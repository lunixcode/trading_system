        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Meta Platforms (META) standing at $490.13, reflecting a +1.26% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.52% for the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a rise of 0.12%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.9%.\n\nShares of the social media company witnessed a gain of 24.06% over the previous month, beating the performance of the Computer and Technology sector with its gain of 1.9% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.85%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Meta Platforms in its forthcoming earnings report. In that report, analysts expect Meta Platforms to post earnings of $4.27 per share. This would mark year-over-year growth of 61.74%. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $36.07 billion, indicating a 25.94% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $19.94 per share and a revenue of $158.75 billion, indicating changes of +34.1% and +17.68%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also note any recent changes to analyst estimates for Meta Platforms. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. To take advantage of this, we've established the Zacks Rank, an exclusive model that considers these estimated changes and delivers an operational rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. The Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has moved 12.48% higher within the past month. As of now, Meta Platforms holds a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nWith respect to valuation, Meta Platforms is currently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 24.27. This expresses a discount compared to the average Forward P/E of 31.67 of its industry.\n\nWe can also see that META currently has a PEG ratio of 1.24. This popular metric is similar to the widely-known P/E ratio, with the difference being that the PEG ratio also takes into account the company's expected earnings growth rate. Internet - Software stocks are, on average, holding a PEG ratio of 1.88 based on yesterday's closing prices.\n\nThe Internet - Software industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 65, placing it within the top 26% of over 250 industries.\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups.

        "content": "While the golden years may be decades away for many of you, here’s the thought process behind retirement stocks for new investors: they represent an inevitability.\n\nHonestly, the aging process may seem to take forever, especially if you’re stuck in a rut climbing the career ladder. However, that might be a blessing in and of itself. When you’re having fun, time just seems to fly. And before you know it, you’re sitting around in a park bench bemoaning how things were different in your day.\n\nGiven that no one is going to escape Father Time – and eventually the Grim Reaper – you should think about these retirement stocks for new investors. Yes, it’s a different name but it’s very much the same game.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSocial media platform and overall technology juggernaut Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is everywhere these days. That’s about as good a reason as any to target it as one of the retirement stocks for new investors. What may have started out as an idea in a dorm room has catapulted into a leading player in some of the most innovative sectors.\n\nLikely, the trend will only continue to rise. In many ways, META stock is the investment equivalent of sliced bread. While there are other social media networks available for users to choose, none commands the global reach and utility of Facebook. It’s a platform you can grow old with, not age out of, which in my opinion is a risk factor impacting Snap (NYSE:SNAP).\n\nIt’s not a perfect investment – nothing is. And surely, I have big questions about the company’s pivot to the metaverse. Nevertheless, that wart aside, Facebook will probably continue to rise in prominence. And its investments in areas such as virtual reality and augmented reality should pay off.\n\nLastly, its introduction of a dividend is a possible gamechanger. Analysts for good reason rate META stock a consensus strong buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nH&R Block (HRB) H&R block storefront in Canada. HRB stock.\n\nSource: TippyTortue / Shutterstock\n\nTo be blunt, H&R Block (NYSE:HRB) might seem an incredibly odd idea for retirement stocks for new investors. As a tax consultancy firm, it’s incredibly boring. However, this boring business is about to get exciting – at least on the relevancy front. It’s all about the burgeoning gig economy.\n\nEarlier this year, Statista noted that in 2023, analysts projected that the gig economy could reach a market value of $455.2 billion. Looking ahead, analysts project that the space could expand to $918.94 billion by 2028. From levels seen in 2022, this trajectory would represent a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 14.22%.\n\nHere’s why HRB stock will likely become more important. Companies hire employees. In contrast, the gig economy fosters independent contractors. Stated differently, the tax profile is far different from employees to contractors. It’s a sizable leap in complexity and filing requirements, potentially boosting demand for tax consultancy services.\n\nAnalysts rate H&R Block a hold with a $55 price target. I think this is ungenerous considering its forward relevance and dividend yield.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nAn aging tech giant, IBM (NYSE:IBM) recently had its 100th birthday. Before I receive emails regarding the nuances of Big Blue’s origin, the name International Business Machines materialized in February 1924. In the present day, IBM doesn’t seem a particularly enticing idea for retirement stocks for new investors. However, it may be time for a rethink.\n\nFor one thing, IBM stock has been on a surprisingly robust run. Since the beginning of the year, shares gained almost 15% of market value. In the trailing one-year period, they swung up almost 45%. While tech fans have coalesced around the usual suspects, Big Blue has been quietly reasserting itself as an innovator. After all, its Watson computer system – capable of answering questions posed in natural language – helped forward the concept of machine learning.\n\nFurther, because it has limited expectations, it wouldn’t be surprising to see IBM stock continue its ascent. While other companies are latching onto digital intelligence, IBM has been pioneering this trend. Looking ahead, I see more practical applications arising from the Armonk, New York-based enterprise.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Carolina Mandl\n\nNEW YORK, Feb 29 (Reuters) - Billionaire Ray Dalio, founder of hedge fund Bridgewater Associates, said the Magnificent Seven stocks are a \"bit frothy but not in a full-on bubble,\" with Alphabet and Meta Platforms still \"somewhat cheap\" and Tesla \"somewhat expensive.\"\n\nDalio made the comments in an analysis of the U.S. stock market he posted on LinkedIn on Thursday aimed to determine if there is a price bubble amid a persistent stocks rally.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven group - comprised of Google-parent Alphabet, Facebook-parent Meta, Amazon.com, Nvidia , Microsoft, Apple and Tesla - has rallied over 80% since January last year.\n\nDalio concluded that the U.S. stock market as a whole \"doesn't look very bubbly,\" taking into consideration a proprietary formula which includes items such as current prices, new buyers, bullish sentiment and leverage.\n\n\"These levels are not consistent with past bubbles,\" the chief investment officer mentor wrote. \"Our readings suggest that, while equities may have rallied meaningfully, we’re unlikely to be in a bubble.\"\n\nThe Magnificent Seven's market capitalization has mostly grown in line with earnings, he wrote.\n\nStill, Dalio said his confidence for the Magnificent Seven is lower because there is uncertainty about the impact artificial intelligence will have.\n\n(Reporting by Carolina Mandl in New York; Editing by Leslie Adler)",

        "content": "Why Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Is Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of data warehouse-as-a-service Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) fell 24.9% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided product guidance for Q1, which missed analysts' estimates. In addition, net revenue retention continued to decline. Snowflake attributed some of the challenges to significant holiday impacts in December and January, a recurring challenge for predicting consumption patterns. Consequently, understanding consumption trends proved difficult, with trends yet to revert to pre-FY'24 levels. As a result, these concerns were baked into the product growth guidance, with management expecting \"increased revenue headwinds associated with product efficiency gains, tiered storage pricing, and the expectation that some of our customers will leverage Iceberg Tables for their storage.\"\n\nAnother significant negative that is adding to the stock's weakness is the announcement of CEO Frank Slootman's retirement. Slootman is a highly-respected tech executive who guided Snowflake through its public offering. Before that, he was CEO of ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), a company he also shepherded through the IPO process. On the other hand, Snowflake delivered strong free cash flow while still growing revenue at 30%+, which is certainly an impressive feat.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snowflake? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnowflake's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 25 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snowflake and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 9 days ago, when the company dropped 5.3% as equities pulled back, with market participants likely taking profits ahead of a big earnings week. Tech stocks led the decline, with the Nasdaq index down 1% while the SP 500 fell 0.5%. Some of the notable stocks reporting earnings during the week include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStory continues\n\nStocks have had a good run since the fourth quarter of 2023 as markets expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024 amidst cooling inflation data. The market's momentum continued into the early weeks of 2024 following solid earnings results from big tech names, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nSnowflake is down 1.7% since the beginning of the year, and at $186.11 per share it is trading 21.1% below its 52-week high of $236 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snowflake's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $732.17.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) Is Up 2.26% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Meta Platforms (META), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of B. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nLet's discuss some of the components of the Momentum Style Score for META that show why this social media company shows promise as a solid momentum pick.\n\nA good momentum benchmark for a stock is to look at its short-term price activity, as this can reflect both current interest and if buyers or sellers currently have the upper hand. It is also useful to compare a security to its industry, as this can help investors pinpoint the top companies in a particular area.\n\nFor META, shares are up 2.26% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is down 1.6% over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 24.06% compares favorably with the industry's 0.48% performance as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile any stock can see a spike in price, it takes a real winner to consistently outperform the market. Shares of Meta Platforms have increased 52.47% over the past quarter, and have gained 179.1% in the last year. On the other hand, the S&P 500 has only moved 11.73% and 29.55%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to META's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. META is currently averaging 22,426,480 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score encompasses many things, including estimate revisions and a stock's price movement. Investors should note that earnings estimates are also significant to the Zacks Rank, and a nice path here can be promising. We have recently been noticing this with META.\n\nOver the past two months, 15 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost META's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.55 to $19.94 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 11 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that META is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of B. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Meta Platforms on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Zagorski\n\nThanks, Tejal, and good afternoon, everyone. 2023 was DV's third year as a public company and one where we continue to deliver industry-leading revenue and profitability growth fueled by AI-powered product innovations that drove a higher ROI for our customers and accelerated DV's global client expansion trajectory and market share gains. In 2023, we grew total revenue by 27% year-over-year to $572.5 million, and our platform measured over 7 trillion billable media transaction across a growing number of digital media properties, formats and devices. DV's continued expansion into new global markets and media environments fueled over $120 million of incremental revenue during the year and established our scale as not only a market differentiator but also a springboard for future revenue growth, especially internationally, where our measurement business grew over 40% last year.\r\nOur focus on top line growth in 2023 was matched by our commitment to profitability and cash flow generation. Our business generated a 33% adjusted EBITDA margin and approximately $120 million of net cash from operating activities in 2023, an increase of 26%. Even as we invested in growing our global workforce, expanding our premium solution set and integrating a new acquisition, Scibids AI. In the fourth quarter, we ended the year with a revenue growth rate of 29% and adjusted EBITDA margins of 38%. This rare and winning combination of growth and profitability allows us to continue to invest in AI and automation, which in turn helps drive our global scale and connectivity and fuel market-leading product innovation. These are DV's core differentiators and the engines of our long-term growth.\r\nBefore I discuss the numerous drivers of our strong performance and market share gains in the quarter and the year in detail, let me highlight the two growth areas I'm most excited about for 2024 and beyond. Social Media Solutions and Scibids AI. DV's social media verification solutions continue to add unique value in challenging advertiser environments and will only become more essential during the upcoming election season. We grew our top 700 customers adoption of DV's social measurement solutions by 10 percentage points in 2023 to 54%, helping propel the sector's revenue growth to nearly 50% for the year. In addition, we grew fourth quarter social measurement revenue by 21% sequentially, and all of our new measurement wins in the fourth quarter signed up for social coverage.\r\nAs social media gains a larger share of advertiser wallets, our position as one of the few companies scale to operate independently across this media, puts DV in a unique and differentiated position. Scibids AI which we acquired in the second half of 2023, has generated an incredible amount of excitement with current and prospective clients. We've integrated sales functions into our commercial work and started connecting its platform to our core solutions, essentially leveraging Scibids AI to transform the entire verification category. With Scibids, DV has a unique value proposition that allows advertisers to protect their brand equity and reduce media waste while simultaneously improving core performance KPIs such as lower CPMs and higher reach. This seamless achievement of both protection and performance is a differentiator that is helping DV win new deals.\r\nIn fact, 40% of our large new logo wins since the beginning of this year are actively testing Scibids AI. With expanding Scibids coverage across key programmatic DSPs and major social media platforms, our customer adoption and scale will allow DV to unlock an entirely new performance marketing TAM. Speaking of wins, we're pleased to have delivered a banner fourth quarter for new customer wins with strong continued win momentum year-to-date. Fourth quarter-to-date, we've won several iconic and category-leading enterprise logos, including Pepsi, Walgreens and Haleon. We maintained an 80% plus win rate across all new opportunities in 2023 with 62% of our full year and 59% of our fourth quarter wins being Greenfield, which we define as wins where the advertiser wasn't using third-party tools for the business that DV won.\r\nThese great Q4 wins add to the powerful roster of new deals we closed in 2023, which included Air France, Uber, Ulta Beauty, General Motors, TotalEnergies, NFL, Rolex, Sam's Club, Pizza Hut, Revlon and Liberty Mutual. We work with approximately half of the world's top 1,000 advertisers and continue to acquire large new enterprise logos. Leading brands choose DV not based on price, but because we offer proprietary and market-leading technology, unrivaled brand equity protection and tangible ROI improvement. We also have the ability to significantly expand within the nearly 450 top advertisers that we currently do business with as DV's fees comprised less than 0.5% of this cohort's digital ad spend in 2023. We expect to double our share of their media spend over time as we, one; expand these valued customer relationships across geographies and media environments, and two; upsell them our broader integrated product suite of Activation and Measurement Solutions.\r\nAs mentioned last quarter, over half of our top 700 customers use less than 4 of DV's 7 core products and that does not include Scibids, creating a vast expansion opportunity within our existing customer base. In addition, we've leaned into our customer acquisition and retention plan of building higher value, more strategic customer engagements that leverage our real-time data to drive superior outcomes and ROI. Over the last 4 years, DV has more than doubled the number of customers and revenue while increasing our overall MTF and expanding the bundle of solutions our customers use from us. As media performance joins media quality protection as a core part of our superior value proposition, closed loosed optimization, leveraging data partnerships like we have with Attain, fueled by data insights from Scibids AI and activated via proprietary solutions like ABS will help us to further enhance our premium value position in the marketplace, elevate and differentiate the level of our customer engagement and set DV up for continued future market share growth.\r\nClients like Lexus have used DoubleVerify Premium Solutions to reduce media waste, increase safety and drive site traffic by 3.5x. DV maintains and will continue to maintain our strong pricing and margin profile based on these higher levels of strategic customer engagement driven by measurable ROI that our Premium Solutions deliver. In the fourth quarter and early this year, we achieved product and platform expansion milestones that we expect will fuel our growth in 2024 and beyond across all major media environments, social, CTV, retail media networks and the open web. Let me discuss each of these in the context of our core differentiators, namely, our rapidly growing global scale and connectivity at our market-defining innovation, both of which are powered by our advancements in AI and automation.\r\nBeginning with social, we increased social measurement revenue by 62% year-over-year in the fourth quarter and by 48% for the full year, significantly outperforming our competitors as well as the growth rate of the broader social ad sector. During 2023 and the beginning of 2024, we meaningfully expanded our measurement coverage across key social platforms, widening our global scale and connectivity across this vital media environment. According to MAGNA Global, social media advertising made up more than 60% of digital ad spend ex search in 2023, yet only 15% of DV's total revenue was attributable to social measurement in 2023. As we continue to expand our product coverage across key social platforms, we expect customer adoption of DV Solutions across social media to fuel revenue growth for years to come.\r\nOn Meta, we're pleased to announce that following our successful beta test in the fourth quarter, we launched DV's Brand Safety and Suitability Measurement on Facebook and Instagram feeds and reels in the first quarter of 2024. This release is in general availability. For the first time, global advertisers are able to activate DV's AI-powered classification technology to protect their brand equity and comprehensively measure media quality on Facebook and Instagram feeds and reels, creating greater transparency across some of the most engaging user-generated content environments in the world. To date, customers have reacted enthusiastically to this launch and impression volumes on Meta have increased by 51% in the first 8 weeks of 2024 compared to the same prior year period.\r\nOn YouTube, following our launch of viewability and valid traffic across YouTube Shorts in the third quarter of 2023, we launched Brand Safety and Suitability Measurement capabilities across YouTube Shorts inventory in the fourth quarter, providing media measurement across a greater volume of ad impressions on YouTube. In addition, we continue to expand TikTok brand safety and suitability measurement across the most important markets in Latin America and Europe and further widened our TikTok APAC market coverage. We currently support Brand Safety and Suitability across 32 markets, which cover 91% of global digital ad spend ex China and India. Our scale and recent product innovations across social media and short-form video are powered by DV's Universal Content Intelligence, a proprietary AI classification engine that enables us to verify video content faster, more accurately and more cost effectively than any of our competitors, having a direct positive impact on our gross margins as we scale.\r\nBy using predictive AI versus the more basic frame by frame process others use, we are able to lower video analysis costs and scale faster. Our solution most recently enabled the rapid rollout of new social markets and suitability categories as exemplified by this month's launch of TikTok Brand Suitability in Japan, as well as our first-to-market release of suitability categories by industry verticals. This advanced capability provides DV with a strong comparative advantage in social media content analysis where video comprised of whopping 67% of all social content in 2023, according to MAGNA Global, and in which we exhibited our speed to market leadership on the Meta News Feed brand safety launch early this year.\r\nTurning now to CTV, where ad-supported streaming continues to gain momentum, DV grew its CTV measurement volumes by 34% in the fourth quarter and by 33% for the full year 2023, significantly outperforming 2023 CTV ad spend growth of 16%, according to MAGNA Global estimates. CTV comprised approximately 5% of our total impression volume in 2023, in line with its nearly 5% share of digital ad spend ex search. Building on DV's existing CTV solutions that allow verification at the app level, we will soon be providing advertisers with more granular content level transparency down to the show level, including program genre, ratings, classifications and more. We are in advanced dialogue with 3 of the top 10 streaming platforms who provide brand safety and suitability measurement and content performance insights at the program level across OTT campaigns. We believe content level transparency at scale across major CTV platforms will be a catalyst for mass adoption of Brand Suitability Measurement on CTV, enabling DV to enhance the long-term value we deliver to and can extract from this high CPM media environment.\r\nAnd we continue to protect our customers' CTV media investments from fraud by leveraging DV's industry-leading Fraud Lab and extensive CTV platform integrations. This week, in conjunction with Roku, we announced the discovery and mitigation of a new CTV fraud scheme we're calling CycloneBot, due to its scale, aggression and velocity. We estimate CycloneBot is generating 250 million false ad requests per day across 1.5 million devices, largely eluding traditional fraud detection methodology. Roku's proprietary watermark technology provided a crucial element in helping identify and mitigate the attacks, saving our combined customers millions in wasted ad spend. Fraud is still a challenge for CTV buyers and DV is still the leader in protecting our clients from sophisticated fraud schemes.\r\nTurning to Retail Media. We generated approximately $23 million of retail media revenue across all 3 business lines in 2023, achieving 60% year-over-year growth and significantly outpacing the sector's 15% growth rate as reported by MAGNA Global. Our global scale and connectivity across Retail Media continues to expand with DV's measurement tags now accepted on 75 of the key global retail media networks and sites, including 14 of the top retail media platforms and 62 major retailers. DV has a strong value proposition for both on-site or owned and operated retail media as well as off-site or audience extensions. Invalid traffic is still significantly higher on owned and operated retail media sites than on traditional media due to an abundance of traffic from competitive price scrapers, while overall violation rates are 129% higher on off-site retail media inventory that on owned and operated sites.\r\nOn the product innovation front, we are working with Criteo to provide an industry-leading solution that measures on-site quality metrics for retail media. Through this upcoming integration, DV will provide invalid traffic, Brand Suitability and Viewability Measurement on Criteo's network of retail media partners, ensuring that marketers are maximizing engagement across this critical channel. Finally, on the Open Web, our innovations advancing our brand suitability solutions continue to be a key market differentiator as exemplified by our most premium-priced solution, Authentic Brand Suitability. ABS grew by 48% in 2023 and contributed $182 million to our top line for the full year. In Q3 '23, we launched an industry-first Made For Advertising or MFA solution to provide our advertisers with the ability to identify and avoid MFA content, which has exploded since the launch of the easily accessible generative AI tools.\r\nThis quarter, we advanced that tool by leveraging AI-based auditing to launch a more granular tiered-made for advertising measurement and prebid avoidance solution. This second-generation solution addresses MFA in a more surgical and brand-specific way, giving advertisers more control over balancing quality, performance and reach. DV continues to have the only solution in market today that can be enabled directly by a customer and their brand safety and suitability profile for measurement and connected to (inaudible) via ABS. It's another great example of DV's innovation leadership and customer adoption is increasing steadily. DV's brand suitability tools are more valuable than ever during election years, when advertisers need to closely monitor challenging political content globally and in real time. DV's election task force has been providing actionable data insights and analysis to protect brand equity and safeguard media investments since 2022, giving DV a differentiated, deep set of experience to deliver real value for our customers seeking to navigate in evolving media landscape.\r\nWe're also pleased to be expanding our industry-leading universal attention segments to Amazon and Viant's DSPs. Our Attention Prebid segments are gaining early momentum and our Attention Measurement business is now growing steadily with 2023 delivering over 180% growth in impression volumes. Before I wrap up and Nicola shares details on our strong 2023 financial results and 2024 outlook, let me conclude with three key takeaways for my remarks today.\r\nFirst, DV continues to significantly outgrow the digital advertising industry and is gaining market share across every digital media environment, social, CTV, retail media and the Open Web. Second, DV will continue to win because the customer value we create through our unmatched global scale and connectivity and our market-defining product innovation, both of which are powered by our proprietary AI that allows the most efficient analysis of vast amounts of data. Every day, DV analyzes 1.3 billion minutes of video close to 275 million social posts, approximately 8 million web page and over 22 million hours of audio content. Finally, we remain focused on growing and realizing our solid pipeline of new and expansionary deals and becoming more engaged with our current customer base that will further drive our market share and create an even stronger long-term trajectory. The fundamental drivers that have powered our growth over the last 3 years remain strong and intractable. With that, let me hand the call over to Nicola.\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nThank you, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. DV delivered industry-leading fourth quarter and full year 2023 revenue growth and profitability, demonstrated continued strong operational execution through a year challenged by geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty. Fourth quarter total revenue growth of 29% was driven by 32% growth in Activation, 30% growth in Measurement and 5% growth in Supply Side. Our Activation and Measurement businesses, which are driven by advertisers were a combined 93% of our total fourth quarter revenue.\r\nAdvertiser revenue grew 31% in the fourth quarter, driven by 25% growth in volume or MTM and 5% growth in pricing or MTF, on a year-over-year basis. In addition, Scibids performed in line with our expectations. MTF growth accelerated sequentially from 2% in the third quarter to 5% in the fourth quarter due to a continued mix shift towards Premium Priced Solutions followed by the impact of the ABS display and video price bifurcation, which was completed across all major DSPs in the third quarter. ABS revenue grew 45% year-over-year in the fourth quarter, driven by volume growth of 34% and MTF growth of 9% year-over-year. Approximately 2/3 of the year-over-year growth in ABS came from existing ABS customers, expanding their usage to more brands and to more markets while 1/3 of the growth came from customers who activated the solutions for the first time.\r\nFourth quarter measurement revenue grew 30%, driven by social revenue growth of 62%. International measurement revenue grew 43% in the quarter with EMEA growth of 45% and APAC growth of 39% year-over-year. International revenue comprised 29% of measurement revenue, up from 26% in the fourth quarter of 2022. Supply side revenue grew 5%, largely driven by growth in new publisher customers in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, revenue growth of 27% was driven by Activation revenue growth of 31% and Measurement revenue growth of 25%. Social revenue grew 48% in 2023 and comprised 43% of our Measurement revenue, up from 37% in the prior year. With spend on social platforms expected to continue to represent approximately 60% of digital ad budget ex search in 2024, our social measurement revenue continues to have a long runway for growth. Supply side revenue growth of 5% was driven by increased publisher revenue. For the full year 2023, advertiser revenue growth was primarily driven by volume growth.\r\nWe measured 7 trillion billable transactions, a 25% year-over-year increase in MTM, while average fee per thousand impressions increased to $0.075 and a 3% year-over-year increase in MTS. We expect volumes to remain the primary driver of our growth as we continue to verify more digital ad impressions through product innovation and channel and geographic expansion, and we expect MTF to remain stable. Our approach on pricing is to lead with our product offering of unique and differentiated solutions, including ABS, Social Prescreen and now Scibids. Our ability to continue to upsell existing clients and acquire new clients to the full suite of products has yielded an overall increase in MTF over the last 4 years, including a 5% increase in Q4 2023.\r\nMoving to expenses. Cost of revenue in the fourth quarter increased by 32%, primarily driven by an increase in revenue sharing arrangement costs with programmatic partners driven by activation revenue growth. We delivered 83% revenue less cost of sales in the fourth quarter, up from 82% in Q3 as we eliminated some duplicative data center costs. Total non-GAAP operating expenses, which excludes stock-based compensation and other items for comparability, grew 24% compared to 29% revenue growth, reflecting the efficiency of our operating model as we scale. Finally, we delivered $65 million of adjusted EBITDA or 38% margin and $33 million of net income in the fourth quarter. For full year 2023, cost of revenue increased by 37%, primarily driven by an increase in revenue sharing arrangement costs with programmatic partners driven by growth in activation revenue.\r\nWe delivered 81% revenue less cost of sales. Going forward, we continue to expect revenue less cost of sales to range between 80% to 82% as we balance data center cost savings with continued investments in cloud optimization and in scaling our infrastructure. Total non-GAAP operating expenses represented 49% of total revenue as compared to 51% in full year 2022. Non-GAAP product development costs grew 28%. Sales, marketing and customer support grew 16% and G&A grew 15% compared to prior year. We delivered full year adjusted EBITDA of $187 million, representing a 33% adjusted EBITDA margin and $71.5 million of net income as our business continues to combine high revenue growth with high profitability. We ended 2023 with 1,101 employees, up from 902 at the end of 2022. Nearly half of our headcount growth was attributable to R&D, where we continue to invest in our engineering and product resources. Moving to cash flow.\r\nWe generated approximately $120 million of net cash from operating activities in 2023, which represented an operating cash flow to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 64%. Capital expenditures were approximately $17 million in 2023. And finally, we ended the year with $310 million of cash on hand and 0 long-term debt. In 2023, we achieved a net revenue retention rate of 124%, maintaining an over 120% NRR for the last 5 years while our gross revenue retention remained above 95%, also for the fifth year in a row. We grew the average revenue from our top 100 customers by 42% year-over-year to $3.7 million. We also grew the number of advertisers generating more than $1 million of revenue by 19% year-over-year to $93 million. We grew the number of advertisers generating more than $200,000 of revenue by 18% year-over-year to 290.\r\nWe have long-term relationships with our customers and remain deeply embedded in their marketing plans. Our top 75 customers have worked with us for over 7 years, while our top 50 and our top 25 have been DV clients for over 8 years. As Mark mentioned, we have maintained an 80% plus win rate across all opportunities and have a strong pipeline of new and expansionary deals that will continue to support our long-term growth trajectory. Now let's talk about 2024 and guidance. For the first quarter of 2024, we expect revenue in the range of $136 million to $140 million, a year-over-year increase of 13% at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $33 million to $37 million, representing a 25% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint. Our growth rate in the first quarter reflects a slow start by brand advertisers and a slow ramp by recently signed new customers, which will catch up in the second half based on large new customer seasonal spend and usage patterns.\r\nWe are guiding to full year 2024 revenue in the range of $688 million to $704 million, a year-over-year increase of 22% at the midpoint and adjusted EBITDA in the range of $205 million to $221 million, representing a 31% adjusted EBITDA margin at the midpoint. We expect a poorly share of our full year revenue to be more second half weighted in 2024 than in prior years as we expect fast-growing already contracted new customer revenue to ramp in the second half of the year. We continue to expect Scibids AI to contribute between $15 million to $17 million to full year 2024 revenue. The midpoint of our guidance implies an approximately $124 million increase in revenue in full year 2024, a testament to the accelerating demand for DV Solutions by existing and new customers across more geographies and media environment. Similar to last year, we expect the key drivers of DV's 2024 revenue growth to be increased Authentic Brand Suitability usage and Adoption in Activation, social measurement revenue growth, increased international adoption of our Measurement Solutions, Scibids AI and new customer acquisition.\r\nOur guidance reflects measured contribution from new revenue opportunities in 2024, including incremental revenue from increased customer adoption of Meta, Authentic Attention and CTV Activation and Measurement. We expect stock-based compensation expenses for the first quarter of 2024 in the range of $19 million to $21 million. For the full year, stock-based compensation expense is expected in the range of $91 million to $96 million. Weighted average fully diluted shares outstanding for the first quarter are expected in the range of $175 million to $177 million. We anticipate capital expenditures, including capitalized software to range between $20 million and $30 million for 2024 as we continue to invest in new product innovation to support future growth. With 0 debt, a strong cash balance, we are well positioned to drive further business expansion and long-term growth in 2024. And with that, we will open up the line for questions. Operator, please go ahead.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And the first question comes from the line of Matt Swanson with RBC Capital Markets.\n\nMatthew John Swanson\n\nIt was great to hear about some of these big investment areas, social being up 62% for Measurement, international coming up, CTV coming up. But just kind of maybe for a balance from a year-over-year perspective. Do you mind kind of touching on some of the areas of your business that maybe were headwinds to those overall growth rate, and particularly kind of (inaudible) right now? Is pricing coming up more from a competitive standpoint?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes. Thanks for the question, Matt. And everyone, thank you for your patience. I know that was a long call before you got to your questions, but we had a lot of news to share. Let me take the second part of your question head-on. We are not seeing pricing pressure, period. Nicola mentioned, we saw MTFs actually increase full year last year and Q4 last year. And when we close new deals, of which we announced some great ones, we're not closing them based on price. We closed them based on stronger technology, unique tools like ABS, our continued social expansion that's driven by the most efficient AI video recognition out there. So we're not seeing pricing pressure.\r\nWe are not addressing or going after new business with an aggressive price structure. And to be clear, we're winning new deals and taking market share at MTFs that are, were increased last year.\n\nMatthew John Swanson\n\nYes. No, that's really helpful. And I guess moving to the second question, I'll kind of revisit a piece of the first. But Nicola, when you're thinking about guidance, can you give us some of this color and, it certainly is not lost on us that we like to think of things as kind of core-core or maybe \"not counting our chickens before they hatch\". But we went through so many secular tailwinds between social and retail media, the ramp in international, the retail media, Scibids. How are you thinking about just kind of balancing these opportunities as we look out through the year, kind of how you're thinking about the impact that had on your guidance?\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nYes. So as we've always said and we said it again today, we look for a view on the year that's core-on-core. And core-on-core for us because it is not part of our core is continued growth in ABS, right? 2/3 of the growth even in the last quarter, which was a very strong quarter of growth where ABS was from existing customers using ABS on more and more of their impression. So core-on-core assumes a continued growth from existing customer on ABS. It assumes continued growth on social. Just as a reminder, within the growth rate that we saw in '23, really that only included English language for TikTok as an example. And that's probably a very large growth opportunity for us as we open up new languages above and beyond English.\r\nSo those are two of the sort of the major ones that you're going to continue to see in addition to international. The fundamental growth drivers of what we saw in '23 are what we expect to continue to see for '24, and that's core-on-core. What's not in that is the Meta opportunity, which is the one that we've been talking over the last few quarters. That is a measured, very measured view for us in 2024 and the numbers that we have -- we're guiding to. We think the upside is large. But we're being measured about how exactly it's going to impact our number, sticking to the core-on-core message. In addition to that, Authentic Attention is also an opportunity where if there is upside and acceleration in adoption, that would be an upside to a core-on-core view that we have on guidance and CTV similarly.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Justin Patterson with KeyBanc Capital Markets.\n\nJustin Tyler Patterson\n\nTwo, if I can. First, just unpacking the guidance. A little bit more from the prior line of questioning. Could you help us understand a little bit more of just the slower start to the year, typically, we thought about U.S. being a little more immune to some of the macro pressures in there. I believe you called out brand advertisers starting a little bit more slowly this year. So just would love to hear a little bit more you're seeing there? Both from the Activation and Measurement side, and then I'll pause there and follow up after.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes. So what we said, what we're seeing is a slow ramp of our new contracted wins. And these are very large enterprise wins. And until we get in with the client to understand how the product is being rolled out, it's difficult to see how it's actually going to ramp. So that is item 1. Item 2 is a slow start for existing brand advertisers. It's isolated to certain advertisers. It feels specific to their spending pattern. It doesn't feel like a macro item at all. This is a slow start that we expect will ramp as we get into the future quarters. The combination of those 2 slow starts is what's reflected in our Q1 outlook. The ramp that we expect is really based on what we know to be a relationship with a large enterprise client. It will ramp once our solutions are actually deployed across their entire global spend. We will see the benefit of it.\r\nSo the ramp is really based on that happening rather than overweighting on say, Meta opportunity, as I was discussing before. It remains core-on-core. It's just added spend coming later than originally anticipated.\n\nJustin Tyler Patterson\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then for the next question, I just wanted to go back to the tech platform and the very healthy gross margins. You're saying, I know for short-form video that you're pretty unique towards how you're approaching brand safety there. As we think about just short form scaling up over the next few years, how do you think about just some of the efficiencies on the tech platform, providing more room to invest around the next growth opportunities for DV going forward?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes, thanks. It's a great take, Justin. We've been talking over the last 12 to 18 months on how much we've invested in R&D, even versus kind of peers in the marketplace. And this is where it really starts to pay off. If you look at where we're talking about growth, we focused a ton on short-form video. Right now, social -- video on social is something like over 60%, almost 70% of total volume. That means if we're going to grow in social, we have to analyze social video. Building the tool set that we had to analyze and use AI to do predictive modeling across that video and do so in a way that's highly accurate, that meets all the standards of the social platforms that we are and can scale to massive levels, that's something that could break you if you don't do it right. And as you've seen, we're guiding towards really nice gross margins. Even though a very big chunk of our growth is going to come from this video.\r\nSo our investments in R&D, our investments in analyzing video are really starting to pay off because as that sector grows, you'll see that we're not seeing any additional degradation of our gross margin cost due to hosting or technical costs of analyzing that video. That's a real win for us.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Raimo Lenschow with Barclays.\n\nFrank Joseph Surace\n\nThis is Frank on for Raimo. Any way to quantify what you're embedding in the guide from the Meta opportunity? And what are some of the key metrics that you point us to for evaluating the progression on that opportunity?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nSo we mentioned a growth rate so far this year regarding that of a total of over 50% growth so far year-to-date. That's in the context of a few things. First off, we launched across Instagram and Facebook Reels last year, which added some additional inventory. We've now launched in late January, the News Feed opportunity, right? So if you think about if you want to scale kind of where Facebook and where Meta sat with us last year, it was roughly, let's say, 7% of our overall revenue. Growing at 50%-ish or so this year, if you take 7% of our revenue last year of the $500 million, you're looking close to $40 million. So if we're growing at 50%-ish or so across all of those different lines this year, you're looking at another $20 million of revenue across all of the Meta properties that -- there's a potential there.\r\nNow that's if we continue to maintain the growth rate. We've got some year-over-year comps. Remember, we launched across Reels in Instagram mid last year, but we've got the additional News Feed on here. So I'd say something roughly in that range is where we're going to see that Meta opportunity panning out across all the new things that we've covered there.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nOne, starting with (inaudible). I think you mentioned that you believe MTF should remain stable. I'm not sure you were referring if that was a kind of a formal outlook for 2020 for it? Because I think you mentioned that before you start talking about the outlook. But the point is out of that 22% growth in the revenue guide for 2024, can you maybe help us parse out volume versus price and MTFs are to remain stable? Why is that considering the mix shift going on? And then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nYes. So Youssef, what we mentioned in the remarks is that we anticipate most of the growth to come from volume. That shouldn't be a surprise to anyone, right? The MTM is really driving the continued growth of the business. From an MTF perspective, we grew, we grew in Q4 of '23. We grew full year 2023. The growth that we saw was based on a mix shift towards premium priced products. It's slightly offset by the fact that we're expanding internationally quite aggressively. But overall, it did increase. The statement we made is we do not expect those to go down based on us needing to lower the price of the products that we have in the market. The likely, our expectation is that we will continue to see strong MTF because we're able to continue to upsell premium priced products. And our perspective is not that we have to necessarily reduce the MTF on other products.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nAwesome. That's very clear now. And just on the linearity of the year as we look throughout 2024. Typically, your Q1 is maybe 21%, 22% of revenues. I think based on your guide, it looks more like high teens. So, and I understand kind of the color you just gave around the brand advertisers, some of the large new enterprises coming on. But maybe help us think through how, where you, when do you make up the shortfall in Q1? Does Q2 kind of retract? Do we see kind of a nice uptick in Q2? Or does it, is it more linear across the 3 quarters?\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nYes. I think what we're going to see is we said it in our remarks, it is going to be heavier weighted towards the second half of the year versus the first half of the year. it's probably 1 to 2 points in terms of revenue share between the first half to the second half. So you can kind of see sort of the ramp starting after Q1 if you take that as a guide.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our next question comes from the line of Arjun Bhatia with William Blair.\n\nArjun Rohit Bhatia\n\nYes. Perfect. Maybe if I can start on some of the large customer wins that you talked about that are signed and contracted but haven't started recognizing revenue from those yet. Is that, this in Q4, Q1, is that larger than it's been in historical periods? Or maybe if we compare to 2023 and 2022. Have you seen a greater activity of larger customers that are taking longer ramp? Just maybe expand on that a little bit, if you could, please.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes, it's a great question, Arjun. We see this periodically when we nail a couple of large businesses. If you remember, Q2 of last year, we closed a couple of really big deals. They started a little bit slower than we expected, and it created a bit of a drag. I think as we start moving into these large enterprise global customers like Pepsi and Haleon, et cetera, they do take a bit of time to scale up. And as Nicola noted, we are learning over time, the bigger the customer and whether or not they're launching globally all at once or they're launching market by market. There is a bit of a drag that creates some level of predictability challenges for us. \r\nThat being said, I think I would say this year, pipeline and the deals that we closed in the pipeline were pretty comparable to last year. Last year, we closed a bunch of big deals coming into the year. And we see this kind of ebb and flow of big deals coming in. And I think that's, it's just the nature of the game. We're talking a couple -- when we're looking at this, this is a couple of million dollars here or there on the edges, which I know makes a big difference for how we look at the year.\r\nBut as Nicola noted when we provided the guide for the year, this is -- we're guiding based on core-on-core growth on pipeline deals that are closed and we expect to ramp. So we know that these are going to come in. They're just coming in a bit slower than we would have hoped.\n\nArjun Rohit Bhatia\n\nOkay. That's very helpful, Mark. And then if I can maybe just revisit the pricing aspect a little bit. Obviously, I know you've said you don't want to compete on price and you have a superior product to be able to do that. But when you have a competitor in market that is using aggressive pricing tactics, how do you think you might respond if that continues into the future? Is there enough of ROI differential that you can continue to compete on product? Or do we have to go down this price route at some point?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes. So it's a great ask. And I think the way we look at this is, if we were just competing on the same products that did the same things and delivered the same results, then, yes, we'd have to look at price, but we're not. We're looking at a differentiated set of solutions. Everything from Scibids optimization to what we do on ABS, which no one else has, to even now the speed and efficacy of our social business, which if you look at how our social grew versus how some others in the markets grew, grew twice as fast. If we had the same product in social, how are we growing twice as fast in social, right?\r\nSo it really is a strategy of saying the investments we made in product and in R&D over the last 12 to 18 months are allowing us to charge a premium. And the solutions that are basic that go head-to-head with each other, sure, if we just have those, you'd end up in a pricing situation. We're not there as exemplified by increasing MTFs in Q4 and for the full year last year. And that's why we're being very clear in saying, we're not going out there and attacking deals on price. It doesn't mean that we aren't competitive. It doesn't mean that we don't get into the market. But if you look at our Greenfield wins, still close to 60%. That means we're winning new deals, not going out and just trying to take share from our competitors by driving price, winning deals based on functionality and winning deals on differentiation.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Michael Graham with Canaccord Genuity.\n\nMichael Patrick Graham\n\nMy two quick questions are: number one, on ABS. You mentioned 45% growth and also called it out as an expected source of strength in 2024. And can you just frame out how much penetration you think is left with your customers? I mean you mentioned that a lot of your customers are sort of increasing their deployment of that product. So maybe just frame out how much you think is left there? And then just a quick one on how the election year might have factored into your full year guidance would be helpful to understand?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nAnd that's great question, Michael. I hope everything is okay there. I'm hearing the sirens in the background.\n\nMichael Patrick Graham\n\nI don't know what's going on out there on 5th Ave, but it's loud, sorry.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nI thought you're up in Boston. So look, ABS for us continues to be a bright spot. And I think the key thing, key couple of things to think about are A, 65% of our top 500 customers use ABS, which means in those top 50 we still have over 1/3 who haven't used them, number one. Number two, if you look at our growth last quarter, 66% of that growth came from existing ABS users. So even when we penetrate a user, so we go and add a new top 500 customer, they still grow. They're still, they're adding new markets. They're adding new lines of business. So we had existing ABS customer expansions with Amazon, with Pfizer, with Walmart.\r\nA lot of growth is still, there's a lot of still growth opportunity there is what I'm getting at. And I think it's a great testament to the efficacy of the product. Second half of your question on elections, it's interesting. We didn't bake anything into our guide for elections. I think it's something that is a bit of a wildcard, right? I can have the intent to create lots of incendiary content and more demand for our solutions. But we also know that sometimes it crowds out traditional advertisers from buying impressions. So I think net-net, we've looked at as neutral for our business. And again, as Nicola said, we're not driving or bedding growth on things that are still questionable. We're betting our growth in our guidance on things that we have in the hopper and that we can predict.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Andrew Boone with JMP Securities.\n\nAndrew M. Boone\n\nMark, you talked about the $20 million for Meta. And I know that we've asked you this in the past. But if you think about Meta and more of a medium-term opportunity, can you come back and help size the overall potential of brand safety on Meta?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nIt's a great question, Andrew. I think it's a bit early for us to size out Meta, the brand safety aspect on its own. In combination with the other things we've launched across, we know there's significant growth opportunity for sure. We do know, and we've said this before, only about half of our top 100 customers use us for measurement across Meta today, whereas across YouTube, another incredibly popular social platform, we are over 90% penetrated. So I think that the addition, we've said this in the past, the addition of News Feed coverage is certainly going to attract new customers into social. I don't think we've factored that fully into it as of today. And again, we're being measured in how we look at that growth trajectory of that solution.\r\nBut net-net, the addition of coverage of Instagram Reels and now the News Feed make Meta a really a strong driver and a strong growth catalyst. We've seen it in the last year, ending up the year with social growing at 62% and Meta is a big part of that.\n\nAndrew M. Boone\n\nAnd then, Mark, we've talked about in the past couple of quarters on Scibids and its opportunity to bring on new customers. Can you just update us there now as the product has been longer through your sales force and is maturing in terms of your go-to-market? What are you seeing there in terms of that being a new own ramp for customers?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes. And the interesting about Scibids is we talked about it like this is some of the solution that we've had for years and the teams are -- we've only had it for around a quarter, a full quarter. And it's generated a ton of excitement. We talked about 40% of our new customer wins so far this year are actually testing out Scibids. That's pretty huge. If you think about the attach rate of a new product to a new close, at almost 50%, it's pretty big, right? So again, we're being tempered in how we look at how that business can grow, but it goes into that bucket of differentiators, right? It goes into that bucket of things that takes us out of the pricing muck and allows us to continue to drive premium -- a premium approach to our customers. \r\nSo we like it. We know customers are interested. We know it's something unique that DV has. And when I talked about in the call how it's changing the way we look at verification, it really is. We're starting to look at not just Scibids as a stand-alone, but how we can plug it into things like Prescreen on social video, how we can plug it into other types of social networks, et cetera. It's a really neat tool set that I think we've got a lot of bandwidth to kind of continue to push.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Matthew Cost with Morgan Stanley.\n\nMatthew Andrew Cost\n\nYou talked about the slower start to the year for existing brands. But I wonder if we zoom out and just think about the behavior of brand advertisers versus performance advertisers. Is there any difference that you would call out that you've seen in 4Q and into 2024 in terms of the willingness of brand versus performance to lean into the product offerings, whether that's adopting new products or expanding usage (inaudible)?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nIt's a great question. I think that for us, and I'm not going to paint the entire brand advertiser category in one way because that's not what we're saying. I think we just had some selected customer who had slower growth in the first couple of months of the year. I don't think there's anything brand versus performance that we really would talk about, other than that a handful of retail and CTV clients that we had, had a slower start to the year. So I don't think there's a ton to look into there on brand versus performance.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Pitz with BMO Capital Markets.\n\nBrian Joseph Pitz\n\nMark, you mentioned Scibids before. Maybe just an update, further update there around your prebid MFA Avoidance Announcement, perhaps an opportunity on the broader precampaign planning and activation market? As you see it, just maybe some of the early customer feedback? I know you said it's still early.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes. Thanks, Brian, for the question. I mean if you've hung around the ad space for the last 8 to 12 months, MFA has probably been the hottest topic out there besides really bad generative AI tools. I think that the MFA area is one in which advertisers first looked at using (inaudible) to attack. And I think that was at the detriment of a lot of great publishers, particularly marginalized publishers who are being excluded from media buys. And where we approach this and saying, look, MFA is not this monolithic definition of content. Advertisers need to interpret based on specific rules, what they are comfortable with. And that was the launch of our MFA Prebid product set, the second Gen that we just launched this week, which basically allows advertisers to tier, how they filter out content to, and they can do that in addition to exclusion lists or any other specific sites they want to have.\r\nBut what it does is it allows them to balance reach performance and specific sites that they also want to include in those lists. And the feedback has been great. We had some coverage recently in the press about advertisers who are certainly looking for more of a scalpel than (inaudible), and this fits that bill perfectly. The cool part about this as well, as this plugs right into our ABS tool set. So again, we've got a differentiated and powerful tool set in ABS, and now we've made it even more powerful by plugging MFA tiers into there, allowing advertisers to dynamically optimize what they're doing on the upfront as well. So we're pretty fired up about MFA. We're fired up about what we've been able to do different than our competitors and how it plugs into a tool that's totally proprietary to us.\n\nBrian Joseph Pitz\n\nGot it. And then just maybe a quick political follow-on to an earlier question. How big of a problem is avoiding disinformation or fake news for your clients, particularly as it relates to ad placement next to UGC videos?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nThis is something that we started talking about in 2020. We launched officially our political news task force in 2022, but really hadn't been going before then. And in which we hear from customers all the time. I mean these ebbs and flows, but one thing we do know and we saw this in the 2022 midterms, is that during heated elections, no surprise, we see not only more inflammatory news and political content, but we see more hate speech, we see more disinformation. And more competitive racism and this isn't just national, but local, more competitive the race is in the state, the higher incidences we see of things like hate speech, that becomes scary for advertisers.\r\nAnd again, going back to the MFA discussion I have, in the past, their choice was, well, (inaudible) just block news. I want to be away from UGC. I want to be away from news. I'm going to shut things off. We're giving them a scalpel again so that the legitimate news -- legitimate content and UGC that doesn't violate those areas of misinformation, disinformation, inflammatory news and politics and hate speech isn't excluded. So it's some place where advertisers are leaning into. Again, we don't see it as a category in its own that's going to drive business for us. We think it is just another value-add that our solution provides that makes us sticky with our customers.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Brian Fitzgerald with Wells Fargo.\n\nBrian Nicholas Fitzgerald\n\nMaybe one little differential when you think about third-party cookies and probably Sandbox after looking over the back and forth between the IAB Tech Lab and Google. It seems as though there is still some work to be done there in terms of allowing for verification on the new on-device auctions. Could you talk about your preparations there and how you think about both the risks and the opportunities around on device auctions? How you think (inaudible) for you guys?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nYes, sure, for sure, Brian. So we've been obviously prepping for this for a long time. We're fully engaged with kind of multiple working groups that are working on Google's privacy Sandbox, and we're pretty confident that we'll have a seamless transition of services as the Sandbox and the deprecation of cookies become implemented over time. There's a lot of moving parts, but this is one thing where Google has been pretty open and leaning in and making sure that they become good partners to the ecosystem. And we've had a relationship with Google on multiple levels for many years. The Sandbox, the privacy sandbox, although not perfect, is certainly going to be a place where we're going to be able to deliver our services and solutions, and we're working with the right people to make sure that happens.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd the next question comes from the line of Omar Dessouky with Bank of America.\n\nOmar Dessouky\n\nSo you sounded fairly confident on ABS and you did specify that new contract wins, we're driving the lower guidance -- excuse, driving the low teens guidance for the first quarter. So is it fair to assume that those newly contracted wins are ramping their measurement volumes slower than previous history and that they're still early in the up-sell process?\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nYes. I think that's exactly right, Omar. We -- the onboarding process for large enterprise clients would start on the Measurement side. And so that's where you're going to see the initial impact of their ramp, and that will leave the Activation and the upsell opportunity for the premium price product for the second phase.\n\nOmar Dessouky\n\nOkay. Great. And then as you look into calendar '24, which geography will drive most of the growth in the Activation revenues? And can you give us some sense of whether international is -- if there's any market structure difference in international that makes it a less high-growth market than the U.S.?\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nI mean the international markets are, for us, this is a high-growth area just because the opportunities for us to go after Greenfield opportunities is still greater, right? There's just more opportunities outside of the U.S. than they are in the U.S. And so if you look at our growth for the rest of the world is 43% in the fourth quarter, of '23. So it is spread across both EMEA and APAC. There was a bit of a disjointed growth trajectory for those 2 areas, the year prior to last one when the macro was a different environment. But right now, we're seeing growth in all areas of rest of the world.\n\nOmar Dessouky\n\nSo I was just trying to hone in specifically on Activation. So your comments apply to that segment as well?\n\nNicola T. Allais\n\nYes, I think actually, the patterns don't really change too much between Measurement and Activation in terms of the opportunity that we have internationally.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from the line of Laura Martin with Needham & Company.\n\nLaura Anne Martin\n\nGreat. I have two. So following up on your Scibids answer that you said 40% of your new customers are testing Scibids. What I like best about that acquisition as they got paid as a percent of revenue where it's historically DoubleVerify has always gotten paid on a fixed fee per 1,000 impressions. My question is, as these new customers are adopting Scibids or at least testing it, are they still getting paid as a percent of revenue? So does that sort of lend revenue diversification to your business model over time? I guess that's my question.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nOkay. Great hearing from you, Laura. Yes, they are still pursuing a percentage of media model. And I like the way you framed it as kind of revenue-type diversification. We've always thought ourselves as transactional SaaS, which is fixed and has its pluses, but as you know, in this space, when CPMs go up, it can also have a potential negative as well. So having them as a percentage of revenue, I think, is an interesting opportunity for us. We get to take advantage of some of those increased CPMs that we may see down the road.\n\nLaura Anne Martin\n\nOkay. Fantastic news. And then my second question is on, One of the things I see going on in, for these big brands, like you call on the biggest 100 brands. And one of the things I see them doing is trying to tie connected television all the way down to performance like full funnel. And I think that's what we see in Amazon's AVOD addition to its streaming tier and Walmart's acquisition of Vizio. So my question to you is as these big brands that are your core customers, do more to drive their, all of their advertising in the performance, even what's historically been top of funnel rather than just CPM-based. Is that good for you or is that bad for you -- DoubleVerify?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nIt's a great question. I don't think, I think -- I want to say it's neutral. And by that, if we look at where we've come from all the other platforms we are, we're on, so social, mobile, open web. All of those have performance capabilities and performance-type advertisers and brand type advertisers. CTV will eventually start to look at that in the same way as you noted, connecting a closed-loop aspect of it. And I think that our core value prop in those places is very similar to the core value prop that we'll see in CTV, which is ensuring that, that spend, whether it's evaluated on a closed-loop batch basis or on some type of brand metric is secure, fraud-free, viewable and brand safe. So I think it doesn't really change the value prop.\r\nAnd the cool thing for us is since we are integrated into all the top 10 CTV platforms at the app level, if there's an opportunity for us, for example, to start looking at driving performance through a tool like Scibids, we're already there, and we've already kind of built those hooks and those connections. So I think down the road, it could be something interesting for us. But net-net, I think it's more of the same that we've seen across other media types.\n\nOperator\n\nAnd our final question comes from the line of Mark Murphy with JPMorgan.\n\nArti Vula\n\nThis is Arti on for Mark Murphy. Just to touch base again on the certain brand advertisers that are kind of starting a little bit slower this year. Is there any kind of common thread between them, whether it's kind of what's causing that geography, industry? Anything along those lines (inaudible)?\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nNo. I mean, look, we're not going to pin this to macro. I don't think it's a macro thing. It's just, it's a bit anomalous. We have a couple of retailers are having a tough go of it, a CPG company is having some issues regarding ramping up spend based on some challenges they have. So it's not really anything I think we can pin to either a vertical in any way or a macro in any way. It just happens to be a handful of customer spending slower than they did last year.\n\nArti Vula\n\nThat's very helpful. And then just a follow-up, and I know it's early on, but with Scibids are you guys able to kind of use that new set of solutions to speak with customers that maybe you just weren't speaking? Didn't make sense to before that you can now. I'll step back into the queue.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\n100%. So in some cases, and we may have mentioned before, we're even talking to folks who aren't using our core measurement solutions right now. But they know that there's pretty much not another great optimization opportunity like this around. So it gets our foot in the door with them as well. So it does, it's spun a lot of conversations. And as we noted, even with folks we are talking to almost 50% of them so far this year, the new deals we closed are testing it. So it's a good uptick and a good attach rate.\n\nOperator\n\nThere are no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Mark for any closing comments.\n\nMark S. Zagorski\n\nGreat. Thank you all for joining us today. And as always, we'd like to thank our customers, our team, partners, shareholders and all the stakeholders that help made 2023 a record year for DV and who will be supporting our growth for years to come. We're excited about the prospect of another great year of growth driven by our unmatched global scale and differentiated technology. Have a great night, everybody.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's teleconference. You may disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 25 companies with the best benefits and perks. If you would like to skip our discussion on the global workforce trends, you can go to the 5 Companies with the Best Benefits and Perks.\n\nIn today's dynamic business environment, attracting top talent requires more than just competitive salaries; it demands a comprehensive benefits package that will address the diverse needs of a modern workforce. Companies that offer various perks not only enhance their attractiveness as employers but also leverage these benefits as strategic tools for business growth and sustainability.\n\nThis is evidenced by the fact that organizations recognized for their superior employee benefits often report lower turnover rates, translating to significant cost savings in recruitment and training. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 56% of US employees consider employer-sponsored health benefits when deciding to stay in their current job. When it comes to identifying the best employee benefits companies, it's important to explore various sectors, including tech giants and manufacturing firms. This helps in understanding how innovative benefits can shape business outcomes and employee satisfaction. The companies that lead in this realm not only offer traditional perks but also prioritize the holistic well-being of both full-time and part-time employees.\n\nWorkplace Evolution: Changing Expectations of Today's Workers\n\nA Microsoft survey from 2021 found that 41% of workers globally were thinking about leaving their jobs within the next year, showing how people's expectations from their workplaces are changing. Health benefits are now crucial for employee satisfaction, as highlighted in another 2021 Glassdoor survey where 40% of the respondents said health insurance is the most important benefit. Furthermore, the desire for flexible work is also growing. In a 2022 FlexJobs survey, 56% of participants said they'd consider finding a new job if remote work options were taken away. Companies like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) are adapting to these changing needs of employees by introducing flexible policies.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Google, a key player under Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), there's significant emphasis on creating a rich workplace culture and extending a wide range of benefits to its employees. This commitment has consistently positioned Alphabet Inc.

Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake: $543,547,266\n\nTesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have fallen by about 19% and many analysts are questioning Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ:TSLA) future amid weakness in the EV industry. DE Shaw cut its stake in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) by 23% in the fourth quarter of 2023, ending the period with a $543 million stake.\n\nRecently, Elon Musk revealed in an SEC filing that he held a 20.5% stake in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) as of the end of 2023.\n\nO’keefe Stevens Advisory stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In my Q4 2022, l made three predictions: 1. One of our top 25 holdings gets acquired 2. TSLA is a sub $200B market cap by the end of 2023 3. Crypto, the final blow.\n\nTesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) is a sub $200B market cap by the end of 2023. Grade: D. TSLA performed contrary to expectations, appreciating approximately 100% in 2023 and ending the year with an $880 billion market cap. We were “just a bit outside,” but I’m not convinced our reasoning was flawed.\n\nThe typical strong correlation between earnings estimates and stock prices did not hold for TSLA during the year. Positive revisions suggest a company outperformed expectations, resulting in a higher price/valuation. Negative revisions suggested estimates were too high, and the stock should decline to meet a weaker outlook…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n11.

Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake:$632,386,298\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, DE Shaw's fund had a $632 million stake in Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL).\n\nHedgeye recently added Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd (NYSE:RCL) as a new long idea. Here is what Hedgeye said in a note about the stock:\n\n\"RCL raised EPS and yield growth guidance by healthy amounts while also confirming that their Trifecta goals are to be met this year. Despite the initial guidance range coming in above expectations a few weeks ago, we had anticipated that there would still be a steady stream of beat and raise events throughout the year.\"\n\nAriel Fund made the following comment about Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Several stocks in the portfolio had strong returns over the period. Global cruise vacation company, Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), was one of the top 3 performers in the S&P 500 during the quarter. Shares surged following a significant top- and bottom-line earnings beat, as stronger than anticipated consumer demand is driving a record WAVE season. Forward booking trends are also ahead of historical ranges at record pricing. These factors combined with further improvement in onboard spend and solid cost containment led management to increase RCL’s full-year 2023 guidance. We believe the revised revenue and earnings outlook lays the foundation for RCL to exceed its’ three-year strategic imperative, the Trifecta Program.”\n\n9. Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake: $675,990,168\n\nDE Shaw decreased its stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) by 28% in the fourth quarter of 2023, concluding the period with a $676 million stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 83 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG). The most significant stake in Booking Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BKNG) is owned by Ken Fisher's  Fisher Asset Management, worth $1.3 billion.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG) (7.60% weight in the Fund): Earlier this year, Booking Holdings rolled out an AI trip planner. Traditionally Booking helps users find the right hotel by offering a search engine to define which city you want to stay in and apply various filters to narrow down the hotel options. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, a user can use natural language such as “plan a road trip on Route 66, starting in Chicago and ending to Los Angeles.” The Trip Planner then engages with the user like a travel agent, suggesting which cities to stay in each night and various sights to see along the way. Once the trip is planned out, the user can use natural language to generate hotel options, such as by writing “My budget is $200 to $300 a night. It will be my husband and I traveling together.”\n\nBooking’s experiments in AI demonstrate the value of proprietary data sets. While general AI systems such as ChatGPT are designed to answer questions about anything, focused AI systems that leverage a company’s unique data can be far more powerful when applied to specific use cases. With Booking’s AI Trip Planner, the system is unable to answer questions unrelated to making travel reservations. But on the other hand, it is far more likely to understand what the user wants since it already knows that the entire conversation will be about travel. Importantly, Booking’s AI Trip planner has access to the company’s enormous dataset that includes hotel ratings, popular hotels, and all sorts of detailed information about each hotel.”\n\n8. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake: $886,123,136\n\nDE Shaw increased its stake in ride-hailing company Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) by 30% in the fourth quarter of 2023. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) shares have gained about 34% in 2024 through February 26.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 129 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was a top contributor in the quarter following better than expected 3Q23 earnings and 4Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $35.3 billion were up 21% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17.9 billion grew 30% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 16% from last year and continued to be strong throughout the quarter. 1Q Adjusted EBITDA of $1.1 billion, up $576 million year over year, was better than management’s guidance of $1 billion, and the company generated $900 million of free cash flow, up from $358 million last year. Management guided to continuing growth in 4Q Gross Bookings (23.5% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $1.2 billion).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates.1 Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than a ride sharing and food delivery service; we also see it as a global mobility platform with 142 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and the ability to penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and hourly worker staffing. Given its $5.2 billion of unrestricted cash and $5.1 billion of investments, the company today has an enterprise value of $128 billion, indicating that UBER trades at 21x our estimates of next year’s free cash flow.”\n\n7. Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake: $963,518,479\n\nRanking seventh in our list of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire DE Shaw is Netflix Inc (NASDAQ:NFLX), which is up about 25% year to date through February 27. During the fourth quarter of 2023, Netflix Inc's (NASDAQ:NFLX) revenue increased by 12.5% year over year to $8.83 billion, beating estimates by $120 million.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX): NFLX was a top contributor in the quarter following strong third quarter earnings and fourth quarter guidance driven by better-than-expected subscriber adds (+8.8 million versus estimates of +6.1 million). The company’s subscriber growth continued to accelerate following the company’s crack down on password sharing, and the rollout of the advertising supported subscriber offering known as the Ad Tier. ARPU came in below expectations, but management announced price increases in the US, UK and France effective immediately. NFLX guided full year 2023 operating margins to the “high end” of the prior guidance, guided 2024 operating margins to a range of 22-23%, ahead of investor expectations of 22%, and raised 2023 free cash flow guidance from $5 billion to $6.5 billion. The recent re-acceleration of subscriber growth, plus price increases on premium memberships and a stabilization of content investments, should position the company for low double digit annual revenue growth over the next few years while driving improved operating margin to more than 25% (revenue grew 8% for 3Q23 and operating margin was 22.4%, up from 13% in 2019). We also believe that the stabilization of content spend should allow the company to continue to scale its FCF.”\n\n6. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nDE Shaw's Stake: $993,649,609\n\nOver the past one year Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) shares have gained about 184%, thanks to the AI-led efforts Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is making that are reviving growth and engagement at its platforms. DE Shaw, with a $993 million stake in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), has been reaping rewards of this investment.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 242 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Improving unit economics: Many of our companies were able to significantly expand margins during 2023 even though revenue growth decelerated for some of them, showcasing the power of their capital-light, recurring revenue business models, and their increased focus on efficiency. One public example that was at least partially responsible for driving other companies (especially in IT) to become more efficient is X (formerly Twitter), which reduced headcount by a whopping 80% after Elon Musk’s acquisition, despite growing user engagement. Another well-known example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), for which cost controls and margin expansion this year have been a key reason behind the stock’s outperformance (Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the year of efficiency). Other less well-known examples include the commerce platform, Shopify, which is expected to expand its operating margins from breakeven to 10.9% in 2023 thanks to the sale of its money-losing logistics business, and a 23% reduction in its workforce. What is even more impressive is that the company was able to accelerate innovation velocity (with a lower headcount) as well as improve sales and marketing productivity.”\n\nClick here to continue reading and see5 Best Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire D.E.

        "title": "Generative AI is having a throw-everything-at-the-wall moment",
        "content": "It seems like every day another company announces a new generative AI product or service. From apps that summarize your meetings to platforms that help with photo editing and customer support bots, generative AI is all any tech firm wants to talk about.\n\nStill, not every piece of generative AI software is going to be a breakthrough like OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the bot that helped kick off this new tech revolution. But don’t expect that to slow the seemingly endless parade of platforms and tools coming to market. Even if some of those products appear doomed from the outset.\n\n“I think we are in kind of a ‘spaghetti-at-the-wall’ stage,” explained Emily DeJeu, assistant teaching professor at Carnegie Mellon University’s Tepper School of Business.\n\n“We're just trying to find … what is the use-case for this? And in order to figure that out, it's almost like …we're going to do everything with it.”\n\nGenerative AI everywhere\n\nThe fact that generative AI is spawning a slew of new products shouldn’t be all that surprising. After all, we’ve seen the tech industry respond to huge trends like this in the same way before.\n\n“[It] reminds me a lot of the dot-com boom in the very late '90s, early 2000s, where everybody's like, ‘I need to get a website,’” explained Jennifer Golbeck, professor and director of the Social Intelligence Lab at the University of Maryland. A series of servers powering Google's Gemini AI platform. (Image: Google) (Google)\n\n“They didn't really know what they wanted to do with it, but they just didn't want to get left behind, and they were really attracted to all the promise of what that tech was going to do,” she added.\n\nAnd as with the dot-com boom, we’re seeing some generative AI capabilities that feel superfluous at best. Think Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Samsung offering an AI feature that changes the tone of your text message, so you sound more or less professional.\n\n“[The] vast, vast majority of these vendors are trying to figure out a product-market fit, and they don't yet have a product market fit,” said Arun Chandrasekaran, distinguished vice president and analyst at Gartner.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn other words, some companies are releasing generative AI products and services, even if it doesn’t seem like there’s a customer desire or need for them.\n\nThat isn’t necessarily all bad, though, explained Stefano Puntoni, co-director of AI at Wharton. After all, experimenting with different generative AI products will inevitably help the best rise to the top, while the worst will fall to the wayside.

Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIt’s not just the enormous number of new AI services, either. Some companies are marketing software as generative AI or AI-powered when, in fact, it isn’t, a practice known as AI-washing.\n\n“I think a really crucial piece of this is that a lot of different things are being called AI, not all of which I think really belong as part of this revolution that we're undergoing,” explained Neil Thompson, director of the FutureTech research project at MIT’s Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Lab.\n\nIn December, Securities and Exchange Commission chair Gary Gensler warned companies against AI-washing schemes, or else they'll face repercussions.\n\nWe’re still in the early stages of the generative AI revolution, which means companies will launch even more AI-powered products and services in the months ahead. Some will stick around, others will fail, and the industry will just have to see which ones come out on top.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The recent debacles at Boeing and Meta highlight the dangers of shrugging off employee concerns",
        "content": "Corporate history is rich with examples of employee warnings falling on deaf ears, often with devastating results. See past crises at Theranos, Abbott Nutrition, and Wells Fargo, to name a few. But some companies still make the mistake of repeatedly waving off concerned workers—or at least not taking them seriously enough.\n\nLast week, for example, the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times investigated Meta’s alleged inability to safeguard girl influencers featured in mom-run Instagram and Facebook accounts. “What often starts as a parent’s effort to jump-start a child’s modeling career, or win favors from clothing brands, can quickly descend into a dark underworld dominated by adult men, many of whom openly admit on other platforms to being sexually attracted to children,” the Times wrote, explaining how Meta’s tools help enable this spiral.\n\nMeta employees raised red flags about Instagram functions for monetizing content and recommended strong protocols to protect minors from potential exploitation and abuse, the Journal reported. Meta instead rolled out an automated safety system that was demonstrably ill-equipped to prevent inappropriate content and interactions.\n\nMeanwhile, an FAA inquiry following Boeing’s 737 Max door plug blowout crisis revealed that the aircraft maker’s employees didn’t trust that a program encouraging them to raise safety concerns anonymously was truly anonymous. The program was created in response to the company’s Max plane crashes in 2018 and 2019, when authorities found Boeing’s culture discouraged whistleblowing and that leadership didn’t react sufficiently or dismissed staffers’ concerns. Employees at Spirit AeroSystems, Boeing’s sole supplier of fuselages, have also claimed that their recent warnings about quality control were shrugged off because of production schedule pressures.\n\nMeta, too, has stood accused of minimizing or dismissing worker complaints about safety in the past, signaling that it has missed a foundational lesson of moral leadership, says Ann Skeet, senior director at the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University. “When people bring things to your attention, it’s an opportunity to reset expectations and to clarify culture,” she tells Fortune. “But if the leadership says that we can continue even when people are surfacing things they feel are inconsistent with the organization’s espoused values,” she adds, “it suggests there is another set of values that are actually being applied.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThose unacknowledged values often prioritize short-term profits and efficiency, of course. Meta’s reliance on algorithms is evidence of that because technology has not developed to a point where algorithms are foolproof, Skeet says. Rather than lean on software, she says a more effective response would involve banning parents from running child-focused accounts. Employees had suggested asking parents running child influencer accounts to register so the company could closely track activity, the Journal reported.\n\nSkeet argues that Meta should probably get out of the child-focused influencer practice entirely, given evidence that its favored approach to stopping predators isn’t working. “The long-term value of its brand has been increasingly associated with horrible outcomes for the people involved with using their products,” she says, pointing to CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s recent appearance before a U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee to discuss the sexual exploitation of teens using Meta’s products. “That is not responsible leadership in any way—not on a values basis, not on a bottom-line basis.”\n\nAlla Valente, an analyst for the consulting company Forrester, likewise warns that companies take on enormous risks when they don’t properly heed employee concerns about issues like fraud or moral breaches and fail to institute clear processes for reporting festering problems. The gamble is akin to investing heavily in a dodgy asset or willingly accepting a risk you might otherwise disclose in a securities filing, she says. When a corporate misdeed or negligence becomes widely known, and Valente says it inevitably will, “it's almost as if the price comes with interest.”\n\nOn the other hand, leaders who take whistleblowers seriously help reinforce the companies’ ethical values, improve morale, and can expect an overall reduction in fines and lawsuits, according to research. Whistleblowing, Valente wrote in a recent white paper, is a sign of an engaged culture. Most employees who call attention to problems are tenured staffers who want the company to improve, not disgruntled junior workers looking to throw stones, as some may believe. “It behooves you to take action because if you don’t, the headlines are probably worse than just quietly fixing [the issue],” she says.\n\n“You don’t have to make a big public announcement that, ‘Hey, we found this thing, and now we’re going to fix it,’” she adds. “Just fix it.”\n\nIn response to the FAA’s report, Boeing said in an emailed statement to Fortune that it has “taken important steps to foster a safety culture that empowers and encourages all employees to share their voice. But there is more work to do.” Meta shared a statement emphasizing Instagram’s rule that parents or managers must actively manage accounts that represent a minor under age 13. “On top of that, we prevent accounts exhibiting potentially suspicious behavior from using our monetization tools, and we plan to limit such accounts from accessing subscription content,” Meta said.\n\nCorporate leaders often have to balance conflicting pressures from various stakeholders. But Skeet reminds business heads who don’t swiftly rectify ethical lapses that they’re hurting not only the reputation of their brand but the people who work for it. “Part of your brand promise to your employees is, ‘I’m creating a good environment for you, and you’re going to actually learn skills here that you can take to other places,’” she says.\n\nIn reality, when staff at scandalized companies leave to work elsewhere, they are sometimes viewed as tainted with potentially questionable habits and principles. Rather than their Silicon Valley experience acting as a feather in one’s cap, Skeet says, “these employees have to convince people to hire them, even though they’ve worked at Meta.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "13 Stocks That Will Double in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 stocks that will double in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the stock market, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Double in 2024.\n\nLast year turned out to be wondrous for the US stock market as the S&P 500 gained over 25% compared to its 18% decline in the previous year. However, almost all of the gains were attributed to the Magnificent 7, which got a huge boost in investor sentiment due to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of the stocks that doubled in 2023, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was able to gain nearly 240%. Because of last year's performance, analysts expect good things to happen in 2024 too.\n\nFor the Magnificent 7, analysts have mixed opinions, as some of them believe that the 2023 rally has made these stocks overvalued. The rest of them believe that the AI revolution is real and there is no stop in sight in the near future. Apart from the seven big tech stocks, Wall Street analysts also have faith in some other stocks such as NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) and believe that AI is a huge growth catalyst for them.\n\nThe former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC’s Mad Money, Jim Cramer, holds the Magnificent 7 in high regard. However, he believes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be the weak link among the group and suggests Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to be its replacement. Cramer also has mixed views about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the short-term but still sees it in a favorable light for the long term due to iPhone sales and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nFor 2024, the technology sector still seems to be holding a celebrity status among analysts and financial media. Nevertheless, some other sectors that can get a huge boost due to the AI revolution include the healthcare and industrial sectors. The industrial sector can benefit from AI as it can help the industry in cost cutting, more effective performance tracking, and enhanced productivity due to AI automation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, while the healthcare sector benefits significantly from AI, it is also a defensive sector that can weather any unforeseen events like we experienced over the last three years. Additionally, AI is quite an old tool in the healthcare industry. Intuitive Surgical, Inc.

The company started off managing call centers but has since evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates the data, and optimizes a client’s customer interactions. CX is a relatively new business, and Concentrix has been acquiring smaller competitors. In March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player, for $4.8B in cash and stock.22 We believe the WebHelp acquisition will help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. The company was spun out from TD Synnex, another of the Fund’s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with the company’s innovation and growth. The market is currently worried about the potential of artificial intelligence to disrupt Concentrix’ core call center business and shares of all CX companies have underperformed.”\n\n8.

The company’s revenue growth rates remain negatively impacted by macro factors as it’s relatively easy for customers to hire fewer freelancers when they must cut budgets in the near term. However, we are encouraged by the company’s rapid progress on the profitability front (with guidance for EBITDA margins to be approximately 16% for 2023 compared to 7% in 2022), early signs of revenue growth acceleration, and its significant long-term opportunity as freelance work continues growing. These factors present a positively skewed risk/reward opportunity for long-term investors, especially with the shares trading at a 9% FCF yield.

        "content": "Big tech's strong performance versus the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is often attributed to the success of the Magnificent 7 stocks. But it's really about three names this time around.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to start 2024. Nvidia has led the trio, surging nearly 60% compared to the benchmark index's 6% increase.\n\nThe three names have also topped the performance of their peers in the \"Magnificent 7.\" Microsoft (MSFT) has gained about 8% this year. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) have lost value through about two months of trade in 2024.\n\nThe stock moves are largely earnings based. In the current earnings season,Nvidia once again blew out expectations. Meta announced plans for a $50 billion share repurchase program and the company's first ever dividend. Meanwhile, Amazon surprised to the upside with its revenue metrics.\n\nOver the last 30 days as Wall Street analysts digested the latest round of corporate results from all seven big tech players, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia saw the largest increases in earnings projections for both the current year and next year, according to research from DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe,\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla and Microsoft negative earnings shifts were the only two of the group to see their earnings estimates move lower by more than the S&P 500 for next year.\n\nThe quarterly results of these companies are likely to shape the direction of the market at large. On Tuesday, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna wrote that big tech earnings per share estimates for 2024 have \"improved considerably\" and moved up the floor for total S&P 500 earnings projection this year.\n\nConsequently, the firm moved up its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,300 from 4,800 in part because of big tech earnings expectations. Goldman Sachs recently struck a similar tone in it's call for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"US Big Tech’s superior earnings estimate momentum versus the S&P 500 as a whole goes a long way in explaining why most of them have been able to continue to build on their [more than one] year run of outperformance,\" DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a note to clients on Monday night. \"As much as rates have risen this year, most Big Tech names are in considerably better fundamental shape than the broader US equity market.\n\n\"As long as they keep delivering on earnings results in the same manner as last quarter, most of these stocks should keep outperforming and driving the S&P higher.\" FILE - A Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023.

        "title": "Should You Invest in Meta Platforms (META) Based on Bullish Wall Street Views?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Meta Platforms, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nAlthough both Zacks Rank and ABR are displayed in a range of 1-5, they are different measures altogether.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nShould You Invest in META?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 12.5% over the past month to $19.94.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

AI is augmenting their objectives in two ways: 1) Improving engagement time per daily active user (AI Job One) 2) Matching ad buyers (advertisers) with ad consumers (AI Job Two)\n\nImproving Engagement Time per Daily Active User Meta is in the business of making sure that when you're scrolling through your feed or watching videos, you're glued to the screen as long as possible. Why? Because the longer you watch, the more ads they can slip into your viewing experience (think of digital billboards). But these ‘digital billboards’ are a finite resource – only more engagement time creates them.\n\nAnd here's where the magic of ‘AI job one’ comes in - finding that perfect video that keeps you hooked - thereby increasing the time you spend on the platform. It's a cycle that feeds itself: more engagement means more opportunities to serve ads, which in turn means more revenue…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nStory continues Facebook\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Currently Held in Warren Buffett's $621 Million \"Secret\" Portfolio",
        "content": "Few money managers command the attention of professional and retail investors quite like the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Warren Buffett.\n\nSince becoming Berkshire's chief in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a jaw-dropping 5,080,168% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 23. For context, we're talking about a nearly 20% annualized return spanning six decades, which is roughly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nEven though the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors aren't perfect, their track record undeniably points to a history of recognizing plain-as-day values hiding in plain sight. This is why investors pay such close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA 13F offers a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the December-ended quarter). However, Berkshire's 13F doesn't tell the complete story of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings.\n\nWarren Buffett has a \"secret\" portfolio that contains two prominent Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nIn 1998, Buffett's company completed a $22 billion acquisition of General Re. While the reinsurance segment was the catalyst behind the deal, General Re also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire purchased General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM.\n\nBecause New England Asset Management continues to oversee more than $100 million in assets under management, it's required to file a 13F with the SEC every quarter. Although Warren Buffett isn't involved with the investing activity at NEAM in the same way he is with Berkshire Hathaway's $371 billion portfolio, the $621 million NEAM had invested as of Dec. 31, 2023 is, nevertheless, part of Berkshire Hathaway's aggregate holdings. In other words, New England Asset Management is Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, this $621 million portfolio held positions in 115 securities, which includes common stock, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and preferred stock. But what really stands out is this portfolio's stake in two of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThey are seven of the largest and most-influential publicly traded companies in the United States. I'm referring to:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have two lures. First, as you can see in the chart above, they have handily outperformed the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven provide sustained competitive advantages and/or virtually impenetrate moats.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is the leading global operating system, while its Azure has quickly become the world's No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services. Apple's iPhone is the clear leader in smartphone market share in the United States. Furthermore, Apple's share-repurchase program is unrivaled, with more than $600 billion worth of its common stock bought back since the start of 2013. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for up to a 90% share of GPUs deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated data centers in 2024. Amazon's marketplace captured a nearly 38% share of online spending in the U.S. in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search in January. It also owns Google Cloud, the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, and YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet. Meta Platforms' social media real estate is unmatched. Facebook is the most-visited site globally, and its family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only EV pure play that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nWarren Buffett's secret portfolio holds stakes in two of these seven companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures. NEAM closed out December with 18,200 shares of Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL), which were worth more than $2.5 million at the time.\n\nThe longtime draw for investors to Alphabet has been its foundational search engine. It's been nearly nine years since Google last accounted for less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search in a given month. As a virtual monopoly, it is able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power and take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion. Internet search should continue to be a healthy cash-flow driver.\n\nHowever, the company's most-exciting cash flow growth is liable to come from its smaller but substantially faster-growing segments. For instance, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income in 2023 after years of steady operating losses. Businesses are still very early in the cloud spending cycle, which suggests the high margins associated with cloud infrastructure services can really lift Alphabet's cash flow.\n\nSimilarly, YouTube's monthly active user count is marching higher. Daily views for Shorts (short-form videos that usually last less than 60 seconds) have climbed from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to north of 50 billion in early 2023. This represents an excellent monetization opportunity for YouTube, as well as another catalyst to spark an increase in high-margin subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet remains cheap, as well. Despite a sizable bounce from their 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be picked up for less than 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. That's a marked discount to the average multiple to cash flow of 17.9 that Alphabet has traded at over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt one time, Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio had a sizable position in Apple and owned shares of GPU giant Nvidia. But as of Dec. 31, 2023, neither company remained in New England Asset Management's $621 million portfolio. The only Magnificent Seven stock represented in that portfolio, other than Alphabet, is tech stock Microsoft. NEAM held 30,845 shares of the company as of Dec. 31, which equated to roughly $11.6 million in market value.\n\nThe reason asset managers are attracted to Microsoft is its exceptional cash flow, which is a function of its seemingly flawless operating model and pristine balance sheet.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Microsoft's success is a reflection of its blending the old with the new. Although its legacy Windows and Office segments are no longer growing much, if at all, they still generate exceptionally juicy margins that provide abundant cash flow. The company is able to use this cash to reinvest in high-growth initiatives or make acquisitions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Microsoft is betting its future on cloud services (including Azure), as well as the rise of AI. It has invested billions in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and is expecting longtail growth from the AI revolution.\n\nAnd Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. The company closed out 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's on pace for almost $99 billion in net cash generated from operations in fiscal 2024, based on the $49.4 billion of net cash it has generated through the first six months of its current fiscal year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Recasts with LG statement)\n\nSEOUL, Feb 28 (Reuters) - Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg on Wednesday met LG Electronics executives to discuss a stronger partnership in extended reality (XR) devices as well as potential cooperation in artificial intelligence (AI), LG said.\n\nZuckerberg arrived in South Korea late on Tuesday and is widely expected to hold talks on AI and meet with President Yoon Suk Yeol and heads of the country's technology powerhouses.\n\nHe held discussions with LG Electronics CEO William Cho and parent company LG Corp COO Kwon Bong-seok about business strategy related to next-generation XR device development, LG Electronics said in a statement.\n\nCho also expressed interest in Meta's large language model-based AI technology and discussed possible on-device AI cooperation, his company said. Cho has previously said LG Electronics is looking for opportunities in XR.\n\nMeta launched its latest mixed-reality headset, Quest 3, in June before rival Apple ramped up competition this month with its Vision Pro device.\n\nIt has also been intensifying AI efforts this year including plans for a custom chip and adding AI functions to products.\n\nZuckerberg is on his first known visit to South Korea in about 10 years. It comes as part of a tour of Asian countries that includes Japan and India, South Korean media reported.\n\nHe was due to meet President Yoon as well as Samsung Electronics Chairman Jay Y. Lee, said a government source with knowledge of the matter, declining to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to media.\n\nZuckerberg is widely expected to discuss AI chip supply and expanding ecosystems for generative AI during his South Korea visit, as Meta seeks to get generative AI technology into its core social media products and hardware devices this year.\n\nMeta plans to deploy into its data centres this year a new version of a custom chip aimed at supporting its AI push, Reuters reported this month. It also plans to secure about 350,000 H100 graphics processing units from leading AI chipmaker Nvidia by end-year to support the push.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg discussed ways to deepen Meta Platforms Inc.’s strategic alliance on extended-reality technology with LG Electronics Inc., making his latest stop on a tour of Asia that’s taken the billionaire founder from Tokyo to Seoul.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Apple's Scrapped Car Project Means AI and Headset Bets Are More Urgent\n\nMeta’s CEO and LG Electronics Chief Executive Officer William Cho spent two hours going over business strategies for so-called XR devices, considered a next phase after early virtual and augmented reality devices such as the Quest headset. The pair discussed Meta’s large language models and the potential to build AI into consumer devices, LG said in a statement. The Korean company mentioned in particular how Meta’s platform can dovetail with LG’s content and TV business to create a “distinctive ecosystem.”\n\nZuckerberg is in Seoul after spending several days on a ski trip with his family in Japan. AI and Quest have featured heavily on his agenda so far, given Meta’s accelerating investment into artificial intelligence and growing competition in hardware from the likes of Apple Inc.’s Vision Pro. In South Korea, he’s also expected to meet up with Samsung Electronics Co., a longtime rival of LG’s that’s also collaborated with Meta on virtual reality.\n\nRead More: Zuckerberg’s Asia Tour to Range From AI to Ambani Wedding Party\n\nZuckerberg, who arrived in Seoul late Tuesday clad in the same brown Mustang jacket he sported in public Wednesday, is attracting outsized attention during an Asian tour that’s largely remained under wraps.\n\nThe billionaire is returning to the city as Meta, whose businesses range from Facebook to Instagram, races to compete in AI with powerful competitors from OpenAI and Microsoft Corp. to Alphabet Inc. It’s an undertaking that will require huge amounts of Nvidia Corp. chips and investment to build what Zuckerberg has dubbed a “massive compute infrastructure.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: LG Electronics Sets Aside $7.6 Billion for New Tech Bets in 2024\n\nMeta remains far and away the industry leader in VR headsets — holding nearly half the market, according to Counterpoint Research — but is losing money on that venture and now has to contend with Apple’s latest device. It’s unclear if mainstream consumers will ever fully embrace the products.\n\nZuckerberg’s next stop is India, where he’s slated to attend the pre-wedding celebrations of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s youngest son. The three-day festivities, which will start on March 1, will draw celebrities in business, technology and entertainment.\n\nLG, one of the biggest names in consumer electronics, this year pledged to set aside some $7.6 billion for investment into new technologies such as electric vehicles. The Korean company, which makes everything from washing machines and TVs to displays for smartphones, is doubling its capital expenditure despite persistent global economic uncertainty, Cho said at the time.\n\nRead More: Meta Debuts Costlier $500 Quest 3 Headset, Ahead of Apple\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer Was Right About These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Was Right About These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer recently said in his program \"Mad Money\" on CNBC that people are asking him which stock would be the next NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Cramer said people believe Nvidia has \"made it\" since the stock has gained 236% over the past one year. Cramer acknowledged that it's really \"hard\" to find another such company that can post such an \"unbelievable\" revenue growth. Cramer reiterated that AI could be the \"gamer changer\" for \"everything\" that is digital.  Cramer said NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the \"freak of nature\" and the stock's dramatic rise in value has been difficult to digest for many because in the past companies like Apple and Microsoft rose to dominance relatively slowly, but Nvidia's market cap ascendance was unheard of.\n\nCramer then went to discuss which companies could join the $1 trillion market cap club soon. Cramer yet again sounded bullish about Eli Lilly because of the company's weight loss drug and Alzheimer's treatment. Cramer said these weight loss drugs make junk food less appealing.  Cramer also said Eli Lilly's Alzheimer's treatment approval could come \"any day\" now. While Cramer believes Eli Lilly stock should see a sell-off in the near term, he thinks the company is headed to become the first $1 trillion market cap pharma company in the future. Jim Cramer Was Right About These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nIn this article we decided to take a look at the performance of Jim Cramer's stock picks. For that we first referred to our previous articles in which we covered Cramer's stock recommendations and calls made near the end of 2023 and early 2024.  We then calculated the performance of these stocks in 2024 so far to see whether Cramer was right or wrong about these stocks. With each stock we have mentioned its performance in 2024. Some top Jim Cramer's recommendations for 2024 were NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG). Let's see how they performed.\n\nStory continues\n\nJim Cramer's Stock Predictions and Their Performance in 2024\n\n10.

Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +93%\n\nIn early January, Jim Cramer had said that Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) was doing \"so much so right, they are going to dominate cell phone, PC, hyperscale.\"\n\nCramer said he'd want to buy Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) for his charitable trust.\n\nArm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have gained about 93% year to date through February 26. However, apparently this performance has run too hot for Cramer. He earlier this month said Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) was an example of market \"froth.\"\n\nLike Arm Jim Cramer is also bullish on NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\n7. Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 43\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +22%\n\nJim Cramer was bullish on Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) when 2024 started. Here's what he had said about the aerospace engineering company when a caller asked him about this thoughts during a program on CNBC:\n\n\"What a stock Howmet is,\" Cramer said.\n\nCramer had said that investing in Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) was the \"right call.\"\n\nHowmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM) shares have gained about 22% since 2024 started.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023,  43 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Howmet Aerospace Inc (NYSE:HWM).\n\nThe company talked about its guidance in Q4'2023 earnings call:\n\n\"Regarding the full year 2024, we see revenue at $7.1 billion plus or minus $100 million; EBITDA of $1.635 billion plus or minus $35 million; and earnings per share of $2.15 plus or minus $0.05. Free cash flow, we see a $735 million plus or minus $35 million and CapEx of $290 million plus or minus $15 million. I’d like to comment further on the capital expenditures, seen as these are expected to be above depreciation for the first time in many years. Essentially, this is due to investment opportunities materializing the Engine Products business. We see this as a very good sign to be able to deploy capital with high returns and rapid future growth. In fact, let me expand. In fact, 2023, which was another year of above market growth in each of our segments, in fact, above 5% above market served.\n\nThis engine investment is viewed as excellent and speaks to the continued market growth in the business with 27%-plus EBITDA margins and a 33%-plus return of capital. And this continued growth is seen as the investments come on stream in approximately 18 months’ time. Underpinning all of this is an agreement with one of our engine manufacturer customers for increased business and increased market shares. This does not change our long-term commitment to deliver average free cash flow conversion of 90% of net income. And as you can see from our guide, free cash flow after all cost is approximately 45% of EBITDA which is best-in-class. We based our guidance on Boeing 737 MAX production of 34 aircraft per month and six 787 aircraft per month. Our Airbus assumptions are in line with their plans.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6. GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nCramer's Recommendation: Buy\n\nYTD Performance in 2024: +16%\n\nIn early January 2024, Jim Cramer had called GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) a \"ridiculously cheap\" stock. Cramer said that GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) was doing \"so many great things.\" Cramer said at the time that when an analyst was downgrading the stock he was saying \"Buy, Buy, Buy\" on the stock.\n\nCramer also said that his Charitable Trust has a \"big position\" in the stock and he's sticking with the GE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) stock for the \"long haul.\"\n\nGE HealthCare Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:GEHC) is up 16% year to date through February 26.\n\nIn addition to GE Healthcare, Jim Cramer also loves NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and Procter & Gamble Co (NYSE:PG).\n\nCooper Investors Global Equities Fund stated the following regarding GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter the portfolio initiated a position in GE HealthCare Technologies Inc. (NASDAQ:GEHC). GEHC is the former Healthcare division of GE, spun out in early 2023. It’s a global leader in imaging equipment such as MRI machines, CT scanners and ultrasound systems along with associated consumables. The business has a long and storied history but was trapped inside a larger, underperforming conglomerate, starved of the love and attention it needed to thrive.\n\nFrom a subset of value perspective, we view GEHC as a Low risk turnaround. The underlying business is fundamentally sound but has ceded market share over time, with sales growth lagging the industry. There is significant margin opportunity with core imaging margins (~50% of sales) much lower than its main peer. We see two drivers in restoring performance. Firstly an increase in research and development spending (since 2017 R&D spend is up 70%, far outpacing revenue growth). Secondly an opportunity to improve SG&A cost efficiency.\n\nWhat makes the turnaround low risk? Management and Board quality are critical. GEHC features a few of what we call ‘CI Alumni’; executives we have invested behind at other companies. Top of this list is Chairman Larry Culp, the former CEO of Danaher, an executive we have the highest respect for.\n\nGEHC has strong financial characteristics. It is a market leader in an oligopolistic industry where market share changes slowly and gross profit comes largely from aftermarket. The balance sheet is appropriately geared with well structured debt. Our analysis of GEHC’s accounts suggests there may be some conservatism baked into the P&L numbers. At today’s share price you don’t need to assume much going right to do well, which partially reflects the backdrop of healthcare stocks having been under pressure this year. If GEHC can deliver on its potential, the upside is significant.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Was Right About These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best performing dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Performing Dividend Stocks To Invest In Now.\n\nFor investors focused on dividends, there's an ongoing struggle to find the right balance between dividend growth and dividend yield. While many experts caution against falling into yield traps, historical data suggests that high-yield stocks have performed well. However, combining both dividend growth and high yield can be a powerful strategy to maximize returns. One example is the S&P Sector-Neutral High Yield Dividend Aristocrats (HYDA) index, which aims to blend dividend growth with higher relative yield while maintaining sector weights similar to the S&P Composite 1500. This index is noted for its defensive characteristics. According to a report from S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has historically provided a buffer against market volatility. On average, the index has outperformed the benchmark when the VIX level, a measure of market volatility, was above 20, with the strongest outperformance seen when the VIX level was above 30. The report further noted that from January 31, 2005, to July 31, 2023, the index's overall return was nearly the same as the benchmark. That said, the S&P Sector-Neutral HYDA showed lower volatility throughout the entire period compared to the benchmark, resulting in better risk-adjusted returns. Moreover, the maximum drawdown experienced during that time frame was reduced by around 5%, indicating a more resilient performance during market downturns.\n\nGiven investors' preference for dividend-paying stocks and their track record of returns, numerous companies are striving to initiate, sustain, and enhance their dividend payouts. In a notable recent development, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has commenced paying a quarterly cash dividend to its shareholders. This move underscores the increasing popularity of dividends in the market. Notably, Morningstar analysts have observed a significant rise in the funds targeting dividend-paying stocks, with the total amount reaching $1 trillion. This figure has been growing at a rate of 10% annually since 2018, indicating a robust and expanding interest in dividend investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nDividend stocks have consistently gained traction due to their resilience and strong performance during previous periods of inflation. Over time, dividends have been a significant contributor, comprising approximately 40% of the total return of the S&P 500 since 1930. However, during decades characterized by high inflation rates, such as the 1940s, 1970s, and 1980s, where inflation averaged 5% or more, dividends accounted for an even larger portion, generating 54% of the total return. Naveed Rahman, co-manager of the Fidelity Equity-Income Strategy, highlighted this trend. He also emphasized that while seeking the best-performing dividend stocks today, investors may need to look beyond the traditional industries or sectors that have historically dominated such investments. The report further noted that companies that consistently pay dividends that are both sustainable and increasing have the capability to expand their cash flows over time, thereby enabling them to stay aligned with inflationary pressures.\n\nWalmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV) are some of the most prominent dividend stocks as these companies have raised their payouts for decades.

        "content": "(Adds details, recasts headline and lead)\n\nMOSCOW, Feb 27 (Reuters) - Telegram, the most popular messaging app used in Russia, suffered a temporary outage on Tuesday for unexplained reasons while some previously blocked social media apps including Instagram and Facebook suddenly became available in Russia.\n\nThe monitoring centre for Russia's public communications network said on Tuesday its specialists had recorded a \"massive failure\" of Telegram, though it was not immediately clear why. Telegram did not reply to a request for comment.\n\n\"The work of Telegram messenger and a number of other services in Russia is already being restored,\" Russia's digital ministry said in a statement, adding that there had also been failures of the app outside Russia.\n\n\"We are working to establish the cause of the incident,\" it said. \"As for Russian telecom operators, their networks are operating normally.\"\n\nReuters correspondents in Moscow noted outages of Telegram, YouTube and Vkontakte for around 90 minutes.\n\nSoon after the outage, several previously blocked social media apps including Instagram and Facebook suddenly became available in Russia on Tuesday, according to Reuters reporters in Moscow.\n\nReuters reporters were able to browse Instagram without requiring a virtual private network (VPN) for the first time since blocks were imposed shortly after Russia sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine in February 2022.\n\nCommunications regulator Roskomnadzor has moved to block some foreign tech companies including Meta Platforms' Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMoscow has long sought to improve its domestic internet infrastructure, or Runet, even disconnecting itself from the global internet for tests.\n\nAnton Gorelkin, deputy head of the State Duma parliamentary committee on information policy, said it was unclear what had caused the Telegram outages, but that immediately blaming the Russian state was a mistake, noting \"conspiracy theories\" that Russia was trying to block foreign resources prior to a March presidential election.\n\n\"There have been, and will be, such incidents for a variety of reasons: from human error to hacker attack,\" he said.\n\n\"Much more important is how long it takes to eliminate the failure; the scale of damage to the Russian economy depends on this.\" (Reporting by Reuters; Writing by Guy Faulconbridge and Lucy Papachristou; Editing by Alexander Marrow and David Evans)",

        "title": "Tech Sector Outlook Still Sturdy",
        "content": "This article was originally published on ETFTrends.com.\n\nThe Nasdaq-100 Index (NDX) is higher by 6.7% year to date. That confirms tech stocks remain in strong form. Still, some market observers are concerned valuations in tech and other high-growth sectors are becoming somewhat frothy.\n\nMarket participants considering ETFs such as the Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) and the Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF (QQQM), both of which follow NDX, might not need to fret about valuations. That's because the techn sector has some positive attributes on its side that can render elevated valuations moot points.\n\nFor example, the high-growth prospects offered by many QQQ and QQQM member firms are attractive in any environment. But they are even more so when economic growth is sluggish. The U.S. economy is expected to post higher rates of growth this year than other large developed economies. But GDP growth here probably won’t set the world ablaze. That indicates many investors will be willing to embrace the tech sector regardless of valuation.\n\nQQQ, QQQM Have Other Tailwinds\n\nAs noted by Charles Schwab in the firm’s recent sector outlook, tech scores will not only perform in terms of growth prospects, but also when it comes to quality metrics. Those can include free cash flow, balance sheet strength, and ability to grow shareholder rewards. These are all factors that many QQQ and QQQM holdings are already excelling at.\n\n“Information Technology tends to do well when strong economic growth encourages companies to invest in technology upgrades and consumers to buy new devices,” according to Schwab. “Some of the larger members are not in the ‘long-duration’ camp—companies expected to produce their highest cash flows in the future—given they have current earnings growth and strong cash positions.”\n\nThe outlook is similarly compelling for communication services stocks. That’s the sector that Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) call home. That group represents almost 16% of the QQQ/QQQM rosters. Schwab noted that companies in this sector should benefit from rising internet advertising and subscription revenue, assuming the economy remains strong. Those catalysts could be enhanced because 2024 is a presidential election year.\n\nStory continues\n\nSchwab is somewhat constructive on the healthcare sector. That undervalued group accounts for 6.43% of the Invesco ETFs. That could provide a small buffer if economic growth slows.\n\n“Information Technology tends to do well when strong economic growth encourages companies to invest in technology upgrades and consumers to buy new devices. Some of the larger members are not in the \"long-duration\" camp—companies expected to produce their highest cash flows in the future—given they have current earnings growth and strong cash positions,” concluded the research firm.\n\nFor more news, information, and analysis, visit the ETF Education Channel.\n\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n\nSPY ETF Quote VOO ETF Quote QQQ ETF Quote VTI ETF Quote JNUG ETF Quote Top 34 Gold ETFs  Top 34 Oil ETFs  Top 57 Financials ETFs\n\nEquity Symposium Will Cover Valuations and More ETF Prime: Zeno Mercer on Nvidia and More 4Q23 Midstream/MLP Dividend Recap: The Growth Continues VIDEO: ETF of the Week: Columbia EM Core ex-China ETF (XCEM) How Themes ETFs Stands Out in Crowded Market\n\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >",

        "title": "Are These the 2 Best \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Right Now?",
        "content": "A significant portion of the market's impressive run since the start of 2023 can be attributed to the monumental rise of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. These businesses are industry-leading entities with a focus on innovation and tech-forward thinking.\n\nA quick look at these companies reveals that their stock prices might be on the expensive side of things. This makes sense, given how much they've rewarded shareholders in recent times. Prospective investors might be discouraged in thinking they missed the rally.\n\nBut there are two Magnificent Seven constituents that still appear to be extremely smart buys right now. Let's take a closer look at Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META).\n\nDominating the industry\n\nBoth of these internet giants touch the lives of billions of people on a daily basis. Alphabet has six products and services that have more than 2 billion users each. And Google Search, for instance, commands a remarkable 91% share of the global search industry.\n\nMeta, with its popular social media apps, counts 4 billion monthly active users. That figure was up 6% year over year in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nWhen it comes to unrivaled scale and limited competitive threats, I don't know if there are any two businesses on the planet that hold a candle to Alphabet and Meta. While it's true that anyone with some funding and tech prowess can create a new search engine or social media app from scratch, adding users would be an insurmountable task.\n\nBoth of these companies benefit from powerful network effects and tremendous data advantages that minimize the risk of disruption. I don't think any other characteristics exemplify just how high quality Alphabet and Meta are.\n\nThe result is that combined, they generate 57% of the world's digital ad revenue in an industry that is set to register sizable growth going forward. And with both enterprises focused on making huge investments in artificial intelligence capabilities, their ability to serve up better-targeted ads will be compelling for marketers.\n\nStory continues\n\nImpressive financials\n\nThese companies have impressive track records of growing both revenue and income at high rates in the past, which has propelled their share prices. In the last five years, Alphabet's and Meta's operating margins averaged 25.8% and 34.2%, respectively, a clear sign of their outsized profitability.\n\nThese are financially sound businesses that generate tens of billions of dollars in operating cash flow on a quarterly basis. Combined, they had a net cash position of $145 billion on their balance sheets as of Dec. 31. This favorable situation virtually eliminates any financial risk from their businesses, while providing seemingly unlimited resources to continue investing aggressively in growth opportunities.\n\nWhile Meta just announced a tiny dividend, these companies have generally returned capital to shareholders via stock buybacks. In the past few years, they have done a wonderful job at shrinking their outstanding share counts, which boosts their earnings per share.\n\nIt's not too late\n\nEven after their gains in the last year, these stocks aren't trading at nosebleed valuations. It's actually the opposite.\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet and Meta sell for forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios of 21.2 and 24.3, respectively. For comparison's sake, the tech-heavy Nasdaq-100 index trades at a forward P/E multiple of 30.3. And even more noteworthy, based on this metric, these two stocks are cheaper than any of the other Magnificent Seven companies.\n\nBased on all of the fantastic qualities, adding these two businesses to your portfolio looks like a no-brainer decision.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 26, 2024\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Randi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "3 ETFs with Big Nvidia Positions: SMH, IYW, SPMO",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is taking the market by storm, and it’s not just the stock that is benefiting. Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia’s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\n\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia’s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock’s percentage weight within the ETF.\n\nLet’s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\n1. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH)\n\nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors “exposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.”\n\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund’s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia’s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nSMH’s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\n\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nI’m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\n\n2. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to “track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.” IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\n\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW’s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH’s massive 25.7% position. Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of IYW’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ Holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nLike SMH, IYW’s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nWhile this ETF’s focus is different than SMH’s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they’ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\n\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nI’m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\n\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys, 27 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n3. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO)\n\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach. SPMO is “based on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,” which “tracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high ‘momentum score.’” The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\n\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO’s holdings, which is less than SMH’s exposure but more than IYW’s. In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPMO’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nSPMO isn’t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO’s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO’s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher. Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn’t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\n\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I’m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position.\n\nIs SPMO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nNo Shortage of Ways to Invest in Nvidia\n\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "(Adds Meta's comment in paragraph 13)\n\nBy David Ljunggren\n\nOTTAWA, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Canada on Monday unveiled draft legislation to combat online hate that would force major companies to quickly remove harmful content and boost the penalty for inciting genocide to life in prison.\n\nThe Liberal government of Prime Minister Justin Trudeau introduced the bill with the stated aim of protecting children from online predators.\n\nThe bill says major social media companies must quickly remove content that sexually victimizes a child as well as intimate content communicated without consent. In both cases, the content would have to be removed within 24 hours, subject to an oversight and review process.\n\nA company found guilty of contravening the law could be fined a maximum of 6% of its gross global revenues, government officials said during a technical briefing.\n\n\"There must be consequences for those who violate the rules online ... bad actors target our most vulnerable - our children. They spread vile hate and encourage impressionable people to commit violence,\" Justice Minister Arif Virani told reporters.\n\nContent providers would have to introduce special protections for children, including parental controls, safe search settings and content warning labels.\n\nThe bill covers social media, user-uploaded adult content and live-streaming services but not private and encrypted messaging services.\n\nThe bill would also sharply raise the penalties for those found guilty of advocating or promoting genocide. The proposed maximum sentence would be life in prison, up from the five years at present.\n\nWhether all the provisions make it through to the final version is unclear. The bill must be studied by a parliamentary committee and then the upper Senate chamber, both of which can demand changes.\n\nOther nations are moving to shield children from danger on the internet. Last October, Britain's new Online Safety Law set tougher standards for social media platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nCanadian government ties with major internet companies are strained over Ottawa's demand that they pay Canadian news publishers for their content.\n\nAlphabet's Google agreed last November to pay C$100 million ($74.05 million) annually to publishers while Meta decided to block news on Facebook and Instagram in Canada.\n\nA Meta spokesperson said the company looks forward to collaborating with lawmakers and industry peers \"on our long-standing priority to keep Canadians safe.\"\n\nA spokeswoman for Google said the company was unlikely to respond on Monday.\n\n($1 = 1.3505 Canadian dollars)\n\n(Reporting by David Ljunggren; Editing by Andrea Ricci, Sandra Maler and Richard Chang)",

        "title": "Supreme Court 'skeptical' of social media laws, professor says",
        "content": "The US Supreme Court will hear arguments over laws regarding social media. This stems from concerns over state laws enacted by Florida and Texas that would stop social media platforms from supposedly suppressing certain political content. The ruling may have major implications for how state governments may regulate how social media platforms moderate their content.\n\nSinan Aral, Author of The Hype Machine and Professor at MIT Sloan Management, joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the social media case before the Supreme Court, how it may play out, and the implications of its potential rulings.\n\nWhen asked how the Supreme Court may lean, Aral says: \"I think the justices are skeptical of these laws. I don't imagine that these two laws are going to be upheld in their entirety. I think that either they're going to be overturned or the cases are going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts. And the reason why that would happen is precisely the threading the needle that I discussed earlier, which is that the Supreme Court is likely to want to bound the impact of their decision... You saw them asking questions about exactly what are the boundaries of the scope of these laws and therefore their decisions about these laws. At the end of the day, it's going to be about content moderation and how much of it is the purview of social media companies or not.\"\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: All right. Today the Supreme Court is hearing arguments that could shape the future of social media. At the center, two laws that seek to limit how social media companies moderate content on their sites. The state laws say companies cannot remove users or posts from platforms.\n\nThe companies have argued it's their First Amendment right to do so. With more, we're joined by Sinan Aral, the David Austin professor of management, IT, marketing, and data science at MIT. Sinan, it's good to see you. Thanks for joining us here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have been so many attempts to try to figure out how to regulate this. So it's interesting these cases and where they're coming from and the allegations that they are making. Is this the thing that ends up shaping content moderation for these companies?\n\nSINAN ARAL: Julie, great to see you. Thanks for having me. This is indeed an important case. It's important because the legislature can't seem to find unanimity in terms of both sides of the aisle coming together to regulate social media in one direction or another.\n\nAnd so here, you see some states taking actions that support the more Republican conservative view that social media companies should not be able to moderate content that they deem as being censorship of conservative voices. These are laws, in effect, in Texas and in Florida. And then in other states, you have other kinds of laws that are pushing for more content moderation.\n\nAnd I think what is important about this case is that it has to thread the needle about, on one side, making sure that the social media companies have the ability to not turn the internet into a cesspool with no content moderation, on one hand. But then, on the other hand, not giving them a blanket immunity from any type of government regulation or legislation. We know that AI is happening right in front of us and right around the corner in terms of legislation. A blanket immunity would also not be good.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Sinan, I'm interested to get your take to, you know, just for traders, investors who are listening right now, Sinan. What are the possible, as you think through them, business implications if the Florida and Texas laws were indeed upheld here?\n\nSINAN ARAL: Yeah, so that's a really important question. In my mind, there are three possible outcomes of this case. Two of them are much more likely than the third, as far as I could see the questioning of the justices today. I think the justices are skeptical of these laws.\n\nI don't imagine that these two laws are going to be upheld in their entirety. I think that either they're going to be overturned or the cases are going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts. And the reason why that would happen is precisely the threading the needle that I discussed earlier, which is that the Supreme Court is likely to want to bound the impact of their decision.\n\nIn other words, is this just about Facebook Blue and the newsfeed on Facebook Blue? Or is it also about Meta's WhatsApp? Is it also about other parts of the internet ecosystem like email? You saw them asking questions about exactly what are the boundaries of the scope of these laws and, therefore, their decisions about these laws.\n\nAnd at the end of the day, it's going to be about content moderation and how much of it is the purview of social media companies or not. It's a First Amendment case. Obviously, you also have the question of whether the government can pressure social media to censor certain types of content on their platforms.\n\nFor instance, COVID misinformation. We know that we have a case in Missouri, that is the Surgeon General against Missouri, that is about whether or not the administration can pressure around COVID-19 misinformation content moderation policies. And so, I believe either these cases are going to be overturned or it's going to be remanded for further development in the lower courts.\n\nAnd in that case, in either of those two cases, not much is going to change with the social media companies in the short term. To the extent that being remanded and coming back with a different scope creates meaningful, substantive changes in content moderation, then it could have impacts on business policy. But for the moment, I think it's a wait and see for business policy.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Well, and there is a looming event here in the US that this would be quite pertinent to, the presidential election. But it sounds like you think nothing's going to be resolved before that.\n\nSINAN ARAL: I think it's not going to be resolved in June or July. To the extent that there's going to be a quick development in the lower courts and a comeback, maybe. To the extent that the laws are overturned, then it's status quo, meaning the social media companies will continue to moderate content based on their editorial discretion and their choices.\n\nAnd that doesn't mean just banning users or banning posts. It means also demoting posts or reducing the amount that they spread on the platforms. That, by the way, is the status quo. So to the extent that that's what we have today, then I could imagine that that remains in effect or that it gets remanded and re-scoped to understand, is this about email?\n\nIs this about private messaging? To what extent should different types of decisions be allowable or not allowable? These are really, really important questions, and I don't expect the Supreme Court to make a hasty decision.\n\nIf there is a decision, I believe it will be to overturn these laws and maintain the status quo and try to maintain some consistency across state laws. But I think it's equally likely that the cases will be remanded to the lower courts for further development.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Big, complex questions and issues. Sinan, thanks as always for helping us walk through them. Appreciate it.\n\nSINAN ARAL: Thank you.",

        "title": "7 High-Upside Tech Stocks to Buy That Also Pay Dividends",
        "content": "Generally speaking, investors buy tech stocks for their exposure to growth and not dividends. When the tech sector gets hot, it grows very quickly producing rapid returns. 2023 was a prime example of that broad truth. Investors will continue to buy tech stocks primarily for that exposure.\n\nYet, text stocks also provide the stability of dividend income in some cases. Most tech firms direct cash toward growth prospects primarily. More established firms also choose to direct the sum of their cash back to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThose are the firms we will be discussing below. These firms tend to pay lower yields but there are also cases in which yields exceed 3% or more. Let’s take a look at these tech firms and their dividends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who do their homework on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will discover that it actually pays a dividend. In fact, the company instituted its dividend program all the way back in 2013. Nvidia has never reduced its dividend payment during that time.\n\nWhile its yield is very low at 0.02%, it is clearly very reliable overall. To be clear, Nvidia is not highly focused on its dividend program as an enticement to investors: the dividend has only grown by 2% on average over the past five years.\n\nIn any case, investors are interested in Nvidia for its growth prospects. The small dividend is something of a novelty but provides a slight amount of income nonetheless. Investors will buy NVDA shares at the moment primarily because it continues to shine. Its fourth quarter earnings beat was yet another strong signal from the world’s leading chip maker. Buy Nvidia because it has the potential to move as high as $1,300 but also consider that dividend which will continue to grow over time.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Is one of the better known tech dividend stocks. The internet networking firm pays a dividend yielding more than 3% and which has not been reduced for more than a dozen years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat dividend looks to add an additional $1.60 to each share of CSCO stock in 2024. Consider that in light of the fact that analysts believe share prices could rise above $76 this year. That would put the total return at $78. Cisco Systems shares currently trade for approximately $49. There is legitimate potential for investors and that dividend yield is critical.\n\nEven if those share prices don’t rise that high, the consensus is that they will rise above $57. In that case, the $1.60 in dividends becomes even more attractive.\n\nOne of the primary reasons Wall Street is bullish on Cisco Systems is the simple fact that IP protocol demand should continue to rise in light of the continued emergence of AI. By the shares for their exposure to that potential growth and rest easy knowing that they provide income.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is no doubt that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a high upside investment. Despite its meteoric growth over the past year there is likely more ahead. In fact, analysts believe it could rise as high as $600 this year. That would represent roughly 50% growth above its current price.\n\nThat potential is pushed marginally higher by Microsoft’s dividend which yields 0.75%. Microsoft pays $3 in annual dividends. In total, MSFT shares could rise as high as $603. The other thing to note is that Microsoft’s dividend is rock solid. The company has never reduced the dividend for the entirety of its existence. That’s probably not much of a surprise to readers: Microsoft is a cash rich firm that instituted the dividend as a bonus in reality. The likelihood that Microsoft reduces the payout is effectively zero.\n\nThe argument in favor of investing in Microsoft as a dividend stock is largely the same as that for the other tech giants with dividends: buy them for the growth potential and consider the dividend as a nice to have novelty.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) provides semiconductor products to firms around the world. Its stock is highly regarded and widely expected to grow from its current price of $103. The consensus opinion is that those shares will rise in value to $115 and potentially move as high as $140.\n\nThe company’s dividend adds an additional $2.72 to its potential returns. Should Skyworks Solutions shares reach the consensus price of $115, that equates to a difference between 11.65% returns and 14.3%. Investors can easily understand the value of a higher yield dividend such as that which Skyworks Solutions provides. The 2.63% yield may not sound particularly impressive but the figures show that it makes a large difference overall.\n\nThe company last reduced that dividend in 2014. However, the semi-annual dividend has been in existence since 1980. Higher yield dividends require more cash and are thus more likely to be reduced in leaner times. That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment and Skyworks Solutions continues to be an excellent choice among tech dividend stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is another of the leading tech firms that also pays a dividend. In fact, among the best known Silicon Valley firms, only Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) lacks a dividend entirely.\n\nUntil recently, Meta Platforms was similar to Google and did not pay any dividend. That changed on February 1st when the company reported 4th quarter earnings and initiated its first ever dividend of 50 cents.\n\nThe decision coincided with the company’s 20th anniversary. It also followed after the company beat 4th quarter expectations on Wall Street. Advertising revenues have rebounded as the unexpectedly strong economy continues to hum along.\n\nWhile the move was welcomed by Wall Street, it is also curious given the fact that META needs all the cash it can get at the moment. The company is trying to satisfy the dual beasts of AI growth and its continued losses in its metaverse segment. Again, it is welcome none-the-less and makes META shares currently among dividend paying tech firms worth investing in.\n\nAAPL (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWould you believe that AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been paying a dividend since 1987? It has, but there was a long pause during that period in which it paid no dividends at all. The company paused its dividend payment between late 1995 and the summer of 2012. That was the last time that the company reduced its dividend payment which currently yields 0.5%.\n\nThe decision heralded the beginning of a new era as Apple transitioned from the leadership of Steve Jobs into that of Tim Cook. The rationale for the reintroduction of the dividend was that it would attract liquidity in the form of institutional investment thus increasing share prices. The history of Apple’s share growth over the past decade makes it difficult to argue against the decision. AAPL shares have returned more than 27% on average annually over the past decade. That was enough to 11x an investment made at the beginning of that period.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but certainly not least on this list of dividend tech stocks is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The company provides investors with $3.20 annually in dividends per share owned. That equates to a yield of more than 2% which is relatively high in the tech world. The general thinking is that that cash would be better served pursuing growth prospects and thus yields of say 5%, for example, are exceedingly rare.\n\nIt’s fair to characterize Qualcomm’s dividend as being stable and relatively quickly growing. It was last reduced in 2003 and has grown at an annual rate of 5.3% over the last five years.\n\nWhile those points of attraction are logical reasons to buy Qualcomm, there are others to consider. Qualcomm is well diversified and exposed to current growth trends. It is one of the better positioned tech firms in relation to the confluence of AI and phones. The company has released updated AI features on its flagship phones. Investors remain very curious to see how the application of advanced AI to phones will drive revenues.  Smartphone revenues have been extraordinarily high as the world remains glued to their handsets. Qualcomm is a major provider to Apple which is a major catalyst to consider overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Future Juggernauts: The Next 7 Trillion Dollar Companies to Buy Now",
        "content": "Investors learned an important lesson in 2023: investing in the biggest companies and their stocks is a surefire way to capture strong gains. The Magnificent 7 – all of which are trillion dollar stocks – produced strong returns for investors.\n\nTherefore, it’s easy to see why investors continue to look for the next trillion dollar companies to buy now.  These companies promise to provide similar returns for investors. The names discussed below populate the ranks between the 8th and 18th most valuable firms.\n\nIf you have reached the trillion dollar threshold in the past but have since fallen back below that level. The others are in a strong position to pass that level in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s take a look at these juggernaut companies in order to understand why investors should buy now.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nWall Street continues to ask whether Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock has the ability to reach  a valuation of $1 trillion. Morgan Stanley is among the firms that  remain bullish in answering that question.\n\nAnalysts there recently raised their target price from $805 to $945. Should LLY shares reach $945 that still would put its valuation short of $1 trillion. Prices would have to reach just above $1,050 in order for Eli Lilly to become the first pharmaceutical stock valued at that level.\n\nThe obvious question then becomes why should investors believe that will be the case? The obvious answer is that Eli Lilly is at the forefront of a new era of drug making.\n\nThere is a huge market for FDA approved weight loss therapeutics. Eli Lilly has a winner in Zepbound. It received FDA approval for weight loss in November. Demand for the drug –  which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro –  is sky high. Mounjaro did more than $5 billion in sales in 2023 with an FDA indication for treating diabetes. Patients were demanding the drug for its ability to induce weight loss so when the FDA approved Zepbound for that indication Eli Lilly’s prospects brightened further. Sales reached $176 million in the fourth quarter, its first with FDA approval. analysts believe sales will be particularly strong given that Zepbound is indicated to reduce heart disease risks as well. That should make it easier for the drug to receive insurance approval.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is already a juggernaut by most standards. The stock is associated with Warren Buffett, arguably the most famous investor ever. Yet, at the same time, it has not reached the level of the Magnificent 7, all of which are valued at more than $1 trillion.\n\nHowever, when investors take a look at its history it is very clear to see that it is on a trajectory to pass that level in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett’s firm is well known for its strategy of investing in Blue Chip American companies.  The core of the company’s portfolio still consists of plays such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) primarily. Yet, a shift has emerged. The company is now investing more heavily in growth plays and lesser known names. That means it is increasingly invested in companies like Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) that poise the company for more growth.\n\nThe company is also highly invested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which makes up more than 50% of its overall holdings.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s fair to assert that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the best chance among the stocks listed in this article of reaching $1 trillion first. The company has been a trillion dollar firm in the past but current troubles plaguing the EV industry have slashed its valuation well below that level at present.\n\nAnalysts have pinpointed the reason for the decline to earnings projections. Wall Street continues to lower its earnings expectations for Tesla throughout 2024. The percentage by which their estimates have fallen correlates highly to the percentage by which Tesla’s shares have fallen over that time frame.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to argue with the numbers and the logic, I think there is something even simpler at play: Tesla doesn’t necessarily need Wall Street to come out and say that it has suddenly become positive about earnings for the shares to rebound.\n\nInstead, the company simply needs Elon Musk to show signs of his dedication to Tesla above all else. Should he do that and focus less on AI robots or X that might be just the spark that shares need.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA big part of the reason to believe in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock is its bullish expectations for the year. The company is already on record announcing that it expects 2024 to be a big year for growth, and a big reason to believe in that growth is the continued growth of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe leading AI chip firm again bested expectations with its 4th quarter earnings report. Both earnings and revenue figures were well above levels that Wall Street had been expecting. Yet, as promising as that sounds, it raises a question: can Nvidia continue to keep up with demand for its high priced processors that are strongly preferred for all things artificial intelligence?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has even further to grow in 2024. Nvidia relies on TSMC for chip production and packaging. So, it is an integral part of Nvidia’s ability to quiet critics who believe that it may not be able to keep up with demand in 2024. Bullish investors should ignore the noise and buy TSM stock as a direct indication of their confidence in both the firm and Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has doubled in the past 12 months. That puts it more than halfway on the path to a $1 trillion valuation. It clearly has a way to go before it can legitimately be considered a real threat to reach that level.\n\nWhile it will take time for Broadcom to realistically reach a $1 trillion valuation, it is worth investing in at the moment. For one, the company recently became more deeply entwined in the artificial intelligence race. CEO Hock Tan was recently added to the board of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe move deepens the already strong relationship between Meta and Broadcom. Meta is attempting to distance itself from Nvidia as a supplier and strengthen its collaborative efforts with firms like Broadcom in order to reduce costs. That should increase Broadcom’s sales from Meta in the future. Meta spent $500 million on service revenues with Broadcom last year.\n\nSo, while Broadcom has a long road ahead to reach $1 trillion, its relationship with Meta promises to speed up that trajectory.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the other pharmaceutical industry firm contending for its place as the first trillion dollar drug maker stock. It is very similar to Eli Lilly in both that regard and its drug portfolio.\n\nBoth firms have now FDA approved weight loss drugs that first received FDA approval as diabetes drugs. Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug is branded under the trade name Wegovy. The weight loss drug is given as an injection but the company also plans to sell it in pill form.\n\nThat should spike sales as the option of an orally taken pill is much more palatable than an injection. However, this is both a problem and an opportunity for Novo Nordisk. The company needs to increase manufacturing in order to meet the potential demand. The oral version of the drug requires more of the active ingredient than does the injectable form. Novo Nordisk will need to address its ability to manufacture the active ingredient at greater volumes in order to take advantage of the huge opportunity before it.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $11 billion for three factories in connection with its acquisition of Catalent. That news alone should give bulls all the confidence they need that Novo Nordisk can meet manufacturing demand for its drug.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who believe the oft repeated refrain that the rich are getting richer should consider buying LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) stock. In fact, it’s very easy to find sources to substantiate that opinion. This article and this one both suggest that the rich are indeed getting richer.\n\nAs people get richer they tend to buy greater volumes of the luxury goods that LVMH sells. The company, which is the largest luxury group globally, reported sales of 86.2 billion euros in 2023. That represented growth of 13% top line for the company and was a record year for the firm.\n\nLVMH is currently valued at approximately $450 billion. It has a long road ahead of to reach $1 trillion. Regardless, the company also has an incredibly diverse portfolio of luxury products and brands overall. Whether it’s jewelry, fashion, watches, expensive alcohol, or upscale retail shops, LVMH owns assets in those areas. That broad exposure to the world’s top luxury brands gives the company a scale that will allow it to continue to grow and head toward $1 trillion in valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Stock buybacks are rising this earnings season",
        "content": "Stock buybacks are increasing in a sign that companies are feeling better about the trajectory of the US economy.\n\nCompanies such as Meta (META), Disney (DIS), and Uber (UBER) all announced plans to repurchase shares this earnings season. And according to data from Deutsche Bank companies are acting on these buyback authorizations, with S&P 500 members repurchasing $63 billion worth of their own stock during the first week of February, the highest single-week total for buybacks since May 2023.\n\nDeutsche Bank director of global asset allocation and US equity strategy Parag Thatte explained to Yahoo Finance that as earnings rise, buybacks often follow suit. This happens because as earnings improve, companies' free cash flow often increases. Corporates will first spend that money on paying down debt. Then, remaining funds are often utilized for paying dividends, boosting capital expenditures to reinvest in the company, and, potentially, buying back shares.\n\nStock buybacks lower the amount of total shares outstanding to the public, boosting investors' stake in the company and their share of any potential dividends. It's viewed as a positive for investors, but is often the first thing to be cut when times are tough.\n\nThis means that the return of buybacks can seen as a sign that companies feel they're in a stronger position than the past few quarters when buybacks hit a lull. Uber CFO Prashanth Mahendra-Rajah described the launch of the company's first ever repurchasing plan as a \"vote of confidence in the company’s strong financial momentum.\"\n\nDisney CEO Bob Iger echoed a similar sentiment when discussing why his company boosted its dividend and announced plans to buy back shares for the first time since 2018.\n\n\"Our current position of strength, and confidence in our path ahead, already led us to pay a dividend to our shareholders last month ... As we continue to invest in our growth businesses and maintain our strong balance sheet, we also expect to prioritize dividend payments and share repurchases in the coming years,\" Iger said on the company's earnings call on Feb. 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta, for its part, is now planning to offer a quarterly dividend for the first time ever while also authorizing a $50 billion share repurchase program.\n\nThe buybacks are a noted shift for Meta, Disney, and Uber, which underwent layoffs over the last year and now appear more confident in where their businesses stand to start 2024.\n\nWhile companies are still managing higher borrowing costs and fears of a potential recession, the increase in buybacks indicates companies think their financial positioning is rounding the corner.\n\n\"They're not yet stating that all is clear and we are maybe completely free of a slowdown,\" Thatte said. \"But at the margin they are saying, 'Yes, we are seeing signs or things turning up.'\" The Walt Disney Co. logo appears on a screen above the floor of the New York Stock Exchange. (Richard Drew/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThere's another sign of corporate confidence:Deals, another way companies spend their cash flow, have increased to start the year too.\n\nWith Capital One's (COF) $35 billion offer to buy Discover Financial Services (DFS) leading the way in deal value, dealmaking year to date is up 55% compared to the same period last year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nFreedom Capital Markets chief global strategist Jay Woods recently told Yahoo Finance's Julie Hyman that the increase in deals is a \"confidence builder for markets.\"\n\n\"Rates have stabilized and have given companies more confidence to pursue deals,\" Woods said.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Nvidia, Meta Platforms, Coca-Cola, Microsoft and Apple",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 26, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Nvidia Corporation NVDA, Meta Platforms, Inc. META, Coca-Cola Company KO, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and Apple Inc. AAPL.\n\nHere are highlights from Friday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNvidia (NVDA) a Must-Buy After AI-Fueled Blowout Earnings\n\nNvidia Corporation ignited a record-setting rally in the stock market on Feb 22 after the chipmaker posted blockbuster fiscal fourth-quarter earnings on the strength of a spending hysteria on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia's bumper profits and revenues helped the chipmaker register a record one-day gain in market capitalization for any company in the United States. Nvidia added $277 billion in market capitalization in the last trading session.\n\nThis California-based company's one-day gain in stock market value easily surpassed the one-day gain of $204.5 billion by Meta Platforms, Inc. on Feb 2 after the social media giant reported robust quarterly results and declared its first dividend. In reality, Nvidia's one-day gain eclipsed the entire value of the Coca-Cola Company at $263.7 billion.\n\nNvidia has now regained its position as the third most valuable company in the U.S. stock market, lagging only behind Microsoft Corporation and Apple Inc.. Nvidia's shares have now soared 59.5% so far this year, way more than the broader S&P 500's rise of 4.3%.\n\nNvidia registered the best one-day percentage gain of 16.4% yesterday since it rallied 24.4% on May 23, 2023. Nvidia's stock has now touched an all-time high of $785.38. (read more: Nvidia Is Now 3rd Largest in Market Cap: More Upside Left?)\n\nAn upsurge in demand for Nvidia's chips, primarily from companies looking to upgrade their AI offerings, helped the firm post revenues of $22.1 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up a whopping 265% from a year ago. Similarly, Nvidia's earnings per share came in at $4.93 in the quarter ending on Jan 28, 2024, up a mind-boggling 765% from a year ago.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia's chips are needed for AI models developed by companies such as Meta and Microsoft. In particular, Nvidia's data center business, which is responsible for manufacturing the H100 graphics cards utilized for AI training, saw revenues jump $18.4 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter, up a solid 409% year over year. The data center business was able to shrug off the adverse effects of government curbs on exporting advanced AI semiconductors to China.\n\nLet us not forget that the H100 graphic card has become a gold standard for AI developers for data crunching required in language models. The H100 chips are, at the moment, one of the most sought-after commodities in Silicon Valley after the rapid success of Open AI's ChatGPT. Meanwhile, Meta is planning to increase its stock of H100 chips to 350,000 by the end of this year, as mentioned by chief executive Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nThus, Nvidia is optimistic about its future growth and expects revenues for the current quarter to come in at $24 billion, way ahead of estimates. Improvement in PC shipments in recent times as price pressure eases due to the Federal Reserve's monetary tightening measures is also expected to benefit the chipmaker soon. Nvidia's gaming business, too, made some advancements in the reported quarter and is expected to do well in the rest of the year.\n\nNvidia's present valuation may look stretched compared to the S&P 500 but it isn't as extreme as companies such as Cisco Systems during the dot-com bubble peak. On the contrary, thanks to the positives, Nvidia stock has more upside left, which certainly makes it a compelling buy for razor-sharp investors. Nvidia currently has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nNvidia's expected earnings growth rate for the current and next year is 58.9% and 15.6%, respectively. Its estimated revenue growth rate for the current and next year is 52.5% and 15.5%, respectively. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for Nvidia's current-year earnings has moved up 3.7% over the past 60 days.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia has a high net profit margin since the company has been able to generate enough income from sales and has successfully kept operational costs under control. Nvidia's net profit margin is a superb 48.9%, a tell-tale sign that its shares should move northward.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "What's in Store for These Top 5 Skyrocketing U.S. Giants?",
        "content": "Wall Street has continued its dream run in 2024 after an astonishing performance in 2023. Year to date, the three major stock indexes — the Dow, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite — have advanced 3.7%, 7.3% and 8.3%.\n\nThe primary reasons for this year’s northward journey so far, are expectations of interest rate cut by the Fed to a good extent, better-than-expected fourth-quarter 2023 earnings results and massive growth of generative artificial intelligence (AI) worldwide.\n\nConsequently, several stocks have rallied year to date even after skyrocketing in 2023. A handful of these stocks are U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $100 billion). Needless to say, these companies have a very strong business model, globally acclaimed brand recognition and a solid financial position.\n\nMost importantly, a handful of these stocks currently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here. Their current Zacks Rank indicates robust upside potential in the near future after a blockbuster performance in the past year.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have selected five such U.S. super giants with a Zacks Rank #1. These stocks have strong earnings growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA reported blockbuster fourth-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings. The strong results of NVIDIA in the recently reported quarter confirm this trend. Quarterly adjusted earnings of $5.16 per share, surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $4.55 and exceeded the year-ago period earnings of $0.88.\n\nNVIDIA posted revenues of $22.1 billion for the quarter, outpacing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3%. This compares favorably with the year-ago revenues of $6.1 billion. NVIDIA reported these robust financial numbers despite a stiff decline in its business in the key market of China. The U.S. government has banned exports of high-end AI-based NVIDIA chips in China for security reasons.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is most important is the guidance issued by management. Even after executing this tremendous success, management provided a rosy revenue guidance of $24 billion for the current quarter, an appreciation of 233.8% year over year.\n\nThe stock price of NVIDIA has soared 235.4% in the past year and 59.2% year to date. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 61.9% and 63.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.1% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid its growth. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms reported fourth-quarter 2023 earnings of $5.33 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 10.35%. The company reported earnings of $1.76 per share in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $40.11 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.87% and jumped 24.7% year over year. META expects total revenues between $34.5 billion and $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe stock price of Meta Platforms has jumped 185.5% in the past year and 36.8% year to date. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.7% and 33%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNetflix Inc. NFLX added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Netflix forecasts revenues of $9.24 billion, reflecting growth of 13.2% year over year or 12% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis. The company has projected earnings of $4.49 per share, suggesting growth of 55.9% year over year or 12% on a foreign-exchange neutral basis.\n\nThe stock price of Netflix has surged 80.6% in the past year and 19.9% year to date. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.3% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN has benefited from Prime and AWS momentum. The strengthening AWS services portfolio and its growing adoption rate contributed well to AWS performance. Ultrafast delivery services and an expanding content portfolio have been beneficial. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers also favored the company. Moreover, AMZN’s robust advertising business contributed well.\n\nNotably, improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home product offerings continues to act as a tailwind. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are the other catalysts. Also, deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus.\n\nAmazon.com delivered fourth-quarter 2023 adjusted earnings of $1.01 per share, topping the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 24.7%. Net sales of $169.96 billion rose 14% year over year. The figure exceeded management’s guided range of $160-$167 billion and surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $166.26 billion. For first-quarter 2024, AMZN expects net sales between $138 billion and $143.5 billion. Net sales are expected to grow 8-13% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\n\nThe stock price of Amazon.com has climbed 86.6% in the past year and 15.2% year to date. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.5% and 40%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.7% over the last seven days.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. PGR continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance, augurs well for PGR’s growth.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nPGR’s fourth-quarter 2023 earnings per share of $2.96 beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.38. The bottom line improved 97.3% year over year. Operating revenues of $16.6 billion beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 3% and increased 23.2% year over year.\n\nThe stock price of The Progressive has rallied 35% in the past year and 20.1% year to date. It has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 15.5% and 45.3%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Walmart Became the Newest Stock-Split Stock Today, and These 3 High-Flying Stocks Appear Primed for Splits of Their Own",
        "content": "Today marks a new era for the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Not only is the nearly 128-year-old index undergoing only its 52nd change with the addition of online retailer Amazon and the removal of pharmacy chain Walgreens Boots Alliance, but the Dow's divisor (the figure that helps convert share price into Dow points) is changing due to Walmart's (NYSE: WMT) 3-for-1 stock split.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event which allows a publicly traded company to alter its share price and outstanding share count by the same magnitude. The important thing to note with stock splits is that they're purely cosmetic and have no impact on a company's market cap or operating performance. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForward-stock splits make a company's share price more nominally affordable for everyday investors, which can be particularly helpful for those without access to fractional-share purchases. Meanwhile, reverse-stock splits are designed to increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major stock exchange.\n\nWalmart becomes Wall Street's newest stock-split stock\n\nToday, Monday, Feb. 26, Walmart enacted its 3-for-1 forward-stock split, which was first announced on January 30. Walmart CEO and president Doug McMillon noted the reasoning behind the split is to encourage employees to take part in Walmart's Associate Stock Purchase Plan. Said McMillon:\n\nSam Walton believed it was important to keep our share price in a range where purchasing whole shares, rather than fractions, was accessible to all of our associates. Given our growth and our plans for the future, we felt it was a good time to split the stock and encourage our associates to participate in the years to come.\n\nWalmart has been a prime beneficiary of an above-average inflation rate over the past two years. Walmart's deep pockets and ability to buy products in large quantities gives it a cost and product breadth advantage that mom-and-pop shops simply can't match. With consumers eager for a good deal, Walmart continues to draw in shoppers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart joins the select group of less than a dozen high-profile companies to have conducted a forward-stock split since the midpoint of 2021. It won't, however, be the last widely owned or high-flying public company to declare a split. What follows are three outperformers that are likeliest to follow in Walmart's footsteps and become the next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first logical candidate to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock after Walmart is none other than social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta hasn't split its stock since going public in 2012, and its share price neared $490 less than two weeks ago.\n\nMeta's long-term success is a function of three factors. To start with, the company's social media real estate is unrivaled. It's the parent company of Facebook, the most-visited social site globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, Meta's family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter. Having access to this many eyeballs is an advertisers' dream, which is why Meta often commands significant ad-pricing power.\n\nSecondly, investors are enamored with the company's potential beyond advertising, which includes augmented and virtual reality devices, becoming an on-ramp to the metaverse, and its various artificial intelligence (AI) applications. Even though advertising makes up nearly 98% of Meta's total sales, the growth potential and addressable market for the metaverse and AI is mouthwatering.\n\nThe third catalyst for Meta has always been its pristine balance sheet. For example, the company closed out 2023 with $65.4 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and it generated $71.1 billion in net cash from operating activities last year alone. It has the luxury to take chances on the innovation front that few other tech-driven companies can match.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill\n\nA second high-flying stock that appears primed for a stock split of its own is fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG). Since its initial public offering in early 2006 at $22 per share, Chipotle stock has rocketed to as much a $2,725 per share, as of roughly three weeks ago. Its sky-high share price is certainly a deterrent to investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nChipotle's recipe for success has long revolved around the quality of its food and its innovation. The company tends to rely on locally sourced foods and vegetables, and has pledged to use only responsibly sourced meats. What Chipotle's management team has found is that consumers are willing to pay more if they're given healthier food choices. As a result, Chipotle hasn't been pinched by inflationary pressures.\n\nTo add to the above, the company has kept its menu reasonably small, which has two advantages. First, a smaller menu allows its employees to efficiently prepare meals and move lines quickly. Secondly, keeping the menu compact helps new product introductions pack more punch.\n\nBut innovation is, arguably, the real secret sauce of late. in 2018, the company introduced the \"Chipotlane,\" which is a drive-thru lane devoted to digital-order pickup. This further sped up the ordering process and improved operating efficiency, which is a key reason Chipotle's bottom line continues to grow by double digits each year.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third highflier that looks poised to follow in Walmart's footsteps and join an exclusive club of stock-split stocks is semiconductor company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Prior to Avago acquiring Broadcom in 2016 and keeping the company's name, the original Broadcom had split its stock three times. Avago, however, never conducted a stock split. A single share of Broadcom set investors back by as much as $1,295 earlier this month.\n\nSince the start of 2023, Broadcom's vast outperformance of the broader market has to do with its ties to the AI revolution. In April, the company introduced Jericho3-AI, which is designed to scale connectivity to as many as 32,000 graphics processing units in high-compute data centers. With businesses practically tripping over themselves to build out AI-accelerated data centers in order to take advantage of AI solutions, Broadcom's traditionally steady growth has turned into outsized sales growth.\n\nHowever, Broadcom still generates a substantial portion of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories designed for next-generation smartphones. The move to 5G has encouraged a steady replacement cycle for smartphones and other wireless devices, which has proven to be a boon to its bottom line.\n\nThe other important factor for Broadcom is that, while tech stocks are usually cyclical, it has a presumably healthy backlog. As of July 2022, Broadcom had $31 billion in backlogged orders. Despite CEO Hock Tan not providing a recent update on the company's backlog, the flurry of order activity surrounding AI, as a whole, suggests it remains robust. A healthy backlog means dependable and predictable operating cash flow year after year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

Its 720 lawmakers, together with EU governments, pass new EU policies and laws.\n\n\"As the election approaches, we'll activate an Elections Operations Center to identify potential threats and put mitigations in place in real time,\" Marco Pancini, Meta's head of EU affairs, said in a blogpost.\n\nHe said experts from the company's intelligence, data science, engineering, research, operations, content policy and legal teams will focus on combating misinformation, tackling influence operations and counter the risks related to the abuse of generative AI.\n\nMeta, which currently works with 26 independent fact-checking organisations across the European Union covering 22 languages, will add three new partners in Bulgaria, France, and Slovakia, Pancini said.\n\nMeta, Microsoft, OpenAI and 17 other tech companies earlier this month agreed to work together to prevent deceptive artificial-intelligence content from interfering with elections across the globe this year.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee, Editing by Louise Heavens)",

They’ll discuss the company’s Quest virtual-reality headsets and its large language model Llama, one of its efforts to compete with OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nOn Wednesday, Zuckerberg plans to travel to Seoul to meet with partners, the spokesperson said, declining to elaborate further. He is tentatively scheduled to meet with South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol, according to a person familiar with the matter who asked not to be named because the details are private. He’ll also meet Samsung Electronics Co. Chairman Jay Y. Lee to discuss cooperation in AI and LG Electronics Inc.’s CEO to talk about joint development of an extended reality headset, according to local media reports.\n\n“Mark is in Japan for a personal trip and will also meet with a few key partners while he is here,” the spokesperson said. “As it’s been reported, Mark is planning to visit Korea briefly for a few key partner meetings.”\n\nSamsung officials declined to comment. LG Electronics officials weren’t immediately available for comment.\n\nMeta and Samsung have collaborated on virtual-reality headsets in the past, with Zuckerberg appearing as a special guest at the Korean company’s Unpacked event in 2016 to talk about Gear VR.

In an Instagram Reels post last month, Zuckerberg said the company’s future roadmap for AI requires it to build a “massive compute infrastructure.” By the end of 2024, he said that infrastructure will include 350,000 H100 chips from Nvidia Corp.\n\nZuckerberg and others have talked about aspirations for building artificial general intelligence, or AI as smart as the average human being, despite concerns about the future dangers of AGI for mankind. Samsung, for its part, has reportedly set up a new semiconductor R&D unit called the “AGI Computing Lab” in Silicon Valley to develop the next generation of chips.\n\nAfter Seoul, Zuckerberg plans to travel to Jamnagar, Gujarat in western India to attend the pre-wedding celebrations of billionaire Mukesh Ambani’s youngest son, Anant Ambani. The three-day festivities, which will start on March 1, will draw celebrities in business, technology and entertainment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe High Cost of Eating Out in America Why Elon Musk Bought Twitter in the First Place Can the Masters of Hipster Cringe Conquer Hollywood With Wall Street Cash?

        "content": "The biggest record labels in music are trying to figure out how to grapple with the rise of AI.\n\nWhen Universal Music Group (UMG) pulled its songs from TikTok on Feb. 1 partly because of a concern artists weren’t being protected from artificial intelligence, it triggered a debate across the industry about whether to embrace the new technology, fight it, or both.\n\nTikTok is \"allowing the platform to be flooded with AI-generated recordings\" while demanding contractual rights that could \"massively dilute the royalty pool for human artists,\" Universal said in a letter announcing its decision. Lucian Grainge, CEO of Universal Music Group, which pulled its songs from TikTok this month. (Kevork Djansezian/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nUniversal’s biggest rivals, Warner Music (WMG) and Sony (SONY), have stayed on the sidelines of this dispute so far. This month Warner CEO Robert Kyncl called his company’s own licensing deal with TikTok \"difficult\" but \"fair.\"\n\nInvestors will be listening for any updates on the TikTok feud Wednesday when Universal is scheduled to report its earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nHow this debate unfolds will have sizable implications for the giants of music as the companies behind artists from Taylor Swift to Drake wrestle with the same AI dilemma currently roiling other creative industries. Taylor Swift is among the artists not currently available on TikTok. (Don Arnold/TAS24 for TAS Rights Management) (Don Arnold/TAS24 via Getty Images)\n\nMusic artists are increasingly concerned there is little protection for their own name, likeness, and voice being used without their permission to create AI-generated songs.\n\nSome have already had their voices mimicked without their permission, while deceased artists have also had their voices reproduced without the involvement of their families.\n\n\"I don’t have to tell you how much of a gut punch it is to have your name, likeness, or voice ripped from you and used in ways you could never imagine and would never allow,\" country singer Lainey Wilson said at a House Judiciary subcommittee field hearing on Feb. 2.\n\n\"It’s wrong.\"\n\n'Ethical and not harmful'\n\nWilson aired her concerns in Los Angeles as the industry prepared for its biggest night of the year: the Grammy awards.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"There aren’t many things that we can control in life, but making decisions about the use of our own selves, our own unique qualities, that should be one,\" she told lawmakers who gathered across the street from the arena where Wilson would win the Best Country Album award two days later. Lainey Wilson poses with the Best Country Album award during the 66th Annual Grammy Awards in Los Angeles earlier this month. (David Swanson/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe singer endorsed an effort underway in Washington to address some of her concerns. Last month lawmakers introduced a new House bill called the No Artificial Intelligence Fake Replicas and Unauthorized Duplications Act — or or the No AI FRAUD Act — that aims to establish a framework for protecting one’s voice and likeness on a federal level.\n\n\"Are we in fact rewarding the creators of intellectual property sufficiently?\" Rep. Darrell Issa (R-Calif.), who chairs the House Subcommittee on Courts, Intellectual Property, and the Internet, said at the hearing. Representative Darrell Issa (R-Calif.). (Ting Shen/Pool via REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\n\"Under AI, it is critical that the development of the technology be ethical and not harmful and that it also be uniform within the United States.\"\n\nThe man in charge of the Grammys, Recording Academy chief executive Harvey Mason Jr., called the proposed legislation \"long overdue\" while also acknowledging the opportunities AI presents for the industry.\n\n\"The productivity that comes along with using this technology, creating things we haven't heard or thought of before and extending the reach of an artist with their voice, is possible,\" Mason told Yahoo Finance in a separate interview. \"[But,] regulations, legislation needs to happen to make sure human creators are protected.\" Harvey Mason Jr., CEO of The Recording Academy. (Steve Marcus / REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nMalik Yusef, a music producer and director who has worked with Kanye West and Jennifer Hudson, said he thinks the legislation has holes in it and needs to be fortified. When AI versions of an artist’s voice or likeness are created, a copyright should automatically be granted to the artist, he said.\n\n\"It should be owned by the artist and they should be able to wield it as much or as little as they want,\" he said.\n\n'It wasn't easy with TikTok'\n\nSo far Universal is standing alone in its fight with TikTok, which has pushed back by calling the label's move \"sad and disappointing\" and claiming it had \"artist-first\" pacts with Universal's rivals.\n\nThe CEO of Warner Music said he is confident that Universal and TikTok will sort things out.\n\n\"It wasn’t easy with TikTok,\" Kyncl said on the company’s most recent earnings call, referring to his own pact with the platform. Warner Music CEO Robert Kyncl. (David Livingston/Getty Images) (David Livingston via Getty Images)\n\n\"I think it was very difficult, too. But we got there. And for us, it was fair. But it was a year ago. It was also a different time. So I don’t know what is driving Universal’s positions. But there’s any way we can help them, we will, all of us.\"\n\nIf all labels pulled their music off TikTok they could take the power back, according to Printz Board, producer and songwriter for the Black Eyed Peas who now owns music and movie production company Beets & Produce.\n\n\"If you can get Sony, Warner Brothers, Atlantic, all these labels to start doing that and say, OK, we're going to take this back, take the power into our own hands, I think we would really be in a better place,\" he said. Printz Board at a Grammy party earlier this month. (Christopher Polk/Billboard via Getty Images) (Christopher Polk via Getty Images)\n\nBoard, however, is not worried about being put out of work by AI.\n\n\"Maybe I'm of the minority, but I also feel because I'm a creative, creatives have an infinite bank of ideas and will never actually be broke,\" he said. \"If you want to take my song and make it into an AI song, I'm going to redo a new song with your sample of my song. That's where it can be good.\"\n\nOther industry figures argue it could be a supplemental tool for songwriting.\n\n\"At this point, we have to accept that AI is coming, AI is going to change our industry,\" said Justin Tranter, founder of record label Facet House and a Grammy-nominated songwriter behind songs from Justin Bieber and Miley Cyrus.

        "title": "Stock Split Watch: Is Meta Platforms Next?",
        "content": "In recent years, stock splits have become increasingly frequent on Wall Street, with companies such as Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla joining the trend. While stock splits may not drastically alter a company's valuation, they can serve a purpose, including enticing more individual investors to buy shares at a lower price.\n\nOne tech company that hasn't participated so far is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), known for Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. But with its shares trading near an all-time high, it could potentially benefit from a split. Let's explore further.\n\nWhat's a stock split?\n\nA stock split is when a company increases the number of its outstanding shares while maintaining its market capitalization. This means that each existing shareholder receives more shares, but the total value of their investment remains unchanged.\n\nTo illustrate, let's say you're an investor holding 10 shares of a company valued at $100 each. If the company decides to execute a 2-for-1 stock split, your holdings would double to 20 shares, and the share price would halve to $50 each. It's important to underscore that a stock split doesn't alter the fundamental worth of your investment; instead, it adjusts the number of shares you possess. In this example, your investment was worth $1,000 before and after the stock split.\n\nWhy would a company split its stock?\n\nWhen a company's stock, such as Meta Platforms, commands a high trading price, it may present a barrier to entry for certain investors. While fractional shares are readily accessible through many brokerage platforms, notable exceptions like Vanguard do not offer this option. In theory, a lower share price could enhance accessibility, potentially boosting demand for the company's shares and thereby increasing its market capitalization.\n\nTesla CEO Elon Musk has previously argued that a lower stock price helps a company's ability to both attract and retain talent, whether through equity compensation packages or employee stock purchase plans.\n\nStory continues\n\nA company's eligibility for inclusion in a price-weighted index -- such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is determined from an average of the share prices of all the companies -- can also be impeded by a higher stock price. As a result, stocks with higher prices, such as Meta, face a lower likelihood of being added, since their share prices could disproportionately skew the index.\n\nMeta has never split its stock before\n\nMeta Platforms has never split its stock since going public in early 2012 at $38 per share. For investors who have held on to their shares since then, the stock has delivered an impressive return of 1,133%, surpassing the benchmark S&P 500's total return of approximately 379%.\n\nNotably, Mark Zuckerberg, the founder and CEO of Meta, had a plan to split Facebook's stock in 2016. This involved creating a new class of shares without voting rights for the general public, which would have enabled Zuckerberg to maintain control of the company while selling his shares to finance his charitable initiatives.\n\nZuckerberg withdrew that proposal in September 2017, noting that \"Facebook's business has performed well and the value of our stock has grown to the point that I can fully fund our philanthropy and retain voting control of Facebook for 20 years or more.\"\n\nIs Meta Platforms a buy ahead of a potential stock split?\n\nInvesting in a company solely because of the potential for a stock split is usually not recommended. The company's financial performance has a far more significant effect on its long-term stock performance. Therefore, it's more important to assess Meta's recent business performance and consider the guidance provided by its management when it comes to making an investing decision.\n\nIn 2023, which Zuckerberg deemed the \"year of efficiency,\" Meta generated $134.9 billion in revenue and $39 billion in net income, marking a year-over-year increase of 16% and 69%, respectively.\n\nLooking ahead, management provided revenue guidance in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the first quarter of 2024, representing a year-over-year increase between 21% and 29%. While management didn't offer an earnings outlook, it did note that its total expenses for 2024 are expected to be between $94 billion and $99 billion, reflecting a potential increase of between 6.6% and 12.2% from $88.2 billion in 2023.\n\nBeyond its recent financial results and management's guidance, Meta's strong balance sheet with net cash (cash and cash equivalents minus total debt) of $47 billion allows the company to return capital to shareholders. In 2023, Meta spent $20 billion on share repurchases, lowering its outstanding shares by 2%. The company still had $31 billion remaining on its share repurchasing program as of Dec. 31, 2023. Additionally, the tech company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.4%.\n\nOne concern for Meta is how much money it spends on its Reality Labs division, the company's virtual reality and augmented reality hardware and software unit. In 2023, Reality Labs was responsible for an astounding $16.1 billion loss from operations, which was 17.5% worse than in 2023. Moreover, Meta expects those losses to \"increase meaningfully\" in 2024.\n\nInvestors will have to wait and see whether Meta's big bet on Reality Labs pays off. In the meantime, Meta is producing strong revenue and earnings growth while returning capital to shareholders. Given its position as a leader in social networking, growth investors would be wise to consider it for their portfolios -- stock split or not.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Just Begging for a Stock-Split",
        "content": "Enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) helped launch a new bull market after bottoming in the fall of 2022. Some of Wall Street's biggest runners have multiplied in value, trading as high as $1,000 per share today.\n\nThat means that investors may want to start looking for potential stock splits. Investors generally favor stock splits, and for good reason. It makes accumulating shares of a company far more manageable. But it's important to know what a split does and doesn't do.\n\nHere is what you need to know. Plus, here are three prime AI stock-split candidates to watch.\n\nWhat stock splits do -- and don't do\n\nAs you may already know, a stock split lowers a company's share price. It does this by proportionately increasing the number of outstanding shares. For example, suppose you have stock XYZ that trades at $100 per share. Splitting the stock 5:1 would mean that each $100 share would turn into five $20 shares.\n\nCompanies split their stock for varied reasons, but it's generally because they perceive that investors generally like lower share prices. It can break through some investors' \"psychological barrier\" to buying shares above a certain price range. Announcing a split also has a propensity to draw investors' attention to a company's stock. Additionally, employees with stock-based compensation can manage their equity more easily and employers can arrange for stock-based compensation easier when share prices are lower. It's easier to divvy up 100 pennies than a single dollar bill.\n\nWhat stock splits don't do is change the business's intrinsic value. Always remember that the additional shares offset the lower price you see. In other words, a pie doesn't get any bigger whether you cut it four ways, eight ways, or 16 ways. The slices change size, but the overall pie remains the same.\n\nSo, which companies might split their stocks next? These three artificial intelligence (AI) stocks are ripe for a split after going on epic runs.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nModular server company Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has seen its business take off in recent quarters. Companies investing in AI are seeking out SMCI's turnkey computing systems. The company's revenue more than doubled year over year in the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024, and management guided up to 219% year-over-year growth next quarter.\n\nSupermicro, as it is also known, started with motherboards in the early 1990s and evolved as computers and servers advanced. The business went public in 2007 and has never split its stock. However, the stock's remarkable recent performance has shares hovering near $1,000. That's nearly a 3,000% gain over the past three years. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company has paid stock-based compensation over the years, and some employees sitting on years-old equity may appreciate a stock split that helps them manage their newly found wealth. Additionally, the stock has become a big pill to swallow for individual investors who may not want to drop $1,000 to own one share of the company. A stock split makes a ton of sense here.\n\n2. ASML\n\nPhotolithography equipment manufacturer ASML(NASDAQ: ASML) is another stock that's enjoyed a magnificent run over the past few years. The company designs and sells equipment that uses ultraviolet light to print complex circuitry onto silicon wafers. The most advanced semiconductors, like those used to power the latest AI models, need specialized extreme ultraviolet light machines, and ASML is the only company that makes them.\n\nThat helps explain why ASML's stock has done so well. ASML has split its stock multiple times before, so management has shown it's willing to do so. However, it's been a while. The last split occurred before 2015, and the stock has appreciated enormously since. ASML Chart\n\nAnalysts expect the business to grow earnings by an average of 20% annually over the next three to five years. Barring a sudden drop in the stock's valuation, ASML could eventually trade at over $1,000 per share. Most stocks on U.S. exchanges trade under $1,000 per share, making it more plausible that a stock split could happen in the next few years.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nSocial media giant and AI innovator Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) didn't seem like a stock-split candidate a year ago. The company struggled with privacy changes to iOS devices and was criticized for aggressive spending. The stock bottomed in late 2022 at roughly $90 per share.\n\nBut, as good CEOs do, Mark Zuckerberg adapted. Spending cuts and new AI-based advertising technology have sent the stock to nearly $500. Meta Platforms has never split its stock, but the company didn't go public until 2012. The conversation about a stock split seems more appropriate than ever, with shares at all-time highs. META Chart\n\nMeta's core business, growing its social media audience and advertising, is still performing well. The company's family of apps reached 3.98 billion monthly active users in 2023, a 6% increase over last year. Analysts see Meta's earnings compounding at 20% annually for the next several years, adding more fuel to the odds that investors see a stock split occur.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nGetting old sucks, and I don't like it one bit.\n\nMy hair is thinning. I don't wake up at 1:45 a.m. each day with the same fiery energy to obsess over markets and stocks. I am down to eating red meat three times a month \"just because\" it's what people have told me is the right thing to do at this point in life.\n\nFrom what I can tell, one of the only positives of getting old is experience.\n\nAnd my experience in analyzing and reporting on markets and leaders for more than a decade tells me that investors have become fully engulfed in an AI-fueled tech bubble.\n\nTo be fair, this feels like a much different bubble than the cannabis and crypto stock bubbles of years gone by, as tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Microsoft (MSFT) have real money-minting business models. Their leaders also aren't inexperienced dopes (see the cryptosphere's bad actors of the last two years).\n\nBut make no mistake: We are in a bubble, and it could end badly at some point.\n\nHere are some of the elements I see to support this view.\n\nEverything rallies, but should it?\n\nNvidia shares ripped 15% higher last Thursday after earnings. The report sent the broader market ripping higher too.\n\nNvidia rivals AMD (AMD) and Arm (ARM) saw strong bids. New hot Yahoo Finance ticker Super Micro Computer (SMCI) exploded by 36%. Even Intel (INTC) caught some Nvidia tailwinds. And shares of Meta (META), which has been out in front in buying Nvidia chips, shot higher as well.\n\nDoesn't this all look insane and feel akin to blind buying by FOMO traders?\n\nIn a normal functioning market, Nvidia doing amazingly is bad news for competitors such as AMD and Intel. Nvidia is selling more of its chips, meaning fewer sales opportunities for rivals. Shouldn't their stocks drop?\n\nStory continues\n\nJust because Meta owns and uses some new Nvidia chips, how is that going to positively impact its earnings and cash flow over the next four quarters? Will it at all?\n\nThe point is that investors are acting irrationally as Nvidia serves up eye-popping financial figures and the hype machine descends on social media. It makes sense until it doesn't, and that is classic bubble action.\n\nJustifying inflated valuations\n\nStill not convinced this is an AI-fueled tech bubble?\n\nThen cast your eyes on the typical Wall Street action of justifying ever-higher valuation multiples on stocks. Tech price-to-earnings multiples are rich. Is this the making of an AI-fueled bubble?\n\n\"At 29x our calendar year 2024 estimated [earnings per share], Nvidia trades at a lower multiple vs. peers Intel and AMD,\" one analyst wrote in a note following the Nvidia earnings stampede. \"We view the valuation as compelling. Nvidia remains a top pick.\"\n\nI am not saying Nvidia shouldn't be valued at a premium to the market — not saying that at all, so don't shred me via email.\n\nWhat I am asking you to do is to deconstruct the above commentary, which is creeping more and more into tech coverage.\n\nThe analyst, in this case, has rationalized that 1) high price multiples for slower growers Intel and AMD are OK because AI is so hot, or so it seems, and 2) Nvidia's stock deserves to trade at about a 33% premium to an already rich P/E multiple on the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia's valuation isn't mind-blowingly compelling considering earnings estimates have been jacked up to the ceiling! This is a priced-for-absolute-perfection tech stock.\n\nBut hey, inside a tech bubble, anything goes, right?\n\nThinking you can't be stopped\n\nNothing says \"investing bubble\" like unbridled confidence. It's that feeling that whatever stock you buy — at whatever price and at whatever time — will only go up forever. This makes you feel like an investing genius and inclined to take on more risk.\n\nHere's a dose of insight that shows a ton of overconfidence sweeping through markets.\n\nTraders’ confidence in their own decision making, consistent with bullishness, just hit the highest level since Charles Schwab began its Trader Sentiment survey, the financial services firm said this week. From a sector perspective, traders are most bullish on information technology (shocker). They are very upbeat on AI stocks in particular (shocker).\n\nNews flash: You aren't an investing genius. The best thing you can do right now to grow your wealth is realize it's time to lay the groundwork to begin protecting your wealth that has been created by the tech bubble.\n\nLean on your investing experience and all its wrinkles.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best major stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and some recent trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nThe start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand.\n\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends.\n\nThis is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history. Quite a sharp turnaround from the tail end of 2022 had seen speculation far and wide that a recession was incoming and that everyone should batten down their hatches.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like 2023 saw the NASDAQ 100 soar to new highs on the back of major stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 2024's record setting index levels are also influenced by such companies. The start of the year ushered in all important earnings season that saw major stocks the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) take the lead on the artificial intelligence front. A.I. was the biggest theme on the stock market last year, and the mega stock earnings calls saw their management share strategies about costs, future plans, and other data that investors parsed over with eagle eyes to see whether the hype in A.I. is really worth investing in.\n\nAnd as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor.\n\nBefore we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.\n\nSo, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in? We took a look and some notable picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best major stocks to buy, we made a list of the common top constituents of the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ 100 index and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen as the best major stocks to buy.\n\nFor these best major stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\n13. Intuit Inc.

        "title": "11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no stop in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.\n\nOther than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.\n\nAI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.\n\nIn addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:\n\n“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.\n\nAs we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEffects of AI on Labor\n\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.\n\nFor emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.\n\nWe also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\n11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $196.65\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.\n\n34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $206.15\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.\n\nOn February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a GAAP EPS of $2.18, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.07. The revenue jumped 2.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $119.6 billion, topping the estimates by $1.34 billion.\n\nMairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”\n\n9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $164.59\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 214\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.\n\nFirst Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”\n\n8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $469.58\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.\n\nOn February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.\n\nOn February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.\n\nWe also believe that Microsoft is one of the best competitively positioned large-cap companies with its vertically integrated software stack (infrastructure + applications), while the inflection in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and GenAI represents potentially the biggest addressable market expansion for the company in recent history. We also view Microsoft’s competitive positioning in AI as advantaged thanks to both the fact that it does not face an innovators dilemma in its core business (as compared with Alphabet’s core search business, which could potentially be at risk due to GenAI). Microsoft also has a tight partnership with OpenAI, has a large proprietary data asset built over time, and has a go-to-market advantage through a vast and robust partner ecosystem and its significant installed base and product bundling opportunities. These should enable it to cross-sell its existing user base as AI becomes embedded into current and new products…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $122.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\n\nSynaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.\n\nOn February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a  non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.\n\nTimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”\n\n6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $653.43\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 105 hedge funds owned a stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s stock. Fisher Asset Management was the most significant stakeholder in the company, with 4.56 million shares worth $2.72 billion, representing 1.33% of the portfolio.\n\nOut of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nRekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nPolen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Best Japanese Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Invest In 15 Best Family Vacations on a Budget for $5000\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 25 countries with the highest employment rates in the world. We have also discussed the global economic landscape. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World.\n\nAccording to the International Labour Organization’s World Employment and Social Outlook Trends 2024 report, just over 5% of the global workforce is currently unemployed. While this figure represents an improvement compared to the pre-pandemic era, the outlook remains uncertain, with an anticipated additional two million individuals expected to seek employment within the next year. Concurrently, the global economy faces its slowest growth period in three decades, as indicated by a recent World Bank report.\n\nNotably, the disparity in economic circumstances persists between higher and lower income countries, with joblessness rates significantly higher in poorer nations. Despite efforts to address challenges such as inflation and informal employment, income inequality continues to widen, posing obstacles to achieving sustained economic recovery and social justice, according to ILO Director-General Gilbert Houngbo.\n\nSpeaking of recovery, in 2022 and early 2023, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) experienced major layoffs, affecting tens of thousands of employees. The company seemed to be transitioning into a period of austerity, marked by reduced teams, tighter budgets, and fewer perks. However, within a few months,  Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s trajectory took a sharp turn as it announced plans for robust hiring in 2024.\n\nDespite the recent layoffs,  Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) anticipates sizable growth in its workforce and payroll expenses to support priority areas, particularly focusing on higher-cost technical roles. Additionally,  Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) aims to invest heavily in groundbreaking tech initiatives, such as the development of the \"metaverse,\" which includes augmented and virtual reality ecosystems.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)’s reversal in hiring strategy reflects a broader trend among tech giants. Companies like Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), after huge layoffs, are now embarking on large-scale rehiring endeavors, particularly in critical divisions such as engineering and data cloud. This resurgence in hiring confirms the demand for tech professionals with sought-after skills, even amidst economic fluctuations.\n\nWith an aim to increase the competitiveness and employability of the youth, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)’s $5 million Pathways to Readiness and Empowerment Program (PREP) has entered its third year, targeting the growth of career opportunities for over 3,000 youth from Chicago's South and West Sides. Since its inception in 2021, PREP has impacted over 2,200 young individuals, offering career exposure, paid internships, credentialing, and full-time employment opportunities. This year, PepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)’s reaffirms its commitment by awarding $250,000 to various local nonprofits, including Imagine Englewood if, Girls in the Game, and Southwest Organizing Project, among others.\n\nOne notable partnership is with Ladies of Virtue (LOV), which empowers girls in underserved areas, with a 100% college acceptance rate among its high school seniors. PepsiCo, Inc (NASDAQ:PEP) collaborated with LOV, providing funding for STEM-focused internships and career exploration experiences. Additionally, the Southwest Organizing Project (SWOP) has started a workforce program that aims to enroll 100 community members annually, projecting an annual income gain of $4 million reinvested into the community.\n\nPepsiCo Inc (NASDAQ:PEP)’ 2024 National Hiring Day initiative also seeks to promote its Canadian workforce by recruiting over 800 individuals. Positions range from Warehouse Workers to sales representatives, dispersed across cities such as Calgary, Vancouver, Montreal, and Ottawa. Successful applicants stand to earn up to $15,000, making it a potentially lucrative opportunity.\n\nDespite training initiatives around the globe, AI is set to revolutionize the global economy, with nearly 40% of jobs worldwide facing its impact, either through replacement or augmentation. While advanced economies stand to benefit from AI's integration, they also face heightened risks, with approximately 60% of their jobs vulnerable. In contrast, emerging markets and low-income countries face fewer immediate disruptions but lack the infrastructure and skilled workforce to fully capitalize on AI's potential.\n\nThe advent of AI introduces the potential for increased income and wealth inequality within countries. Those able to harness AI may see an increase in productivity and wages, leaving others behind. Without proactive policies to address these disparities, AI could exacerbate existing social tensions. To mitigate these risks, comprehensive social safety nets and retraining programs are essential to ensure a more inclusive transition to an AI-driven world. 25 Countries with the Highest Employment Rates in the World\n\nA headshot collage of employees indicating the company's diversity and innovation.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the countries with the highest employment rates in the world, we relied on OECD’s Employment Rates (Total, % of working age population). In order to utilize the latest available information, we relied on OECD’s employment dataset from Q3 of 2023.

It is one of the countries with the highest minimum wage in the world.\n\n16. Finland\n\nEmployment Rate in Q3 2023: 73.86\n\nWhile the country is one of the countries with the highest employment rates, Finland faces a mounting worker shortage in crucial sectors like healthcare and construction, prompting a proactive approach in recruiting skilled professionals globally.

Austria\n\nEmployment Rate in Q3 2023: 74.00\n\nWhile it is one of the countries with highest employment rates, Austria still plans to attract over 15,000 skilled workers annually from non-EU countries by 2027 through the Red-White-Red Card system.

So here with more, we've got Nancy Tengler who is the CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments. Also here, we've got Steven Glass, Pella Funds Management Managing Director and Investment Analyst. Great to have you both here with us today.\n\nNancy, I want to begin with you because you are looking specifically at one of the best positioned companies. We'll start with the good. Then we'll get to the bad.\n\nBest position here, Amazon. Make the case for why Amazon even up against Meta and NVIDIA is the outperformer.\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Well, it's a game of relative performance from here. I think, I mean, clearly, NVIDIA is the winner. And will continue to win, I believe.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Amazon has yet to hit-- to retest its highs. And it's a company that has done improved efficiency, growing the advertising business. Cloud came in better than expected.\n\nAnd you have a CEO who is committed to taking the company to the next level. And so we think from here, you'll get really solid performance out of Amazon. And so we've moved it into our 12 best ideas portfolio and continue to hold it across our large cap equity strategies.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steve, I'm going to ask the same question to you in terms of who is best positioned. It looks like you think NVIDIA is. What do you see as the upside there just in terms of how much more gain is still in play?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, it's very difficult to actually have to have to force one to use their imagination. But the fact of the matter is this is a company on a 2% free cash flow yield, and it's only expected to grow 20% in 2015. So really its valuation fundamentals remain very strong. And it can continue growing here.\n\nI mean, Jensen Huang was commented on the size of the opportunity. It's bigger than everyone expected. It's a whole new industry. And it keeps on surprising. So in actual fact and royal valuation figures, it's actually one of the better positioned of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBRAD SMITH: All right, I want to get to one that, Nancy, you believe is worse position. And, Steve, I'm going to bring you in on this as well because I know you've got some commentary on their positioning.\n\nBut it's Google. It's Alphabet. Nancy, why is this the worst position to you?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: That's a great question, Brad. Because it should by its recent performance at least be teed up to outperform going forward. But they keep stumbling.\n\nSo this latest issue with the images, on Gemini is the second hiccup since they've announced generative AI. They are behind at least in the intellectual capturing war with Microsoft. And so I think you want to be dubious.\n\nUse weakness, maybe if you don't own the position to add to it or initiate it. But we are holding firm and not adding to our holdings. Because we think it's going to be a while before the company gets past these negative issues.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steven, do names that you see as worse position are Tesla and Apple? Tesla, I think, everyone can pretty much wrap their heads around just the fact that we've seen declining sales. The fact that margins have been under pressure. But why don't you see Apple turning it around anytime soon?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, the fact is that that's a fully penetrated market. I mean, obviously, we're depending on services now. And they are doing very well in services.\n\nBut they have to justify that market cap, they don't seem to have a large pipeline of new products coming through. And we're not suggesting for a moment that Apple is a bad business. It's just not growing, and it does not justify its valuation given its growth profile. One just has to accept that if they invest in Apple, they're going to get based on the current valuation and growth profile quite Meager returns.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What's going to unlock the next supercycle? Just to follow up on that, Steven.\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Supercycle for, which company?\n\nBRAD SMITH: For Apple. We often talk about an iPhone supercycle, whether or not generative AI is part of the smartphone or the handset is actually going to propel. A wave of new people to go trade in, trade up, and get whatever the new iPhone is. What from your perspective can drive it?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: That's unlikely. Because actually at the moment, the AI is happening in the cloud rather than at the edge. So it's not really a device, a personal device-driven market.\n\nAnd even if that was to happen, I mean, it's very well penetrated. So we're just swapping a current user for a new user. So then you've got to ask yourself, OK, can they expand their margins on the iPhone? Well, no.\n\nCan they grow more sales potentially? But then they've got the problems on the App Store. They rarely do in our view need to come out with a new product to justify their current valuation. They need some new growth vector.\n\nAnd we don't think it's going to be the headset. So it's based on what we can see right now. We can't see where that new growth vector is going to come from.\n\nAnd in actual fact, we actually think the App Store is at threat from this new-- from we see the regulation around the world, we see it in Europe, we've seen some in the US. And maybe it'll be more difficult for them to take their 30% cut on all app sales going forward.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Nancy, one of the names that we have not mentioned yet is Meta. And I bring that up given the outperformance that we saw last year. Given the fact that the stock is up just about nearly 190% over the past year.\n\nThey declared their first dividend last quarter on the earnings report. Obviously, lots of excitement there. Why isn't that one of your top names?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Yeah, well, we did own it, Seana. We owned it for many years. And we got out kind of in the high 300.\n\nAnd then we missed this last run. But we instead owned a name like Spotify in its place. And that's done extremely well also.\n\nI love the dividend. I think that there is an opportunity for Google potentially to announce a dividend. I mean, they certainly have enough free cash flow.\n\nBut I think Meta, for me, it's at this point, I'd rather jump into NVIDIA than into Meta because I think the model is not nearly as robust as NVIDIA's model is. And I would just point out that I think one of the things that's going to put a floor under all these stocks are share buybacks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven have announced about $190 billion in share buybacks. As the stock sell off, that the companies are going to step in and put a floor under it for investors.\n\nSo I think you can't go wrong owning any of them in my view. But I think our favorite right at this point is Amazon.\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Nancy and Steven, great to get your insight here, especially on names that we know so many of our viewers want to own, would like to own, or closely follow here when it comes to some of the trends that we're seeing in the broader market. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.",

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Could Easily Take On More Debt",
        "content": "Warren Buffett famously said, 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' It's only natural to consider a company's balance sheet when you examine how risky it is, since debt is often involved when a business collapses. We can see that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does use debt in its business. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhat Risk Does Debt Bring?\n\nGenerally speaking, debt only becomes a real problem when a company can't easily pay it off, either by raising capital or with its own cash flow. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. By replacing dilution, though, debt can be an extremely good tool for businesses that need capital to invest in growth at high rates of return. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat Is Meta Platforms's Net Debt?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of December 2023 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.92b, over one year. But it also has US$65.4b in cash to offset that, meaning it has US$47.0b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nA Look At Meta Platforms' Liabilities\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$32.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$44.5b due beyond that. Offsetting this, it had US$65.4b in cash and US$16.2b in receivables that were due within 12 months. So it can boast US$5.12b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So it's very unlikely that the US$1.23t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Succinctly put, Meta Platforms boasts net cash, so it's fair to say it does not have a heavy debt load!\n\nStory continues\n\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 46% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But ultimately the future profitability of the business will decide if Meta Platforms can strengthen its balance sheet over time. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Meta Platforms may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. During the last three years, Meta Platforms produced sturdy free cash flow equating to 79% of its EBIT, about what we'd expect. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile we empathize with investors who find debt concerning, you should keep in mind that Meta Platforms has net cash of US$47.0b, as well as more liquid assets than liabilities. And it impressed us with its EBIT growth of 46% over the last year. So we don't think Meta Platforms's use of debt is risky. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. However, not all investment risk resides within the balance sheet - far from it. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 46% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks -- but Made Some Big Changes During the Quarter",
        "content": "David Tepper has developed quite a following on Wall Street. The billionaire heads up Appaloosa Management -- the hedge fund he founded back in 1993. He has been called \"arguably the greatest hedge fund manager of his generation\" by Forbes magazine and has \"consistently outperformed his industry peers and the broader global markets since [Appaloosa's] inception,\" according to Carnegie Mellon University.\n\nThe results speak for themselves. Over the past three years, Appaloosa has outperformed the S&P 500 by nearly 17%, a remarkable accomplishment considering the macroeconomic downturn that plagued investors during 2022. Given his robust results, Tepper's stock picks might be worthy of additional review.\n\nAppaloosa's portfolio is heavily weighted toward artificial intelligence (AI) stocks, with just five companies representing more than 46% of the fund's holdings to close out the fourth quarter:\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): 11.6% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT): 11.3% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 10.6% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 6.9% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 5.7%\n\nKeep in mind that hedge funds only report their holdings at the end of each quarter, and while these five stocks combined are largely unchanged compared to the third quarter, there's been a big shakeup among the holdings. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms continues to be Tepper's top holding, largely unchanged since the prior quarter. The company's history of using AI to surface relevant content for users on its social media sites is well documented. Furthermore, as the world's second-largest digital advertising platform, Meta makes the lion's share of its revenue from targeted advertising -- which is more effective when assisted by AI.\n\nThe company isn't resting on its laurels, recently releasing a suite of AI-powered tools for its advertisers, designed to help better reach their desired audience. Furthermore, its LLaMA AI (Large Language Model Meta AI) has become one of the leading open-source AI models and can be found on each of the major cloud infrastructure platforms -- for a price.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta gained 172% last year, so even as Tepper decreased his share count by 5%, the stock -- as a percentage of his portfolio -- is virtually unchanged.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nRecognizing the vast opportunity ahead, Microsoft was quick off the blocks to integrate generative AI capabilities into its widely used workplace productivity tools and cloud infrastructure platform.\n\nMicrosoft's AI assistant, Copilot, is the standard-bearer for these innovations. Users are rushing to adopt Copilot thanks to its ability to increase user productivity. Several analysts have suggested that Copilot could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027. Perhaps as importantly, Copilot is having a halo effect on Microsoft's Azure, which outgrew its cloud infrastructure rivals in the fourth quarter. Furthermore, management credited 6 percentage points of that growth to increasing demand for AI.\n\nTepper was likely impressed by the company's strong move in AI and market share gains in the cloud. This gave him an incentive to increase his Microsoft share count by 4%, bringing it to 11.3% of his portfolio. It probably doesn't hurt that it's only selling at a slight premium to the overall market -- a bargain for potential growth of this magnitude.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon has a trifecta of successful businesses, including its industry-leading e-commerce and cloud infrastructure operations, as well as the company's No. 3 digital advertising platform. Amazon has long been at the forefront of AI development, using these sophisticated algorithms to improve its operations, from making product recommendations to scheduling the most efficient delivery routes.\n\nMore recently, the company introduced Amazon Rufus, a digital shopping assistant designed to answer product questions, make comparisons, and make recommendations based on specified criteria. Furthermore, Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers have access to all the latest generative AI models, which could reignite the company's cloud growth.\n\nTepper obviously sees additional upside, as he increased Appaloosa's holdings by 5%, bringing Amazon to 10.6% of its total portfolio. And at just 2 times next year's sales, Amazon stock is a steal.\n\n4. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is arguably the poster child for the AI revolution, as its graphics processing units (GPUs) are the gold standard not only for gaming, but also for data centers, speeding information through the ether. Their unmatched computational horsepower has given the company a near monopoly on GPUs for both machine learning and data center use cases, with 95% of their respective markets. This supremacy gave the company a leg up in the generative AI market, which it has dominated from the outset.\n\nHowever, Tepper cut its stake in Nvidia by 23%, knocking it down to 6.9% of Appaloosa's holdings, from 8.8% in the third quarter. However, Nvidia stock jumped 239% last year, so Tepper likely took the opportunity to lock in some profits.\n\n5. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's Google Search acts as a funnel to fuel the company's industry-leading digital advertising business, which is also fueled by AI. The company was quick out of the gate to develop its generative AI functionality, infusing AI across a broad cross-section of its Android and Google products. Like Amazon and Microsoft, Google is one of the \"Big Three\" cloud providers, giving it the perfect channel to sell AI products to its cloud customers.\n\nRecent developments include the debut of Gemini AI, which the company calls its \"largest and most capable AI model.\" Google Cloud's Vertex AI continues to expand, providing access to 130 foundational AI models, with something to suit every need.\n\nFor all its potential, however, Appaloosa sold roughly 16% of its Alphabet holdings last quarter, bringing its stake to 5.7%, down from 7.2%. While Tepper hasn't addressed the move, it's likely he saw greater potential opportunities for Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exit Now! 3 Social Media Stocks to Sell in February 2024",
        "content": "Social media stocks can come and go just as fast as the memes their platforms support. While the early days of social media stocks provided potential for huge growth akin to the dot-com bubble, many of these publicly traded companies are now faltering thanks to expanded regulatory action, increased competition and dwindling customer demand. The once-trendy darlings of the market are now experiencing a shift in sentiment, as the risks associated with these stocks loom larger than ever. Investors holding positions in this sector need to pay attention to what social media stocks to sell before they start trending downward.\n\nThere are compelling reasons why selling certain social media stocks may be the prudent move for investors seeking stability in their portfolios. Upside is limited with the three social media companies discussed here due to the overall risks they pose to investors. By divesting these stocks, investors can free up space in their portfolio for far more profitable options, like Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nHere are three social media stocks to sell as, sometimes, unfollowing is the wisest investment strategy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWeibo (WB) hands typing on a computer keyboard under a computer screen\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWeibo (NASDAQ:WB) is a Chinese microblogging platform facing challenges due to the country’s economic slowdown and competition. It reported a forward revenue growth estimate of only 13% and expects negative 7% EBITDA growth, indicating a tough road ahead. The intensifying competition in the Chinese social media landscape, coupled with evolving user preferences, poses challenges for Weibo’s growth prospects which have already started impacting its advertising revenue and market share.\n\nWeibo is expected to release its Q4 2023 earnings statement on Feb. 27. In the meantime, reviewing the Q3 numbers sheds light on the struggling business. In Q3 2023, net revenue was down 3% year-over-year (YOY). This included a 1% decrease YOY in ad revenue, and a 12% YOY decrease in value-added services revenue. Considering both active daily users and active monthly users were up, that doesn’t paint an overly optimistic future for the company’s continued revenue success. As a material improvement in China’s macroeconomic and political situation is unlikely to happen any time soon, Weibo’s situation could only get worse from here.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeibo’s stock may face headwinds as geopolitical tensions and government interventions in the tech sector create an unpredictable environment, making it a less favorable investment compared to more stable alternatives in the current market conditions. All things considered, Weibo should be at the top of the list of social media stocks to sell.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) offers a confusing mix between growth and declines in its key segments, but the recently reinvigorated pressures on SNAP overall are too much for investors to bear.\n\nIn 2023, Snap reported a marginal increase in annual revenue, reaching $4.6 billion, up less than 1% YOY. The company managed to reduce its net loss to $1.3 billion from $1.4 billion the previous year. Despite improvements in net loss, Snap’s adjusted EBITDA declined by 57% to $162 million in 2023.\n\nFor Q1 2024, the company’s adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be between negative $55 million and negative $95 million, thanks to its revenue expectations and investment plans. Still, the company expects its YOY revenue growth to be somewhere between 11% to 15% in Q1. While its daily active users grew by 10% YOY in the fourth quarter, there are signs that its user base is dwindling. And with recent concerns that Snapchat poses privacy risks to children and that the platform is under-regulated, SNAP could be in for a noticeable decline in the near future.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Hand holding Apple Iphone6 gold color with Pinterest app on the screen. In the background, a laptop is open to Pinterest. PINS stock.\n\nSource: photobyphotoboy / Shutterstock\n\nFounded in 2010, Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) is a social media platform that allows people to discover inspiration, share ideas and find content related to their hobbies and interests through a visually-oriented and user-friendly interface. For Q1 2024, Pinterest expects revenue to be in the range of $690 million to $705 million, representing a 15-17% growth YOY. This guidance aligns with the consensus but indicates a cautious outlook.\n\nHowever, the company’s stock-based compensation for all of 2023 was $1.6 billion, a 46% increase YOY. That’s 52% of Pinterest’s annual revenue for 2023 which came in at just over $3 billion. This highlights the significant costs associated with retaining talent at Pinterest.\n\nIt can be risky for investors to put a lot of money into stocks like PINS that are issuing shares through stock-based compensation. This practice can dilute existing shareholders’ equity and, if done excessively, may signal to the market that the company is more willing to spend on compensation than on direct business growth or dividend payouts. Additionally, heavy reliance on stock-based compensation can sometimes obscure the true cost of employee compensation in the financial statements, so the problem could be worse than it appears at first glance.\n\nGiven that the company’s revenue growth YOY was only 9%, which is certainly not spectacular, investors should consider putting PINS on their list of social media stocks to sell as there are better opportunities elsewhere.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "It’s Time! 3 Small-Cap Tech Stocks to Sell in February",
        "content": "Though small-cap stocks tend to outperform large-caps as a collective investment class, that truism hides a key risk when investing in small-cap stocks. There’s little barrier to entry, practically speaking, to public listing (and the few barriers are easily avoided, as in the case of SPAC mergers). This means that companies with limited prospects or long-term potential can achieve public stock exchange status, giving them an undeserved air of legitimacy.\n\nEach of these three small-cap stocks to sell has inherent and structural weaknesses that will be tough to overcome. Invest at your own risk – but if it were me, I’d avoid each of these small-cap stocks like the plague.\n\nGrom Social Enterprises (GROM) GROM stock: a phone displaying the GROM social network app page in the app store\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock\n\nGrom Social Enterprises (NASDAQ:GROM) is hanging on by a thread, making it top on our list of small-cap stocks to sell. The company positions itself as a safe social network for children, which isn’t a particularly compelling value proposition. Kid-friendly alternatives that offer more engaging features already exist, like Roblox (NYSE:RBLX).\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInstead, Grom combines many of the top features you find in existing social stocks like those Meta (NASDAQ:META) offers and delivers them to children. Children, of course, are an advertiser’s dream but tend to have low conversion rates when necessary financial protections are put in place. Bottom line, relying on kids swiping parental credit cards is a poor advertising strategy. To that end, it’s obvious why GROM’s sales are slipping, as they dropped by nearly half in the most recent quarter.\n\nWhile the company did secure a $4 million private placement deal late last year, don’t expect that to save the stock. That capital will likely disappear quickly based on its balance sheet, which shows nearly $1 million in accounts payable and about the same amount in dividends owed. Working capital is tough to come by, and GROM seems as though it is grasping at straws.\n\nStory continues\n\nUdemy (UDMY) An image of the logo for Udemy through a lens.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs great an idea as Udemy (NASDAQ:UDMY) may be, the fact stands that, in an era of free learning opportunities everywhere, expecting customers to fork over cash for information they could get on YouTube (or a book!) for free isn’t practical. And, though the small-cap stock may have a handful of big-name corporate clients like AT&T (NYSE:T), bigger firms will likely increase in-house production for mandatory training and similar coursework Udemy offers.\n\nMost concerning is Udemy’s “stickiness” with existing customers. The company boasted a 13% increase in total enterprise customers and a 25% increase in recurring revenue in the previous quarter’s filing. Good news, right? Not so fast.\n\nUdemy also reported a 9% drop in net dollar retention (how long customers stick around) and a 10% drop in large customer net dollar retention (UDMY defines large customers as companies with 1,000 or more employees). Both stats indicate that, once they get what they need, companies aren’t sticking around for further service – which doesn’t bode well for Udemy as it struggles to differentiate itself in a competitive EdTech landscape.\n\nAffirm Holdings (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM) may seem a strange pick on a list of small-cap stocks to sell, considering its strong performance this year (up 176% since February 2023) and the fact that its $11.6 billion market cap puts it in the questionable small/mid-cap status range. Still, this stock is one you should sell stat – it’s destined for tough times ahead.\n\nAffirm’s cornerstone service, buy now, pay later (BNPL), offers consumers instant micro-loans at purchase points. Recognizing that BNPL schemes often attract consumers with lesser creditworthiness is key to understanding what lies ahead for AFRM. With a noticeable uptick in credit card delinquencies, the likelihood of Affirm facing unpaid BNPL loans is high.\n\nA closer look at Affirm’s recent financial disclosures unveils a worrying $30 million increase in its provision for credit losses (reserves for expected loan defaults) from one quarter to the next, notably before the peak holiday shopping period. This period likely saw an increase in consumer reliance on Affirm’s BNPL offerings, further stretching their financial commitments. Given the current consumer financial behaviors and broader economic indicators, Affirm’s outlook appears challenging, making it a tough small-cap stock to get behind.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Have you been paying attention to shares of Meta Platforms (META)? Shares have been on the move with the stock up 23.6% over the past month. The stock hit a new 52-week high of $489.99 in the previous session. Meta Platforms has gained 37.3% since the start of the year compared to the 9.7% move for the Zacks Computer and Technology sector and the 17.5% return for the Zacks Internet - Software industry.\n\nWhat's Driving the Outperformance?\n\nThe stock has an impressive record of positive earnings surprises, as it hasn't missed our earnings consensus estimate in any of the last four quarters. In its last earnings report on February 1, 2024, Meta Platforms reported EPS of $5.33 versus consensus estimate of $4.83.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $19.78 per share on $158.75 billion in revenues. This represents a 33.02% change in EPS on a 17.68% change in revenues. For the next fiscal year, the company is expected to earn $22.94 per share on $179.75 billion in revenues. This represents a year-over-year change of 15.99% and 13.22%, respectively.\n\nValuation Metrics\n\nMeta Platforms may be at a 52-week high right now, but what might the future hold for the stock? A key aspect of this question is taking a look at valuation metrics in order to determine if the company has run ahead of itself.\n\nOn this front, we can look at the Zacks Style Scores, as they provide investors with an additional way to sort through stocks (beyond looking at the Zacks Rank of a security). These styles are represented by grades running from A to F in the categories of Value, Growth, and Momentum, while there is a combined VGM Score as well. Investors should consider the style scores a valuable tool that can help you to pick the most appropriate Zacks Rank stocks based on their individual investment style.\n\nMeta Platforms has a Value Score of D. The stock's Growth and Momentum Scores are B and B, respectively, giving the company a VGM Score of B.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn terms of its value breakdown, the stock currently trades at 24.6X current fiscal year EPS estimates, which is not in-line with the peer industry average of 31X. On a trailing cash flow basis, the stock currently trades at 24.7X versus its peer group's average of 18X. Additionally, the stock has a PEG ratio of 1.26. This isn't enough to put the company in the top echelon of all stocks we cover from a value perspective.\n\nZacks Rank\n\nWe also need to consider the stock's Zacks Rank, as this supersedes any trend on the style score front. Fortunately, Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy) thanks to rising earnings estimates.\n\nSince we recommend that investors select stocks carrying Zacks Rank of 1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B, it looks as if Meta Platforms meets the list of requirements. Thus, it seems as though Meta Platforms shares could have potential in the weeks and months to come.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta’s Zuckerberg Seeks Out of Lawsuits Blaming Him for Instagram Addiction",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Mark Zuckerberg is seeking to avoid being held personally liable in two dozen lawsuits accusing Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies of addicting children to their products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Rises Most in About Nine Months as AI Drives Sales T-Bills Without Tax Bills? This Fund Says It Cracked the Code US Lands on Moon in Historic Feat for Private Spacecraft AT&T Outage Triggered by Company Work on Network Expansion China’s Central Bank Tries to Catch Markets Off Guard With Surprise Easing\n\nThe Meta chief executive officer is set to make his case at a hearing Friday in California federal court. A ruling in Zuckerberg’s favor would dismiss him as a personal defendant in the litigation with no impact on the allegations against Meta.\n\nHolding him personally responsible may be a challenge because of a corporate law tradition of shielding executives from liability, especially at larger companies where decision-making is often layered. A victory against the billionaire who launched Facebook with friends as a Harvard undergraduate two decades ago could encourage claims against other CEOs in mass personal injury litigation.\n\nZuckerberg faces allegations from young people and parents that he was repeatedly warned that Instagram and Facebook weren’t safe for children but ignored the findings and publicly stated the opposite was true. Plaintiffs contend that as the face of Meta, Zuckerberg has a responsibility to “speak fully and truthfully on the risks Meta’s platforms pose to children’s health.”\n\n“With great power comes great responsibility,” plaintiffs’ lawyers said in a court filing, quoting the Spider Man comics in a footnote. “Unfortunately, Mr. Zuckerberg has not lived up to that maxim.”\n\nZuckerberg, the world’s fourth-richest person as of Thursday, has argued that he can’t be held personally responsible for actions at Meta just because he’s the CEO. As for the statements made by Zuckerberg himself, his lawyers claim that they were generalized or covered by the US Constitution’s First Amendment protection of free speech and that Zuckerberg didn’t have a duty to disclose the safety findings that were allegedly reported to him.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers in Oakland, who is overseeing the cases, has asked lawyers on both sides to clarify about how laws covering negligent misrepresentation and corporate officer responsibility vary among individual states.\n\nWhen The Scrolling Doesn’t Stop: Social Media Lawsuits Pile Up\n\nThe cases naming Zuckerberg are a small subset of a collection of more than 1,000 suits in state and federal courts by families and public school districts against Meta along with Alphabet Inc.’s Google, ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, and Snap Inc. Rogers recently allowed some claims to proceed against the companies while dismissing others.\n\nZuckerberg, who is Meta’s most significant shareholder and maintains sole voting control at the company, is also at risk of being held personally liable in a separate 2022 lawsuit over the Cambridge Analytica data privacy scandal brought by the attorney general of the District of Columbia in Washington.\n\nPinning blame on an executive for unlawful conduct typically hinges on showing their involvement in relevant day-to-day decisions or their knowledge of the practices at issue. It’s generally easier to assign executive liability at smaller companies, where an individual’s direct participation in decision-making can be clearer.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 23, 2024 – Stocks in this week’s article are Netflix, Inc NFLX, Meta Platforms, Inc META, Deckers Outdoor Corp. DECK and GigaCloud Technology GCT.\n\nSnap Up These 4 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks to Enhance Your Portfolio\n\nInvestors looking for high returns are likely to benefit from adding stocks with robust liquidity levels, as it promotes business growth.\n\nLiquidity primarily determines a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors’ radar owing to their potential to provide strong returns.\n\nOne should be alert before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level might imply that the company is clearing its dues at a faster rate compared with peers, it may also suggest that it is unable to utilize its assets competently.\n\nHence, one may consider a company’s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — the ‘acid-test ratio’ or ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\nA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.\n\nHere are four stocks out of the 16 that qualified for the screen:\n\nNetflix, Inc is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the company had 260.28 million paid subscribers globally. The company added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNetflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diverse content portfolio and heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content. Stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Apple, Peacock and Paramount+ is a headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2024 bottom line is pegged at earnings of $16.93 per share, up 6% in the past 60 days. The company has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.4%, on average.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc is the world’s biggest social media platform. The company is gaining from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increasing engagement in its other platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth catalyst. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid prospects.\n\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a concern for Meta’s advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.62 per share, up 11.2% in the past 60 days. META has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.7%, on average.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corp. is a leading designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. The company sells products primarily under five proprietary brands — UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk and Other brands (mainly comprising Koolaburra). Strength in the UGG and HOKA brands is driving top-line performance.\n\nRobust gains from the direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels, brand growth, a strong balance sheet and a stable operating model are positives. Continued momentum in its global wholesale business, driven by consumer demand in both domestic and international markets, appears encouraging as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 bottom line is pegged at $26.85 per share, up 13.7% in the past 60 days. DECK has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.1%, on average.\n\nGigaCloud Technology provides end-to-end B2B e-commerce solutions for ample parcel merchandise worldwide. The company's marketplace brings together manufacturers (mainly in Asia) and resellers (in the United States, Asia and Europe) to implement cross-border transactions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 bottom line is pegged at $1.77 per share, unchanged in the past 60 days. GCT has a Growth Score of A.\n\nGet the remaining stocks on the list and start testing this and other ideas.

        "content": "Baron Funds, an investment management company, released its “Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund” fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. The fund increased 17.6% (Institutional Shares) in the fourth quarter compared to a 14.2% gain for the Russell 1000 Growth Index and an 11.7% increase for the S&P 500 Index. For the full year, the fund appreciated 57.6% compared to 42.7% and 26.3% returns for the indexes, respectively.

(NASDAQ:META) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Improving unit economics: Many of our companies were able to significantly expand margins during 2023 even though revenue growth decelerated for some of them, showcasing the power of their capital-light, recurring revenue business models, and their increased focus on efficiency. One public example that was at least partially responsible for driving other companies (especially in IT) to become more efficient is X (formerly Twitter), which reduced headcount by a whopping 80% after Elon Musk’s acquisition, despite growing user engagement. Another well-known example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), for which cost controls and margin expansion this year have been a key reason behind the stock’s outperformance (Mark Zuckerberg called 2023 the year of efficiency). Other less well-known examples include the commerce platform, Shopify, which is expected to expand its operating margins from breakeven to 10.9% in 2023 thanks to the sale of its money-losing logistics business, and a 23% reduction in its workforce. What is even more impressive is that the company was able to accelerate innovation velocity (with a lower headcount) as well as improve sales and marketing productivity.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCopyright: rvlsoft / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Why Are Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Soaring Today",
        "content": "Why Are Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) jumped 15.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with a meaningful revenue beat, strong gross margin improvement, and EPS outperformance vs. Wall Street's estimates. Notably, revenue grew 265% year-on-year and 22% sequentially. The strong topline performance was mostly driven by the data center segment, which was up 409% year-over-year and 27% sequentially as demand for Nvidia processors optimized for generative AI, LLMs (large language models), and other AI workloads continued to accelerate. Notably, the company estimated that roughly 40% of Data Center revenue was driven by AI-related applications.\n\nGuidance for the next quarter was also good, with revenue, gross margin, and implied operating profit coming in ahead of expectations. The company noted that growth in the data center and professional visualization segments is expected to more than offset the anticipated seasonal decline in gaming. Zooming out, we think this was a great quarter that shareholders will appreciate.\n\nIs now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 8 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Nvidia and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago, when the company dropped 5.7% as equities pulled back, with market participants likely taking profits ahead of a big earnings week. Tech stocks led the decline, with the Nasdaq index down 1% while the SP 500 fell 0.5%. Some of the notable stocks reporting earnings during the week include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), and Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG).\n\nStocks have had a good run since the fourth quarter of 2023 as markets expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024 amidst cooling inflation data. The market's momentum continued into the early weeks of 2024 following solid earnings results from big tech names, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nNvidia is up 61.5% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $19,552.\n\nHere at StockStory, we certainly understand the potential of thematic investing. Diverse winners from Microsoft (MSFT) to Alphabet (GOOG), Coca-Cola (KO) to Monster Beverage (MNST) could all have been identified as promising growth stories with a megatrend driving the growth. So, in that spirit, we’ve identified a relatively under-the-radar profitable growth stock benefitting from the rise of AI, available to you FREE via this link.",

        "title": "Nvidia stock surges after earnings beat estimates across the board",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. That's a massive jump from the same period last quarter when Nvidia reported EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. To put a finer point on Nvidia's performance, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\nShares of Nvidia were up more than 15% in Thursday trading following the report.\n\n“Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers — demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies. Vertical industries — led by auto, financial services and healthcare — are now at a multibillion-dollar level,\" Huang said in the statement.\n\nDespite the across-the-board beat, Nvidia did have at least one negative comment in its report, with CFO Colette Kress warning that data center revenue out of China fell \"significantly\" in Q4 due to US licensing requirements. The US has blacklisted the sale of certain Nvidia chips to China on fears that they could be used for military applications.\n\nNvidia's all-important Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue of $18.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. The company reported revenue of $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall, Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 217% for the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia's Data Center segment is driving the ship, its gaming business is still an important piece of the company. Revenue for the division topped out at $2.9 billion. Investors were expecting revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nNvidia's stock price has skyrocketed more than 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), thanks to its position as the world's leading AI chipmaker.\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, faces challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nAnd that could prove especially problematic as the company said more than half of its Data Center revenue in Q4 came from large cloud providers for internal workloads and external customers.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Nvidia's Latest Results Are Proof Of AI's Turbocharging Potential For Business",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) delivered its fourth quarter results and they smashed Wall Street’s expectations across the board as generative AI demand is surging across the globe. While the Data Center business is running the show, Nvidia’s gaming business also has an important role in its success. Over the last 12 months, Nvidia’s stock price easily surpassed those of its rivals, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ: INTC).\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on January 29th, Nvidia reported total revenue grew 265% to $22.10 billion, topping LSEG’s estimate of $20.62 billion.  Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue skyrocket 217% to $18.4 billion, also beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. However, data center revenue was harmed by recent U.S. restrictions on exporting advanced AI chips to China.\n\nThe gaming segment brought in 2.9 billion, topping analyst estimates of $2.7 billion as it rose 56% YoY. Impressively, net income rose 769% YoY to $12.29 billion with adjusted earnings of $5.16 also topping LSEG's estimate of $4.64.\n\nCompetitive Threat Is Rising\n\nNvidia is undoubtedly at the top of its game, but its rivals are not standing still. Its main rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips. Moreover, AMD is claiming its new MI300X surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads. AMD rolled out the MI300X before 2023 came to an end, placing it as the industry’s most advanced AI accelerator.\n\nIntel also has its own server chips while it continues to work on expanding its own capabilities on the AI front.Interestingly, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) turned to Intel and not Nvidia to make its future in-house chips. Microsoft plans to use 18A manufacturing technology that Intel developed. With this move, Microsoft will undoubtedly boost Intel and its made-to-order chip business.\n\nStory continues\n\nPerhaps an even bigger threat to Nvidia doesn’t come from its direct rivals but from its customers like Microsoft that are racing to develop their own specialized AI chips to lower their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Moreover, such customers brought in more than half of its Data Center revenue during the latest reported quarter, as Nvidia attributed more than half of quarterly revenue to large cloud providers for conducting internal workloads and external customers. Besides Microsoft, those that are either already offering or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips are Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)-owned Google, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and even the EV leader, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA). However, Reuters reported that Nvidia has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI in an effort to get them on board to make custom chips for them.\n\nDuring the current quarter, Nvidia guided for revenue of $24 billion while CEO Jensen Huang assured investors that the AI chip leader is all set for continued growth.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Here's My Top 4 Tech Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Although the market continues to notch new all-time highs, plenty of individual stocks are worth buying at these prices. While some stocks may be overpriced, not all are that way. Right now, I've got four I would feel confident taking a position in today. These are stocks that could help lead the market forward as it continues to reach new levels.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nFirst up is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet is currently the fourth-largest U.S. company. Yet, as big as it is, Alphabet's business continues to expand. In the fourth quarter, revenue rose 13% year over year to $86.3 billion while the operating margin expanded from 24% to 27%.\n\nWhile Alphabet has significant skin in the game in artificial intelligence (AI), its primary business is advertising. Advertising has strengthened as clients become more comfortable with the economic situation, which led Alphabet to succeed in its latest quarter.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's stock doesn't appear to receive the same respect as other big tech companies like Microsoft and Apple and trades at a massive discount from a forward price-to-earnings basis. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet garnered the same valuation as Microsoft, it would be a $2.9 trillion company -- causing it to pass Apple as the second-largest business on Earth. Eventually, the market will wake up and understand this, causing Alphabet's stock to rise. But until it does, it's a great buy.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) may be the most important company on Earth for our digital society. It's the world's largest contract chip manufacturer and produces cutting-edge chips for companies like Apple and Nvidia.\n\nLast year, the chip industry experienced a downturn due to excess supply, but that trend may be over. In January, Taiwan Semiconductor's revenue rose 7.9% year over year, indicating growth may be returning to the chip giant.\n\nManagement expects to boost revenue at a 15% to 20% compound annual growth rate for \"several years.\" Based on this expected growth, the stock looks very attractive.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. UiPath\n\nUiPath (NYSE: PATH) is a leader in robotic process automation (RPA) software, which allows its clients to automate repetitive tasks like creating a report or filling out an expense report. It also has multiple AI tools to expand the number of tasks it can automate.\n\nUiPath has seen plenty of success recently, with its annual recurring revenue rising 24% to $1.38 billion in its fiscal 2024's third quarter (ended Oct. 31). But this is a drop in the bucket for the overall RPA market.\n\nPolaris Market Research estimates the RPA market opportunity to be worth around $2.66 billion in 2022 but will expand to $66 billion by 2032. That's a massive expansion, and UiPath already has a significant foothold in this market.\n\nWith the stock trading at a little over 11 times sales, it's attractively priced for a growing software company. UiPath is on my short list for a stock that could be a top market performer over the next decade, and I think it's a great buy now.\n\n4. Meta Platforms\n\nLast is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), the company formerly known as Facebook. Like Alphabet, Meta is primarily an advertising company on its various social media platforms. While the ad business struggled in late 2022 and early 2023, it has drastically recovered.\n\nIn Q4, Meta's ad revenue increased 24% to $38.7 billion -- a new all-time high. Improvements in this segment, along with its Reality Labs division, allowed Meta to return to peak operating margin levels -- something that was a major concern in late 2022 when they dropped. META Operating Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith Meta back on the right track and trading for an attractive 24 times forward earnings, it looks like a great stock to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Within the FoA segment, almost 100% of the revenue came from advertising revenue. Clearly, advertising is Meta's most important revenue source.\n\nMeta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li explained the strong growth in advertising revenue for the quarter and year during the earnings call:\n\nFor full year 2023, the largest contributors to year-over-year ad revenue growth were the online commerce, CPG, entertainment and media and gaming verticals. The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets. In 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth.\n\nTurning back to Q4 results. Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $39 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.7 billion, up 24% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe can see that Chinese advertisers were the biggest drivers for Meta's revenue growth, which is consistent with the third quarter of 2023. During that quarter's earnings call, Li gave a more detailed answer regarding Chinese advertisers' growth:\n\nTo give you a little bit of color, in North America, we saw accelerate by 7 points due primarily to strong demand from China advertisers. Note that North America didn't experience the same currency tailwinds that drove acceleration in year-over-year growth for the other regions. In the EU or in our EU region, we saw that accelerate 21 points. There was a broad-based acceleration in the region, including demand from China advertisers and some benefit from currency tailwinds after facing currency headwinds in Q2. Brazil was a strong contributor to the region's acceleration due in part to increased advertisers' demand from China advertisers targeting users in Brazil.\n\nBy China adverisers, obviously Li meant Shein and Temu from PDD Holdings (PDD), especially Temu. According to a WSJ article published on Nov. 28, 2023:\n\nForty-six percent of Temu's digital ad spend so far this year went to Facebook, 22% went to Instagram, and 15% went to YouTube, according to market intelligence firm Sensor Tower. The wave of spending by China-owned retailers is affecting the overall online ad business. Temu and rival Shein are 'almost single-handedly having an impact on the cost of advertising, particularly in some paid channels in Google and Meta,' Etsy CEO Joshua Silverman said during an earnings call with analysts earlier this month. Susan Li, chief financial officer at Meta, has also credited unnamed Chinese retailers with helping to sustain the company's ad business in recent months.\n\nCNBC also reported that:\n\nJMP analysts estimated that Temu and Shein spent roughly $600 million and $200 million, respectively, on Facebook and Instagram ads in the third quarter. That would suggest they accounted for about 3% of Meta's total growth in the period, according to JMP. Research from data.AI prepared for CNBC shows that Temu notched 73.87 million downloads in 2023, up more than 500% from a year prior. Shein's downloads increased around 52% over that stretch to 36.93 million.\n\nTemu's growth is truly extraodinary. The e-commerce site was launched in the U.S. in September of 2022. After the launch, it had to spend aggressively in order to attract customers and gain brand recognition. Fortunately for Meta, Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp are all important advertising channels that can give Temu the broadest reach, not only in the U.S., but across the globe.\n\nTemu has spent a lot on Meta's social apps in 2023. The important question is whether its advertising spending is sustainable in 2024 and beyond. Even if Temu's advertising spending is sustainable, are Meta's social apps still the most effective and efficient channels for it? I will not assume that Temu will continue to contribute such growth for Meta in 2024 because its user growth has already slowed down in the U.S. and it is almost guaranteed that Meta's exposure to Temu and Shein will be a political target from both Democrats and Republicans. Therefore, I think conservative investors should assume Meta's revenue growth will slow down in 2024 due to slower advertising growth from Temu on Meta's apps.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta has benefited from both a Year of Efficiency as well as Chinese advertisers' increased growth in 2023. But in 2024, both tailwinds are likely to subside. At 31 times 2023 earnings and 23 times estimated 2024 earnings, Meta's stock is not very expensive, but not very cheap either. Investors should keep a close eye on Temu and Shein's advertising revenue growth in the next two to three years.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Snap These 4 Top-Ranked Liquid Stocks to Enrich Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Investors looking for high returns are likely to benefit from adding stocks with robust liquidity levels, as it promotes business growth.\n\nLiquidity primarily determines a company’s capability to meet debt obligations by converting assets into liquid cash and equivalents. These stocks have always been on investors’ radar owing to their potential to provide strong returns.\n\nOne should be alert before investing in such stocks. While a high liquidity level might imply that the company is clearing its dues at a faster rate compared with peers, it may also suggest that it is unable to utilize its assets competently.\n\nHence, one may consider a company’s efficiency level in addition to its liquidity to identify potential winners.\n\nMeasures to Identify Liquid Stocks\n\nCurrent Ratio: It measures current assets relative to current liabilities. The ratio gauges a company’s potential to meet short- and long-term debt obligations. A current ratio — the working capital ratio — below 1 indicates that the company has more liabilities than assets. However, a high current ratio does not always suggest that the company is in good financial shape. It may also indicate that the firm failed to utilize its assets significantly. Hence, a range of 1-3 is considered ideal.\n\nQuick Ratio: Unlike the current ratio, the quick ratio — the ‘acid-test ratio’ or ‘quick assets ratio’ — indicates a company’s ability to pay short-term obligations. It considers inventory, excluding the current assets relative to current liabilities. A quick ratio of more than 1 is desirable, like the current ratio.\n\nCash Ratio: This is the most conservative ratio among the three, considering cash and cash equivalents and invested funds relative to current liabilities. It measures a company’s ability to meet existing debt obligations using the most liquid assets. Though a cash ratio of more than 1 may suggest sound financials, a higher number may indicate inefficiency in cash utilization.\n\nStory continues\n\nA ratio greater than 1 is always desirable but may not always represent a company’s financial condition.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nTo pick the best of the lot, we have added asset utilization — a widely used measure of a company’s efficiency — as one of the screening criteria. Asset utilization is the ratio of total sales in the past 12 months to the last four-quarter average of total assets. Though this ratio varies across industries, companies with a ratio higher than their respective industries can be considered efficient.\n\nWe added our proprietary Growth Style Score to the screen to ensure these liquid and efficient stocks have solid growth potential.\n\nCurrent Ratio, Quick Ratio and Cash Ratio between 1 and 3 (While liquidity ratios greater than 1 are desirable, significantly high ratios may indicate inefficiency.)\n\nAsset utilization is more significant than the industry average (Higher asset utilization than the industry average indicates a company’s efficiency.)\n\nZacks Rank equal to #1 (Only Strong Buy-rated stocks can get through). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nGrowth Score less than or equal to B (Back-tested results show that stocks with a Growth Score of A or B handily beat other stocks when combined with a Zacks Rank #1 or 2.)\n\nThese criteria have narrowed the universe of more than 7,700 stocks to only 16.\n\nHere are four stocks out of the 16 that qualified for the screen:\n\nNetflix, Inc NFLX is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. At the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, the company had 260.28 million paid subscribers globally. The company added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general. Netflix is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diverse content portfolio and heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content. Stiff competition in the streaming space from the likes of Amazon Prime Video, Disney+, Apple, Peacock and Paramount+ is a headwind. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NFLX’s 2024 bottom line is pegged at earnings of $16.93 per share, up 6% in the past 60 days. The company has a Growth Score of B and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 5.4%, on average.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc META is the world’s biggest social media platform. The company is gaining from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increasing engagement in its other platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth catalyst. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass and mixed reality device Quest 3, is likely to aid prospects. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a concern for Meta’s advertising revenues. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings is pegged at $19.62 per share, up 11.2% in the past 60 days. META has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 19.7%, on average.\n\nDeckers Outdoor Corporation DECK is a leading designer, producer and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities. The company sells products primarily under five proprietary brands — UGG, HOKA, Teva, Sanuk and Other brands (mainly comprising Koolaburra). Strength in the UGG and HOKA brands is driving top-line performance. Robust gains from the direct-to-consumer (“DTC”) channels, brand growth, a strong balance sheet and a stable operating model are positives. Continued momentum in its global wholesale business, driven by consumer demand in both domestic and international markets, appears encouraging as well. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its fiscal 2024 bottom line is pegged at $26.85 per share, up 13.7% in the past 60 days. DECK has a Growth Score of A and a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 32.1%, on average.\n\nGigaCloud Technology GCT provides end-to-end B2B e-commerce solutions for ample parcel merchandise worldwide. The company's marketplace brings together manufacturers (mainly in Asia) and resellers (in the United States, Asia and Europe) to implement cross-border transactions. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its 2023 bottom line is pegged at $1.77 per share, unchanged in the past 60 days. GCT has a Growth Score of A.\n\nGet the remaining stocks on the list and start testing this and other ideas.

        "title": "7 Terrific Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of the Magnificent 7",
        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – have been the darlings of Wall Street for the past few years. And for good reason – they have dominated their markets and delivered outstanding returns for investors. However, their meteoric rise has pushed their valuations into the stratosphere. As an investor, I believe it’s prudent to take some chips off the table and redeploy that capital into other promising tech stocks that have not yet received their time in the spotlight.\n\nI will highlight seven terrific tech stocks that have been executing at a high level, but have mostly flown under the radar on Wall Street. Many of these stocks have the potential to generate triple-digit returns over the coming years. The best part? Most of these stocks can still be scooped up at reasonable valuations before the herd catches on. Let’s take a look!\n\nPriority Technology (PRTH) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a payments technology company, Priority Technology (NASDAQ:PRTH) is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable rebound in lending and borrowing once interest rates are cut. The entire fintech space remains depressed from the post-pandemic cooldown, but companies like PRTH that partner with banks or facilitate lending have huge upside when activity picks back up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPriority is already seeing promising progress on the financial front. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q3 to $189 million, and the company is getting close to breakeven profitability. While any profits right now may not be sustained, analysts expect Priority to hit its stride in 2025 with solid earnings growth. Importantly, the company’s balance sheet is healthy enough to fund losses until profitability scales.\n\nYes, Priority’s hefty debt load of $623 million is a concern with rising rates. But as rates inevitably fall, payments on this debt will decrease considerably, leading to much stronger profitability and a higher stock price. I’m bullish on Priority Technology’s ability to thrive as fintech rebounds. The company has an excellent payment platform and lending exposure to capitalize on renewed borrowing activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nFutu Holdings (FUTU) An iPhone screen displaying the Futu Holdings logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/Shutterstock\n\nFutu Holdings (NASDAQ:FUTU) has performed remarkably well as a digitalized brokerage platform, despite the recent market downturn. While the financial industry is still reeling from the post-pandemic hangover, companies like Futu will bounce back strongly once headwinds clear.\n\nCase in point – Futu achieved a stunning 36% dollarized revenue growth in Q3 to $338 million, with net margins of 46%. The company continues growing its user base rapidly, even amid weakness in the Chinese market. Investors are returning in droves, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs and the Nasdaq poised to follow. When the Chinese market finally wakes up, I expect Futu’s growth to accelerate tremendously.\n\nThe stock has traded sideways for more than three years after its parabolic surge. But this consolidation sets the stage for an upside breakout as market sentiment improves. Futu has proven its resilience and ability to rapidly monetize its user base. Once China stimulates its economy, the company should see user growth re-ignite.\n\nIn short, the company is firmly profitable, with margins expanding, and its growth story is far from over. Futu still has substantial room for international growth, and the ability to cross-selling financial products beyond stock trading. I’m bullish on this long-term compounder.\n\nRELX (RELX) A businesswoman looks at a floating interface screen full of data.\n\nSource: metamorworks/Shutterstock\n\nRELX (NYSE:RELX), a global analytics company, is firing on all cylinders with double-digit sales growth. The stock has surged 42% over the past year as fundamentals accelerated, but I think the company still has room to run as a premium quality business.\n\nSpecifically, RELX’s Exhibitions and Risk businesses have achieved stellar top-line growth of 32% and 8%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2023. Meanwhile, the company’s Scientific, Technical & Medical, and Legal divisions saw more modest but steady growth of 4%-6%.\n\nRELX’s Exhibitions and Risk units will likely drive near-term gains as RELX continues leveraging its unrivaled data assets. However, all four business lines have strong competitive positions that enable pricing power and reinvestment into new verticals.\n\nThe company’s valuation looks rich at first glance. But for a high-quality compounder like RELX, growth investors are wise to pay up. RELX consistently delivers organic growth with 19%-plus net margins and rising cash flows. As analytics adoption increases across industries, RELX has an open runway for expansion.\n\nTechTarget (TTGT) hand using online banking and icon on tablet screen device in coffee shop\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) operates an expansive network comprised of over 220 digital brands offering IT purchase intent data, research, and marketing services. Though shares currently sit around 70% off 2021 highs, the company’s recent combination with Informa’s digital business drastically expands TechTarget’s total addressable market by more than 10x.\n\nBeyond merger benefits, the company continues to execute well, with double-digit earnings and revenue growth pace expected again in 2024. Compared to richly-valued SaaS peers, TechTarget’s growth suggests upside from reasonable sub-20x earnings multiples. Pro forma estimates call for the combined entity to generate over $500 million in 2024 sales, expanding to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue within five years on 35%+ EBITDA margins. This consolidation also brings 50 million unique visitors.\n\nIf TechTarget can successfully harness merged assets to drive engagement with IT decision-makers, immense shareholder value could be unlocked, given the integral role purchase intent data plays in capturing trillion-dollar global IT spending.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nClaiming the #2 spot for U.S. dating app downloads behind Tinder in 2023, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) faces near-term headwinds like slowing user growth and leadership changes. However, the company’s long-term growth story remains intact. Bumble ranked ahead of Hinge. And its financials are strong, with high gross margins and double-digit revenue growth.\n\nStill, Bumble must effectively manage costs and continue scaling its user base amid a competitive online dating market. Recent stock dilution also weighs on the company’s share price. However, I see a compelling bargain for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue growth should average around 12% annually this decade. More importantly, Bumble’s earnings per share are expected to grow ffom 27 cents in 2023 to more than $1.45 in 2028. I believe Bumble deserves a higher premium, with profitability inflecting higher as online dating becomes normalized.\n\nChallenges exist, but Bumble retains leadership in a secular growth industry. The path forward is clear – drive monetization and engagement through new features while optimizing marketing costs. I’m bullish on Bumble regaining momentum and delivering substantial upside from current depressed levels.\n\nOpera (OPRA)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDelivering a unique web browser infused with messaging, crypto, and AI capabilities, Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) continues to gain share by targeting younger demographics—especially gamers. Last quarter, Opera beat guidance, with sales up 20% year-over-year to $103 million on surging profitability metrics. New Opera GX Cloud subscriptions also recently launched.\n\nDespite executing well into a $53 billion browser software market, the stock trades at a 58% discount to highs. It trades around 13-times forward earnings—presenting a compelling rebound opportunity as gamers plus smartphone users present adoption upside.\n\nBy integrating differentiated functionality like Twitch streaming and Discord messaging support, Opera’s ability to carve out enduring browser niche share seems continually underestimated to me. If conversion and monetization of its base exceeding 350 million users ramps successfully, material share price appreciation could follow over the long-term.\n\nQuickLogic (QUIK) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a small-cap semiconductor outfit developing embedded FPGA and edge AI solutions targeting high-potential markets like IoT and robotics, QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK) finds itself strategically aligned with surging AI adoption trends. With earnings per share potentially tripling next year amid a nearly 100% revenue growth pace, the stock likely warrants a higher premium than the 36-times earnings multiple 2024 projections imply.\n\nQuickLogic’s strengths in facilitating optimized AI inferencing on power-constrained endpoints perfectly position the company to enable the proliferation of AI use cases where data privacy and real-time responsiveness prove critical—a vital need in automation. With shares up over 131% in the past year on rapid adoption traction, I believe this undercovered name still seems significantly underestimated by the Street.\n\nIf the relentless focus on expanding its embedded FPGA IP capabilities boosts QuickLogic’s design win pipeline as projected entering 2024, immense shareholder value could be created given the immense TAM pursuing low-power AI innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies continue to advance at incredible speeds. Just a couple of years ago, OpenAI's DallE text-to-image platform was only capable of generating crude visuals. The program's output was an intriguing novelty and hinted at what was to come, but you probably wouldn't have wanted to hang anything it produced on your wall.\n\nThe pace at which AI technologies have progressed has been nothing short of incredible. This February, OpenAI demonstrated Sora, a text-to-video platform that is capable of generating Hollywood-level visuals simply by inputting text-based prompts. This is just one example of the incredible shifts that are currently underway.\n\nAs impressive as AI's progression has been so far, this technological revolution is still in very early stages. If you're looking to capitalize on this century's most disruptive technology shift, read on to see two top AI companies that Motley Fool contributors think would be great investments this month.\n\nMicrosoft has a stellar position in AI\n\nKeith Noonan: Advanced AI technologies depend on powerful graphics processing units and other hardware. That means most large-scale apps will need to run and be distributed through the cloud. As a leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is poised to benefit from surging AI-driven demand.\n\nNotably, OpenAI has already signed on to use Microsoft's Azure service as its exclusive cloud provider for ChatGPT, Sora, DallE, and all other software that it produces. While Amazon remains the worldwide leader in terms of cloud infrastructure market share, Microsoft's service continues to gain market share -- and it's clear that AI developers love Azure.\n\nRevenue for Azure and other cloud services increased 30% year over year in Microsoft's Fiscal 2024 second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023). The performance helped push overall sales up 18% year over year to $62 billion, and non-GAAP (adjusted) net income jumped 26%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince dethroning Apple earlier this year, Microsoft ranks as the world's most valuable company and has a market capitalization of roughly $3 trillion. Given the software giant's already enormous size, its sales and earnings growth are even more impressive -- and it looks like its strong performance will continue.\n\nIn addition to supercharging its cloud-infrastructure business, Microsoft's forefront position in AI should bolster its strengths in operating systems, productivity software, search, and media. AI should open up new growth opportunities for the company in cybersecurity and other categories.\n\nAnd while Microsoft doesn't own a direct stake in OpenAI, the software giant reportedly poured $13 billion in funding into the AI innovator in exchange for future profit sharing. The two companies are also close partners, and Microsoft has already been integrating OpenAI's tech across various consumer and enterprise software offerings.\n\nWith all these resources, advantages, and opportunities, it's no stretch to say that Microsoft has one of the strongest overall positions in AI.\n\nMeta Platforms gives shareholders an attractive AI investment option\n\nParkev Tatevosian: With AI taking the investment world by storm, investors looking to get in on the action are seeking out options. One option is a company that is capitalizing on the efficiencies that AI brings with it.\n\nSocial media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has made it known that it is transitioning to a focus on the metaverse. But while it builds out that segment of the business, it needs its current operations to keep performing. Increased user engagement remains critical to doing that and Meta is putting AI to use to surface more engaging content for users. More engaged users prolong user sessions and lead to incrementally higher revenue from the advertisers hoping to sell to those users.\n\nImprovements in AI are contributing to Meta increasing its revenue from $40.6 billion in 2017 to $134.9 billion in 2023. With the support of more effective recommendation systems powered by improving AI, revenue growth has a good chance of continuing for several years. It also helps that Meta is becoming more efficient with how it puts that revenue to work. Meta's operating income rose from $20.2 billion to $46.8 billion in the above-mentioned years. AI efficiencies are helping Meta boost operating profit as well as sales. META PE Ratio (Forward 1y) Chart\n\nGiven Meta's improved financials, it's also seeing growth in interest from investors. And yet, despite a rising price (up 173% in the past year), the stock is not prohibitively expensive. Trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 20.6, Meta's stock remains a decent value for long-term investors given its excellent prospects. Of course, there are risks with any investment and Meta's volatile performance over the past three years shows that. However, the risk versus reward is favorable at current valuations for this excellent AI stock if you are willing to buy and hold.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023, investors have enjoyed a true running of the bulls on Wall Street. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average and broad-based S&P 500 galloped to fresh highs, while the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite ended the previous week a stone's throw from eclipsing its November 2021 record-closing high.\n\nWhile I'd love to tell you that this has been a broad-driven rally, the emergence of a new bull market is the result of outsized returns from the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to some of the largest, most influential businesses on Wall Street:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese are seven innovation-driven businesses that offer an abundance of competitive advantages. Examples include Alphabet's virtual monopoly in internet search with Google; Microsoft's continued dominance with its Windows operating system; Tesla's position as North America's leading electric vehicle manufacturer; Amazon's dominant e-commerce marketplace; and Meta's top social media assets, which attract nearly 4 billion active users each month.\n\nWhile the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven isn't lost on Wall Street, its most successful money managers have very different outlooks on these top-tier stocks, as evidenced by the latest round of 13F filings. A 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's brightest minds bought and sold in the latest quarter.\n\nBased on 13Fs for the December-ended quarter, three Magnificent Seven stocks were given the heave-ho by billionaire investors, while another was aggressively purchased.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires are selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock that was sent to the chopping block in the fourth quarter is social media giant Meta Platforms. A half-dozen billionaire money managers lightened their respective fund's stakes in the parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nStory continues\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (3,037,082 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,430,767 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (542,399 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (371,850 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (307,709 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (100,000 shares)\n\nThe most logical reason for billionaires to be wary of Meta is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in 2024. Meta generates almost 98% of its revenue from advertising on its social media platforms, and it's perfectly normal for advertisers to reduce their spending during periods of economic weakness. A recession would hurt Meta's sales and its ad-pricing power in the short run.\n\nThe other potential concern for billionaires might be Meta's valuation. Shares of the company have more than quintupled in value from their 2022 bear market low. Billionaires selling could represent simple profit-taking, or perhaps signal that top asset managers anticipate a short-term pullback in Meta stock.\n\nHowever, the interesting thing about Meta is that it's still historically cheap, even after its run-up. Shares of the company are valued at 12.6 times forecast cash flow in 2025, which represents a nearly 20% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires are selling: Alphabet\n\nA second Magnificent Seven stock that got the boot from billionaire asset managers in the December-ended quarter is Alphabet. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud saw seven billionaires sell its stock, including (total shares sold in parentheses for Alphabet's Class A shares, GOOGL):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (3,302,342 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (3,113,001 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,278,300 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (806,651 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (571,317 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (236,969 shares)\n\nSimilar to Meta, the exodus among billionaires from Alphabet may have to do with concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. A few money-based metrics and predictive indicators have been blaring warnings that U.S. economic activity could weaken. Alphabet brought in about 76% of its net sales in 2023 from advertising on Google search, Google Network, and YouTube.\n\nAnd just like Meta, the selling doesn't seem to make much sense. In addition to periods of growth disproportionately outlasting recessions, Alphabet's Google accounts for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share, as of January. In fact, you have to look back nearly nine years to find the last time a month went by where it didn't account for at least 90% of global internet search. Alphabet's ad-pricing power is practically unsurpassed.\n\nAlphabet also completed its first year of operating profitability from its high-margin cloud infrastructure services segment. Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending and shouldn't have any trouble meaningfully increasing its cash flow in the years to come.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 3 billionaires are selling: Nvidia\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that had billionaires willingly pressing the sell button during the fourth quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia. All told, eight billionaires were sellers of the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne of the prime reasons billionaire investors may have rushed for the exit is growing graphics processing unit (GPU) competition. Not only is Nvidia going to fend off increasing competition from external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, but many of Nvidia's top customers are developing their own AI chips, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nThere's also a real possibility that Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands its production of A100 and H100 AI-GPU chips. A modest increase in cost of revenue compared to an 86% jump in sales through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January) pretty clearly demonstrates how powerful Nvidia's pricing power has been. Once this GPU scarcity wanes, its gross margin is liable to decline.\n\nLastly, every next-big-trend over the past three decades has worked its way through an early-stage bubble. History suggests that investors will overestimate the uptake of AI, just as they have with every previous next-big-thing trend for 30 years.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire money managers can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nThere was, however, one Magnificent Seven stock that didn't have billionaires abandoning ship. During the December-ended quarter, eight billionaires gobbled up shares of e-commerce company Amazon, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe lure of Amazon for billionaires is that its business isn't as reliant on e-commerce as you might think. Although e-commerce accounts for a sizable percentage of Amazon's sales, online retail sales are low margin. If the U.S. economy were to stumble and online retail sales tapered off, it won't have much impact on Amazon's cash flow.\n\nBy comparison, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income from its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was responsible for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending in the third quarter of 2023. As long as AWS continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, Amazon's cash flow can motor substantially higher.\n\nDespite a huge rally in its share price, Amazon remains inexpensive, relative to its cash flow. The reason I'm using cash flow, as opposed to the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, is because Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business. After ending every year of the 2010s at a multiple of between 23 and 37 times its cash flow, Amazon shares can be picked up right now for a little over 12 times forecast cash flow in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best momentum stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our overview of the different kinds of trading strategies and some latest stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy Now.\n\nWhen it comes to trading, a strategy can typically follow two different directions. One of the more commonly understood trading strategies is trading by the fundamentals. This strategy looks at a firm's ability to make money, and it analyzes the income statement and the balance sheet to take stock of costs, assets, and other financial metrics that could hint at growth in the future and the corresponding share price appreciation.\n\nThe second direction or strategy is played by the technical indicators. As opposed to looking at fundamentals such as earnings per share or dividends, a technical trading approach instead analyzes share price trends and movements. It takes stock of a variety of factors such as the volume of shares traded, whether a stock is overbought or oversold if its share price is above or below long term averages, and the percentage of returns delivered by the price. By combining these factors, technical analysts believe that they capitalize on emerging market trends before they blow up and make a profit.\n\nOne kind of technical trading strategy is called momentum trading. For those out of the loop, analyzing a stock's momentum is unrelated to its balance sheet. Instead, it involves looking at the share price movements to see whether further upside or downside is present to merit an investment decision. Inside the momentum trader's toolkit are several 'tools' such as average directional indexes, moving averages, stochastic oscillators (also called a relative strength index (RSI)), and simple trend lines that gauge whether current share price levels are part of a broader upward or downward trend.\n\nTogether, these allow for informed decision making. For instance, let's consider a hypothetical stock A. A has an RSI reading of 19, a long term upward share price trend, and an ADX reading of 40. This might lead an investor to correctly conclude that since the RSI reading indicates that the stock is oversold, and the share price is trending upwards, then a high ASX reading could potentially present a chance for a profit since it indicates the presence of a trend. Of course, just as all investment decisions should be made after consulting a qualified investment professional, trying to read the technical tea leaves can yield better results if conclusions like the one in our example are also evaluated along with a fundamental reading. So if Stock A has high debt and falling revenue, then unless insiders or institutional investors know something that the broader market does not, it might not be worthwhile to wager holding A for a long time period.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith that out of the way, one way in which momentum stocks benefit is through the effects of macroeconomic news, events, and developments on the stock market. Throughout 2022 and 2023, the market has been held hostage by these events if we're being honest. Whether it's predictions of a recession, interest rate hikes, or high inflation, the market has seen investors flip between being bears and bulls depending on the nature of the data set. Right now, all eyes are on the Federal Reserve and the inflation readings for January 2024 that will help investors decide when the Fed might start cutting interest rates to ease business conditions and provide a further boost to the market.\n\nSince the times are quite dynamic for the stock market, we decided to take a look at some top momentum stocks that hedge funds are buying. After all, even the smallest of news could spark a pop and the hedge funds will be there in the waiting to reap the profits. Some top momentum stocks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). 13 Best Momentum Stocks To Buy Now\n\nA classic Ferrari sports car against a lush green hillside, symbolizing the company's luxurious performance.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best momentum stocks, we ranked the top 100 holdings of the iShares MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end.

Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best magic formula stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nConsidering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.\n\nOne investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades.\n\nHowever, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods.\n\nLike some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money.\n\nIn Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors.\n\nSo what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). 11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRommel Canlas/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy now, we scanned the Q4 2023 investment portfolio of Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management and picked out the top holdings in U.S. dollar terms.\n\nFor these best magic formula stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now\n\n11. Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

        "title": "Amazon addition helps Dow stay 'relevant'",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.\n\nOn Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\n\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you’re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that’s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\n\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120 year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\n\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that over the last several years with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\n\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy filing in October.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We don’t not like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.

Amazon.com is being added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, joining Apple, Walt Disney, Walmart and other companies that make up the 30-stock average. (AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.\n\nPart of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.\n\nAmazon is now the third of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year. Meanwhile the Dow Jones has risen 16% in the same timeframe.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Metaverse has begun to take center stage in the digital landscape, turning out to be more than just a fashionable technological concept. Now that generative AI has garnered a lot of attention, emphasis is turning to the growing interest in metaverse.\n\nMeta META founder and CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, in the company’s fourth-quarter 2023 conference call, stated that the tech giant has made substantial investments in both AI and metaverse, essential components of the company's long-term vision over the next decade.\n\nAccording to Nasdaq, the metaverse hype has surged within publicly traded companies, evidenced by a notable uptick in references during quarterly conference calls after Facebook's rebranding to Meta Platforms.\n\nAnticipating Metaverse’s Market Expansion\n\nAccording to Earthweb, as quoted on CompTIA, the global metaverse market is projected to witness a CAGR of 47.2%, reaching $426.9 billion by 2027.

McKinsey further forecasts that by 2030, over 50% of live events will migrate to metaverse, with its influence extending to over 80% of commerce.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to Gartner, as quoted on CompTIA, an estimated 25% of individuals are anticipated to dedicate at least an hour daily to activities within the metaverse by 2026. Meanwhile, by the same year, it's projected that 30% of global organizations will have developed products and services tailored for metaverse.\n\nSectoral Opportunities:\n\nMany industries are positioned to take advantage of the exceptional potential for growth and innovation that metaverse has to offer. Metaverse presents a dynamic environment for industries to flourish in, ranging from gaming and healthcare to banking, manufacturing and other fields.\n\nHealthcare\n\nThe influence of metaverse in healthcare has seen rapid growth in recent years. The impact of emerging technology in the healthcare space is poised to witness a CAGR of 34% till 2028, reaching a valuation of $44.44 billion, according to Research and Markets.\n\nHowever, the sector is in its developing stages.

North America leads the gaming metaverse market thanks to its early adoption of technology and the domination of major players in the sector like Microsoft and Meta. With significant investments from firms like Tencent and Sony, Asia Pacific has emerged as a noteworthy competitor.\n\nAccording to Statista, the user base in the Metaverse Gaming market is anticipated to reach 943.3 million by the year 2030, with the user penetration rate surging to 14.2% by 2030 from 4.7% in 2024.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nBelow, we highlight a few metaverse ETFs for investors to capitalize on the optimistic outlook of the emerging technology.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV)\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF follows the Ball Metaverse Index which seeks to track the performance of globally-listed equity securities of companies that engage in activities or provide products, services, technologies or technological capabilities to enable the metaverse and benefit from its generated revenues.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF has gathered an asset base of $451.2 million and charges an annual fee of 0.59%.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade as revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed over 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third-most-valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adjused EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Ruben Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Can Continue to Rise in 2024: 2 Monster Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "It's been a rocky road for the Nasdaq Composite over the past few years. But after slumping 33% in 2022, it soared 43% last year, and this bullish trend has persisted into early 2024.\n\nInterestingly, the Nasdaq has demonstrated a solid ability to rebound for at least a couple of years after downturns. For example, after declining nearly 32% in 2002, the Nasdaq jumped about 50% and 9% respectively in 2003 and 2004. And, after crashing by almost 41% in 2008, the technology-heavy index posted hefty returns of around 44% and 17% respectively in 2009 and 2010.\n\nWith this pattern in mind, there's good reason to expect decent performance from the Nasdaq in 2024. And with artificial intelligence (AI) emerging as a major investment theme, this trend could well continue. Against this backdrop, here's why Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are smart buys now.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft, a stalwart in the technology sector, delivered outstanding results for its fiscal 2024's second quarter (ended Dec. 31, 2023), surpassing consensus estimates in revenue and earnings. Not surprisingly, shares of the company have gained nearly 54% in the past year.\n\nAt the heart of Microsoft's recent success lies its strategic embrace of generative AI through a long-standing partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Microsoft's cloud computing platform Azure is rapidly capturing market share thanks to its focus on offering innovative cloud-based AI services. Azure accounted for a 24% share of the enterprise spending on cloud infrastructure services in the fourth quarter, up from 23% in the previous quarter.\n\nAzure's superiority in training and inferencing large language models has positioned it as the preferred choice for AI workloads. Moreover, Microsoft's strategy of offering diverse AI software models and AI chips integrated deeply with Azure infrastructure has attracted a sizable customer base of 53,000 Azure AI users. Since one-third of these customers have been new to Azure itself over the past 12 months, AI services are also playing a pivotal role in expanding Azure's overall market presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft has recently introduced a suite of AI-powered features called CoPilot, which are seamlessly integrated into the company's core products to improve their productivity and efficiency. Additionally, the company has further expanded CoPilot's target addressable market by offering out-of-the-box integrations with third-party applications. With widespread adoption expected across various sectors, CoPilot can have a significantly positive impact on the company's average revenue per user in the coming months.\n\nBeyond AI, Microsoft's core PC and gaming businesses are also exhibiting resilience and potential for expansion.\n\nMicrosoft stock is currently trading at just under 37 times trailing-12-month earnings and about 13 times sales, which is quite expensive. However, this premium is justified considering the company's proven track record of innovation and its prowess in the AI market -- making it a compelling investment option for 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nAfter a dramatic sell-off in 2022, social media giant Meta Platforms has made a staggering turnaround, with shares surging by almost 164% in the past year. The stock has even spiked recently by nearly 20% in a single day after posting stellar fourth-quarter 2023 results and solid guidance for the first quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nAccording to Magna, U.S. ad spending on social media platforms is expected to grow year over year by 11.9% in 2024. With 3.2 billion people using at least one of its applications (including Facebook, WhatsApp, Threads, Instagram, and Messenger) daily, Meta seems well-positioned to capitalize on this growing market opportunity.\n\nFurthermore, the company's focus on cost-cutting and efficiency optimization has also played a major role in driving up its operating margins to 41% in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2023, up from 20% in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\nAccording to Insider Intelligence, Meta is expected to account for a 20.4% share of U.S. digital advertising sales in 2024. To further strengthen its dominant position in the digital advertising landscape, the company has been increasingly leveraging AI technologies to increase user engagement on its social media platforms and improve ad performance.\n\nMeta has been working on unifying its AI-powered video recommendation system across all of its applications. This is expected to provide users with the best content across applications, thereby resulting in an improved user experience. The company also plans to use its AI-powered chatbot assistants to boost user engagement and help users interact with businesses and creators.\n\nMeta continues to invest in its AI-powered Advantage+ portfolio of solutions to help advertisers automate ad creation and audience targeting while controlling costs. The company has also introduced generative AI features in ad creative tools in areas such as text variations and image expansion, which have been rolled out globally and are already providing value to advertisers. Although in an early stage, these features are expected to be meaningful revenue contributors over time.\n\nMeta is currently trading at 8.8 times its trailing-12-month sales, significantly higher than its five-year average of 6.8. However, the premium seems justified considering the company's large and engaged user base, improving financials, and robust AI initiatives. Hence, the stock seems a smart pick now, even at the current elevated valuation levels.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, traces its origins to Goldman Sachs' asset management division, a leading global investment bank. With an initial investment of $10 million from a select group of investors in 1995, Asness utilized quantitative methods to swiftly expand the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund to over $100 million within a matter of months. Despite Asness departing from Goldman Sachs to establish his hedge fund in 1998, the Alpha Fund continued its growth trajectory, managing assets worth $12 billion by 2007.\n\nCliff Asness often appears on television and podcasts, where he shares his expertise on financial matters. In a Bloomberg podcast last year, he expressed apprehension about overinflated stock prices, cautioned about challenges in the commercial real estate sector, and even forecasted the possibility of a looming financial crisis.\n\n“My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it’s equities that I think are a scary place. They’re not priced very consistently with bonds, and we’re going to find out who’s right in the next year.”\n\nAsness recently grabbed attention by reiterating his stance on emerging-market equities outperforming the US market, despite this trade's lackluster performance in recent years. AQR allocates approximately $8 billion of its $99 billion under management to an emerging-market equities portfolio, managed collaboratively like its other funds. This perspective challenging the dominance of US stocks aligns AQR with other major players in the industry, such as Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the billionaire's hedge fund closed out 2023 with impressive double-digit returns across several of its funds, driven by strong performance in stock selection, bonds, European natural gas, and iron ore, as reported by Reuters. The investment manager achieved a net return of 18.5% for the year in its AQR Absolute Return strategy, its longest-running multi-strategy fund. This marked a notable comparison to the almost 44% net return achieved in 2022. Asness had predicted in January 2023 that this particular investing approach, involving \"going long cheap companies and shorting expensive ones\" within specific sectors, would be particularly appealing for the year. With that in mind, lets look at some of the top stocks in the AQR Capital Management portfolio, which include the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness\n\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.

Latest 13F filings show that AQR Capital Management owned 1.7 million shares of Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 worth $351.6 million.\n\nOn December 12, Argus upgraded Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)’s stock from a Hold to a Buy rating, with a $550 price target. This upgrade followed the company's decision to discontinue merger discussions with The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), a move perceived to have multiple downsides according to the analyst.\n\nBy the end of last year’s fourth quarter, 86 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey’s research had bought a stake in Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM). Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owned the biggest stake which was worth $688 million.\n\nMuch like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\n12. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 76\n\nAQR Capital Management's Stake: $352.6 million\n\nThe Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is a for-profit American multinational managed healthcare and insurance company headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut. With a global presence spanning 30 countries, the company serves over 86 million customers and continues to be a prominent leader in providing global healthcare benefits. Securities filings show that AQR Capital Management owned over 1.179 million shares of The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) at the end of December 2023 worth $352.6 million, representing 0.66% of the portfolio.\n\nAs of the close of Q4 2023, 76 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), a slight increase from the previous quarter. The consolidated worth of these stakes is more than $4.49 billion.\n\nDavis Funds mentioned The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Cigna Group, a well-regarded provider of managed care.\n\n11. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nAQR Capital Management's Stake: $379.78 million\n\nPulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is a prominent American residential home-construction company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. As of 2023, it held the position as the third-largest home-construction company in the United States in terms of the number of homes closed. Cliff Asness’ investment firm reduced its stake in PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) by 11% to $379.78 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) reported a profit of $711 million or $3.28 per share, a decrease from $882 million or $3.85 per share in the same period last year. The company sold 7,615 homes, which was below expectations, at an average price of $547,000, down from $561,000 a year ago. The decline in home sales was attributed to the surge in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to nearly 8%, the highest level in two decades. These high rates led many potential homebuyers to postpone their purchases and prompted sellers to offer concessions. However, as mortgage rates moderated in the latter half of the quarter, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) experienced a 57% increase in net new orders to 6,214 homes valued at approximately $3.4 billion. This growth was driven by a more favorable selling environment and a decrease in cancellations, which decreased to 9% of backlog from 11% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAfter looking through 933 hedge funds for their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings, Insider Monkey discovered that 38 were the firm’s investors.\n\n10.

Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n7.

Moreover, operating profits are rising due to an organization-wide focus on improving productivity and accelerating the time to market for new products.

        "content": "The Federal Reserve's Chairman Jerome Powell is planning on slashing benchmark interest rates at a slower pace than expected, as indicated during the 60 Minutes interview with CBS. This revelation caused the equity market rally to take a beat, as the previously expected March rate cuts are now written off.\n\nThe stronger-than-expected jobs growth last month might keep inflation levels elevated in the near term, hindering the Fed from achieving its 2% inflation growth target in the event of premature rate cuts.\n\n\"We want to see more evidence that inflation is moving sustainably down to 2%,\" Powell said during the interview, \"Our confidence is rising. We just want some more confidence before we take that very important step of beginning to cut interest rates.\"\n\nOnly 37% of market participants are anticipating a rate cut in March, down from 47% recorded in the last week of January. According to a CNBC survey, only 9% of respondents expect a rate cut in March. Market participants are now expecting only three or slightly more rate cuts.\n\nDespite the stalled rate cuts, these Magnificent Seven stocks are poised to deliver strong returns in the near term.\n\nTesla\n\nAfter surging by nearly 68% in 2023, Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had a rough start to 224, with the stock down nearly 24% year-to-date. The company's total revenues came in at $25.17 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter of 2023, up 3% year-over-year, but missed the consensus estimate of $25.16 billion by London Stock Exchange Group (LESG) analysts. Tesla's EPS amounted to $0.71 in the last quarter, missing the consensus estimate of 74 cents.\n\nTesla also issued a weaker growth forecast for 2024 in a statement, as it is currently focused on expanding its operations and production capabilities. The stock was recently downgraded by Daiwa Capital's analyst Jairam Nathan to Neutral. He also reduced the price target on TSLA from $245 to $195, indicating a current upside of just over 5% on the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Our company is currently between two major growth waves: the first one began with the global expansion of the Model 3/Y platform and the next one we believe will be initiated by the global expansion of the next-generation vehicle platform. In 2024, our vehicle volume growth rate may be notably lower than the growth rate achieved in 2023, as our teams work on the launch of the next-generation vehicle at Gigafactory Texas,\" the company stated in a press release.\n\nTesla is currently engaged in a power struggle on the management front as well, as CEO Elon Musk, who has a 13% ownership stake in the company, is seeking to expand its voting control to 25%.\n\n\"I am uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics without having ~25% voting control. Enough to be influential, but not so much that I can't be overturned,\" Musk said.\n\nHowever, given Tesla's brand popularity and near-term growth prospects, the company is set to resume its growth trajectory once the internal management conflict is resolved. Piper Sandler is bullish on Tesla stock and currently has an Overweight rating with a price target of $225, indicating a potential upside of over 22%. Wedbush also maintains a similar Outperform rating with a price target of $315, indicating a potential upside of more than 70%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler.

Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is up nearly 30% year-to-date, making it one of the best-performing Magnificent Seven stocks so far this year.\n\nDespite the stalled rate cuts, investors and analysts are bullish on the stock, as evident from META's latest surge. Over the past five days, META stock is up nearly 17%.\n\nThe company recently initiated a cash dividend payout of $0.50 per share for the first time while expanding its share buyback by $50 billion, equivalent to 5% of its total outstanding shares.\n\nMeta Platforms boasted a stellar growth rate in its latest earnings report, as the company's net income tripled year-over-year to $14 billion in the fiscal fourth quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles.

        "content": "OpenAI’s recent introduction of Sora could provide the next step forward in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) within the Metaverse. This will create an opportune moment for certain next-big-thing stocks. If generative AI technologies were a major focus of 2024, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of its new Vision Pro product might help drive more widespread adoption of Metaverse concepts. One hurdle has been developing fully immersive and natural virtual worlds that move seamlessly with the user. Sora could address such challenges and make Metaverse experiences more appealing to broader audiences. These improvements can pave the way for the next big thing stocks in the tech industry.\n\nSeveral companies have already applied AI tools within Metaverse platforms, with gaming industry leaders demonstrating particular interest. According to some projections, the video games sector currently generates an estimated $282 billion annually. However, the Metaverse may contribute more than $615 billion to the global economy by 2030. Even Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has unveiled initial Metaverse products. This includes its HoloTile system, which allows virtual mobility without physical movement. This could potentially lead to several next big thing stocks.\n\nBelow are three companies well-positioned to capitalize on OpenAI’s breakthrough. They will also help drive AI integration within emerging Metaverse technologies, making them potential next big thing stocks:.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META), Facebook’s parent company, went as far as to change its name to reflect its focus on the next big tech: the Metaverse. The company has invested more than $27 billion in developing and advancing Metaverse technologies since 2019. It continues investing heavily in the next big thing. In addition to Metaverse applications and other software, Meta also manufactures and sells its Mixed Reality headsets. These compete with Apple’s Vision Pro at a much more affordable price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also largely involved in AI. They explore how it can be applied within Metaverse’s virtual and augmented reality (AR) experiences. It sees the Metaverse as the next big thing in online social experiences. Also, it appears to be positioning itself at the forefront of the tech industry.\n\nTrading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.9 times, Meta’s valuation is below the average 43.5x of the tech sector. With Metaverse representing a promising new frontier while being heavily invested in it makes the company one of the next big thing stocks to consider.​\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up.

While other companies have taken a more consumer and entertainment-focused approach to developing the Metaverse, Microsoft is adopting a strategic work/industrial lens. Although the company now derives most revenue from other business segments, its ties to the Windows operating system allow it to integrate advanced technologies like AI and cloud computing seamlessly. If generating static images within the Metaverse requires substantial cloud computing resources, generating immersive moving images will probably demand even greater capacity. This positions Microsoft well to boost its largest revenue stream further as virtual worlds consume higher volumes of video.\n\nWith a forward P/E ratio of 36.5 times, Microsoft offers a modest dividend yield of just 0.7%. This reflects the market’s view of the stock as a potential next big thing. Microsoft is another of the next big thing stocks to consider as it leverages its strategic investments and platform advantages in AI and cloud to capitalize on new Metaverse opportunities.​\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) Roblox has been known as a pioneer in the Metaverse gaming sector. The company has seen notable growth thanks to strategic AI and virtual reality (VR) moves. It is currently working on integrating generative AI into developing and expanding immersive experiences. The company’s strategy drove 26% revenue growth in the prior year, with guidance for at least 18% sales growth this period.\n\nDespite planning big investments to expand its user base, Roblox maintained a positive free cash flow in the last reporting year, ending with $2.2 billion in net liquidity. Analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic view on the stock, with an average target price of $49.03 representing solid upside to the current $42.91.\n\nThis could position Roblox at the forefront of the next big thing in tech but also gaming. This makes it a tempting opportunity for investors seeking exposure to Metaverse’s digital landscape and a solid addition to the list of next big thing stocks.​\n\nDisclaimer:On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Wall Street thinks stocks have room to run even higher than originally thought",
        "content": "The high-water mark for Wall Street's S&P 500 (^GSPC) predictions has moved up yet again.\n\nThe benchmark index has hit new record highs to kick off 2024. The surge in stocks has alreadyput the S&Pabove the average Wall Street strategist year-end target less than two months into the year. And now, two strategistsare boosting their projections for how far stocks can run in 2024.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target from 5,100 to 5,200. On Tuesday, UBS also boosted its target. The UBS Investment Bank equity strategy team led by Jonathan Golub now sees the S&P 500 ending this year at 5,400, up from a prior call of 5,100. This reflects nearly an 8% increase from Tuesday's opening price.\n\n\"Despite our bullish outlook, it appears we were not bullish enough,\" Golub wrote.\n\nBoth Goldman Sachs and UBS expressed a more upbeat outlook for corporate earnings this year than previously forecast when describing why they see further upside in stocks.\n\nTheir new predictions come as earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to grow 3.2% in the fourth quarter, up from a 1.9% projection a month ago, per FactSet. For the full year 2024, analysts project the S&P 500 will grow 10.9%.\n\nIn a research note boosting the bank's S&P 500 projection on Feb. 16, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote earnings growth will be \"the primary driver\" of remaining upside for stocks during 2024.\n\nKostin noted that the more upbeat outlook on earnings stems from \"upgraded outlooks on US economic growth and mega-cap profit margins.\" Specifically, Goldman's call on earnings growth stems from megacap companies. The Charging Bull or Wall Street Bull is pictured in Manhattan, Jan. 16, 2019. (Carlo Allegri/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIn the past three months, earnings estimates for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) have increased by 7%. Meanwhile, margin expectations have been revised up 86 basis points. This contrasts trends seen across the other 493 stocks, which have seen a downward earnings revision of 3% and 30 basis point downward revision in margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis leads Goldman to believe the Technology (XLK) and Communication Services sectors (XLC), which include five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks, will lead the earnings growth in 2024.\n\n\"We expect demand drivers including AI growth and consumer strength will support revenue growth in these sectors, while margins will continue to expand as these companies focus on operating efficiency,\" Kostin wrote.\n\nHe added: \"The rest of the S&P 500 should also improve margins in 2024, but to a much smaller degree.\" Goldman Sachs projects an outsized portion of the S&P 500's net profit margin growth in 2024 to come from two sectors: Information Technology and Communication Services. (Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research)\n\nOf course, there are still many risks to the stock market rally. One that has weighed on stocks in recent days is the prospect of sticky inflation. Stocks sold off on Feb. 13 in reaction to a hotter-than-expected inflation report that sparked fears that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as soon as hoped.\n\nBut UBS'sGolub points out that sticky inflation might not be all bad for corporates.\n\n\"Returns and profits are measured in nominal dollars. Put differently, higher inflation tends to be a positive for stock prices,\" Golub wrote. \"While the market sold off on more robust [Consumer Price Index] and [Producer Price Index] reports last week, our work indicates that these demand-driven readings are constructive for future returns.\" A graph from UBS shows that \"earnings benefit from higher inflation.\" (UBS Investment Bank)\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade. Revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed 184% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), which saw their shares rise 91% and 67%, respectively.\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads over Nvidia.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adj. EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Robin Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Stock buybacks are one of the many actions companies use to attract investors and raise their share price. A board of directors typically approves when a company repurchases its shares in the stock market, decreasing the overall number of outstanding shares. Increasing the overall stack of each shareholder, which is the main reason a company will buy back its share, improves overall shareholder returns and is a positive sign regarding the financial position of a particular company.\n\nThe initiation of share buybacks is a solid sign to investors that a company’s management believes its share price is trading at a discounted value. Investors looking for great bandwagon stocks that have begun to approve and implement share buybacks should check out these companies below. They have all seen very good returns over this last year and offer investors a unique buying opportunity at the moment.\n\nUber Technologies (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) is a company that operates through multiple segments, including ground transportation services such as ridesharing, public transit and rentals; a delivery segment that includes meal and grocery delivery services; and also a freight segment that provides shipping carrier capabilities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nUber has been a substantial bandwagon stock over the prior year because its share price has more than doubled. On Feb. 7, Uber reported earnings for the fourth quarter full year 2023, which stated that total revenue grew by 15% and net income more than doubled compared to the previous year.\n\nA week after its recent earnings release, Uber Technologies announced a share repurchase program authorized by the board of directors of up to $7 billion. Following this press release, Uber’s stock price surged by 15%.\n\nUber is another bandwagon stock that has continued to impress investors, and after its share repurchase announcement, its stock price is likely to continue to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nStellantis (STLA) Stellantis (STLA) logo at the transmission factory. The Stellantis subsidiaries of FCA are Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, and Ram.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nStellantis (NYSE:STLA) engages in the manufacturing of vehicles such as pickup trucks, sedans, SUVs and luxury cars. Its brands include Chrysler, Dodge, Jeep, Ram, Peugeot, Maserati and Fiat.\n\nOn Feb. 15, STLA announced earnings for the fourth quarter full-year results, stating that total sales increased by 6% and net income rose by 11% compared to the previous year. Additionally, it was reported that North America and other international markets saw an increase in total vehicle sales within the same time period. Most notably, the Middle East and Africa segment which saw a 44% increase.\n\nStellantis announced a share buyback program within its latest earnings report, which may total up to €3.0 billion.\n\nAlong with the impressive share buyback initiative, Stellantis still has other positive aspects, including a decent dividend yield, which is 5.75% on an annual basis for one dollar and sixty cents per share paid annually, and the next payout is anticipated in May 2024. Its share price has also risen by over 50% within the last year. These enticing aspects of Stellantis make it a bandwagon company that continues to garner investor attention.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) someone using the Facebook (FB stock) app on their phone in front of a laptop that also has the Facebook webpage on it\n\nSource: Chinnapong / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a media and communication services company focusing on connecting individuals through personal computers and other mobile devices. Its popular applications include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Facebook Messenger.\n\nOver the past year, Meta’s stock price has been rising, increasing by 175%, primarily due to growing profit, particularly within its digital advertising segment.\n\nOn Feb. 1, Meta Platforms announced that it would initiate a dividend payout for investors for the first time, which would be 0.51% for fifty cents per share. And it also announced a $50 billion increase in its share buyback program.\n\nFollowing Meta’s earnings release for the fourth quarter of 2023, its share price surged by over 20% due to positive financial results, most notably a 24% increase in advertising revenue, which was previously mentioned and is one of its most profitable business segments.\n\nMeta Platforms has investors swarming to buy shares, especially following its last earnings report. A newly instated dividend yield and an upgrade to its share buyback program, makes it a solid choice for bandwagon investors.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position in UBER. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "content": "Why Nvidia (NVDA) Shares Are Trading Lower Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of leading designer of graphics chips Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fell 5.7% in the morning session after equities pulled back, with market participants likely taking profits ahead of a big earnings week. Tech stocks led the decline, with the Nasdaq index down 1% while the SP 500 fell 0.5%. Some of the notable stocks reporting earnings during the week include Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nStocks have had a good run since the fourth quarter of 2023 as markets expect the Fed to begin cutting rates as early as the first half of 2024 amidst cooling inflation data. The market's momentum continued into the early weeks of 2024 following solid earnings results from big tech names, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Nvidia? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nNvidia's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 8 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 15 days ago, when the company gained 5.1% on the news that Goldman Sachs analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target on the company's stock from $625 to $800, and maintained a Buy rating. The price target represented a potential 16% upside from where shares traded when the update was announced. The analyst added \"We believe Nvidia will remain as the industry gold standard for the foreseeable future, given its robust hardware and software offerings and, importantly, the pace at which it continues to innovate.\"\n\nNvidia is up 42.1% since the beginning of the year, and at $685.87 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $739 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Nvidia's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $17,263.\n\nUnless you’ve been living under a rock, it should be obvious by now that generative AI is going to have a huge impact on how large corporations do business. While Nvidia and AMD are trading close to all-time highs, we prefer a lesser-known (but still profitable) semiconductor stock benefitting from the rise of AI.

Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nRoku's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 32 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 4 days ago, when the stock dropped 22.3% on the news that the company reported fourth-quarter results and provided slightly underwhelming outlook for the coming quarters. The company lacked specificity that the market craves when discussing its full-year 2024 EBITDA forecast (it stated that EBITDA would be \"positive\" rather than sharing a number - Wall Street was expecting $100 million of EBITDA for 2024). Management cited challenging macroeconomic conditions and an uneven ad market recovery, and they anticipate seasonal revenue declines in line with Q1 2023, alongside tough year-over-year growth rate comparisons in streaming services distribution and a challenging media and entertainment landscape. Additionally, the company has averaged 8% upside to Wall Street's revenue estimates since Q3 2022, so Roku's more modest beat this quarter may be causing investors to level set with regards to expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn a more positive note, Roku beat analysts' revenue expectations as it grew its user base and outperformed in its Platform and Devices segments. Its revenue guidance for next quarter also topped analysts' expectations. Overall, this quarter's results seemed mixed, but the market was likely expecting more.\n\nRoku is down 24.2% since the beginning of the year, and at $67.48 per share it is trading 36.9% below its 52-week high of $106.87 from November 2023. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Roku's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,258.\n\nToday’s young investors likely haven’t read the timeless lessons in Gorilla Game: Picking Winners In High Technology because it was written more than 20 years ago when Microsoft and Apple were first establishing their supremacy. But if we apply the same principles, then enterprise software stocks leveraging their own generative AI capabilities may well be the Gorillas of the future. So, in that spirit, we are excited to present our Special Free Report on a profitable, fast-growing enterprise software stock that is already riding the automation wave and looking to catch the generative AI next.",

Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnowflake's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 25 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 11 days ago, when the company gained 5.3% after the Bureau of Labor Statistics provided a revised inflation reading for December 2023, which came in lower than expected (+0.2% m/m versus the prior reading of +0.3%). This further supports the narrative that inflation is cooling, likely giving the Fed more reasons to start cutting rates in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, stocks continued to rally as the Nasdaq rose 1.2% and the S&P 500 gained 0.57% to end another strong week of earnings with positive results from most of the big tech stocks that reported so far this season. Notably, Meta reported strong top and bottom-line beats, hinting at a potential rebound for the advertising sector in 2024. Cloudflare also reported solid earnings with guidance for sustained growth momentum in 2024, further boosting the market's optimism toward software stocks, especially those with cloud and AI capabilities. In addition,\n\nOverall, it was also a strong week for equities, with the S&P 500 breaking past the 5,000 level for the first time as the market continued to maintain the strong momentum from the last quarter of 2023.\n\nSnowflake is up 15.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $218.61 per share it is trading close to its 52-week high of $236 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snowflake's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $860.79.\n\nWhen a company has more cash than it knows what to do with, buying back its own shares can make a lot of sense–as long as the price is right. Luckily, we’ve found one, a low-priced stock that is gushing free cash flow AND buying back shares.

        "content": "The conventional wisdom is that hiring older, more experienced S&P 500 CEOs is the best way to ensure solid results, financially and in the markets. However, recent data from executive search firm Spencer Stuart suggests that conventional might not be the best way to handle the future changes all industries go through.\n\n“What worked at a CEO’s last job — at a different company with a different team facing a different set of micro and macro problems — is just not likely to work again.” stated Bloomberg Opinion contributor Beth Kowitt.\n\nAccording to Spencer Stuart consultant Cathy Anterasian, who specializes in CEO succession, almost 30% of new S&P 500 CEOs in 2022 were under 50, double 2018 levels.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs Kowitt finished her Feb. 12 opinion piece, “refusing to move on to the next generation of leaders can be a risk all its own.”\n\nIn fact, if you look at some of the most successful CEOs over the last 25 years, more than a few were 40 or under.\n\nHere are three under-50 S&P 500 CEOs with must-buy stocks.\n\nMatthew Meloy, Targa Resources (TRGP) Momentum stocks: Natural gas pipeline through green field with blue sky above\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMatthew Meloy has been CEO of Targa Resources (NYSE:TRGP) since March 1, 2020. Meloy was 45 as of March 30, 2023.\n\nSince taking the top job of the integrated midstream natural gas and NGLs (natural gas liquids) infrastructure company, its shares have gained nearly 200%, double the performance of Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM).\n\nIn May 2023, I recommended Targa as one of three stocks to buy whose share prices added up to $500, or thereabouts. At the time, analysts really liked its stock – 19 out of 20 rated it a Buy, with a target price of $98.50 – and I like the fact that its price-to-free cash flow was only 6.68. The inverse is free cash flow yield. Targa’s was 14.7%. Anything over 8% is value territory.\n\nWhere is it today?\n\nThere are 22 analysts covering its stock with 21 rating it a Buy and a $106 target price, 10% higher than where it’s currently trading. Based on trailing 12-month free cash flow of $826.2 million and a market capitalization of $21.6 billion, its free cash yield is 3.8%, which is slightly below fair value.\n\nStory continues\n\nYielding 2.1%, you pay more for quality.\n\nHassane El-Khoury, ON Semiconductor (ON) AI.

Semiconductors Stocks to Sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHassane El-Khoury has been CEO of ON Semiconductor (NASDAQ:ON) since December 2020. El-Khoury was 43 as of the company’s 2023 proxy.\n\nSince taking the top job of the provider of intelligent power and sensing solutions for the automotive and industrial markets, ON shares have increased by 163%.\n\nEl-Khoury had been the CEO of Cypress Semiconductor until its sale to Infineon Technologies (OTCMKTS:IFNNY) in April 2020 for 9 billion euros ($9.7 billion). Khoury, who hails from Lebanon, worked at Cypress for 13 years, becoming its CEO in August 2016.\n\nWhile its corporate name is ON Semiconductor, it operates under the Onsemi brand, which generated $8.3 billion in revenue and $2.26 billion in non-GAAP income in 2023.\n\nBetween 2024 and 2027, it plans to grow its revenue by 11% compounded annually at the midpoint of its guidance, with annual free cash flow of $3.75 billion in 2027 – it was $402 million in 2023, down from $1.63 billion, due to a 50% increase in capital expenditures toward its future growth – which should lead to a much higher share price.\n\nOf the 34 analysts covering its stock, 19 rate it a Buy, with a target price of $90.00, 14% higher than where it’s currently trading.\n\nMark Zuckerberg, Meta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s hard to believe but Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will only turn 40 this May.\n\nHe is the fourth wealthiest person on the planet with a net worth of $170 billion. In 2024, alone, his wealth increased by nearly $42 billion, more than double Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO and co-founder Jensen Huang. Zuckerberg has been CEO since founding the company in 2004.\n\nThere is no question that Meta’s revival over the past year – its stock is up 175% over the past 52 weeks – is one of the most significant turnarounds in recent history. It was dead in the water in early 2022 after reporting Facebook’s first ever drop in daily users.\n\n“Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg may be keen to coax the world into an alternate reality, but disappointing fourth-quarter results were quick to burst his metaverse bubble,” The Guardian reported Hargreaves Lansdown equity analyst Laura Hoy’s comments about the company’s 2021 results.\n\nIn 2021, it had operating income of $46.8 billion on $117.93 billion in revenue, good for a 39.7% operating margin. In 2023, it had an operating profit of $46.75 billion on $134.90 billion in revenue, 500 basis points lower than in 2021.\n\nHowever, when you consider how far it fell in 2022, the rebound is astounding. Further, it’s got plenty of irons in the fire to keep driving revenue and operating profits higher.\n\nNow, if it could only get its Reality Labs business making money, he’d soon become the world’s wealthiest person.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "After a weak start to 2024, Wall Street regained momentum, driven by a solid earnings season, a resilient economy and a technology surge. In fact, the S&P 500 topped the major milestone of 5,000 for the first time ever earlier this month.\r\n\r\nAs such, we have highlighted five stocks from the S&P 500 that have gained more than 25% halfway through the first quarter and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy), or #3 (Hold). These are Nvidia NVDA, Eli Lilly and Company LLY, Meta Platforms META, Uber Technologies, Inc UBER and Ralph Lauren Corp. RL. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nTotal fourth-quarter earnings of the 387 S&P 500 members who have reported results so far increased 5.1% from the prior-year period on 3.4% higher revenues. Of the companies that reported results, 79.1% beat EPS estimates and 65.1% surpassed revenue estimates. The pace of earnings and revenue growth represents an acceleration from the last couple of quarters, with the technology sector being a major contributor to this improving trend. Notably, the earnings growth is the best growth rate for the S&P 500 companies since the 6.5% earnings growth rate in the first quarter of 2022.\r\n\r\nThe resilience of the U.S. economy has played a crucial role in the stock market ascent, although it has reduced the likelihood of a near-term rate cut. Factors like robust retail sales, consumer sentiment and a cooling trend in the producer price index indicate the possibility of the Fed achieving a soft landing, bringing inflation back to target without triggering a recession. This economic resilience, coupled with surging shares of big technology companies and optimism over artificial intelligence, has been a significant driver of the market's upward trajectory.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks\n\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 47% so far this year. It saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 23 cents over the past month for the fiscal year ending January 2025 and has an estimated growth of 64.5%.\r\n\r\nNvidia has a Zacks Rank #2 at present and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly is one of the world’s largest pharmaceutical companies. It boasts a diversified product profile, including a solid lineup of new and successful drugs. It also has a dependable pipeline as it navigates through challenges like patent expirations of several drugs and rising pricing pressure on its U.S. diabetes franchise. The stock has rallied 34% this year.\r\n\r\nEli Lilly has an estimated earnings growth rate of 96.2% for this year. It has a Zacks Rank #3 and a Growth Score of B.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock has jumped 34% so far this year. Meta saw a solid earnings estimate revision of $1.91 over the past month for this year, with an estimated earnings growth rate of 31.9%.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B.\r\n\r\nUber develops and operates proprietary technology applications in the United States, Canada, Latin America, Europe, the Middle East, Africa and Asia, excluding China and Southeast Asia. The stock has gained 27.3% so far this year. Uber saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 8 cents over the past 30 days for this year and has an estimated earnings growth rate of 32.2%.\r\n\r\nThe stock currently has a Zacks Rank #2 and a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nRalph Lauren is a major designer, marketer and distributor of premium lifestyle products in North America, Europe, Asia and internationally.

        "content": "(Adds Google's statement in paragraph 4)\n\nJAKARTA, Feb 20 (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo said on Tuesday he had signed a regulation requiring digital platforms to pay media outlets that provide them with content, a move aimed at levelling the playing field between the media industry and big tech companies.\n\nDigital platforms in Indonesia include Meta Platforms' Facebook, Alphabet Inc's\n\n\"The spirit of the regulation is... to ensure a fair cooperation between media and digital platforms, provide clearer cooperation framework between them,\" said Jokowi, as the president is popularly known.\n\nGoogle said it will review the regulation. It has worked with news publishers and the government to build a sustainable news ecosystem in Indonesia, its spokesperson said.\n\nFacebook did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday.\n\nGoogle had last year said that the regulation would restrict public access to diverse sources of news instead of promoting quality journalism.\n\nJokowi said the drafting process of the regulation, proposed three years ago, had been very long due to different opinions among media and digital platforms.\n\nThe regulation posted on the government's website suggests cooperation between digital platforms and media companies could be in the form of paying licences or sharing data of news users.\n\nA committee would be formed to ensure digital platforms fulfil their responsibilities to the media companies, it said.\n\nThe regulation, which takes effect in six months, would not harm content creators as it applied only to digital platforms, Jokowi said.\n\nContent creators had previously complained it could restrict their operations.\n\nIndonesia's communication and information minister, Budi Arie Setiadi, said in a statement the regulation was part of government efforts to ensure media companies \"are not eroded\" by digital platforms.\n\nIn Australia, the News Media Bargaining Code took effect in March 2021 and tech firms have since signed deals with media outlets compensating them for content which generated clicks and advertising dollars, according to a report by its Treasury Department.

        "content": "The most you can lose on any stock (assuming you don't use leverage) is 100% of your money. But on the bright side, if you buy shares in a high quality company at the right price, you can gain well over 100%. One great example is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) which saw its share price drive 188% higher over five years. It's also good to see the share price up 40% over the last quarter. The company reported its financial results recently; you can catch up on the latest numbers by reading our company report.\n\nSo let's investigate and see if the longer term performance of the company has been in line with the underlying business' progress.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhile the efficient markets hypothesis continues to be taught by some, it has been proven that markets are over-reactive dynamic systems, and investors are not always rational. One imperfect but simple way to consider how the market perception of a company has shifted is to compare the change in the earnings per share (EPS) with the share price movement.\n\nOver half a decade, Meta Platforms managed to grow its earnings per share at 15% a year. This EPS growth is slower than the share price growth of 24% per year, over the same period. This suggests that market participants hold the company in higher regard, these days. That's not necessarily surprising considering the five-year track record of earnings growth.\n\nYou can see how EPS has changed over time in the image below (click on the chart to see the exact values). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? This freereport showing analyst revenue forecasts should help you figure out if the EPS growth can be sustained.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's nice to see that Meta Platforms shareholders have received a total shareholder return of 174% over the last year. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 24%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. In the best case scenario, this may hint at some real business momentum, implying that now could be a great time to delve deeper. If you would like to research Meta Platforms in more detail then you might want to take a look at whether insiders have been buying or selling shares in the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut note: Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Can Be the Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "Over the past 30 years, Wall Street has had no shortage of next-big-thing trends that have captivated investors. At the moment, nothing is garnering the attention of professional and everyday investors quite like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI, which involves the use of software and systems to oversee tasks normally overseen by humans, has application across almost every sector and industry. This is likely why the analysts at PwC believe AI has the potential to add $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia has become the infrastructure backbone of the AI revolution\n\nOver the past year, megacap Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has led the charge among artificial intelligence stocks. It's become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. The company's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are the brains of high-compute data centers that allow for split-second decision-making by AI software and systems.\n\nSince 2023 began, shares of Nvidia have nearly quintupled in value, with the company closing in on $1.5 trillion in added market cap, all thanks to AI. With enterprise demand particularly high for the company's AI-accelerated chips and supply still short, Nvidia has enjoyed exceptionally strong pricing power, which has driven most of its sales increase.\n\nBut with Nvidia shares closing at $726 last week, the prospect of a stock split may begin to look all the more enticing.\n\nA \"stock split\" is an event that allows a publicly traded company to alter both its share price and outstanding share count without having any impact on its market cap or operating performance. Think of it as a purely cosmetic change that can either make a company's shares more nominally affordable for everyday investors, as with a forward-stock split, or can increase a company's share price to ensure continued listing on a major exchange, as with a reverse-stock split. Nvidia would be looking at its second forward split in the past three years.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia isn't the only high-flying AI or AI-related stock that appears primed for a potential stock split. What follows are three AI companies that could beat this GPU juggernaut to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first artificial intelligence stock that could beat Nvidia to the punch and become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is none other than social media juggernaut Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta has never conducted a stock split, but its share price climbed to near $490 this past week.\n\nMeta is using AI in a variety of ways across its various products. In addition to helping with search and weeding out noncompliant posts made on its social media platforms, it's leaning heavily on generative AI to help businesses tailor their ads to users.\n\nMany of the investments Meta is making in AI and virtual/augmented reality probably won't result in a sizable increase in sales for years. In the meantime, it continues to generate almost 98% of its revenue from advertising. The company's social media real estate, which includes Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads, is tops in the world, with nearly 4 billion collective monthly active users in the December-ended quarter. Meta should have no trouble commanding exceptional ad-pricing power more often than not.\n\nSomething else to note about Meta Platforms is that it's a cash-flow machine. It generated more than $71 billion in net cash from operations last year, and it closed out 2023 with over $61 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. This treasure chest is what allows CEO Mark Zuckerberg the luxury of taking risks, which includes the development of Meta's own AI chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer\n\nA second AI-fueled company that can become Wall Street's next stock-split stock well ahead of Nvidia is server and storage-solutions specialist Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI). Like Meta Platforms, Super Micro has never conducted a stock split. However, with its stock briefly surpassing $1,000 per share last week, a forward split is probably in consideration.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's more-than-doubling in sales this year is a function of its highly customizable and energy-efficient rack-scale servers being in high demand. It's also a reflection of the company relying on Nvidia's AI-powered GPUs in its products. Businesses wanting to harness AI to expand their long-term growth potential and reach are increasingly turning to Super Micro.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is if Super Micro Computer can hold onto its nearly exponential returns over the past couple of weeks. Shares ended the previous week up 183% on a year-to-date basis, and are up 878% since the start of 2023. Historically, every next-big-thing investment over the past 30 years has endured an initial bubble. This is to say that investors have a terrible habit of overestimating the uptake of new technologies or innovations. AI will likely share this fate.\n\nThe other challenge for Super Micro is going to be whether or not it can maximize demand for its rack-scale solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Since Super Micro relies on Nvidia's GPUs, it's at the mercy of its suppliers. But if Super Micro can somehow meet or surpass Wall Street's already lofty growth expectations, a stock split could well be in the cards.\n\nBroadcom\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock that could leapfrog Nvidia and become one of Wall Street's next stock-split stocks is semiconductor giant Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). Before Avago acquired Broadcom in 2016 and kept its name, Broadcom had completed three splits. But Avago had never split its stock. As of Feb. 16, a single share of Broadcom was setting shareholders back a whopping $1,245.\n\nBroadcom is approaching AI inclusion a couple of ways. It's added AI features to its Trident networking processors, and in April 2023 introduced its Jericho3-AI chip for AI networks. Jericho3 is integral for high-performance data centers in that it's designed to connect up to 32,000 GPUs. In short, it's designed to handle increasingly faster workloads in enterprise data centers.\n\nOne factor that's definitely worked in Broadcom's favor is its juicy backlog. Although CEO Hock Tan failed to provide an update on Broadcom's backlog in fiscal 2023 (the company's fiscal year ends in late September), the company totaled a record backlog of $31 billion in mid-2022. Wall Street and investors love large backlogs, because it typically leads to highly predictable operating cash flow.\n\nBut something investors should keep in mind is that Broadcom is generating a significant percentage of its revenue from wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones. While this segment should continue to deliver modest growth and plenty of cash flow for Broadcom, it could, ultimately, hold back the company's overall growth rate given how large of a role it plays in net sales.\n\nWith one of the highest nominal-dollar share prices on Wall Street, Broadcom is a logical candidate to split its stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 Top AI Stock to Bet On the Future of Data Centers",
        "content": "Shares of data center equipment designer Arista Networks (NYSE: ANET) have been on fire, more than doubling since the start of 2023. The fourth-quarter 2023 earnings update justified this company's dominant position in the market as the realization settles in that artificial intelligence (AI) -- or maybe just accelerated computing -- is more than just a passing fad.\n\nBut as Arista is ultimately a hardware-based business, periods of rapid growth can quickly come to an end. In fact, growth is expected to slow a bit for Arista in 2024. Is this still a top stock to bet on the future of data center and AI computing?\n\n2023 was on fire, followed by a 2024 thud\n\n2023 was an epic rebound for Arista. After several years of building to its AI supercomputing crescendo, the company put up incredible growth numbers -- with \"Cloud Titan\" customers Meta(NASDAQ: META) (21% of total revenue last year) and Microsoft (18% of revenue) leading the charge. A flurry of big tech businesses have been building out new data center infrastructure in support of accelerated computing, and Arista is a key partner in helping them put all the pieces together.\n\nFinancial Metric 2023 Results YOY % Change Revenue $5.86 billion 34% GAAP earnings per share (EPS) $6.58 54% Adjusted EPS $6.94 52%\n\nData source: Arista Networks. ANET Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIn the chart above, you can see Arista's revenue and profitability really ratchet up in the wake of the pandemic. That's thanks in large part to the \"Cloud Titan\" customers (especially Microsoft and Meta) building and upgrading their data centers in support of all the new internet traffic they picked up the last few years. For Microsoft, that has been primarily its Azure cloud platform for businesses, and for Meta, its consumer-facing apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp needing to operate more traffic and launch new AI-powered advertising services for marketers. Arista's engineering teams have been busy helping both companies expand their data center capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut things could finally be starting to cool down in 2024, mostly due to the big data center customers moderating their spend on infrastructure (all together, including Meta and Microsoft, \"Cloud Titans\" accounted for 43% of total sales last year). Management said other enterprise customers should still grow, but the end result is a forecast for just 10% to 12% revenue growth in the year ahead. RW: Do these tables really add anything to the piece? We already mention the 10% to 12% forecast in the text and stacking these on top of each other might be more distracting than helpful. We could simply add this information into the text and alleviate some of the information bloat and we could make it more meaningful and clearer to less experienced readers in the process.\n\nGrowth is growth, so it's no big deal. After all, Arista is holding onto all of its big gains from the last few years. But the problem with a slowdown is that Arista stock now trades for a whopping 40 times trailing-12-month EPS and 42 times trailing-12-month free cash flow. That's about the highest valuation it has traded for in years, excluding during the pandemic when stocks went wild for a while. Is this really a good stock to buy right now, and is data center AI an enduring growth trend or not?\n\nArista's big advantage\n\nFor years, Arista has been gobbling up market share, especially at the expense of giant networking hardware leader Cisco. Cisco isn't exactly taking its eye off the ball, but it has been focused on software as of late. Remember its pending mega-acquisition of Splunk?\n\nBecause of this, and Arista's leading platform for network hardware and built-in software suite, I don't see any reason why the trend favoring Arista will change anytime soon, especially as new AI infrastructure (which Arista helps engineer, too) is further complicating data center needs going forward. Image source: Arista Networks.\n\nAnd while Arista is taking a cautious view to 2024, it is still confident in its ability to grow at a low-teens percentage clip over the long term. Along the way, it churns out high rates of profitability. At this point, the company has just over $5 billion in cash and investments on balance and no debt, which could fuel its ambitions.\n\nViewed in this light, Arista is a premium-priced stock, but reasonably so if you factor in excellent growth prospects over the next five years and beyond. I'm happy to hold my position, as Arista is a key partner for all sorts of data centers, and won't be dislodged easily as the AI era continues apace.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arista Networks right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arista Networks, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arista Networks wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Analyst upgrades consistently offer valuable insights, deftly guiding investors through market dynamics.\n\n2024 unfolds a promising economic landscape, diverging from past apprehensions. Contrary to previous fears, the U.S. economy is poised for a staggering $7 trillion growth over the next decade. Moreover, this positive outlook is reinforced by widespread analyst upgrades across various sectors, reflecting confidence in the economic backdrop.\n\nIn a historic milestone, February 2024 saw the S&P 500 breaching 5,000 points for the first time. Simultaneously, the NASDAQ Composite approached all-time highs, propelled by AI and other emerging technologies. Additionally, with analysts offering insights into potential upswings, here are three strategic opportunities to pounce on at this time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArdelyx (ARDX) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nArdelyx (NASDAQ:ARDX), a pioneering biopharmaceutical firm, is up a remarkable 200% surge over the past year. It’s been driven by IBSRELA, its innovative medication for irritable bowel syndrome and chronic kidney disease (CKD).\n\n2023 marked a transformative year for Ardelyx, with IBSRELA’s net sales reaching an impressive $22.3 million in the third quarter alone. The company’s revenue soared to $56.4 million, showcasing a phenomenal 1030.3% year-over-year (YOY) surge, surpassing projections by $33.83 million. Building on this triumph, Ardelyx achieved another feat with the FDA green-lighting XPHOZAH to treat CKD in dialysis patients.\n\nLooking ahead, TipRanks assigns Ardelyx as a strong buy, foreseeing a 38.27% upside potential with an average price target of $12.50. Citigroup joins the optimism, offering a buy rating and anticipating a substantial 54% upside potential. Together, these projections signal a promising investment opportunity in Ardelyx’s evolving biopharma journey.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the forefront of the metaverse revolution, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to redefine, shaping the future of social media. The company’s strategic focus revolves around augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR) technologies. Those include Ray-Ban’s smart glasses and Oculus VR headsets, which lay the foundation for spatial computing.\n\nIn a triumphant fourth-quarter, Meta surpassed expectations, posting adjusted earnings-per-share (EPS) of $5.33 on $40.11 billion in revenue. CEO Mark Zuckerberg highlighted crucial investment areas, particularly in artificial intelligence (AI), aiming to deliver top-tier AI products and services to enhance user experiences. Consequently, TipRanks analysts assign Meta Platforms a strong buy, foreseeing an average price target of $528.5 and signaling a robust 12% upside potential. Moreover, in a resounding endorsement, Wedbush assigns META an outperform rating, projecting a 10.2% upside potential and establishing an average price target ranging from $420 to $520.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the burgeoning demand for AI chips intensifies across enterprises, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to ruffle the feathers of its competition.\n\nRecent revelations show that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms secured 60% of the 500,000 chips from Nvidia, explicitly stating their intention to switch to AMD as their preferred chip provider. AMD’s M1 mi300x chips position the company as a formidable competitor to Nvidia, presenting a genuine opportunity to challenge its market dominance.\n\nIn AMD’s recent financial report, the fourth quarter Non-GAAP EPS of 77 cents aligns with expectations, while the revenue of $6.2 billion showcases a robust 10.7% year-over-year increase, surpassing estimates by $60 million.\n\nMoreover, TipRanks analysts advocate for AMD, assigning a strong buy rating with an average price target of $194.94, indicating a substantial 12% upside potential. Wedbush analysts echo this positivity, bestowing an ‘outperform’ rating on AMD with a 14.95% upside potential and an average price target surpassing the $200 mark.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Growth Investors Shouldn't Overlook Meta Platforms (META)",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is one such stock that our proprietary system currently recommends. The company not only has a favorable Growth Score, but also carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nResearch shows that stocks carrying the best growth features consistently beat the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this social media company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 17.1%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.9% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 24.2%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nAsset utilization ratio -- also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio -- is often overlooked by investors, but it is an important indicator in growth investing. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.56, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nWhile the level of efficiency in generating sales matters a lot, so does the sales growth of a company. And Meta Platforms looks attractive from a sales growth perspective as well. The company's sales are expected to grow 17.3% this year versus the industry average of 10.7%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 10.7% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Meta Platforms a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Meta Platforms is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +23.4%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 16.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.20 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +59.1%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +16.9%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $19.62 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31.9%. This estimate has changed +10.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.65 indicates a change of +15.5% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +12%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $36.09 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +26%. The $158.3 billion and $179.01 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.4% and +13.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "20 Oldest Companies In The World",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 oldest companies in the world. If you would like to read about more companies, you can go to the 5 Oldest Companies In The World.\n\nBusiness and commerce have been integral to human civilization for a very long time. While older civilizations may be perceived as less advanced, they progressed in ways suitable for their respective times. The term \"Corporation\" finds its roots in the Latin term \"corpus,\" meaning a body of people. Records indicate that as early as the 4th century, Roman society recognized corporate entities with legal standing, allowing them to enter into contracts and seek legal remedies. Similar structures for businesses existed in other ancient civilizations, such as Europe, Japan, Britain, and India. Many cities had stock exchanges where investors could invest in shares and receive written proof of their ownership in specific companies.\n\nIn Western history, a few corporations stand out as particularly noteworthy, including the Dutch East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and England's East India Company. The East India Company went on to rule the Indian Subcontinent for over a century. It was allegedly one of the largest companies in history, surpassing the scale of well-known contemporary corporations like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nJapan is known to have the highest number of oldest companies. It is reported that over 52,000 businesses in Japan are over 100 years old, making it the country with the highest number of 100-year-old companies in the world. Some well-known names in the country included Nintendo Co., Ltd (TYO:7974), founded in 1889; Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd (TYO: 2587), founded in 1899; and Kikkoman Corporation (TYO:2801), founded in 1917. Meanwhile, the oldest company in Europe is a winery. While these companies operate across various industries, their key to enduring challenges over time lies in their ability to adapt to changes over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis raises questions about the secrets to a business's longevity and how other enterprises can draw lessons from these entities. Understanding these lessons becomes important, especially considering the decline in the average lifespan of a business listed in the S&P 500 index - from 67 years in the 1920s to approximately a decade today. In recent years, economic upheavals and competition have brought about the downfall of many corporate giants, ranging from financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank to renowned camera manufacturers such as Kodak.\n\nA key determinant for long-term survival is a commitment to innovation and continuous reinvention. A popular example is Nokia, which evolved from being a pulp manufacturer to entering the field of electricity and, eventually, mobile phones. At one point, Nokia's brand extended even to galoshes. Another illustrative case is Berkshire Hathaway, which was initially established as a textile mill in Rhode Island and later diversified its operations into a number of industries.\n\nHere's what Vltava Fund said about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Entire books have been published on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) transactions. One of the best that I can highly recommend is Adam Mead’s 2021 book, The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway. The book is excellent and detailed, but it, too, will need updating over time. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway writes another interesting chapter in its history every year. A chapter describing 2023 would be quite extensive. At the turn of the year, Berkshire completed its $11.6 billion acquisition of the insurer Alleghany Corporation. A little later, Berkshire increased its stake in Pilot Flying J to 80% and its holdings in five Japanese “sogo shosha” conglomerates to 8.5% (a total investment at current prices of about $20 billion). Through the course of the year, Berkshire also steadily increased its stake in Occidental Petroleum to 37% (including warrants). Berkshire Hathaway continues to be a very unique type of conglomerate whose investments generate huge amounts of cash and which can successfully reinvest that cash again and again over the long term. It is an almost perfect case of a snowball in the markets. Here is one interesting fact: we estimate that the intrinsic value of a single Berkshire share is currently growing at a rate of about $178 per day. When we bought the shares 12 years ago, this was less than $50 a day. The rate of growth is accelerating gradually and with minimal fluctuations. Moreover, Berkshire has additional decades of similar growth still ahead of it.” 20 Oldest Companies In The World\n\nFer Gregory/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 oldest companies in the world, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using reports from reputable websites such as Bloomberg and the Visual Capitalist.

Benediktinerstift Admont\n\nFounding Year: 1074\n\nAdmont Abbey was built in 1074 by the Archbishop of Salzburg and is the oldest surviving monastery in Styria, Austria. Located in a wooded region, the Abbey initially engaged in small-scale woodworking activities. Over time, this evolved into a significant commercial enterprise with the establishment of the Timber processing operation Stift Admont, also known as Stia. The brand manufactures natural wood floors, panels, and staircases.\n\n19. Affligem Brewery\n\nFounding Year: 1074\n\nThe Abbey of Affligem was built around 1074, which makes it one of the oldest known breweries and businesses in Belgium. The beers are now manufactured under license from the Affligem monks by Heineken International.\n\n18. Otterton Mill\n\nFounding Year: 1068\n\nThe oldest record of the Otterton Mill dates back to 1068. The mill uses waterpower to produce traditional stoneground whole meal flour. While milling experienced a decline in 1959, restoration efforts in 1977, driven by a local family's investment, successfully transformed the mill into a tourist destination.\n\n17. Weltenburg Abbey\n\nFounding Year: 1050\n\nLocated in Germany, Weltenburg Abbey is one of the two oldest surviving monastery breweries to date. Established in 617, the Abbey's brewing tradition is well-documented, with the oldest proof of its brewery dating back to 1050. Barock Dunkel is one of the brewery’s famous offerings that has received the title of best dark beer at the World Beer Cup on three separate occasions.\n\n16. Weihenstephan\n\nFounding Year: 1040\n\nSituated in Germany, Weihenstephan Abbey is also one of the two oldest surviving monastery breweries today. While the earliest reference to a brewery at the site dates back to 768, the officially licensed establishment of the brewery occurred in 1040, a date that Weihenstephan claims as its founding. The oldest documented evidence of its brewery, however, is from the year 1050.\n\n15. Shumiya-Shinbutsuguten\n\nFounding Year: 1024\n\nShumiya-Shinbutsuguten is the second oldest shrine and funeral goods maker. The company makes Buddhist altar equipment, vestments, temple fittings, funeral products, and tombstones. To keep up with changing times and declining demand for such products, the company is now adapting by offering traditional Japanese art goods to the global market. In this evolution, businesses of today, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), may find valuable insights from the resilience and adaptability of businesses like Shumiya-Shinbutsuguten.\n\n14. Ichimonjiya Wasuke\n\nFounding Year: 1000\n\nIchimonjiya Wasuke is a confectionery company in Kyoto, Japan. It sells Wagashi (a form of Japanese sweets). The 25th generation of the Hasegawa family runs the company. The family initially settled near the Imamiya Shrine around the year 1000, seeking refuge from a pandemic and aiming to cater to pilgrims visiting the shrine. To this day, the business continues to provide its treats to both shrine visitors and other tourists.\n\n13. Marinelli Bell Foundry\n\nFounding Year: 1000\n\nThe Marinelli family started their bell foundry slightly over a 1,000 years ago in Italy. Today, the site is located in the small village of Agnone, situated in Molise. In 1924, Pope Pius XI gave the foundry the title of \"pontifical foundry\" in recognition of its service to the Vatican. The Vatican remains the primary patron of this historic foundry.\n\n12. Château de Goulaine\n\nFounding Year: 1000\n\nThe Château de Goulaine is an ancient château in the Loire Valley wine region in France.

        "title": "Biden and Trump want to rein in Big Tech. Their campaigns can't avoid using it.",
        "content": "Tech giants are often a target for derision in Washington. Presidential campaigns are nonetheless sending a lot of money their way.\n\nFederal Election Commission records now offer a complete accounting of how the campaigns spent money in 2023. The files show millions of dollars being funneled to Silicon Valley to pay for digital advertising — one of the most effective ways to reach voters.\n\nWhat the filings also make it clear is how the other services of the tech giants are also as inescapable for campaign operators as they are for Americans going about their day-to-day lives.\n\nTake the two likely nominees: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and the logos of Facebook and Twitter. (AP Photos) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTrump has sporadically brought up antitrust concerns over the years and has gone so far as to launch his own social media platform, Truth Social, to get around what he calls \"biased Big Tech.\" But that doesn't mean he's not advertising on Facebook (META) this campaign season or using Amazon (AMZN) to stock his campaign's offices.\n\nPresident Biden similarly sits atop an administration engaged in legal battles against Amazon, Google (GOOG), and Meta — with a suit against Apple (AAPL) likely not far behind. But his presidential campaign still regularly patronizes those same companies.\n\nBiden has launched antitrust efforts by saying consolidation in tech and elsewhere creates \"fewer options for workers and consumers alike.\" It's a conundrum apparently facing his campaign as well.\n\nPresidential candidates have also been reliant on Big Tech while simultaneously criticizing the companies in years past. The 2020 campaign notably featured candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren advertising a plan to break up these companies — on their own platforms.\n\nThe expensive world of digital advertising\n\nCollectively, the Biden and Trump campaigns spent at least $30 million on advertising efforts in 2023. Some of that money headed to linear television, but much clearly ended up on the books in Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook is based, and Mountain View, Calif., the location of \"the GooglePlex.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPlenty of other corners of the business world — from airlines to restaurants to special-event organizers — come up repeatedly in the filings, but advertising represents the lion's share of the nearly $80 million in total campaign spending from Biden and Trump last year, according to FECrecords. Donald Trump's social media is seen on a phone screen with the Facebook logo in the background. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe question of exactly how much of those advertising budgets ends up in Big Tech's hands is somewhat harder to answer, with the money flowing through third parties.\n\nThe Trump campaign put at least $11.5 million in 2023 toward an array of outside firms for expenses categorized as as \"online advertising\" or \"placed media.\" Some have tried to track that money, with Bully Pulpit Interactive telling Axios last year it had traced hundreds of thousands to Facebook and Google ads within just the first few months of 2023.\n\nUpdated data wasn't immediately available, but the total spending almost surely grew over the course of the entire calendar year.\n\nThe Biden campaign has likewise sent millions to Democratic-aligned firms. A name that showed up frequently is Gambit Strategies. The firm is run by two former Biden aides and is focused on digital advertising touting \"unrivaled experience persuading and mobilizing voters online.\" The records show it collected over $8 million from the Biden campaign in 2023.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden and Trump campaigns declined to offer Yahoo Finance a more detailed analysis of their spending habits beyond what has been publicly reported.\n\nThe spending towards Big Tech comes even after years of criticism from the two men atop these campaigns. In 2023, Trump called Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a \"weirdo\" as he recounted their political differences. Biden often criticized Facebook and other platforms over how they handled COVID-19 misinformation, once saying the platforms were \"killing people.\"\n\nOffice supplies and Ubers\n\nThe filings show that below those top-line advertising numbers, campaigns spent liberally for a range of other technology services.\n\nBoth campaigns patronized Amazon, but for different reasons. The Biden campaign sent almost $60,000 to Amazon Web Services in 2023 to host its website. Trump's campaign spent as well, but in a different wing of CEO Andy Jassy's company, racking up over $30,000 in purchases of office supplies.\n\nBiden and Trump have had their run-ins with Amazon over the years.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission under Biden — along with 17 states — has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company charging the tech giant with using its \"monopoly power\" to inflate prices. Biden also engaged in a Twitter fight in 2022 with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO, over inflation and corporate taxes.\n\nTrump has also long feuded with Amazon and occasionally threatened antitrust action against the company when he was in office. \"People think it is a very antitrust situation,\" Trump said in 2018 of Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\n\nOther tech spending is perhaps more illuminating about the distinct cultures of the two campaigns.\n\nBiden's team appears to have spent a lot on Apple products. Over $170,000 was spent in 2023 at an Apple authorized service provider named \"Mac Business Solutions.\"\n\niPhone and MacBook purchases appear to be less numerous in Trump's filings, but the campaign nonetheless spent almost $9,000 directly with the company on purchases of \"office equipment.\"\n\nWhen campaign staffers need a ride, Trump's team proved much more likely to grab an Uber (UBER), with the ride-sharing company being expensed 10 times more often than Lyft (LYFT). Uber Eats also showed up frequently in the Trump filings.\n\nTeam Biden is much more mixed on this issue. Democratic aides split their fares between the two companies but slightly favored Lyft.\n\nNeither campaign seemingly had much in the way of direct contact with X, formerly known as Twitter. But Trump's operation paid $168 to Elon Musk's company, evidently for two premium subscriptions.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

At a CAGR of 9.2%, this market is expected to boost from $1620.94 billion in 2023 to $1769.82 billion in 2024. Population increase, government financing, education policy, parental involvement, and community development are the key elements propelling this rise. The latter market is anticipated to increase significantly during the next few years. At a CAGR of 8.8%, it will increase to $2483.77 billion in 2028. The emphasis on global competencies, inclusive education methods, infrastructure renovations, public-private partnerships, and teacher professional development are all factors contributing to the rise in the projection period.

Of course, there are academic aspects. Students receive intellectual stimulation at boarding schools that goes beyond what is offered in regular classrooms. The Association of Boarding Schools (TABS) conducted a poll called \"The Big Picture on Boarding Schools\" that included alumni and students from boarding schools, private day schools, and public schools. The survey's results included that, compared to 60% and 52% of graduates from private day schools and public schools, respectively, 77% of boarding school graduates claim that their institution offers leadership chances. 71% and 39% of graduates from private day schools and public schools, while, 87% of graduates say they were extremely well prepared intellectually for college.

In 2023, the industry-leading provider of student-centered online learning, Chegg Inc.

The university, which has over 45,000 students, will now offer spaces where students may interact and learn in the metaverse.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation also recently announced that it will invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the company whose artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT has gained widespread attention.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat.\n\nIn the life-changing decision of packing your bags and moving to a new destination, multifarious variables need to be analyzed thoroughly. Migration has been extensive over the past years-- 281 million people were estimated to be living outside their country of origin in 2020. While the drive behind migration could be influenced by multiple forces, the basic intention is to experience a prosperous and higher quality of life in a safe and secure environment, with the least amount of trouble. Therefore, an immigration decision that lands one in the worst countries to live in could create many problems.\n\nInternational Expat Migration Overview\n\nAn analysis of international migrant data reveals that the majority live in countries that can ensure higher opportunities for individuals and families. In 2020, 65% of migrants resided in high-income countries, 31% in middle-income, and 4% in low-income countries. It was also observed that the primary reasons for international migration to high-income countries were labor, family reunification, and education. Global data also indicates that Europe was the leading destination for expatriates in 2020 (87 million), followed by North America (59 million), and North Africa and Western Asia (approximately 50 million). The United States emerged as the country hosting the largest number of international migrants-- 51 million migrants in 2020.\n\nBest Vs Worst Countries for Expats\n\nWith such large numbers of people flowing in and out of countries, immigrant integration has become an international agenda. In fact, first-time migration has been incorporated into the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development. Thus, while countries worldwide are ensuring expat integration, certain country-specific conditions determine the success or failure of this endeavor. There are some countries that are ideal for relocation (check our article 20 Best Countries to Relocate to for more details) and others that are not such a great fit. Expats evaluate their new destination based on various factors, including but not limited to the quality of life (encompassing safety and security), healthcare and education facilities, ease of settling in, employment opportunities, personal financial conditions, housing, language, and bureaucracy. Therefore, countries that are unable to perform well in these indicators may develop a reputation as the worst choice for expats to live in.\n\nStory continues\n\nUS Losing Talented Expats\n\nFor ages, the United States has been a magnet for expats seeking better work opportunities. Renowned tech companies like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Meta (NASDAQ: META), among others, have attracted foreign talent in large numbers. However, due to the country’s grueling immigration policies and high cost of living, much of this talent is frustrated. Furthermore, substantial layoffs by the tech industry in the recent past have further fueled the fire and even provided an opportunity for other countries to accommodate such a labor force. Canada, for example, has launched its own work permit program to attract these individuals.\n\nTech companies, including Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) , continue to lay off employees despite better performance. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) laid off 1,900 employees in their gaming division, whereas Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), continuing their spree of layoffs, cut down 180 more employees and shut down two gaming initiatives: Game Growth and Crown Channel. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG) also confirmed laying off around a thousand employees.\n\nSuch working conditions and the rising cost of living due to inflation are causes of concern for expats. Not only will this affect their quality of life, but it will also foster dissatisfaction related to employment. 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the 15 worst countries to live in as an expat, we relied on data from two different expat indexes: Expat Insider 2023 and Worldwide Expat Index 2023 by William Russell. Expat Insider ranks countries on five essential indexes for choosing a country for relocation: quality of life index, ease of settling index, working abroad index, personal finance index, and expat essentials index. On the other hand, Worldwide Expat Index uses four components: happiness, health, employment, and quality of life. By averaging these two index rankings, we identified countries with an overall worse outlook for expats. A higher average ranking indicates a relatively worse choice of a country. In cases where the average ranking turned out to be the same, we used the Human Development Index (UN 2021) as a tie-breaker. The country with a lower HDI value was considered the worst.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet’s take a look at our list of 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat.\n\n15. Denmark\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 41\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 23\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 32\n\nBoth indexes present a picture where Denmark excels in the working/employment and quality of life sectors, as well as other expat essentials like the adoption of technological advancements. However, the country performs slightly poorly in the health category, scoring below 4.95 out of 10. Life has also been pointed out as expensive in this country, especially in the housing department. Of even greater importance is the difficulty that expats encounter in settling down in the country due to the inability to make friends with the locals and have a social life. Therefore, overall, Denmark is one of the worst countries to live in as an expat.\n\n14. United States\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 30\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 36\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 33\n\nAs a land of opportunity, the US has much to offer expats, ranking high on job and work growth possibilities in the country. The happiness score on the Worldwide Expat Index for the happiness factor is also in favor of the country, indicating a general satisfaction that people experience in the US. Nevertheless, the country performs quite poorly in the health section on both indexes, and the overall quality of life index is also not very encouraging. The cost of living is lamented as expensive by expats, which includes amenities such as public transportation, housing, and rent. Thus, while the US does have some attractive benefits that attract expats, caution must also be taken regarding various problems they might face.\n\n13. Brazil\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 15\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 53\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 34\n\nBrazil receives a very low ranking according to the Worldwide Expat Score, consistently performing poorly on all four components of the index, earning a score of only 3.08/10. According to the Expat Insider report, Brazil’s quality of life leaves much to be desired, particularly receiving a low ranking in the safety sector and showing little improvement in the health department. Individuals seeking better work or career opportunities in Brazil would also be severely disappointed. However, the country turns out to be a haven for expats in terms of ease of settlement.\n\n12. Belgium\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 38\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 31\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 34.5\n\nAs with other European countries, Belgium ranks fairly high for expats moving abroad with the intention of furthering their careers or finding lucrative jobs. However, the quality of life and health facilities are not attractive selling points for this country. Furthermore, expats have also complained about problems with integration into society. Overall, Belgium emerges as one of the worst countries to live in as an expat.\n\n11. Cyprus\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 32\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 40\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 36\n\nWhile Cyprus has much beautiful scenery to offer its expats, a closer look is necessary at some essential elements before making a relocation decision. Cyprus does not score very well on variables like happiness, health, and employment; therefore, it fares even worse in overall quality of life. Expats have also expressed dissatisfaction with their work culture, and it is expected that people looking for jobs would face hurdles in securing them. Thus, given such scores, Cyprus turns out to be a potentially worse country to live in as an expat.\n\n10. Indonesia\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 13\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 59\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 36\n\nIndonesia was observed to perform quite poorly on both indexes, particularly concerning the quality of life and healthcare facilities for expats. While the possibility of good career and job prospects is not entirely ruled out, they are also not very alluring. However, expats are unlikely to face significant social obstacles in settling down in the country, and the cost of living is relatively low. With a combined score from the two indexes, Indonesia does not fare well, earning the 10th position in our list of the worst countries to live in as an expat.\n\n9. South Korea\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 50\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 24\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 37\n\nSouth Korea has emerged as a challenging country for settling down. Finding friends and maintaining a social life seems difficult, and the country does not offer very good work prospects or much satisfaction with work culture. Expats have also reported financial problems. While the quality of life is not altogether bad, especially concerning healthcare, it is still not very high. South Korea scores quite low on the happiness factor as well, making it one of the worst countries for expats to relocate to.\n\n8. Malta\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 46\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 33\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 39.5\n\nPortraying a poor quality of life, Malta must be carefully considered before being chosen as a potential relocation country. Expats express dissatisfaction with the housing situation and the financial scenario in the country. The working culture, job prospects, and salaries are also not very attractive. However, Malta does not present too many issues for newcomers in blending in with society.\n\n7. Poland\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 35\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 46\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 40.5\n\nFor expats planning on moving to Poland, the language barrier is a real problem that must be accounted for before making this decision. This could also be the contributing factor in making Poland a tough country for finding friends and setting up a social life. However, working conditions are fair enough in the country, and the quality of living, as well as the cost of living, is mediocre.\n\n6. Hungary\n\nExpat Insider Index Ranking: 34\n\nWorldwide Expat Index Ranking: 48\n\nInsider Monkey Average Ranking: 41\n\nHungary ranks low on healthcare facilities, and the overall quality of life is not very high. Expats have reported trouble settling in the country and finding local friendly faces. Language is one of the biggest problems faced by expats. The low score on the working abroad index also does not bode well for future immigrants. However, most expats have given positive feedback regarding financial aspects, including the cost of living and disposable income. Nevertheless, the overall score places the country on the list of worst countries to live in as an expat.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expat.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n35 Most Visited Countries in the World: 2024 Rankings 12 Worst Cities in the Southwest for Retirees 20 Cities With The Highest Cost of Living in the US\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Worst Countries to Live in as an Expatis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will look at 50 Funny Things To Ask Chatgpt and Google's AI Chatbot. In case you want to skip our detailed analysis on the Artificial Intelligence (AI) industry, and the key market players, you can go directly to 5 Funny Things To Ask Chatgpt and Google's AI Chatbot.\n\nThe global AI market has experienced a notable growth, with technological advancements shaping the landscape in 2023. Looking ahead, the integration of automation and machine learning is poised to enhance the tech ecosystem in 2024. Despite concerns regarding potential challenges like the high cost of generative AI and chip shortages, it is vital to acknowledge that these obstacles may not result in a widespread downturn. The AI market is currently in a phase of maturation, presenting significant opportunities for real-world applications.\n\nWhile short-term projections may indicate a slight potential downturn, the long-term outlook remains positive. Projections suggest that by 2024, the global AI market is expected to exceed half a trillion US dollars, underscoring the industry's robust growth trajectory. Investors are advised to consider the intricate process of technology maturation, an aspect that may have been somewhat overlooked by tech giants in 2023. The year 2024 is anticipated to witness the emergence of AI in early maturation, with tangible advancements anticipated across various sectors.\n\nAI's Disruptive Reach Across Industries\n\nAI's impact on various industries is quite evident if we look at the healthcare sector, where a significant growth of 41.2% was observed in the integration of AI into the sector, from 2018 to 2023. Similarly, the manufacturing industry has embraced AI, with estimates projecting a market size of $7.2 billion by the end of 2023, reflecting a substantial compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 42.2% since 2018. Likewise, in the energy and utilities sector, AI applications are forecasted to reach $1.5 billion by 2023, demonstrating a CAGR of 38.3% over the same period. Furthermore, AI's influence extends to the job market, where it is predicted to have a transformative impact by 2025. While the technology is expected to eliminate 85 million jobs, it will also create 97 million new opportunities, resulting in a net gain of 12 million jobs. Also, the transportation industry is also poised for AI-driven growth, with forecasts indicating a market size of $6.8 billion by 2023, with a CAGR of 21.5% since 2018, on the back of increasing use of AI in the industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn contrast, the US Artificial Intelligence market is anticipated to reach a market size of US$106.50 billion in 2024, with an estimated annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2030) of 14.27%, leading to a projected market volume of US$237.10 billion by 2030. The United States is expected to have the largest market size in global comparison, with greater utilization of AI in healthcare, specifically in areas like disease diagnosis, drug development, and personalized medicine. Another notable trend is a more rigorous application of AI to enhance customer service and support, incorporating features like chatbots and virtual assistants. The advancement of AI chips and edge computing is also on the rise, facilitating more efficient processing of AI applications. Furthermore, the integration of AI with complementary technologies such as blockchain and the Internet of Things (IoT) is forecasted to drive further innovation and growth in the AI sector.\n\nWhat To Expect of AI in 2024\n\nLooking ahead to developments in the AI landscape for 2024 reveals a promising shift, particularly in the accessibility of generative AI for the average user. The upcoming year is expected to see increased engagement with various AI models, offering enhanced usability. Notable advancements include the evolution of advanced AI models like GPT-4 and Gemini, which boast multimodal capabilities, expanding beyond text processing to include images and videos. This enhanced versatility is set to unlock a wealth of innovative applications. For instance, professionals in the real estate industry could utilize sophisticated models like GPT-4 and Gemini to streamline their processes. By leveraging AI to replicate past property listings, incorporate multimedia content, and generate customized property descobriptions with ease, real estate professionals can enhance their workflow efficiency. Additionally, the horizon of possibilities extends to text-to-video technology, a significant advancement beyond existing text-to-image capabilities. This technology, designed to build upon the strengths of its predecessor, is gaining traction in various industries, including the film sector.\n\nMajor studios such as Paramount and Disney are exploring the potential of generative AI in their production pipelines, using it for tasks like aligning actors' performances with foreign-language overdubs. The use of generative AI technology, as showcased in projects like \"Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny\" in 2023, featuring a de-aged deepfake of Harrison Ford, signifies the transformative impact AI can have on the entertainment industry.\n\nNow having discussed the AI market current standing and its future with depth, it is essential to analyze the leading players in the market as well, who are leading the innovation and rapid growth of the technology. The players we are going to discuss are Google, Microsoft and Amazon.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nGoogle, under the umbrella of Alphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOG), revealed a new effort aimed at enhancing online security through artificial intelligence tools and investments. Given the rising prevalence of AI in cybersecurity measures and cybercrime activities, Google outlined plans to introduce an open-source tool powered by AI. This tool, focusing on file type identification to aid in malware detection, is already in use for safeguarding products such as Gmail and Google Drive. Google intends to provide this tool free of charge for broader accessibility.\n\nMoreover, the company is set to unveil a white paper at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Friday, outlining its utilization of AI for cyber defence. Additionally, the paper will propose a policy agenda advocating for advanced AI research and establishing safeguard measures for autonomous cyber defences.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NasdaqGS:GOOG) released its financial results for the latest quarter ending on December 31, 2023. The search revenue and profit margin reported fell below analysts' expectations, indicating that the company's flagship business growth and recent cost-cutting measures through layoffs were insufficient to offset the increased investments in artificial intelligence.\n\nRevenue from the search engine, Alphabet's primary unit, reached $48 billion in the fourth quarter ending December 31, 2023, up by 13% but slightly below analysts’ projected $48.1 billion. Overall quarterly sales for Alphabet amounted to $86.3 billion, reflecting a 13% increase from the previous year and surpassing analysts' estimates of $85.2 billion.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nFor nearly forty years, Microsoft Corporation (NasdaqGS:MSFT) has maintained its position as a prominent figure in end-user computer technology. Currently recognized as the world's largest company, Microsoft's widely used Windows desktop operating system holds approximately 74% of the global market share. Looking ahead, Microsoft has announced plans to invest €3.2 billion in Germany by the end of 2025 to enhance the artificial intelligence and cloud capabilities of its data centre in the region. Additionally, the company aims to provide digital skills training to over 1.2 million individuals.\n\nMicrosoft has recently released its financial results for the second quarter of its 2024 fiscal year. The software giant reported revenue of $62 billion and a net income of $21.9 billion during Q2. Revenue has seen an 18% increase, with net income rising by 33%. This marks the inaugural quarter in which Microsoft discloses earnings as a $3 trillion company and the first-time additional revenue from its acquisition of Activision Blizzard is included in the report. The increase in gaming revenue has elevated Microsoft's gaming business to become the third-largest, surpassing Windows. Despite these changes, Office and cloud revenue continue to be the primary drivers, collectively contributing close to 60% of Microsoft's overall revenue.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the technology conglomerate responsible for Facebook and Instagram, has made a strategic shift in its focus by disbanding the Responsible AI team, reallocating resources towards the advancement of generative artificial intelligence. This transition, as initially disclosed by The Information, signifies a deliberate restructuring within Meta's AI division.\n\nZuckerberg has highlighted the positive impact of artificial intelligence advancements on Meta's advertising business, surpassing growth rates compared to Google. He emphasized Meta's ongoing commitment to AI investment and enhancing computing infrastructure to manage increased workloads.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) exceeded analysts’ expectations, achieving a record $40.1 billion in revenue, with net income tripling. The company's expansive user base across platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, grew to 3.98 billion monthly active users by the end of 2023, marking a 6% increase year over year. Notably, Meta reported over 130 million monthly active users on Threads, the Twitter-like social app launched in July 2023.\n\nLet's now head over to the list of 50 Funny Things To Ask Chatgpt and Google's AI Chatbot. 50 Funny Things to Ask Chatgpt and Google's AI Chatbot\n\nA medical professional wearing a ReWalk robotic exoskeleton with a person with mobility impairments in the background.\n\nWith this context and industry outlook in mind, let’s start our list of 50 Funny Things To Ask Chatgpt and Google's AI Chatbot.\n\n50.

        "title": "Stock-Split Watch: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Stock Split",
        "content": "The stock market is red-hot. The S&P 500 crossed 5,000 for the first time ever; the Dow Jones Industrial Average is making new all-time highs regularly.\n\nMeanwhile, the Nasdaq Composite, the most tech-heavy of the major indexes, is riding a wave of artificial intelligence (AI) optimism right into the stratosphere. Over the last 12 months, that index is up 33%.\n\nWith so many new highs being made, some stock prices have reached towering heights. So let's talk stock splits and cover three stocks -- SuperMicroComputer(NASDAQ: SMCI), Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), and MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META) -- that are ready. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe hottest AI stock around looks primed for a first-ever split\n\nJake Lerch (Super Micro Computer): If I had to pick one stock as the mascot for the current bull market, it just might be Super Micro Computer. Its shares generated a mind-blowing total return of 774% in the last 12 months.\n\nTo put that in context, it's taken Microsoft (which is no slouch regarding stock performance) the last eight years to generate a similar total return.\n\nSuper Micro Computer's rapid rise has seen its stock price shoot up from around $86 a share to over $880. That, my friends, is a recipe for a stock split. The company has never conducted a stock split in its 17 years as a public company. However, with its stock price closing in on $900 a share and investor interest surging, it might be time. SMCI Chart\n\nThe company's near-term prospects look spectacular as the AI revolution drives up demand for its off-the-shelf server racks -- one of the primary building blocks for AI data centers. The company reported exceptional earnings results a few weeks ago, lifted its full-year guidance, and provided highly upbeat commentary in a post-earnings conference call.\n\nIn short, given the stock's amazing run, now could be the right time for Super Micro Computer to perform its first stock split -- a development many investors would cheer.\n\nAI chip dominance has taken this stock's share price into the clouds\n\nWill Healy(Nvidia): Amid the generative AI boom, Nvidia has been on a tear. Over the last year, the stock has risen almost 240% as demand for chips designed for AI workloads has boomed. That took the share price to around $740 per share as of the time of this writing.\n\nStory continues\n\nCoincidentally, that places its price near where Nvidia last executed a 4-for-1 stock split, in July 2021, with the stock up nearly 300% since then.\n\nAlong with the company's current stock price, Nvidia's market positioning and growth appear to make a case for another split. It has an estimated 85% market share in the high-end AI chip market, according to an analyst at RaymondJames. Moreover, Allied Market Research estimates a compound annual growth rate of 38% for the AI chip market through 2032.\n\nGiven such numbers, it should come as little surprise that its revenue for the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 29) rose 206% yearly to more than $18 billion. With that, the gross margin surged to 74% versus 54% in the year-ago quarter, when operating expenses rose by 16%.\n\nConsequently, Nvidia's net income of over $9.2 billion rose by nearly 14 times! Amid such increases, its P/E ratio of 97 has not deterred investors from bidding the stock higher.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia may have another less discussed reason for wanting a split. At a market cap of $1.8 trillion, it has arguably become the market's most essential semiconductor stock. A lower nominal share price would make it a leading candidate for inclusion in the Dow Jones Industrial index. The Dow is a price-weighted index, and Nvidia's addition would add to its prestige and investor interest, serving as yet another positive catalyst.\n\nIndeed, when it comes to semiconductor stocks, none appears better positioned than Nvidia. And with its continuing growth prospects and history, a stock split could make it more appealing to prospective buyers and indexes alike.\n\nA stock split could potentially keep Meta's red-hot momentum going\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): In late 2022, when shares were just $89, most investors probably didn't have a possible stock split for MetaPlatforms on their bingo cards. But Wall Street will soon wrap up Q1 of 2024, and the stock is quickly running toward $500. This epic comeback is no fluke. The stock on fire since overcoming adversity in its advertising business and cutting expenses to get its profits back on track.\n\nLost in the stock's ups and downs were two consistent truths. First, Meta's three-headed monster of social media apps, Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, never stopped growing. Monthly active users rose from 3.71 billion in Q3 of 2022, when the stock bottomed, to 3.98 billion today. That doesn't seem like much, but half the world's population is on these apps, and Meta's audience is still rising at a meaningful pace.\n\nSecond, Meta has continually invested in building computing systems for the company's long-term AI ambitions. Meta is already using AI to grow its advertising business, and the consumer-facing nature of Meta's apps gives the company tons of room for innovation over time.\n\nStock splits don't change a company's fundamental valuation. Fortunately, Meta's forward P/E of 23 is attractive if the business delivers the 20% annualized earnings growth analysts expect. If Meta does split its stock, the numbers make it a stock split you can confidently buy and hold for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Chase Coleman Has 46% of His Portfolio Invested in 5 Brilliant Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "Billionaire investor Chase Coleman is one of Wall Street's original whiz kids. When he was just 24 years old, he founded Tiger Global Management with starting capital from his former boss and mentor, the iconic hedge fund manager Julian Robertson, Jr.\n\nColeman parlayed this seed money of $25 million into one of the world's most successful hedge fund empires, with roughly $58 billion in assets under management. He's currently ranked as the world's 500th richest person by Forbes with a net worth estimated at $5.7 billion.\n\nColeman is best known for spotting big winners early on, making notable investments in (among others) Spotify; Facebook, now Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META); and LinkedIn, now owned by Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT).\n\nHe's no stranger to bold bets, so it isn't surprising that to close out 2023, Coleman had a whopping 45.8% of Tiger Global Management's equity portfolio invested in just five artificial intelligence (AI) stocks:\n\nMeta Platforms: 18.8% Microsoft: 14.3% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN): 5.3% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG): 4% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA): 3.4%\n\nLet's look at Coleman's top holdings to see why he's so heavily weighted in these AI stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is Coleman's largest holding by far, which isn't surprising since he discovered the company when it was still Facebook.\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Meta has a long track record of using sophisticated algorithms to its advantage. The lion's share of its revenue is generated by digital advertising, and using AI helps surface more relevant ads and appropriate content for its social media users.\n\nWith the ongoing recovery in ad spending, 2023 was a banner year for the world's second-largest digital advertiser. Meta helped fuel its growth by providing advertisers with a suite of AI-powered tools to help improve their results.\n\nThe company also jumped feet first into generative AI by developing a top-shelf AI model -- the LLaMA (large language model Meta AI) -- which is available on all the major cloud platforms, giving Meta an entirely new revenue stream. The social media company also announced its first-ever dividend.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta stock sells for about 23 times forward earnings, a discount compared to the broader market -- which likely factored into Coleman's investing decision.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft stunned tech aficionados last year when it invested $13 billion in ChatGPT creator OpenAI, focusing the limelight on the potential applications for generative AI. Many big tech companies followed suit, and the AI arms race was on.\n\nMicrosoft made the most of its investment, quickly integrating AI functionality across a broad cross-section of its most popular productivity tools. It further bolstered demand by offering the most sought-after AI models on its Azure Cloud.\n\nOne of the biggest opportunities, however, rests in its suite of AI-fueled assistants: Microsoft Copilot. The ability of these tools to increase users' productivity has resulted in strong demand, which could generate incremental revenue of $100 billion by 2027, according to the I/O Fund's Beth Kindig. Azure's growth outpaced the competition in the fourth quarter, and Microsoft noted that 6 percentage points of that growth came from increased demand for AI services.\n\nMicrosoft currently trades for 35 times forward earnings. That's a slight premium to the overall market, but the company's strong history of growth and the additional potential resulting from AI make it a must-own AI stock, which likely provided extra incentive for Coleman to buy.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon also has a long history of deploying AI algorithms to manage its e-commerce business, using AI to make product recommendations, manage inventory levels, schedule delivery routes, and more.\n\nThe company has also jumped on the generative AI bandwagon, using the technology to improve product descriptions, summarize reviews, and polish merchant advertising. Amazon also plans to offer a customer-focused tool to answer specific product questions.\n\nFurthermore, as the leading cloud infrastructure provider, Amazon Web Services (AWS) offers a laundry list of popular generative AI models via its Bedrock AI. The company is also several generations along in the development of its AI processors -- namely Inferentia and Trainium -- to provide improved and lower-cost AI processing for its cloud customers.\n\nDespite its run-up over the past year, Amazon stock sells for just 2 times forward sales, the standard for an undervalued stock, which likely didn't escape Coleman's notice.\n\n4. Alphabet\n\nLike its rival Meta Platforms, Alphabet makes the vast majority of its revenue from its ad tech business, driven by Google search. Alphabet has a long and distinguished history of using AI to improve its search and targeted advertising results, and the rebound in the digital advertising market will no doubt boost its fortunes.\n\nAlphabet has been hard at work developing generative AI solutions, incorporating this next-generation functionality into a broad cross-section of its namesake Google and Android products and services.\n\nIts position as a leading cloud infrastructure provider puts the company in the perfect position to market AI solutions to its cloud clients. The recent debut of Gemini AI was hailed by Google as its \"largest and most capable AI model.\"\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet's Vertex AI platform offers a growing suite of more than 130 foundational AI models for customers to choose from.\n\nOne of the most intriguing things about Alphabet's stock is the price: just 25 times earnings, a discount to the broader market -- and a valuation that Coleman likely couldn't pass up.\n\n5. Nvidia\n\nNvidia is the poster child for the accelerating adoption of AI. Its processors revolutionized the gaming industry and were adapted to handle the rigors of AI and have since become the gold standard.\n\nIts graphics processing units (GPUs) dominate the market in machine learning and data centers, with an estimated 95% share in each market. This made Nvidia the no-brainer choice when demand for generative AI ramped up.\n\nWhile rivals are working furiously to develop competing chips, Nvidia's pace of innovation makes it difficult to gain ground. Further frustrating those efforts is the company's heavy spending on research and development, which amounted to $6.2 billion -- or 16% of total revenue -- for the nine months ended Oct. 29.\n\nDespite the stock's triple-digit gains, Nvidia is still incredibly cheap, with a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of less than 1 -- the standard for an undervalued stock -- and Coleman was no doubt keenly aware of that.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best breakout stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe stock market in 2024 is more optimistic and forward looking than it was at the start of last year. Back then, investors were fretting about the state of the U.S. economy and the impact that high interest rates from the Federal Reserve would have on it. Yet, as 2023 demonstrated, and much to everyone's surprise, neither did the U.S. economy tip into recession and nor did the stock markets fall and wipe out wealth.\n\nInstead, AI prevailed everywhere as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and other big ticket technology names soared after OpenAI's ChatGPT convinced the world that A.I. now roams among us.\n\nIn fact, February 2024 is the first time in its history that the flagship S&P 500 index has crossed 5,000 points. As if this weren't enough, the month has also seen the NASDAQ Composite, dominated by the technology industry, near its all time high levels before paring back the breakout. At the heart of this stunning performance is, you guessed it, A.I. The start of the year has seen industry bigwigs the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) chief Mr. Mark Zuckerberg, NVIDIA boss Jensen Huang, and of course, OpenAI's eccentric Sam Altman all take the stage and reaffirm their optimism for the artificial intelligence industry.\n\nIt was Zuckerberg who got the ball rolling, as he shared his firm's plans for buying hundreds of thousands of GPUs from NVIDIA this year in order to beef up Meta's computational capacity. Since we'll be talking about breakout stocks in this piece, Meta is particularly important as far as 2024 is concerned. This is because its shares have shown the classic trait of a sudden breakout in the wake of a catalyst. While the Meta chief's GPU comments were nevertheless welcome, the true surge in the firm's shares came after its earnings report for the fourth quarter of 2023. This report saw the firm report a surprise dividend of 50 cents. Since the earnings report, Meta's shares are up by 18%, making it a classical example of a breakout stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, when we talk about breakout stocks in the A.I. era, the crown is still firmly placed on NVIDIA and Mr. Huang's head. NVIDIA's shares are already up by 49.9% year to date in a blistering set of results that saw NVIDIA briefly become more valuable than big ticket technology stocks Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nSimilarly, another breakout stock that has soared recently is also related to artificial intelligence and also has a close relationship with NVIDIA. This stock is none other than the British semiconductor design house Arm Holdings plc (NASDAQ:ARM). Arm is one of the youngest entrants on the stock market, and before its shares were publicly listed, NVIDIA was on its way to buy the firm before regulators marred the plans. Well, the decision to go public seems to have served Arm well, since it's a breakout stock that is now up by 145% since its IPO.\n\nSo why is Arm soaring? Well, all the company had to do was to convince investors that there were A.I. related orders down in the pipeline, and off the shares went. Arm's latest earnings call saw plenty of AI mentions, with the management commenting:\n\nFrom the most complex devices on the planet for training and inference, the NVIDIA Grace Hopper 200 to edge devices such as the Gemini Nano Pixel 6 from Google or the Samsung Galaxy S24, more and more AI is running on more end devices, and that's all running on Arm. And what that has done is driven a very strong set of tailwinds for our licensing growth. When we look at demand for new products from a licensing standpoint, what we are finding from the end market is that we've reached nowhere near good enough relative to the capability of the technology, and end customers for new designs are needing more and more Arm technology to keep up, particularly with the AI demands.\n\nLooking at these trends, it appears that the gods of the stock market are plenty favorable when it comes to breakout stocks. Therefore, we made a list of some such stocks today and the top picks are Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). 12 Best Breakout Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nImage by Gerd Altmann from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best breakout stocks, we ranked the holdings of the IBD Breakout Opportunities ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q4 2023.

        "title": "Will Coinbase Be a Trillion-Dollar Stock by 2035?",
        "content": "There are only seven companies worth more than $1 trillion today. These include some of the world's most prominent corporations, such as Apple, Microsoft, and Amazon. Reaching a $1 trillion valuation is no easy task and is reserved for a select few with just the right combination of characteristics.\n\nBy 2035, the $1 trillion club will likely look slightly different. Surely, some current members will slip, but new members will also join the club. One of those could be Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nProven growth in a burgeoning industry\n\nAt the time of this writing, Coinbase's market cap is just shy of $40 billion. That means that if it were to join the $1 trillion club, it would need to grow by 2,400%. While undoubtedly that is an enormous amount, Coinbase could pull it off if it can maintain its current trajectory. Before dismissing this type of growth, let's look at Coinbase's past and how it provides a glimpse into its future.\n\nAlthough Coinbase has only been on the stock market for a few years, the company's founding dates back to 2012. Originally designed to make buying and selling Bitcoin more accessible for users, Coinbase's business has evolved alongside the asset class.\n\nPreviously deriving the bulk of revenue from transaction fees, today, Coinbase boasts a diversified revenue model with innovative crypto products catering to retail and institutional investors.\n\nAs Coinbase's offerings have grown, so have its users. In the first quarter of 2018, there were around 23 million verified users on Coinbase's platform. Today, that number has reached nearly 120 million, a 400% increase.\n\nNaturally, with more users, revenue has grown as well. In 2019, Coinbase generated around $533 million in revenue. Based on the most recent earnings report, total revenue for 2023 reached a whopping $3.1 billion, a nearly 500% increase in just four years and a compound annual growth rate of 168%.\n\nKeep in mind that these metrics only capture the growth that has occurred over the last four or five years. If we were to measure from Coinbase's earliest days, the growth would be considerably larger, but this data is not easily accessible.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow it gets to $1 trillion\n\nCoinbase checks just about every box a company should have to be considered a candidate for the $1 trillion club. Proven growth? Check. Resilient and innovative business model? Check. Position at the forefront of a burgeoning industry? Check.\n\nBut to show how it can join this elite club, the most practical approach is to compare it to an existing member -- Meta (NASDAQ: META).\n\nEven though Meta (previously Facebook) derives most of its income from advertisers targeting audiences across its social media empire, there are striking similarities to Coinbase's crypto-centric business model.\n\nAt their core, both operate highly scalable digital platforms that don't necessitate significant costs. Digital platforms often have lower marginal costs per user as the user base grows. Once the platform is established, adding new users typically incurs minimal additional costs, contributing to scalable and efficient operations.\n\nFurthermore, due to their digital nature, both benefit from network effects to grow revenue. An expanding user base enhances the overall value of platforms. More users attract more participants, creating a self-reinforcing cycle that can drive more growth.\n\nMost importantly, though, similarities between business models are evident in each company's finances. Of the seven companies worth $1 trillion today, Meta boasts the highest profit margins at 80%. While annual revenue is second to last at $134.9 billion, its agile and light business model provides industry-leading margins no other company really comes close to. COIN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nHere is where Coinbase's opportunity arises. Like Meta, Coinbase enjoys profit margins north of 80% due to its highly efficient business model. In fact, Coinbase's profit margins are better than those of all seven trillion-dollar companies today at 86%.\n\nIf Coinbase's revenue continues to grow at its current compound annual growth rate of 168%, it could see revenue reach $90 billion by 2035. It's not that far off from Meta's $117 billion in 2021 when it first crossed the $1 trillion mark. Assuming profit margins stay where they are today, Coinbase's future finances begin to look remarkably similar to Meta's.\n\nFinal considerations\n\nThe path to $1 trillion is far from a guarantee. However, Coinbase has a significant advantage shared by many of the current members of the $1 trillion club -- a leading position at the forefront of a paradigm shift. Similar to how social media altered our daily interactions, cryptocurrencies hold the power to transform businesses, economies, and our own financial lives.\n\nThe future growth of such disruptive technology is difficult to quantify and predict. However, we only need to look at its history to see its potential. In just 15 years, the total crypto asset class has grown in value from a few million dollars to a flourishing economy worth more than $1.5 trillion. By nearly every account, crypto has exceeded projections, and almost every past prediction underestimated its true potential. If Coinbase continues riding the waves of crypto's momentum, then reaching $1 trillion looks all the more possible.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coinbase Global wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has minted a lot of millionaires since its public debut (as Google) in 2004. If you had invested $20,000 in that historic IPO, your stake would have grown by 6,850% to $1.39 million today.\n\nHowever, investors who missed out on Alphabet's gains over the past 20 years might be wondering if it can still generate millionaire-making returns from here. Let's see if the tech giant could turn $20,000 into $1 million again over the next 20 years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet's business model and growth rates\n\nFrom 2003 to 2023, Alphabet's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% as its net income increased at a CAGR of 39%. That growth was driven by the expansion of Google's search engine and advertising network, its acquisition of YouTube in 2006, and the broadening of its ecosystem across the web browser, webmail, mobile software, and cloud infrastructure-as-a-service markets.\n\nAlphabet also expanded into nascent markets like driverless vehicles, digital healthcare, and the development of experimental drugs, but it still generates the lion's share of its revenue from Google's advertising ecosystem, which faces unpredictable macroeconomic, competitive, and regulatory headwinds.\n\nOver the past few years, Google's ad sales were affected by macroeconomic issues like inflation and rising interest rates, stiff competition from Meta's (NASDAQ: META) family of apps and ByteDance's TikTok, and government regulations aimed at limiting its access to people's personal data for crafting targeted ads. The pandemic also disrupted its ad sales throughout 2020.\n\nTo reduce its long-term dependence on ads, Google expanded its subscription-based services, Play Store, and hardware devices (which it categorized as its \"other\" revenue), and its cloud platform. But as the following table illustrates, the growth of its \"other\" segment was unpredictable and its cloud segment cooled off over the past few years. At the same time, its advertising growth decelerated, so its total revenue expansion slowed down.\n\nStory continues\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Google advertising revenue growth 16% 9% 43% 7% 6% Google \"other\" revenue growth 21% 28% 29% 4% 19% Google Cloud revenue growth 53% 46% 47% 37% 26% Total revenue growth 18% 20% 41% 10% 9% EPS growth* 12% 19% 91% (19%) 27%\n\nData source: Alphabet. *Adjusted for a 20-for-1 stock split in 2022.\n\nOn the bright side, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) growth accelerated again in 2023 as it laid off people, reined in its spending on its \"moonshot\" projects, and spent $61.5 billion on stock buybacks.\n\nAlphabet faces unpredictable long-term headwinds\n\nGoogle's advertising business is now expanding much slower than Meta's, and it faces unpredictable long-term challenges. Independent adtech companies like The Trade Desk are driving advertisers to break free from Google and Meta, Amazon is beefing up its own marketplace ads, and generative AI platforms like ChatGPT could pull users away from its search engine.\n\nGoogle is upgrading its search capabilities with new AI features like its Bard chatbot and Gemini large language model, but it still seems to be trailing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in the AI race. The Redmond-based software giant gained an early-mover advantage by backing OpenAI and integrating the start-up's AI tools into its own services.\n\nGoogle also continues to pay Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) billions of dollars every year to remain the default search engine on iOS. If Apple ever switches over to another search engine like Microsoft's Bing (a change that it reportedly considered in the past), Google could abruptly lose a large chunk of its advertising revenue and the global search market.\n\nFinally, Google Cloud still ranks a distant third in the cloud platform market behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Its growth rate is decelerating, and it won't offset the slower expansion of its ad business anytime soon.\n\nCould Alphabet turn $20,000 into $1 million again?\n\nAlphabet's stock looks reasonably valued today at 22 times forward earnings. Assuming its valuation holds steady, it would need to increase its EPS at a CAGR of 22% for 20 years to turn $20,000 into $1 million.\n\nThat might seem possible if it keeps cutting costs and buying back shares, but those strategies could lose their potency if its revenue growth continues to decelerate. If Alphabet fails to light a fire under its advertising and cloud businesses again, its valuation will likely contract, and it could be revalued as a slower-growth tech giant like Oracle.\n\nThat declining multiple -- along with the fact that a 50-bagger gain would boost Alphabet's market cap to a whopping $90 trillion -- will probably prevent this company from turning a $20,000 investment into $1 million over the next two decades. Alphabet could still generate impressive gains, but investors should temper their expectations as its core business matures.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Tech companies sign accord to combat AI-generated election trickery",
        "content": "Major technology companies signed a pact Friday to voluntarily adopt “reasonable precautions” to prevent artificial intelligence tools from being used to disrupt democratic elections around the world.\n\nTech executives from Adobe, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, OpenAI and TikTok gathered at the Munich Security Conference to announce a new voluntary framework for how they will respond to AI-generated deepfakes that deliberately trick voters. Thirteen other companies — including IBM and Elon Musk's X — are also signing on to the accord.\n\n“Everybody recognizes that no one tech company, no one government, no one civil society organization is able to deal with the advent of this technology and its possible nefarious use on their own,” said Nick Clegg, president of global affairs for Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, in an interview ahead of the summit.\n\nThe accord is largely symbolic, but targets increasingly realistic AI-generated images, audio and video \"that deceptively fake or alter the appearance, voice, or actions of political candidates, election officials, and other key stakeholders in a democratic election, or that provide false information to voters about when, where, and how they can lawfully vote.”\n\nThe companies aren't committing to ban or remove deepfakes. Instead, the accord outlines methods they will use to try to detect and label deceptive AI content when it is created or distributed on their platforms. It notes the companies will share best practices with each other and provide “swift and proportionate responses” when that content starts to spread.\n\nThe vagueness of the commitments and lack of any binding requirements likely helped win over a diverse swath of companies, but may disappoint pro-democracy activists and watchdogs looking for stronger assurances.\n\n“Every company quite rightly has its own set of content policies,” Clegg said. “This is not attempting to try to impose a straitjacket on everybody. And in any event, no one in the industry thinks that you can deal with a whole new technological paradigm by sweeping things under the rug and trying to play whack-a-mole and finding everything that you think may mislead someone.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe agreement at the German city's annual security meeting comes as more than 50 countries are due to hold national elections in 2024. Some have already done so, including Bangladesh, Taiwan, Pakistan, and most recently Indonesia.\n\nAttempts at AI-generated election interference have already begun, such as when AI robocalls that mimicked U.S. President Joe Biden’s voice tried to discourage people from voting in New Hampshire’s primary election last month.\n\nJust days before Slovakia’s elections in November, AI-generated audio recordings impersonated a liberal candidate discussing plans to raise beer prices and rig the election. Fact-checkers scrambled to identify them as false, but they were already widely shared as real across social media.\n\nPoliticians and campaign committees also have experimented with the technology, from using AI chatbots to communicate with voters to adding AI-generated images to ads.\n\nAhead of Indonesia's election, the leader of a political party shared a video cloning the face and voice of the deceased dictator Suharto. The post on X disclosed the video was generated by AI, but some online critics called it a misuse of AI tools to intimidate and sway voters.\n\nFriday's accord said in responding to AI-generated deepfakes, platforms “will pay attention to context and in particular to safeguarding educational, documentary, artistic, satirical, and political expression.”\n\nIt said the companies will focus on transparency to users about their policies on deceptive AI election content and work to educate the public about how they can avoid falling for AI fakes.\n\nMany of the companies have previously said they’re putting safeguards on their own generative AI tools that can manipulate images and sound, while also working to identify and label AI-generated content so that social media users know if what they’re seeing is real. But most of those proposed solutions haven't yet rolled out and the companies have faced pressure from regulators and others to do more.\n\nThat pressure is heightened in the U.S., where Congress has yet to pass laws regulating AI in politics, leaving AI companies to largely govern themselves. In the absence of federal legislation, many states are considering ways to put guardrails around the use of AI, in elections and other applications.\n\nThe Federal Communications Commission recently confirmed AI-generated audio clips in robocalls are against the law, but that doesn't cover audio deepfakes when they circulate on social media or in campaign advertisements.\n\nMisinformation experts warn that while AI deepfakes are especially worrisome for their potential to fly under the radar and influence voters this year, cheaper and simpler forms of misinformation remain a major threat. The accord noted this too, acknowledging that “traditional manipulations (”cheapfakes\") can be used for similar purposes.\"\n\nMany social media companies already have policies in place to deter deceptive posts about electoral processes — AI-generated or not. For example, Meta says it removes misinformation about “the dates, locations, times, and methods for voting, voter registration, or census participation” as well as other false posts meant to interfere with someone's civic participation.\n\nJeff Allen, co-founder of the Integrity Institute and a former data scientist at Facebook, said the accord seems like a “positive step” but he'd still like to see social media companies taking other basic actions to combat misinformation, such as building content recommendation systems that don't prioritize engagement above all else.\n\nIn addition to the major platforms that helped broker Friday's agreement, other signatories include chatbot developers Anthropic and Inflection AI; voice-clone startup ElevenLabs; chip designer Arm Holdings; security companies McAfee and TrendMicro; and Stability AI, known for making the image-generator Stable Diffusion.\n\nNotably absent from the accord is another popular AI image-generator, Midjourney. The San Francisco-based startup didn't immediately return a request for comment Friday.\n\nThe inclusion of X — not mentioned in an earlier announcement about the pending accord — was one of the biggest surprises of Friday's agreement. Musk sharply curtailed content-moderation teams after taking over the former Twitter and has described himself as a “free speech absolutist.”\n\nBut in a statement Friday, X CEO Linda Yaccarino said “every citizen and company has a responsibility to safeguard free and fair elections.\"\n\n“X is dedicated to playing its part, collaborating with peers to combat AI threats while also protecting free speech and maximizing transparency,” she said.\n\n__\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

        "title": "Follow META’s Lead? 3 Tech Stocks That Should Also Debut Dividends",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) surprised the stock market recently by announcing it would pay its first-ever quarterly dividend. The owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp said the payout will be 50 cents per share, or $2 per share on an annual basis. That works out to a yield of about 0.4% at current prices. It’s not earth-shattering but leaves room for lots of future growth.\n\nThere was a time back in the 1990’s when very few tech stocks paid dividends. They were financing their growth and chose to plow their excess cash back into the business. Thirty years on and these are now more mature operations so you can find many tech companies paying dividends: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) all reward shareholders for owning the stock.\n\nMost tech companies still don’t pay dividends, but arguably many of them should. At the very least least they could afford to pay them. Here are three tech stocks that should follow Meta’s lead and initiate a dividend, but let’s see if they actually will.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Logo of Alphabet (GOOG) website displayed on the screen of the mobile device. alphabet logo visible on display of modern smartphone on white\n\nSource: turbaliska / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the first tech stocks that springs to mind that could pay shareholders a dividend. It ended 2023 with over $110 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The search giant also generated nearly $70 billion in free cash flow (FCF). Alphabet certainly has the financial wherewithal to initiate a payout but probably won’t.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet chooses to use much of its excess cash to buy back shares. Just last year it spent $61.5 billion on repurchasing shares, equivalent to 88% of its FCF. Many businesses think buying back stock is a better use of their cash profits than dividends. That’s because they can be a more tax-efficient way to return value to shareholders.\n\nAlthough President Biden began taxing companies 1% on the stocks they repurchased beginning in 2022 it hasn’t deterred companies from repurchasing shares. Now the president wants to quadruple the tax to 4%. However, investors tend to prefer dividends because it is a tangible symbol of a company’s success. It is cash they can reinvest in the business themselves if they choose. Nevertheless, Alphabet doesn’t look likely to scratch that itch anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilarly, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is unlikely to begin paying shareholders either for owning its stock. Like Alphabet, the e-commerce giant can afford a dividend, after having $87 billion in liquid assets available and producing $32 billion in FCF last year. But unlike Alphabet, Amazon was not buying back its stock, instead choosing to reinvest in the business.\n\nThere are only a few things a company can do with its cash profits: pay dividends, buy back shares, pay down debt, engage in mergers and acquisitions or reinvest back into the business. Amazon is choosing to do the latter, spending virtually all of its profits across its varied businesses.\n\nAmazon is more than just e-commerce, it is also a cloud services company through Amazon Web Services. It also has physical retail stores, third-party marketplaces, digital advertising, streaming video and more. By putting its cash profits to work in each of these areas, it hopes to grow them into dominant forces, which it has in many instances.\n\nAmazon is the No. 1 destination for online sales and is the leading cloud service provider through AWS. Sometimes it fails spectacularly, like with its Fire Phone and Amazon Wallet. The key takeaway is Amazon is continually looking to grow and expand so it seems unlikely it will ever pay a dividend.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface customer relationship management specialist Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) does not have quite the same financial resources as either Alphabet or Amazon. It only has $12.5 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments available to it. However, it did see a 19% increase over the past year of FCF, generating $6.3 billion in 2023.\n\nAlthough Salesforce could sustainably afford to pay a dividend, it instead chooses one of the other routes open to it for using its FCF: making acquisitions. Salesforce could be considered a serial acquirer, with significant acquisitions in the past few years. Notably, Slack was acquired for $27.7 billion in 2021, Tableau for $15.7 billion in 2019 and MuleSoft was bought the year before for $6.5 billion. Salesforce anticipates making many more acquisitions in the future.\n\nBecause M&A activity is part and parcel of Salesforce’s DNA and it uses up the bulk of its cash profits, little remains for dividends. The CRM specialist becomes another in a long list of tech stocks that could, and maybe should prioritize a dividend over the paths they’ve chosen. However, Salesforce seems unlikely to take that path, and investors shouldn’t hold their breath waiting.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Potentially Undervalued?",
        "content": "Let's talk about the popular Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). The company's shares led the NASDAQGS gainers with a relatively large price hike in the past couple of weeks. The company is now trading at yearly-high levels following the recent surge in its share price. As a large-cap stock with high coverage by analysts, you could assume any recent changes in the company’s outlook is already priced into the stock. However, could the stock still be trading at a relatively cheap price? Let’s take a look at Meta Platforms’s outlook and value based on the most recent financial data to see if the opportunity still exists.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nWhat's The Opportunity In Meta Platforms?\n\nThe stock seems fairly valued at the moment according to our valuation model. It’s trading around 15% below our intrinsic value, which means if you buy Meta Platforms today, you’d be paying a reasonable price for it. And if you believe that the stock is really worth $569.87, then there’s not much of an upside to gain from mispricing. So, is there another chance to buy low in the future? Given that Meta Platforms’s share is fairly volatile (i.e. its price movements are magnified relative to the rest of the market) this could mean the price can sink lower, giving us an opportunity to buy later on. This is based on its high beta, which is a good indicator for share price volatility.\n\nCan we expect growth from Meta Platforms? earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFuture outlook is an important aspect when you’re looking at buying a stock, especially if you are an investor looking for growth in your portfolio. Although value investors would argue that it’s the intrinsic value relative to the price that matter the most, a more compelling investment thesis would be high growth potential at a cheap price. Meta Platforms' earnings over the next few years are expected to increase by 69%, indicating a highly optimistic future ahead. This should lead to more robust cash flows, feeding into a higher share value.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat This Means For You\n\nAre you a shareholder? META’s optimistic future growth appears to have been factored into the current share price, with shares trading around its fair value. However, there are also other important factors which we haven’t considered today, such as the financial strength of the company. Have these factors changed since the last time you looked at the stock? Will you have enough confidence to invest in the company should the price drop below its fair value?\n\nAre you a potential investor? If you’ve been keeping an eye on META, now may not be the most advantageous time to buy, given it is trading around its fair value. However, the positive outlook is encouraging for the company, which means it’s worth diving deeper into other factors such as the strength of its balance sheet, in order to take advantage of the next price drop.\n\nSince timing is quite important when it comes to individual stock picking, it's worth taking a look at what those latest analysts forecasts are. Luckily, you can check out what analysts are forecasting by clicking here.\n\nIf you are no longer interested in Meta Platforms, you can use our free platform to see our list of over 50 other stocks with a high growth potential.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "F-Rated SNAP Stock Is Destined to Stagnate Near $10. Sell Shares Now.",
        "content": "Snap (NYSE:SNAP) stock plummeted 30% last week after announcing lackluster 2024 guidance. First-quarter sales are expected to grow only 13% to $1.11 billion, barely half of what rivals like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) expect. Analysts expect profits at the Santa Monica-based firm to hit just $205 million this year, a quarter of its 2021 peak.\n\nAt its core, Snapchat faces a popularity problem. Rival platforms like TikTok and Instagram are keen innovators, and teens have increasingly turned to these video-first platforms. The average American now spends almost two-thirds of their time on social media watching videos, according to Bernstein.\n\nThat’s put pressure on companies like Snap, a company I warned investors about back in 2020.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm has struggled to overhaul its business to enter the “2.0” of social media. And now that Snap’s shares trade within a dollar of my original $10.50 price target, this represents my “I told you so” moment… with a little delay.\n\nSNAP Stock: Fundamental Analysis Vs. Speculation\n\nMy process for determining Snap’s valuations was relatively straightforward. By taking Snapchat’s usage statistics from Sensor Tower and combining them with boots-on-the-ground observations about its business, I determined that the company was unlikely to exceed a compound 15% growth rate or surpass 20% EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) margins through 2029. Few companies ever manage to sustain growth rates higher than that, and Snapchat seemed unlikely to pull off that feat. Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), for instance, only needed to sustain a 16.6% annual growth rate over the past decade to reach $307 billion in revenues last year.\n\nPutting these figures into a 2-stage discounted cash flow (DCF) model yielded enlightening results. By assuming Snap’s revenues would increase to $8.7 billion by 2029 and EBIT margins remain at 20%, my model determined that Snap’s fundamental value sat at roughly $15 billion, or $10.50 per share. That represented a stunning 61% downside from its $27 share price at the time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trend Is Your Friend\n\nReality, however, was more complex. In 2021, Snap logged a single year of unprecedented growth, driven by a surge of digital advertising. According to the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB), spending on digital advertising rose three times faster that year than the broader economy as brands jockeyed for eyeballs in the post-pandemic recovery period. Annual revenue growth at Snap itself topped 64%.\n\nThese new figures suddenly turned Wall Street wildly bullish. Snap’s stock price rose to $83, valuing the social media firm at $135 billion. To justify that valuation, Snap would have needed to sustain that 64% growth rate for the next five years and keep its growth rate north of 30% for the two decades after that, assuming no decline in profitability. That would have put Snap on track to generate $82 billion in revenues by 2029, almost 10 times more than the $8.7 billion originally expected.\n\nIn other words, investors simply extrapolated Snap’s 2021 performance as a straight line up.\n\nBut the honeymoon period would eventually end. In 2023, Snap only logged 12% sales growth after advertisers brought spending to more normal levels. And Snap’s 13% growth forecasts suggest this trend will continue through 2024.\n\nThat puts Snap’s fair value at… well.. the same $10.50 we started off with three years ago.\n\nBut Was I Wrong?\n\nNevertheless, Snap’s wild ride from $27 (when I first floated my $10.50 price target) to $83 and back to $11 shows the significant limitations of fundamental valuation. Although we might know a company’s intrinsic value, we have no idea what path share prices will take.\n\nThat presents a particular problem to short-sellers and options writers, two groups where timing is everything. If a position moves in the wrong direction, these contrarians must often liquidate it at a loss without any chance of recouping their principal. My own suggestion of shorting Snap would have left any short-seller in a terrible position until shares began sliding back in 2022.\n\nTo address this issue, I’ve since developed an AI-based stock-picking system that accounts for the momentum that high-volatility stocks regularly see. Today, the system believes that F-grade Snap shares only have 3.8% upside over the next six months, putting it in the bottom quintile of all tracked stocks. Downward earnings revisions and sinking shares tend to signal future underperformance.\n\nThough it might be tempting to buy Snap on the dip, investors must do so knowing that neither fundamental valuation nor technical factors support a speedy recovery.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held a LONG position in GOOG and GOOGL.

        "title": "Meta Touts New Way for Small Advertisers to Avoid Apple Fees",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. released new guidelines for small businesses that advertise on Facebook and Instagram, aiming to help them get around fees imposed by Apple Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJapan Loses Its Spot as World's Third-Largest Economy as It Slips Into Recession Putin Steps Into US Race to Back ‘Old-Style’ Biden Over Trump Trump Eyes NATO Makeover, Hurried Peace in Ukraine If Elected Israel Quits Ceasefire Talks Over ‘Delusional’ Hamas Demands Dozens of Banks Rapidly Piled Up Commercial Property Loans\n\nMeta is advising the companies to buy ads through a web browser, rather than on Facebook or Instagram iOS apps, according to guidance released Thursday. That will help them avoid an Apple commission that Meta said would take effect this month.\n\nApple’s new policy requires advertisers to use its In-App Purchase feature whenever they pay to “boost” social media posts — a move that gives the content more exposure. Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% on app purchases in its iOS software, meaning that Meta will lose a portion of its ad revenue to the iPhone maker.\n\nThe policy change, first announced by Apple in 2022, ratcheted up tension between the tech giants, which have become two of Silicon Valley’s biggest adversaries in recent years. At the time, Meta accused the company of “undercutting others in the digital economy.” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also frequently criticized Apple for wielding too much control over its App Store.\n\nApple said Thursday that treating boosts as an In-App Purchase is consistent with its longstanding approach to the App Store. The company said it spent more than a year discussing the boosting policy with Meta, giving them ample time to comply.\n\n“We have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use In-App Purchase,” Apple said in a statement. “Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service — so of course In-App Purchase is required. This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has been a vocal detractor of the privacy practices at Meta, which relies on user data to sell ads. Previous Apple changes have hit Meta in the pocketbook. In 2021, an iOS tweak that limited third-party data collection led to an estimated $10 billion loss in ad revenue for Meta.\n\nThe iPhone maker has drawn broader criticism for its policies, with companies like Spotify Technology SA and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. saying App Store rules are unfair. The company recently overhauled its approach in Europe to comply with new regional legislation, though those changes have brought further outcry.\n\nApple’s new policy takes effect in the US first, before rolling out to other countries later this year. The change will also require advertisers to pay for ads upfront when buying them through an iOS app. The change will largely affect Meta’s smaller advertisers, some of whom use boosted posts as their only form of advertising, Meta said.\n\n(Updates with response from Apple in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

        "content": "OpenAI chairman Bret Taylor knows a thing or two about spotting the next big thing in tech.\n\nSo when Taylor — whom I got to know during his time as co-CEO of Salesforce (CRM) — decides to give me a few minutes, let's just say I pick up the phone.\n\nOr, in this particular case, do an interview on Yahoo Finance Live (video above) with him and his latest co-founder Clay Bavor.\n\n\"Clay and I really believe that conversational AI is going to be the way companies interact with their customers in the future,\" said Taylor, who co-created Google Maps, then launched businesses that were sold for top dollar to Facebook (META) and Salesforce.\n\nEnter Taylor's new venture Sierra, which just emerged from stealth mode this week.\n\nTaylor has been building the startup alongside friend and former Google (GOOG, GOOGL) colleague Bavor since he left Salesforce in late 2022.\n\nReportedly valued at nearly $1 billion after a $110 million funding round from VC heavyweights Benchmark and Sequoia, Sierra is essentially a customer service bot on steroids.\n\nThe bot is purported to have the capabilities for conversations with real people. As the interactions with humans evolve, so too will the bot as it leverages various large language models.\n\nEnd goal: happier customers for businesses and more profitable sales streams. Here comes more conversational AI. Sierra is the latest entrant. (Photo courtesy of Sierra) (Sierra)\n\nTaylor pushed back on Sierra being another customer service bot amongst a plethora of new AI bots.\n\n\"I think [conversational AI is] so much bigger than that. I look at ChatGPT, it grew to 100 million users — faster than any consumer product in history. I think it really represents a sea change in consumer behavior,\" Taylor says.\n\nAdded Bavor, \"We are running towards one of the most challenging — and we think potentially impactful — problems in AI, which is putting AI directly in front of your customers.\"\n\nThe San Francisco-based firm has already landed several well-known brands as clients: SiriusXM (SIRI), Sonos (SONO), and WeightWatchers (WW).\n\nStory continues\n\nFull stop, it's anyone's guess where Sierra is going to be one year from now. I suspect it will have a lot more customers while the bot will be even sharper. Knowing Taylor, I suspect the business will add new services that complement its core mission.\n\nOver time, Sierra could follow the route of Taylor's other ventures and be part of a larger tech giant (perhaps Salesforce again?).\n\nBut one thing is for certain: The next wave of AI is starting to arrive, and with it we will get a glimpse into the business impact of this new generation of bots.\n\nMcKinsey estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually to the global economy. About 75% of that value could be delivered across four areas: customer operations, marketing and sales, software engineering, and research and development.\n\nThe numbers are more eye-opening within specific sectors.\n\nAcross the banking industry, for example, the technology could deliver value equal to an additional $200 billion to $340 billion annually if the use cases are fully implemented. In retail and consumer packaged goods, the potential impact is at \"$400 billion to $660 billion a year,\" McKinsey's researchers found.\n\nThe robots aren't coming — they are here.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Adds background in paragraphs 3-4, 10; Meta comment in paragraphs 8-9)\n\nLONDON, Feb 15 (Reuters) - Facebook must face a collective lawsuit valued at around 3 billion pounds ($3.77 billion) over allegations the social media giant abused its dominant position to monetise users' personal data, a London tribunal ruled on Thursday.\n\nLegal academic Liza Lovdahl Gormsen, who is bringing the case on behalf of around 45 million Facebook users in the UK, says they were not properly compensated for the value of personal data they had to provide.\n\nHer lawyers argue users should get compensation for the economic value they would have received if Facebook was not in a dominant position in the market for social networks.\n\nFacebook's parent company Meta Platforms Inc, however, says the lawsuit is \"entirely without merit\" and its lawyers argue the claimed losses ignore the economic value Facebook provides to its users.\n\nThe Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) last year refused to give the go-ahead to the case against Meta.\n\nBut the CAT ruled on Thursday that a revised claim put forward by Gormsen's lawyers should be allowed to proceed towards a trial.\n\nJudge Marcus Smith said in a written ruling that a final hearing in the case could be heard in \"the first half of 2026 at the latest\".\n\nA Meta spokesperson said in a statement that the company would \"vigorously defend\" the case.\n\n\"We are committed to giving people meaningful control of what information they share on our platforms and who with, and already invest heavily to create tools that allow them to do so,\" they added.\n\nThe case against Meta is the latest to be given the go-ahead at the CAT, with separate claims against Sony, Apple and major banks being certified last year alone.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "We're halfway through the second month of the year, and Cathie Wood has a lot of ground to make up. The Ark Invest founder, CEO, and ace investor finds her largest exchange-traded fund trading lower in 2024, even after a 5% surge on Wednesday.\n\nShe's still making moves, lately adding to some of her biggest gainers over the past year. Wood added to existing stakes in CrowdStrike Holdings(NASDAQ: CRWD), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Archer Aviation(NYSE: ACHR) on Wednesday. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. CrowdStrike Holdings\n\nCathie Wood's funds may be lower this year, but you can't blame CrowdStrike. The cybersecurity specialist has seen its shares soar 31% so far this year, and that's on top of more than doubling in 2023.\n\nAnalysts are struggling to keep up. Eric Heath at Keybanc bumped his price target from $245 to $318 a month ago. On Wednesday, he jacked up that price goal to $375. It's a 53% overall hike in less than four weeks. He's naturally sticking to his overweight rating. Heath is upbeat about the fiscal fourth quarter CrowdStrike will discuss on March 5, backed by strong channel checks for its endpoint security and identity protection products. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt's a good time for CrowdStrike's Falcon line of cloud-based cybersecurity solutions. Companies need to protect their sites and their customers, and you can't skimp on your reputation. Revenue rose 34% in its fiscal third quarter, ahead of expectations. Adjusted earnings soared 85%, trouncing Wall Street projections by at least 9% for the fourth period in a row.\n\nCrowdStrike is also now profitable on a reported basis. Its guidance calls for 32% revenue growth in next month's fiscal first-quarter report, but the market has seen a steady string of \"beat and raise\" performances here. Expectations may be high, but reality has been even higher for CrowdStrike these days.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta was another big winner of 2023 that Wood was buying up on Wednesday. The parent company of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp has seen its stock nearly quadruple since the start of last year. The crazy thing is that the stock is still somehow reasonably cheap.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta ended 2022 on a rough note, with top-line declines in the final three quarters. Revenue growth turned positive last year, accelerating every single quarter of 2023. The top line isn't the only thing moving higher. Wall Street continues to paint rosier portraits of the social media giant with every financial checkpoint.\n\nThree months ago, analysts figured that Meta would earn $16.03 a share this new year and $18.78 a share next year. Those targets now stand at $19.92 and $22.96, respectively. Despite almost soaring fourfold since revenue growth turned positive, Meta is trading at a reasonable 21 times earnings. Put another way, you could've bought Meta at the beginning of 2023 for just a little more than 5 times what analysts now see it earning next year.\n\n3. Archer Aviation\n\nWood is flying high on electric vertical takeoff and landing (eVOTL) aircraft upstarts. She owns significant positions in a couple of them, but Archer Aviation is one of her favorites. She now owns more than 9% of the company's total shares outstanding.\n\nArcher won't be profitable anytime soon. It's going to take years before it generates meaningful revenue. That doesn't mean the stock isn't moving on news. Archer keeps scoring partnership deals and other wins as it builds out its next-generation fleet of air taxis. Two weeks ago, it announced it had completed its Midnight aircraft's first phase of the flight test program. This will still take years to play out, but momentum is building in its favor. Like CrowdStrike and Meta, Archer has more than doubled since the start of last year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in CrowdStrike right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in CrowdStrike, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and CrowdStrike wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "I don’t think there’s any question that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has got its groove back after spending too much time in the metaverse. As a result, Mark Zuckerberg’s net worth has increased by nearly $42 billion through the first six weeks of 2024, making it undoubtedly the champion of social media stocks.\n\nAre there others that come anywhere near Meta’s prodigious cash flow generation? I doubt it. That said, it’s hard to imagine Meta being the only social media platform lasting more than one of two economic cycles.\n\nWho are the other possible challengers to Meta Platform’s crown as social media dynamo? Likely, it hasn’t even been created yet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAn impressive 62 analysts cover META stock, with 53 (85%) rating it a Buy, with a target price of $525, 11% higher than where it’s currently trading. It’s the gold standard in social media.\n\nHowever, here are my suggestions for those looking for social media stocks other than META to buy now.\n\nSocial Media Stocks to Watch: Pinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nI selected my three social media stocks from the Global X Social Media ETF (NASDAQ:SOCL), which tracks the performance of the Solactive Social Media Total Return Index.\n\nThe ETF currently has 43 holdings, with Meta being the top stock, with a weight of 13.08%. The third-largest holding is Pinterest (NASDAQ:PINS), with a 9.22% weighting.\n\nPinterest has always been my favorite social media stock because it’s visually driven with a desire for positivity in its message and user engagement. CEO Bill Ready recently sat down for an interview with Financial Times contributor Hannah Murphy to discuss the toxicity of social media and how its most prominent players can fix it.\n\nWriting about stocks as I do, I’ve experienced many occasions where investors are unhappy with my commentary, have gone off half-cocked on LinkedIn, etc., telling the world how awful I am for being so pessimistic about this stock or another. If only these people would save their energy for positive contributions to social media, I’m confident the world would be a better place. But, I digress.\n\nStory continues\n\nReady and the rest of his company are doubling down on positivity. And while we’ve seen this act many times before, I will always back those with the conviction to try to deliver a product that’s simultaneously good for the customer and the company. A win/win, if you will.\n\nI have no idea if Ready’s strategy will be successful.\n\nHowever, I hope it is. We need something to counter Elon Musk’s dark vision for social media. With 498 million MAUs (monthly active users), it could play a big part in brightening the internet while also making its shareholders stinking rich.\n\nWhat’s not to like?\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAre you familiar with Simon Owens? He writes a media newsletter on Substack that I like to read from time to time. He’s a super bright individual with many interesting observations about the content creation economy. You should check it out.\n\nOn many occasions, Owens has commented about how successful YouTube has become. The more he mentions this, the more I realize just what a deal Google got when it bought the social media platform for $1.65 billion in 2006. That was 18 years ago. I was barely 40.\n\nThe Ringer’s Victor Luckerson wrote in 2016:\n\n“Ten years ago this week, Google bought YouTube for $1.65 billion. That figure seems quaint now (it equates to WhatsApp being worth about 13 YouTubes) but at the time it was an eye-popping figure to pay for a startup only a year and a half ol,” Luckerson wrote.\n\n“Some analysts and competitors said Google overpaid. Mark Cuban said the search giant was “crazy” to take on YouTube’s many legal liabilities. Google itself later acknowledged that YouTube wasn’t worth anywhere near the price tag at the time of the acquisition.”\n\nFlash forward to today.\n\nIn a Feb. 9 post, Owens points out that YouTube generates more than $9 billion a quarter in ad revenue. As a result, it’s been able to pay out $70 billion to content creators over the past three years. YouTubers are as sophisticated as they come. Jimmy Donaldson generates more than $82 million in annual earnings, much from YouTube.\n\nGoogle was already an advertising giant. YouTube will only make it exponentially so. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a wealth of riches.\n\nYalla Group (YALA) Yalla Group (YALA) Voice Chat Rooms mobile app logo on phone screen close up, Illustrative Editorial.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn February 2023, I recommended Yalla Group (NYSE:YALA) and two other penny stocks to buy. Of the three, the voice-centric social networking platform for people living in the Middle East and northern Africa is the only one to hang in there.\n\nIt’s gone sideways over the past year. However, with it down more than 21% year-to-date, I thought I’d revisit YALA to find out why it’s down on its luck.\n\nLooking at its Q3 2023 results, it’s easy to see where the car might have gone off the tracks. Its average MAUs as of Sept. 30 were 35.10 million, up 13.6% from Q3 2022. That’s the good news. The bad news is that its paying users were 11.24 million, 2.6% less than a year earlier.\n\nOk, but here’s the thing.\n\nIts ARPPU (average revenue per paying user) in Q3 2023 was $7.35, 46 cents higher than a year earlier. Based on 11,236,000 paying users in Q3 2023, the revenue generated from those users would be $82.58 million. In Q3 2022, it would be $79.52 million, or $3.06 million more, despite 305,000 less paying users.\n\nIn the third quarter, its non-GAAP operating margin was 41.5%, 470 basis points higher than a year ago. Furthermore, it has more than $3 a share in net cash on its balance sheet as of Sept. 30, so you’re paying about $1.86 a share for the operating business.\n\nI’m not saying you’ll get rich off Yalla Group, but the upside seems far greater than the downside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Will Surge in 2024: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Before It Does",
        "content": "Growth investors went through a tough stretch in 2022 that saw the Nasdaq Composite fall more than 35% at its low. That feels like the distant past after the technology-heavy index roared back in 2023 with 43% gains. It now trades just 2.5% from its all-time high.\n\nHistory indicates investors could be in for more good times in 2024. The index has historically performed well following similarly large drawdowns throughout the past.\n\nThe excitement for artificial intelligence (AI) advancements helped give a turbo boost to the market's rally. And some leading AI stocks still have the growth potential and reasonable valuations to continue their strong momentum.\n\nHere are three AI stocks to consider buying for continued gains.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe stock market's momentum has been carried by \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a handful of megacap technology stocks leading the charge into AI with their dominant business models and deep pockets.\n\nOne of them is chip company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), one of Wall Street's best performers after surging 222% over the past 12 months. You shouldn't typically buy a stock after such a run, but Nvidia's accelerated growth from AI chip demand could be unprecedented.\n\nHow often does a company, already doing billions of dollars in sales, accelerate to a triple-digit growth rate? But that's precisely what Nvidia did.\n\nMore importantly, the momentum looks like it could continue. The company controls the lion's share of the AI chip market, which could grow to over $400 billion over the coming years.\n\nNot only are Nvidia's H100 and H200 chips the go-to hardware for building AI computers, but the company is also aiming to go after the custom chip market, targeting companies that might design and build their own AI chips.\n\nAnalysts believe the business will grow earnings at over 42% annually, which means that paying a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) figure of 35 for the stock is very reasonable. Sure, investors who have already seen tremendous gains could take profits. Still, Nvidia's outlook makes any pullback a fantastic long-term buying opportunity.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe best strategy might be to buy a little at a time, since there's no telling how far a runaway stock with such strong fundamentals could rise before it does dip.\n\n2. Super Micro Computer\n\nLike Nvidia, Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) is undergoing a growth spurt that investors might struggle to wrap their heads around because shares have moved so quickly.\n\nThis stock is up 751% over the past year alone. But as you'll see in a moment, the unprecedented tailwinds of AI are justifying these gigantic gains. Super Micro Computer sells modular server systems, which means its customers buy turnkey state-of-the-art servers without having to design and build such systems themselves.\n\nThe company has been in business since 1993, and the migration to cloud computing -- and now AI -- is taking growth to new levels. It recently reported its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Revenue grew 103% year over year to $3.66 billion, and 73% over the prior quarter.\n\nThis is exponential growth from a multibillion-dollar corporation, and management is guiding for over 200% year-over-year growth in the third quarter.\n\nWhen revenue is multiplying like this, it shouldn't be jarring to see the stock doing the same thing. Analysts expect big things from Super Micro Computer, and they estimate earnings will grow at an average annual rate of 37%. At a forward P/E of just 34, that's a price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio under 1, making this highflier a potential bargain if it continues to perform like this.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nAnother Magnificent Seven stock wraps up this list. Social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has soared 163% over the past year.\n\nIt also has a lot going on with AI, but Meta is more a story of redemption after its advertising struggles and excessive spending had it fall out of favor with Wall Street in 2022. Since then, Meta has bounced back, and cost-cutting has re-established it as a cash cow.\n\nMeta, which owns social media apps Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, continues to gain users. It grew its total audience to 3.98 billion monthly active users as of the fourth quarter, a 6% increase over 2022.\n\nRevenue was 25% higher year over year, and management paid its first-ever dividend, a sign that the company is confident it can share more profits with investors while investing for long-term growth.\n\nSince Meta came from such a low place in 2022, the stock's remarkable run still hasn't made shares too expensive. It trades at a forward P/E of 23, which is fair for a stellar business that analysts believe will grow earnings at nearly 20% annually over time. Meta Platforms stock looks like a buy-and-hold choice in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSee the 10 stocks\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of February 12, 2024\n\nRandi Zuckerberg, a former director of market development and spokeswoman for Facebook and sister to Meta Platforms CEO Mark Zuckerberg, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors. Justin Pope has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Meta Platforms and Nvidia. The Motley Fool recommends Super Micro Computer.

GuruFocus has detected 7 Warning Signs with CRNX.\n\nSteven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio), through Point72 Asset Management, has recently made a notable adjustment in the firm's investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc (NASDAQ:CRNX). On December 31, 2023, the firm decreased its holdings by 808,400 shares, resulting in a 19.13% change in the position. The transaction was executed at a price of $35.58 per share, leaving the firm with a total of 3,416,900 shares in CRNX. This trade has altered the firm's portfolio by a -0.09% impact, with CRNX now representing 0.36% of the total portfolio and 5.10% of the firm's holdings in the traded stock.\n\nProfile of Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nSteven A. Cohen stands as the Chairman and CEO of Point72, a significant player in the investment advisory landscape. With a foundation laid in 1992 through S.A.C. Capital Advisors, Cohen transitioned to Point72 in 2014, overseeing a team of over 1,650 professionals. A Wharton School alumnus, Cohen's career began at Gruntal & Co., eventually leading to the establishment of his own investment firm. His investment philosophy centers on a long/short equity strategy, employing a fundamental, bottom-up research process to guide macro investments. Cohen's portfolio is diverse, with top holdings in major companies like Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). The firm's equity stands at $33.83 billion, with a strong focus on the Technology and Healthcare sectors. Steven Cohen Adjusts Position in Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc\n\nCrinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc at a Glance\n\nCrinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc, a clinical-stage pharmaceutical company, is dedicated to developing treatments for rare endocrine diseases and related tumors. Since its IPO on July 18, 2018, CRNX has been actively engaged in the Biotechnology industry within the USA. With a market capitalization of $2.42 billion, the company's financial performance has been under scrutiny, especially considering its current status as significantly overvalued according to GuruFocus's GF Value. Despite a current stock price of $36.3, the GF Value stands at a mere $0.66, indicating a price to GF Value ratio of 55.00. The stock has seen a 2.02% gain since the transaction and an 88.57% increase since its IPO, with a year-to-date change of 2.57%. However, the GF Score of 32/100 suggests a cautious outlook on the stock's future performance potential.\n\nStory continues Steven Cohen Adjusts Position in Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc\n\nAnalysis of the Trade Impact\n\nThe recent trade by Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm has a modest impact on the overall portfolio, yet it reflects a strategic move within the firm's investment approach. The reduction in CRNX shares aligns with the firm's practice of actively managing positions based on thorough research and market analysis. Given the stock's current valuation and GF Score, the firm's decision to reduce its stake may be indicative of a broader strategy to optimize portfolio performance in light of market conditions and company-specific factors.\n\nMarket Context and Stock Valuation\n\nCrinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc's current market valuation presents a challenging scenario for investors. The stock is deemed significantly overvalued, with a GF Value that suggests a considerable disconnect between the stock's intrinsic value and its market price. The stock's price has slightly increased since the transaction, yet it remains high compared to the GF Value, which could signal caution for potential investors.\n\nSector and Industry Insights\n\nSteven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm maintains a significant exposure to the Technology and Healthcare sectors, with CRNX being part of the latter. The Biotechnology industry, where CRNX operates, is a key area of interest for the firm, and investment decisions within this sector are likely informed by the firm's extensive research and sector-aligned investment model.\n\nPerformance Metrics and Rankings\n\nCrinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc's financial metrics and rankings provide a mixed picture. The company's Financial Strength ranks at 7/10, supported by a Cash to Debt ratio of 10.63. However, its Profitability Rank and Growth Rank are both at 0/10, indicating challenges in these areas. The GF Value Rank and Momentum Rank also reflect areas of concern, with low scores that may have influenced the firm's decision to reduce its position.\n\nComparative Analysis with Largest Shareholder\n\nFisher Asset Management, LLC, another prominent investment firm, holds a significant position in Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc. While specific share percentage data is not provided, comparing the investment approaches of Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s firm and Fisher Asset Management can offer insights into how different investment philosophies are applied within the same industry and company.\n\nIn conclusion, Steven Cohen (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent transaction involving Crinetics Pharmaceuticals Inc reflects a strategic adjustment in the firm's portfolio. While the trade has a minor impact on the overall portfolio, it is a calculated move that aligns with the firm's investment philosophy and market outlook. Investors and market watchers will be keen to observe how this decision plays out in the context of the firm's performance and the evolving landscape of the Biotechnology sector.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

And, by 2026, 25% of individuals are expected to spend an hour per day in the Metaverse.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven artificial intelligence is breathing new life into the metaverse. For example, according to TaylorStrategy.com, “Companies are now starting to explore the potential of how AI can play a role in creating more immersive and engaging virtual experiences in the metaverse.”\n\nAlso, despite the metaverse’s rollercoaster history, it could be worth billions. In fact, according to Grand View Research, it could be worth about $936 billion by 2030. That being said, investors may want to jump on the hottest metaverse stocks to buy. These include the following.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince late September, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) exploded from a low of $26 to a recent high of $47.11. Even now, it’s still one of the top metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nAll thanks to growing demand, the metaverse comeback, and strong earnings. It may have lost 52 cents in the fourth quarter, but that was better than expectations. Bookings were up 25.3% year over year to $1.13 billion. Average daily active users jumped 22% year over year to 71.5 million. Monthly unique visitor numbers rose 18% to 15.9 million.\n\nRBLX expects for first quarter bookings to come in between $910 million and $940 million, which is above expectations of $902.6 million. For the full year, bookings are expected to come in between $4.14 billion and $4.28 billion, which is above estimates for $4.06 billion. Plus, the company expects for its top line to grow by about 20% every year through 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, Barclays upgraded Roblox to Equal Weight, noting that, “RBLX’s execution has become much steadier since mid-2023. The longer-term framework of 20% bookings CAGR and 20% DITBA margin, with advertising entering the fray at some point, looks attractive.”\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s also Unity Software (NYSE:U), an oversold $12.5 billion software company.\n\nHelping, analysts at Bank of America just reiterated a “Buy” rating on the stock, believing its well positioned for faster growth.

We also have to remember that Unity is working with Apple on immersive 3D apps for the tech giant’s Apple Vision Pro.\n\nRoundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nOr, if you’d rather diversify, there’s always an exchange-traded ETF like the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV), which just ran from about $9 to a high of $12.50. From here, as the Metaverse perks back up, I’d like to see the METV closer to $20 this year.\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF offers exposure to 47 metaverse-related stocks, including Roblox, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Apple, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).

        "title": "Meta was supposed to bring the metaverse to life. Epic is actually doing it.",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Meta (META) was supposed to bring the metaverse into billions of users’ homes via the company’s Quest AR/VR headsets. Heck, Zuckerberg even changed the social media giant’s name to reflect his lofty aspirations of creating a series of interconnected, permanently online worlds.\n\nBut it’s looking more and more like Epic Games will be the company to turn the metaverse into reality. That’s even more likely after Disney (DIS) announced it is investing $1.5 billion in the “Fortnite” game developer.\n\nIn the press release announcing the investment, Disney stopped just short of referring to the deal as a means of bringing the metaverse to life, saying, “The new persistent universe will offer a multitude of opportunities for consumers to play, watch, shop and engage with content, characters and stories from Disney, Pixar, Marvel, Star Wars, Avatar and more.”\n\nIf that isn’t a kind of metaverse I don’t know what is. That’s especially true considering the “persistent universe” will be run through Epic Games’ “Fortnite,” the wildly popular competitive online shooter and building game.\n\n“Fortnite” is already home to online concerts, and recently introduced a Lego “Fortnite” game, racing game, and music-based game. Meta's vision of the metaverse is still a dream. Epic is making it a reality. (Thibault Camus/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMeta, meanwhile, is continuing to invest in the metaverse, with Zuckerberg calling out the technology during the company’s most recent earnings call, but it’s seemingly taking a backseat to artificial intelligence. In fact, the CEO dedicated the bulk of his prepared remarks during the call to Meta’s AI investments.\n\nYes, he mentioned that the company’s Reality Labs segment saw $1 billion in revenue in the quarter and that its Horizon app is among the 10 most-used apps for Quest. But he also sprinkled plenty of AI talk into his metaverse bit, saying that the company’s Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses offer a better experience thanks to Meta AI and that the glasses are a way for people to interact with AI.\n\nIn other words, it certainly looks like Epic has beat Meta to the punch with the metaverse. And the gap is only likely to expand from here.\n\nStory continues\n\n'Fortnite' has been expanding for years\n\nEpic CEO Tim Sweeney is a metaverse believer. In May 2023, when Business Insider published an article saying the metaverse would join the list of failed tech industry fads, Sweeney tweeted a response jokingly calling for an online wake so “600,000,000 monthly active users in Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, PUBG Mobile, Sandbox, and VRChat can mourn its passing together in real-time 3D.”\n\nSweeney is right that there are millions still playing games like “Fortnite,” “Minecraft,” and “Roblox,” but the metaverse concept had lost considerable steam. Companies ranging from Microsoft to, yes, Disney ended their metaverse projects as AI took over as the go-to technology for the industry.\n\nBut Epic and Meta have kept charging forward. While Meta has poured billions into its Quest products, Epic has added characters and intellectual property from the likes of Marvel, “Dragon Ball Z,” “Naruto,” “Halo,” “John Wick,” and “Stranger Things” to “Fortnite.”\n\nMeta, however, has struggled mightily to get consumers hooked on its Horizon Worlds app. In 2022, the Wall Street Journal reported that the app fell well short of its goal of hitting 500,000 users per month, instead reaching less than 200,000. The company revamped the app in 2023 with an eye towards adding more games. A MetaQuest 3 is seen on display during the Meta Connect Developer Conference at Meta's headquarters in Menlo Park, Calif., on Sept. 27, 2023. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nEpic, meanwhile, announced a trio of games in December including “Lego Fortnite,” an open-world survival game in which players craft objects out of Lego bricks; “Fortnite Rocket Racing;” and “Fortnite Festival.” Each game allows you to bring your “Fortnite” character skins, in-game outfits, with you, creating a seamless series of worlds for your “Fortnite” avatar.\n\nAdding Disney and its various characters and unique locales to the “Fortnite” formula should help keep players coming back to Epic’s interconnected collection of online games.\n\nIt’s important to point out that Epic and Meta aren’t the only companies building out their respective metaverses. Roblox (RBLX) also continues to put together its concept of the metaverse. And in its most recent quarterly earnings report, the company announced it hit $1 billion in bookings.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Zuckerberg seemingly refuses to give up on the metaverse. This despite the fact that the company lost $16.1 billion on the effort in 2023 alone. That’s up from $13.7 billion in 2022.\n\nPart of Meta’s problem is that its metaverse largely requires users to jump in via its line of Quest headsets. The company did launch a Horizon Worlds mobile app to lower the barrier to entry, but it just doesn’t have the appeal “Fortnite” has to offer. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nZuckerberg is also facing increased competition in the headset space from Apple’s new Vision Pro. On Tuesday, he posted on Instagram Reels, saying that after using the Vision Pro he believes the Quest 3 is the overall better product, not just the less expensive option.\n\nBut getting people to pony up and stick with the Quest will take more than just dunking on the Vision Pro.\n\nStill, the tech and gaming industries are fickle. And with Zuckerberg determined to make his vision of the metaverse a reality, it could end up paying off in the long run. For now, though, “Fortnite” is eating his lunch.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "title": "Meta’s Zuckerberg fires shots at Apple Vision Pro, says Quest is 'better product, period'",
        "content": "Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg got his hands on Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro and, perhaps unsurprisingly, he’s not all that impressed. In an Instagram Reel posted Tuesday evening, the social media CEO sized up Apple’s headset against Meta’s own Quest 3 and came to the conclusion that “the Quest is the better product, period.”\n\nZuckerberg’s post, which he largely filmed using the Quest 3, comes as Apple’s Vision Pro approaches its second week on the market. The $3,499 “spatial computer” quickly went viral as videos and photos of people using it bounced across social media.\n\nAll of the hype leading into the Vision Pro’s launch seemingly irked Zuckerberg, who has funneled billions into Meta’s efforts to take VR/AR headsets mainstream and jumpstart his vision for the metaverse, a series of interconnected online worlds.\n\nIn his review of the Vision Pro, Zuckerberg calls out a handful of differences between the devices, chief among them their prices. Apple’s Vision Pro is priced well beyond the average consumer electronics product. At $499, the Quest 3 isn’t exactly cheap, though it does come closer to what you’d spend on a modern game console or laptop than Apple’s offering. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nZuckerberg also needled the Vision Pro for requiring a wired external battery pack and said the Quest is more comfortable and has a wider field of view and brighter display.\n\n“I was surprised by how many tradeoffs [Apple] had to make to the quality of the device,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for.”\n\nZuckerberg also spoke to the broader ecosystems powering the headsets, touching on Apple’s closed-off operating system compared to Meta’s more open approach, saying he wants to see an open approach win out.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've used both the Quest 3 and Vision Pro and found the Vision Pro to be easier to navigate and quite comfortable. Its display was also a standout, offering impressive clarity compared to the Quest 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt makes sense for Zuckerberg to promote his product. But critiquing Apple’s Vision Pro is an unusual step among tech CEOs.\n\n“I think one of the reasons for anyone to do what he did is to keep up that hype, keep up that momentum, because this market surely needs that,” explained Gartner director and analyst Tuong Nguyen. “Keep people interested, and what better way to keep them interested than shots fired.”\n\nAccording to Nguyen, Zuckerberg’s battle with Apple is a good thing because it means increased competition, which should ultimately benefit consumers.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that Apple could address Zuckerberg’s criticisms with the next version of the Vision Pro, explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\n“Let's come back in a year, let's come back in two years, and let's see how that story changes,” he said. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis isn’t the first time Zuckerberg and Apple have butted heads. Heck, it’s not the first time the CEO has used his social platform to tangle with another Big Tech executive. You’ll recall the billionaire was previously set to fight Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the X owner challenged Zuckerberg to an MMA match in 2023.\n\nBut his disdain for Apple runs deeper than playground antics.\n\nApple kneecapped Meta’s ad business with the release of its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021. The software update gave iPhone users the ability to keep apps from tracking their movement across the web and other apps, cutting into a key piece of Meta’s data stream, which helps power its advertising sales.\n\nMeta has also criticized Apple for its so-called walled garden-style operating system that gives the iPhone maker ultimate control over what kind of apps and software users can install on their devices.\n\nHowever Zuckerberg feels about Apple’s Vision Pro, though, the headset war will ultimately come down to device sales. And if the Vision Pro can beat the Quest 3 there, the CEO’s opinions won’t matter all that much.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "content": "Tyre maker Continental plans to axe 7,150 jobs - JOCHEN LUEBKE/AFP/Getty Images\n\nContinental will cut 7,150 jobs worldwide by 2025 as it navigates the difficult switch to electric vehicles.\n\nAlthough the group is best-known as a tyre-maker, it supplies vehicle manufacturers with a wide range of components from headlights to brakes. It has been trying to reposition itself as a software supplier for electric vehicles, developing autonomous driving systems, while closing some factories producing parts for petrol and diesel vehicles.\n\nIt said it would shed 1,750 jobs in research and development. This, it said, would help it “increase efficiency” by reducing the number of locations where it develops products, from the existing 82, and allow it to focus on “promising growth areas”.\n\nMeanwhile, it will also lose around 5,400 posts as part of a previously announced cost-cutting programme aimed at saving the group €400m (£341m) by 2025.\n\nHowever, a company spokesman said there would be “only very minor impact” in the UK.\n\nContinental, which currently employs around 200,000 people worldwide, announced the plan in November without putting a precise figure on the number of jobs that would go.\n\nContinental’s automotive chief Philipp von Hirschheydt said: “We are aware of the impact on our employees and will do everything we can to find good, tailored solutions (for employees).”\n\nHe said the cuts would allow Continental to “focus our resources even more on future technologies for software-defined vehicles”.\n\nGermany’s car industry has been facing problems as the transition to electric vehicles gathers pace, after decades relying on fossil fuel vehicles for their profits.\n\nContinental and rivals Robert Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen are bracing for muted car production this year amid a slowdown in electric-vehicle demand.\n\nRead the latest updates below.\n\n06:32 PM GMT\n\nSigning off\n\nThanks for joining us today.

Alphabet’s shares have risen 53pc, while Nvidia has increased 217pc.\n\nThe neck-and-neck jostling came a day after Nvidia closed above Amazon’s market value.\n\nNvidia, the world’s most valuable chip designer, made its name making graphics cards for PCs.

James Titcomb reports:\n\nThe cyber attack comes as one of the first known cases of state-backed organisations exploiting new artificial intelligence (AI) tools.\n\nOpenAI and Microsoft said they had closed accounts belonging to a hacking group affiliated with Iran’s revolutionary guard, nicknamed Crimson Sandstorm, alongside other groups linked to Russia, China and North Korea.\n\nThe companies said the Iranian group used AI to write emails seeking to lure “prominent feminists” to a fake website, which could have been used to steal details or install computer viruses.\n\nContinue to read the full story...\n\n04:23 PM GMT\n\nThree Londoners arrested in suspected organised insider trading scheme\n\nThree Londoners have been arrested on suspicion of insider dealing and money laundering following a raid by dozens of officers. Adam Mawardi reports:\n\nOfficers from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the National Crime Agency (NCA) were sent to apprehend the suspects at three residential properties in London earlier this month.\n\nThe operation also saw several digital devices seized during searches by FCA investigators, the financial regulator said on Wednesday.\n\nThe three individuals in their 50s were arrested on suspicion of insider dealing, conspiracy to insider deal and money laundering linked to organised crime.\n\nThey were all interviewed under caution by the FCA, with two released and the other remaining under investigation.\n\nA fourth suspect, a 48-year-old man, remains under investigation after being interviewed on Tuesday.\n\nMembers of organised crime groups account for a major part of suspicious trading in stock markets, according to the FCA.\n\nCriminal gangs involved in spread betting and contract for difference schemes often recruit junior staff members with access to inside information and brokers who can open overseas trading accounts with fewer security controls.\n\nThe FCA warned advisory firms that clients with a pattern of trading before merger and acquisition announcements and press speculation could be illegally benefitting from insider trading.\n\n03:48 PM GMT\n\nSony’s profit rises amid rising sales to mobile phone makers\n\nProfits at the Japanese electronics and entertainment giant Sony rose 13pc in the final quarter of 2023 on growing sales of music, image sensors and video games, the company has revealed.\n\nThe Tokyo-based company delivered a quarterly profit of 363.9bn yen (£1.9bn), up from 321.5 billion yen the year before.\n\nQuarterly sales for the maker of the PlayStation game machines and Bravia TV sets rose 22pc to 3.7trn yen ($24.7 billion).\n\nSales were robust across its wide range of businesses, which include financial services, games consoles and entertainment businesses including music and movies. An increase in sales of image sensors for mobile products also helped boost the company’s bottom line.\n\nLike other Japanese companies, Sony has benefited from recent exchange rate trends. The yen has weakened against the dollar, boosting the value of overseas earnings when they are converted into yen.\n\nSales of recorded and published music, merchandise and licensing revenue rose, Sony said.\n\nIn Sony’s pictures operations, TV and digital streaming licensing revenue and home entertainment sales climbed during the fiscal year following successful movie releases.\n\nHits included Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, an animation film about the superhero, and The Equalizer, starring Denzel Washington. Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse was a hit for Sony - Sony Pictures Entertainment\n\n03:34 PM GMT\n\nAI technology being used for offensive cyber attacks, warns Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has said today that adversaries of America and members of the international community - chiefly Iran and North Korea and to a lesser extent Russia and China - are beginning to use so-called generative artificial intelligence techniques to mount or organise offensive cyber operations.\n\nThe technology giant said it detected and disrupted, in collaboration with business partner OpenAI, threats that used or attempted to exploit AI technology they had developed.\n\nThe software giant said the techniques were “early-stage” and neither “particularly novel or unique” but that it was important to expose them publicly as US rivals leverage large-language models to expand their ability to breach networks and conduct influence operations.\n\nCybersecurity firms have long used machine-learning on defence, principally to detect anomalous behaviour in networks. But criminals and offensive hackers use it as well, and the introduction of large-language models led by OpenAI’s ChatGPT upped that game of cat-and-mouse.\n\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars in OpenAI, and today’s announcement coincided with its release of a report noting that generative AI is expected to enhance malicious social engineering, leading to more sophisticated deepfakes and voice cloning. This could pose a threat to democracy in a year where over 50 countries will conduct elections, magnifying disinformation and already occurring,\n\nLast April, the director of the US Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, Jen Easterly, told Congress that “there are two epoch-defining threats and challenges. One is China, and the other is artificial intelligence.”\n\n03:30 PM GMT\n\nUK recession 'frankly in the balance,' says Bailey\n\nAndrew Bailey has told peers that it is “in the balance” as to whether Britain has fallen into a technical recession or not.\n\nThe Office for National Statistics publishes its latest figures for gross domestic product (GDP) tomorrow, which will show Britain fell into a recession it the economy shrank in the final three months of 2023.\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England told the Lords Economic Affairs Committee:\n\nLast year, overall GDP was basically flat. We will find out whether we had a so-called technical recession or not depending on what the fourth quarter number is.\n\nIn our February Monetary Policy Report it was frankly in the balance. We didn’t have a recession in the forecast but it is at best flat. It wouldn’t take much to tip it either way frankly.\n\nI would say, underneath that, and it’s quite an important point to make, that if you split that overall GDP number into what we call the market economy and the government economy, actually the market economy was negative and the government economy was positive.\n\nThe big GDP revisions we had were all on the government economy - things like health and education.\n\nNow, going forwards, however, I think we are now seeing some signs of the beginning of a pick-up in some of the surveys, for instance. Certainly in our view in the February report we published two weeks ago, we have got a modest pickup this year which continues thereafter.\n\nWith that I will say goodbye for the day and hand you over to my colleague Alex Singleton.\n\n03:15 PM GMT\n\nBailey hails 'broad-based' falls in inflation\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England said the latest inflation figures were “encouraging” because of the “broad based” nature of the slow down in price rises.\n\nAndrew Bailey was speaking to the House of Lords Economic Affairs Committee after inflation remained steady at 4pc, below economists’ expectations of an increase to 4.1pc.\n\nHe said:\n\nIf you look under the surface there is a bit more to it than that, which is the encouraging bit.\n\nThe reason we were expecting a small tick up in inflation this month was because of these so-called annual base effects...\n\nThey were there, so nothing’s changed on those, they were in the arithmetic. What it means is there were some more other things going on which were putting more downward pressure on it [inflation] than we expected so that’s good news.\n\nAs far as I can tell, looking at it this morning, that amount of downward movement was pretty broad based - a bit of it in energy, some in food but also some of in services as well, so that’s quite encouraging.\n\nIt leaves us broadly where we thought we were going to be but that’s obviously encouraging compared to where we could have been.\n\n03:02 PM GMT\n\nKraft Heinz sales slide as customers switch to cheaper brands\n\nBaked beans and ketchup maker Kraft Heinz suffered a slip in sales during the fourth quarter as customers switched to cheaper brands.\n\nKraft Heinz had increased prices by 3.7pc as it sought to preserve profits as a result of inflation but as a result volumes fell by 4.4pc.\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company reported fourth-quarter earnings of $757m (£603m).\n\nThe processed food company with dual headquarters in Pittsburgh and Chicago posted revenue of $6.86bn, which fell shy of the $6.97bn forecast by analysts.\n\nFor the year, the company reported profit of $2.9bn, or $2.31 per share. Revenue was reported as $26.6bn. Heinz took a hit to profits as customers switch to cheaper alternatives - REUTERS/Andrew Kelly\n\n02:42 PM GMT\n\nContinental to cut more than 7,000 jobs as it switches to electric vehicles\n\nContinental will cut 7,150 jobs worldwide by 2025 as it navigates the difficult switch to electric vehicles.\n\nThe group, which makes tyres and supplies components to car manufacturers, said it would shed 1,750 jobs in research and development.\n\nMeanwhile, it will also lose around 5,400 posts as part of a previously announced cost-cutting programme aimed at saving the group €400m (£341m) by 2025.\n\nContinental, which currently employs around 200,000 people worldwide, announced the plan in November without putting a precise figure on the number of jobs that would go.\n\nContinental’s automotive chief Philipp von Hirschheydt said: “We are aware of the impact on our employees and will do everything we can to find good, tailored solutions (for employees).”\n\nHe said the cuts would allow Continental to “focus our resources even more on future technologies for software-defined vehicles”.\n\nGermany’s car industry has been facing problems as the transition to electric vehicles gathers pace, after decades relying on fossil fuel vehicles for their profits.\n\nContinental and rivals Robert Bosch and ZF Friedrichshafen are bracing for muted car production this year amid a slowdown in electric-vehicle demand.

We have been in the camp of later and lesser from central banks.\n\nIn premarket trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 0.2pc, the S&P 500 had gained 0.5pc and the Nasdaq 100 had risen 0.6pc.\n\n12:23 PM GMT\n\nJeff Bezos boosts fortune by selling $4bn in Amazon shares\n\nJeff Bezos has sold more than $4bn (£3.2bn) worth of Amazon stock, as the tech tycoon looks to cash in on some of his vast holdings.\n\nOur senior technology reporter Matthew Field has the details:\n\nThe Amazon founder bolstered his $190bn fortune in recent days by selling shares in two tranches worth $2bn apiece, which comes after his company’s share price neared an all-time high.\n\nAmazon’s shares have risen more than 12pc so far this year after the company reported a 14pc rise in Christmas sales last week. It recorded revenues of $170bn in the three months to December.\n\nThe share sales are Mr Bezos’s first since 2021 and follow his recent move from Washington state to Florida - where he will reportedly save hundreds of millions of dollars in taxes.\n\nMiami, which has no income or capital gains tax, has become increasingly popular among the ultra-wealthy in recent years.\n\nRead about his move to the island dubbed “Billionaire Bunker”.

US-produced West Texas Intermediate has fallen 0.2pc to less than $78.\n\nIt comes as the industry-funded American Petroleum Institute reported US crude stockpiles rose by 8.5m barrels last week, according to Bloomberg News.\n\nMeanwhile, Opec’s top official said on Tuesday that global oil demand is poised to expand strongly.\n\nHowever, a monthly outlook from the group revealed limited compliance with the members’ latest round of supply cuts.\n\nSeparately, the Paris-based International Energy Agency flagged comfortable markets this year, with expected supply growth more than satisfying worldwide consumption.\n\n11:40 AM GMT\n\nPay offer 'dead in the water,' says rail union boss\n\nAfter announcing the approval of more strike action, Aslef general secretary Mick Whelan said:\n\nThese results show – yet again – a clear rejection by train drivers of the ridiculous offer put to us in April last year by the Rail Delivery Group on behalf of the train operating companies with whom we are in dispute.\n\nThe RDG knew the offer would be rejected because we had told them that a land grab for all the terms & conditions we have negotiated over the years would be unacceptable.\n\nSince then our members have voted, time and again, for strikes. That’s why Mark Harper, the Transport Secretary, is being disingenuous when he says that offer should have been put to members. Drivers obviously wouldn’t vote for industrial action, again and again and again, if they thought that was a good offer. They don’t. That offer was dead in the water in April last year – and I think Mr Harper knows that.\n\nBut we remain open and willing, as ever, to talk about a revised offer. That’s why we are asking the Secretary of State for Transport, or the Rail Minister Huw Merriman, to come and meet us. Mr Harper hasn’t seen fit to talk to us since December 2022; Mr Merriman has not been in the room with us since January 2023; and the RDG has not talked to us since April last year.\n\nToday we are saying, clearly, to Mr Harper, Mr Merriman, the RDG and the TOCs, come and talk to us. Let’s sit around the table and negotiate. You don’t want any more strikes, and we do not want to be forced to take any more industrial action, although we have the renewed mandates to do just that.\n\nWe want to find a resolution to this dispute, for members who have not had a pay rise since our last deals ran out in 2019, and the only way to resolve this dispute is for the employers, and the government that stands behind them, to come and talk to us.\n\nThat’s why I’m saying the ball is in your court. We are ready to talk. Are you?\n\n11:22 AM GMT\n\nTrain drivers vote to hold more strikes\n\nTrain drivers at five rail operators have voted to continue taking strike action for six months in the long-running dispute over pay and conditions, Aslef has announced.\n\nWorkers at Chiltern Railways, c2c, East Midlands Railway, Northern Trains and TransPennine Trains have voted to hold more strikes.\n\nThe union now has live mandates for industrial action until August at all 16 train operating companies with whom it is in dispute.\n\nIt means commuters also face strike action at Avanti West Coast; CrossCountry; Greater Anglia; GTR Great Northern Thameslink; Great Western Railway; Island Line; LNER; Southeastern; Southern/Gatwick Express; South Western Railway main line; SWR depot drivers; and West Midlands Trains.

He said:\n\nThe headline rate remains on track to fall to the 2pc target in April, when the Ofgem cap on energy bills will be lowered sharply, and it may well drop further later in the year. Recession and deflation could soon be the bigger threats.\n\nThe headline rate was held down by a further fall in food price inflation and weakness in ‘furniture and household goods’ and ‘clothing and footwear’, suggesting that December’s slump in retail sales has prompted some heavier discounting. This is market forces at work.\n\nUnderlying all this, money and credit growth is subdued, which should continue to dampen inflation in the months ahead.\n\nInterest rates are probably on hold until May, but when the Bank of England does move it is likely to move quickly, with rates ending the year at around 4pc.\n\n09:14 AM GMT\n\nBP agrees tie-up with Abu Dhabi oil giant in Egypt\n\nBP and Abu Dhabi National Oil Co - known as Adnoc - have agreed to form a joint venture in Egypt that will focus on natural gas.\n\nLondon-listed oil giant BP will contribute its interests in three development concessions to the new tie-up, as well as exploration agreements in Egypt.\n\nMeanwhile, state-owned Adnoc will make a proportionate cash contribution which can be used for future growth opportunities.\n\nThe deal gives Abu Dhabi a foothold in Egypt, which supplies liquefied natural gas to Europe.\n\nBP and Italy’s Eni SpA have been working in the country for decades to develop fields and increase oil and gas production.

That will provide excellent cover for the MPC to pivot and start cutting interest rates.\n\n07:45 AM GMT\n\nInflation surprise ‘keeps alive’ hopes of spring interest rate cut\n\nInflation is easing more quickly than expected, economists have said, as the pace of price rises held steady last month in a surprise boost for the Prime Minister.\n\nRishi Sunak was given a Valentine’s Day gift as the consumer prices index remained unchanged at 4pc in January, according to the Office for National Statistics.\n\nEconomists had expected prices to rise by 4.1pc compared to the same month last year but many have said the latest data opens the door to earlier interest rate cuts from the Bank of England.\n\nA fall in interest rates, which currently stand at 5.25pc, would ease restrictions on household spending, delivering a boost for the economy.\n\nSamuel Tombs, chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures “keep alive chances” that the Bank of England will cut interest rates in the second quarter of this year, while Simon French of Panmure Gordon said inflation had continued its “softening trend”.\n\nResolution Foundation chief executive Torsten Bell said he does not “buy the market consensus that data this week points to later rate cuts”.\n\nThomas Pugh, economist at RSM UK, said: “Inflation in the UK economy is clearly easing much more quickly than expected and the surge in prices of the pandemic and energy crisis will soon be a bad memory.\n\n“Indeed, we still expect inflation to fall below 2pc as early as April, which would throw the door wide open to an interest rate cut in the spring or early summer.”\n\nMoney markets increased bets on interest rate cuts after the inflation data, pricing in around 70 basis points of reductions - equivalent to just under three quarter of a point cuts - up from about 58 basis points previously.\n\nI don’t really buy the market consensus that data this week points to later rate cuts.

It’s time for change.\n\nOnly Labour has a long-term plan to get Britain’s future back by delivering more jobs, more investment and cheaper bills.\n\n07:31 AM GMT\n\nUnderlying inflation lower than expected\n\nCore inflation, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, rose by 5.1pc in January, which was the same rate as in November and December and lower than economists forecasts of a rise to 5.2pc.\n\nThe figure, which is closely-watched by the Bank of England, has fallen from 7.1pc in May, which was the highest recorded since March 1992.\n\nPolicymakers have also pointed to the importance of services inflation, which they fear could keep inflation persistent and force them to keep interest rates higher.\n\nHowever, this performed better than expected, rising fractionally from 6.4pc in December to 6.5pc in January. Economists had forecast for the figure to jump to 6.8pc.\n\n07:21 AM GMT\n\nWe need to start seeing inflation fall, say estate agents\n\nInflation now needs to begin to fall to bring confidence back to the property market, according to an industry body.\n\nNathan Emerson, chief executive of Propertymark, which represents estate agents, said:\n\nThere is a silver lining in the fact that inflation has stayed the same as we are unlikely to see any increases to borrowing and further strains on the purses of the nation.\n\nThat being said, the Bank of England made an optimistic projection in February that the rate of inflation would be back down to 2pc, like it was prior to the pandemic, and whilst the figure remains at 4pv, this will be sure to make them cautious about cutting rates.\n\nWe now need to start seeing inflation fall so that interest rates can drop too, as this will result in more people being able to move home or step onto the housing ladder.\n\n07:18 AM GMT\n\nHunt: We have made huge progress on inflation\n\nAs inflation held steady at 4pc, Chancellor Jeremy Hunt said:\n\nInflation never falls in a perfect straight line, but the plan is working; we have made huge progress in bringing inflation down from 11pc, and the Bank of England forecast that it will fall to around 2pc in a matter of months.\n\n07:17 AM GMT\n\nMonthly food prices fall for first time in year two years\n\nThe Office for National Statistics said monthly prices for food and non-alcoholic beverage fell by 0.4pc between December and January, compared with a rise of 0.6pc a year ago.\n\nMonthly prices for food (excluding non-alcoholic beverages) also fell by 0.4pc.\n\nThis was the first fall in monthly prices since September 2021, and the largest fall since July 2021.\n\n07:14 AM GMT\n\nFood prices fall for first time in two years\n\nAs inflation remained steady at 4pc, ONS chief economist Grant Fitzner said:\n\nInflation was unchanged in January reflecting counteracting effects within the basket of goods and services.\n\nThe price of gas and electricity rose at a higher rate than this time last year due to the increase in the energy price cap, while the cost of second-hand cars went up for the first time since May.\n\nOffsetting these, prices of furniture and household goods decreased by more than a year ago and food prices fell on the month for the first time in over two years.\n\nAll of these factors combined resulted in no change to the headline rate this month.\n\n07:07 AM GMT\n\nInflation holds steady in unexpected boost for Sunak\n\nRishi Sunak has been given a Valentine’s Day gift as inflation unexpectedly held steady last month.\n\nThe consumer prices index (CPI) - which measures the costs that households face - was unchanged at 4pc in January, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).\n\nEconomists had expected prices to rise by 4.1pc compared to the same month last year.\n\nThe drop eases pressure on the Bank of England to keep interest rates higher for longer to bring inflation back down to its 2pc target.\n\nA fall in interest rates, which currently stand at 5.25pc, would ease restrictions on household spending, delivering a boost for the economy.\n\nIt would also lower government borrowing costs, providing the Chancellor with more headroom for spending in an election year.\n\nEconomists are already predicting that inflation will fall to 3.4pc in February.\n\nOn Tuesday, figures from the US showed that inflation slowed to 3.1pc from 3.4pc earlier, but the slowdown was less than the drop to 2.9pc that had been expected.\n\nIn the year to January 2024:\r\n\r\n&squf;️ Consumer Prices Index including owner occupiers’ housing costs (CPIH) rose by 4.2%, the same rate as December.\r\n\r\n&squf;️ Consumer Prices Index (CPI) rose by 4.0%, unchanged from 4.0% in December.\r\n\r\n➡️ https://t.co/OgNFNwsta0pic.twitter.com/MWx8Sz8iCo\n\n— Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) February 14, 2024\n\n07:03 AM GMT\n\nGood morning\n\nThanks for joining me.

The company's stock price is a massive bull run, rocketing 380% since the end of 2022, and was the best performing component of the S&P 500 in 2023. With that said, here are three things we'll be watching for when the chip giant announces its fourth-quarter earnings on February 21.\n\nArtificial intelligence. Nvidia is the tech industry's go-to provider for the powerful graphics processing units used to train and run generative models. Heck, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg announced that his company will purchase an incredible 350,000 Nvidia H100 cards by the end of 2024, at a price tag well into the billions of dollars. Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Tesla, you name it, every company is clamoring for Nvidia's chips.\n\nAnd those are just the tech giants. Smaller firms are also working to get their mitts on Nvidia's offerings. And with the earnings season already showing continued AI investment across the tech industry, Nvidia stand to continue to gain considerably.\n\nMarket expectations. Expectations for Nvidia's fourth quarter are sky high after the company stunned Wall Street in the prior period, when revenue rocketed an incredible 206% year over year to $18.12 billion. In the fourth quarter, the company is projecting revenue of $20 billion plus or minus 2%, well above analysts' prior expectations of $17.8 billion.\n\nAnd Wall Street doesn't see the growth stopping anytime soon. Bank of America recently raised its price target on Nvidia from $700 to $800. Goldman Sachs also raised its price target for the company to $800. It previously had a price target of $625 on the stock.\n\nRegulation and competition. Still, it's not all smooth sailing for Nvidia. The company is contending with US export restrictions blocking the sale of some of its high-end chips to China, one of its largest markets. And while that isn't hurting the company for now, it could mean the chip giant misses out on potential future sales.\n\nThen there are rivals.

        "title": "Arista Networks Is a Prime Beneficiary of Hyperscalers' AI Ambitions",
        "content": "Since the release of OpenAI's ChatGPT, artificial intelligence has captured the world's attention with its limitless possibilities of productivity benefits. The projected gains from AI's potential productivity boost have created a mad rush for enterprises to adopt AI applications in their organizations. At the same time, technology companies, led by hyperscale cloud companies, or hyperscalers, such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are also racing to build the back-end infrastructure to meet enterprise demand for AI.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with ANET.\n\nMost recently, Meta Platforms informed analysts on its full-year 2023 earnings call that they should expect to see higher capital expenditures due to increased infrastructure projects related to AI-specific data center projects.\n\nArista Networks Inc. (NYSE:ANET) is one of the biggest beneficiaries that stands to make the most of Meta Platform's AI data center projects. Despite the impressive 15% gains that Arista's investors have enjoyed so far for the year, I still see upside from current levels.\n\nBusiness model recap\n\nArista Networks is a leader in data center and cloud networking that has filled the innovation gap left behind by one of the largest incumbent competitors in the networking space, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO). Arista is the pioneer of low-latency switching technology, a technical framework built upon network components such as network applications and ethernet switching and routing platforms. These network components are extremely crucial for hyperscalers to maintain the high service levels of their cloud platforms and products, so they heavily rely on companies like Arista to provide low-latency, highly optimized network architecture.\n\nI have added an overview of Arista's cloud networking solutions below. But I will also mention here that data center and cloud products contribute significantly to its revenue since these products are also deployed with AI use cases in mind.\n\nStory continues Arista Networks Is a Prime Beneficiary of Hyperscalers' AI Ambitions\n\nThe company has two primary sources of revenue, with product revenue accounting for over 86% of total revenue per its third-quarter 10-Q filing. Product revenue usually comprises sales of its network products such as ethernet switches and routing platforms. Arista currently sells to about 9,000 customers worldwide, as per the last known reports in its 2022 10-K filing.\n\nHyperscalers are accretive to Arista's networking business growth\n\nOver the years, Arista has been able to forge strong business relationships with cloud computing companies. Arista's networking products have become extremely relevant in solving the most important business problems for most cloud computing companies, using its networking products to achieve incredible computational speed and minimal latency. Arista's products have been especially relevant to hyperscalers such as Microsoft and Meta Platforms, who, as I mentioned, have significantly ramped up their data center infrastructure to scale their cloud compute infrastructure. The hyperscalers, or \"cloud titans,\" as Arista likes to call them, plan and allocate for capital expenditures at the start of every financial year, which may be upgraded based on various factors such as macroeconomic situations improving, cloud applications and platform demand expanding.\n\nCurrently, Microsoft and Meta Platforms account for 16% and 26% of Arista's total revenue, respectively. Based on commentary from participants at the Wells Fargo TMT Summit last year, analysts usually estimate Microsoft and Meta Platforms account for around 43% of Arista's revenue. And with the proliferation of AI, both of these hyperscalers will continue to increase their data center capital expenditures over the next few years to meet infrastructure demand. I agree with these views since Meta recently announced during its fourth-quarter earnings call that it would be increasing capital expenditures by 23% in 2024, which immensely boosts Arista's revenue outlook for the year. The chart below shows how Arista's revenue grows stronger as its top two clients increase their own respective capex spends. Arista Networks Is a Prime Beneficiary of Hyperscalers' AI Ambitions\n\nIn addition, with large enterprises such as hyperscalers in Arista's client portfolio, the company enjoys strong margin growth at every level. The company's non-GAAP operating margin has grown from 37.70% in 2020 to 41% in 2022. On a year-to-date basis for 2023, Arista's non-GAAP operating margins have expanded to 43%, which is very impressive and bodes well for its valuation.\n\nWhile reviewing the company's books, I also wanted to mention the company's debt profile versus its cash. Total debt stands at $48 million, primarily due to lease obligations. But the company can easily service its debt since its cash and cash equivalents stand at $4.50 billion.\n\nArista still has room for upside based on valuation\n\nArista presented to a closed group of investors in their investor presentation on Nov. 9. In the absence of specific presentations or exclusive commentary, I will resort to reviewing management's follow-up commentary from the Wells Fargo TMT Summit. The company's long-term operating plan assumes it will gro revenue at a 15% compound annual growth rate from 2022 to 2027. At the same technology summit, management announced the company was on track to achieve 33% revenue growth in 2023, which is essentially more than twice the projected growth rate it expected over a five-year period. I believe management is being deliberate in tempering optimism about its future growth prospects. However, I will still assume 15% CAGR until 2027, with 2024 consensus expectations this year.\n\nOn the margin front, Arista has benefited from a boost in margins since demand for the company's networking products has given it more pricing power. However, management cautioned that margins would normalize in 2024. Assuming margins normalize, I will take the same margin rate this year as shown below. Arista Networks Is a Prime Beneficiary of Hyperscalers' AI Ambitions\n\nMy estimates project an 18.90% growth in income, which should warrant a forward price-earnings ratio of 28. At these premiums, Arista has enough room for upside, and I see this as a base case.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nBy selling networking products and solutions, Arista directly competes with the largest competitor in this space, Cisco, as I mentioned earlier. So far, Arista has been resilient by addressing the need for selling very specific networking products to hyperscalers and has since been constantly innovating and scaling its products. Network latency is one of the key performance metrics for all networking products, and all networking companies try to optimize their products to reduce network latency and optimize network architecture. However, if Arista fails to innovate, it may lose market share or, worse, its clients. This also puts the company at significant risk since hyperscalers account for around 43% of its revenue. Although Arista continues to benefit from its relationship with Microsoft and Meta, there would be a significant impact if Arista's products failed to meet its customers' requirements.\n\nAdditionally, Arista recently had a change of guard in the chief financial officer role. I expect the new CFO to continue to execute on prior targets that were announced and work toward further optimizing its margins, cash and debt profiles.\n\nFinally, if there are macro forces in the economy that cause Arista's clients, including hyperscalers, to reassess their capital expenditure budgets toward data center infrastructure spending, this could also impact its growth prospects.\n\nTakeaways\n\nWith cloud infrastructure companies leading the way in ramping up spending to build AI-intensive datacenters and meet enterprise demand, Arista Networks immensely benefits from these industry trends. The company's long-term growth model is intact, in my opinion. For now, my base case valuation finds this company to be still undervalued.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "How much a stock's price changes over time is a significant driver for most investors. Not only can price performance impact your portfolio, but it can help you compare investment results across sectors and industries as well.\n\nThe fear of missing out, or FOMO, also plays a factor in investing, especially with particular tech giants, as well as popular consumer-facing stocks.\n\nWhat if you'd invested in Meta Platforms (META) ten years ago? It may not have been easy to hold on to META for all that time, but if you did, how much would your investment be worth today?\n\nMeta Platforms' Business In-Depth\n\nWith that in mind, let's take a look at Meta Platforms' main business drivers.\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app owing to acquisitions. Along with in-house developed Messenger, these apps now form Meta’s family of products used by almost 3.96 billion people on a monthly basis as of Sep 30, 2023.\r\n\r\nNewly introduced metric, which is the family daily active people (DAP) that measures daily users of its family of products, was 3.14 billion, as of Sep 30. \r\n\r\nMeta uses metrics like daily active users (DAUs) and monthly active users (MAUs) to measure Facebook’s user base. As of Sep 30, 2023, DAUs and MAUs were 2.085 billion and 3.049 billion, respectively.\r\n\r\nHeadquartered in Menlo Park, CA, Meta generated revenues worth $116.61 billion in 2022. Advertisement accounted for 97.5% of revenues. Marketers buy ads that can appear on multiple platforms including Meta, Instagram, Messenger and third-party applications and websites.\r\n\r\nMeta, thanks to its huge user base gained a significant market share in the advertising space wherein it faces tough competition from Google, Twitter, Amazon and Snapchat-parent Snap.\r\n\r\nMeta also faces significant competition from the likes of Apple (messaging), YouTube (advertising and video), Bytedance (social media) and Tencent (messaging and social media).\r\n\r\nMeta core app enables people to connect, share, discover and communicate with one other on mobile devices and personal computers. User engagement on core Meta platform is fostered by News Feed that displays an algorithmically-ranked series of stories and advertisements customized for each user.\r\n\r\nInstagram is a community for sharing photos, videos and messages, enabling people to discover interests that they care about. People can express themselves through photos, videos and private messaging via Instagram Feed and Stories.\r\n\r\nMessenger helps people to connect with friends, family, groups and businesses across platforms and devices.

This return excludes dividends but includes price appreciation.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 170.69% and the price of gold increased 48.30% over the same time frame in comparison.\n\nAnalysts are forecasting more upside for META too.\n\nMeta is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. The company is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to aid prospects. Reels continued to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook driven by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter. However, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\n\nOver the past four weeks, shares have rallied 25.22%, and there have been 13 higher earnings estimate revisions in the past two months for fiscal 2024 compared to none lower. The consensus estimate has moved up as well.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Get Rich Quick With These 3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Augmented reality is admittedly in its infancy, but we can expect the sector to accelerate as recent innovations bring products to market and (ultimately) drive costs downward. Market value forecasts are a tricky metric to establish, but conservative estimates point to augmented reality being worth as much as $58 billion by 2028 while driving $38 billion in sales this year alone. This is an important consideration when investing in AR stocks.\n\nAs with any new and emergent tech, plenty of newcomers, upstarts, and startups are flooding the scene in a bid for investor attention. Of course, not all of these will come out on top. If you’re looking for augmented reality stocks, the best bet today is to stick with names you know – and these AR stocks are household names for a reason.\n\nSo here are three AR stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\n\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track to hit a record-setting $4 trillion market cap next year, with much of its newfound acceleration coming from augmented reality. While not staggering, the company’s already sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets, which is no mean feat at a $3,499 price tag. We’ll likely see sales accelerate as early adopters prove the product’s capabilities and, eventually, unit costs drop.\n\nOf course, a going concern moving forward is that the Vision Pro could begin to cannibalize sales across Apple product lines, specifically tablets and iPads, sales of which are already on a downswing. Apple is at an inflection point: while they wait for Vision Pro sales to settle and stabilize, they’re also waiting to see whether the new hardware and augmented reality tech is a mere diversion or represents what the iPod did in the mid-2000s. Either way – Apple is easily the dominant augmented reality stock today and the best bet for a blue-chip inroad into the emerging market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a close runner-up to Apple but may not stay in second place for long. In one major consumer review, Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro are neck-and-neck at four stars each – but the Quest Pro’s pricing is a fraction of Apple’s. This sets Meta up not as an inferior discount to Apple but as a cost leader able to innovate without brand-name bloat often associated with Apple. this makes it one of those AR stocks to consider.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Zuckerberg and the team have something brewing under the surface that likely relates to its augmented reality initiatives. In mid-January, Zuckerberg revealed billions of dollars worth of spending on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. While Meta’s AI initiatives doubtlessly contribute to the total, the company’s burgeoning “massive compute infrastructure” will just as likely service augmented reality platforms to boot – especially once integrated with AI.\n\nLike Apple, Meta is on the blue-chip side of augmented reality stocks, making it a safer bet to capture new trends as the sector develops.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An abstract illustration of an adult wearing an AR/VR headset.\n\nSource: Andrush via Shutterstock\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of today’s largest augmented reality manufacturers. As such, it likely won’t let new entrants or existing competitors take over its position. The company’s joint venture with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) solidifies its industry-leading hardware role and could be the next big thing as augmented reality markets mature.\n\nThis partnership aims to create a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, leveraging Qualcomm’s technology, Samsung’s hardware, and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. No specific product announcement has been announced. Still, analysts anticipate that the venture will produce a series of headsets that will introduce customers to new virtual reality experiences and generate significant revenue for Qualcomm.\n\nMeanwhile, QCOM continues to enhance its extensive range of virtual reality products, including headsets. The company’s Snapdragon processor equips its product line with the latest WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, fostering innovation in the augmented reality space and establishing new industry standards for others to emulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Jim Simons Adjusts Position in Herbalife Ltd",
        "content": "Recent Transaction Overview\n\nOn December 29, 2023, Renaissance Technologies, led by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), made a notable adjustment to its investment portfolio by reducing its stake in Herbalife Ltd (NYSE:HLF). The firm sold 126,100 shares of the nutrition company at a trade price of $15.26 per share. Following this transaction, Renaissance Technologies holds a total of 5,926,601 shares in Herbalife, which represents a 5.98% ownership in the company and a 0.15% position in the firm's portfolio.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) and Renaissance Technologies\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with HLF.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), a renowned mathematician and quantitative investor, founded Renaissance Technologies in 1982. The firm has since become one of the most successful hedge funds globally, known for its use of complex mathematical models and automated trading strategies. Renaissance Technologies' approach to the market is grounded in data analysis and scientific thinking, aiming to identify non-random price movements for predictive trading. As of now, the firm manages an equity portfolio worth $64.61 billion, with top holdings in technology and healthcare sectors, including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Novo Nordisk A/S (NYSE:NVO). Jim Simons Adjusts Position in Herbalife Ltd\n\nHerbalife Ltd at a Glance\n\nHerbalife Ltd, based in the Cayman Islands, operates as a global nutrition company, offering health and wellness products through a direct-selling model in 95 markets. The company's product portfolio includes weight management shakes, targeted nutrition supplements, and energy and fitness products. With a market capitalization of $1.17 billion and a P/E ratio of 6.31, Herbalife's financials reflect a company that is currently undervalued according to GuruFocus's GF Value, with a stock price to GF Value ratio of 0.44. The stock's current price stands at $11.8, which is significantly below the GF Value of $26.95.\n\nStory continues Jim Simons Adjusts Position in Herbalife Ltd\n\nImpact of the Trade on Simons' Portfolio\n\nThe recent sale of Herbalife shares by Renaissance Technologies has a minimal immediate impact on the firm's extensive portfolio. However, the reduction in Herbalife's position size, now at 0.15%, indicates a strategic decision by Simons to adjust the firm's exposure to the consumer packaged goods industry. This move could be a response to the stock's recent performance or a shift in the firm's investment strategy.\n\nHerbalife's Market Performance and Valuation\n\nSince the trade date, Herbalife's stock has experienced a decline of 22.67%, with a year-to-date drop of 23.18%. Despite this downward trend, the company's long-term performance since its IPO in 2004 shows a significant increase of 237.14%. The current stock price represents a substantial discount to the GF Value, suggesting that the stock may be significantly undervalued.\n\nFinancial Health and Growth Prospects\n\nHerbalife's financial health is a mixed picture, with a Financial Strength rank of 4/10 and a Profitability Rank of 9/10. The company's Growth Rank and GF Value Rank are both at 4/10, indicating moderate growth potential and fair valuation. Herbalife's Momentum Rank also stands at 4/10, reflecting a lack of strong momentum in its stock price.\n\nMarket Sentiment and Other Gurus' Positions\n\nThe Baupost Group is currently the largest guru shareholder in Herbalife, while other notable investment firms like HOTCHKIS & WILEY and Barrow, Hanley, Mewhinney & Strauss also maintain positions in the company. This diversified interest from multiple gurus suggests a mixed market sentiment towards Herbalife's stock.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' firm, Renaissance Technologies, has reduced its stake in Herbalife Ltd, a move that aligns with the firm's data-driven investment philosophy. Despite the stock's current undervaluation and strong profitability rank, the reduction in position size may reflect a strategic shift or a response to the stock's recent performance. For value investors, the current outlook for Herbalife Ltd warrants attention to the company's financial health, growth prospects, and market sentiment, as these factors will influence the stock's future trajectory.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' Latest Investment Move\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with CORT.\n\nRenowned investment firm Renaissance Technologies, led by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), has recently increased its stake in Corcept Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:CORT), a pharmaceutical company specializing in the treatment of severe metabolic, oncologic, and neuropsychiatric disorders. On December 29, 2023, the firm added 111,000 shares to its portfolio, reflecting a 0.01% trade impact and bringing its total share count to 6,725,871. This transaction underscores the firm's confidence in Corcept Therapeutics, even as it navigates the volatile biotechnology sector.\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio) and Renaissance Technologies\n\nJim Simons (Trades, Portfolio), the CEO of Renaissance Technologies, is a prominent figure in the investment world, known for his firm's data-driven and quantitative approach to trading. Since its inception in 1982, Renaissance Technologies has utilized complex mathematical models to predict market movements and execute trades. This scientific methodology aims to identify non-random price movements and capitalize on them, avoiding reliance on statistical flukes. The firm's portfolio is diverse, with significant holdings in technology and healthcare, including Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). With an equity portfolio valued at $64.61 billion, Renaissance Technologies remains a formidable force in the investment landscape. Jim Simons Bolsters Position in Corcept Therapeutics Inc\n\nCorcept Therapeutics at a Glance\n\nCorcept Therapeutics Inc, trading under the symbol CORT, has been a player in the biotechnology industry since its IPO on April 14, 2004. The company's focus on developing medications that modulate the effects of cortisol has positioned it as a leader in addressing complex health conditions. Despite the inherent risks of the biotech sector, Corcept has demonstrated financial resilience, with a market capitalization of $2.38 billion and a stock price that is currently deemed significantly undervalued according to GuruFocus's GF Value. The company's GF Score of 88/100 indicates a strong potential for outperformance, supported by high ranks in financial strength, profitability, and growth.\n\nStory continues Jim Simons Bolsters Position in Corcept Therapeutics Inc\n\nDetails of the Recent Trade\n\nThe acquisition of additional shares in Corcept Therapeutics by Renaissance Technologies took place at a trade price of $32.48. Since then, the stock has experienced a decline, currently trading at $23.05, which represents a -29.03% change. Despite this downturn, the firm's position in Corcept now accounts for 0.37% of its portfolio and 6.52% of the company's outstanding shares, indicating a significant level of commitment to the stock.\n\nPortfolio Impact of Corcept Therapeutics\n\nCorcept Therapeutics holds a strategic position within Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' portfolio, aligning with the firm's focus on technology and healthcare sectors. The recent trade has slightly increased the stock's weight in the portfolio, demonstrating a calculated move by the firm to capitalize on the stock's current undervaluation. This addition is consistent with the firm's investment philosophy of leveraging data analysis to identify market opportunities.\n\nMarket Dynamics and Corcept's Performance\n\nCorcept Therapeutics' stock has faced challenges in the market, with a year-to-date price change ratio of -4.59%. However, the company's long-term performance since its IPO has been positive, with an 88.16% price change. The stock's current valuation metrics, including a PE ratio of 28.46 and a price to GF Value of 0.70, suggest that it is significantly undervalued, potentially offering an attractive entry point for investors.\n\nFinancial Health and Rankings of Corcept Therapeutics\n\nCorcept Therapeutics boasts a robust balance sheet, with a Financial Strength rank of 9/10 and an impressive cash to debt ratio of 1,578.78. The company's Profitability Rank stands at 8/10, while its Growth Rank is a perfect 10/10, indicating strong potential for future expansion. The GF Value Rank also hits the top mark at 10/10, further reinforcing the stock's undervaluation status. However, the Momentum Rank is low at 2/10, reflecting recent market headwinds.\n\nComparative Analysis and Market Sentiment\n\nWhen compared to the largest guru shareholder in Corcept Therapeutics, Gotham Asset Management, LLC, Renaissance Technologies' recent move signals a bullish stance on the stock's prospects. Market sentiment and momentum indicators, such as the RSI and Momentum Index, suggest a mixed outlook, with the stock currently facing some negative pressure. Nonetheless, the firm's decision to increase its holdings may be indicative of a contrarian approach, banking on the company's strong fundamentals and potential for recovery.\n\nTransaction Influence and Outlook\n\nThe recent acquisition by Jim Simons (Trades, Portfolio)' firm has a modest yet strategic impact on its portfolio, reinforcing its position in a stock that exhibits strong financial health and growth prospects. While the market has yet to reflect the firm's optimism, the underlying fundamentals of Corcept Therapeutics, combined with its significantly undervalued status, could lead to favorable long-term returns. Investors will be watching closely to see if this calculated addition by one of the world's most successful hedge funds will pay off as anticipated.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 15 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico. You can skip our detailed analysis of Mexican immigration and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico.\n\nFor ages, immigration has been a part of life. However, with this fast-evolving world and digital access to even the remotest places, exposure to new and exciting lifestyles has greatly increased. People have become more open to novel experiences and moving away from your birth place is not altogether a difficult proposition. There are numerous reasons for immigration, though. While some venture into new territory to find better work and economic prosperity, other are simply in for a thrill and cultural diversity. Still there are some who move out because of socioeconomic or political turmoil in their original country and others who move across countries to be with family. Whatever the reason, immigrating to a country has become somewhat easier over the years.\n\nMexican Immigration: An Overview\n\nMexican immigrate from the country mainly for better economic opportunities. However, other reasons such as international treaties and security issues in the country, have also propelled Mexicans to move out. Mexico is the second country with most remittances in the world, expected to reach $67 billion by 2024. One of the easiest countries for Mexicans to immigrate to is the United States-- accounting for about 97% of all Mexico emigrants-- where work opportunities are higher. Aside from the US, Mexicans also immigrate to other countries including Canada (the next most popular country with 87,000 Mexican population), Spain (61,000), Germany (20,000), Italy, Portugal etc. The similarity in culture and language in Spain, as well as Portugal, seems to be the driving force behind this move. Other countries like Canada, and European states like Germany, England, and the Netherlands, have caught their eye mainly due to a broader and better job market.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Most Popular Destination for Mexicans\n\nThe number of Mexicans migrating to the US is much higher, compared to other countries. In 2021, about 10.7 million Mexican-born individuals were found to be living in America. While the immigration dropped for some time due to more immigrants moving out than moving in, this trend reversed after a while. Mexicans are also the largest group of unauthorized immigrants in the US- 48% of the estimated 11 million people in 2019. Although, in recent time this trend is seen to be moving downward, it remained at high levels of 63,000 monthly immigrants, for the time period January 2021 to June 2023. Documented Mexican labor migration is also on the rise. From 2019-2022, the H-2A visas (temporary Agricultural Work) for the Mexicans showed a 46.3% increase. Given the existence of both legal and illegal border immigration, US is one of the easiest countries to immigrate to from Mexico.\n\nRole of Big Companies in Sponsoring Work-Visas\n\nThere are many different visas through which immigration can be achieved. Work visas are especially relevant when one wishes to immigrate for better job prospects. Many big companies like Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ: META), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft  (NASDAQ: MFST), Accenture (NYSE: ACN), Cisco (NASDAQ: CSCO) etc. have realized the need for foreign manpower and are willing to sponsor workers from around the world, thereby further solidifying America’s position as one of the easiest countries to immigrate to from Mexico.\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ: GOOG), Meta (NASDAQ: META), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MFST), and Salesforce (NYSE: CRM) have, in fact, urged the US government to increase the cap for H-1B visa program so that more temporary foreign workers would be allowed to move into the country. Google (NASDAQ: GOOG), gained approval for 4,043 H-1B visa applications in 2023. Meta (NASDAQ: META had 2,628 approvals whereas Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MFST) had 8,065 and 3,547 respectively. 15 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico\n\n15 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the 15 easiest countries to immigrate to from Mexico, we focused primarily on the idea that Mexicans move to different countries for better economic and work opportunities. In order to incorporate these variables in our methodology, we relied on data from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020, taking into account scores for labor market mobility and permanent residency. We also use the employment rate for foreign-born from OECD Indicators of Immigrants Integration, 2023.  By averaging them, we identified countries that facilitate smoother relocation to countries while satisfying their main objective of economic betterment. A higher average score indicates a more favorable ranking.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

Hungary\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 81\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 37\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 80%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 39.6\n\nAs a potential immigration destination, Hungary has much to offer in the form of high standards of living and various types of work permits. Non-EU citizens have a favorable outlook towards securing their permanent residency, and while labor market mobility is not very high, temporary workers do have a high chance of access. Furthermore, the high employment rate for foreign-born suggests a successful integration of worker moving to Hungary. Therefore, we consider all these variables to include this country in our list of easiest countries to immigrate to from Mexico.\n\n14. Japan\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 63\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 77%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 40.9\n\nAs the 3rd largest economy in the world, Mexicans moving here would be able to enjoy a first-rate lifestyle, complete with excellent healthcare and safe and clean environment. The country also offers multiple types of work visas, including the regular Japan work visa, highly skilled professional visa, and working holiday visa. Permanent residents will find themselves qualified for various equivalent rights. Access to labor market, especially for temporary workers, is also reasonable.  The high employment rate is indicative of people finding and retaining work easily.\n\n13. New Zealand\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 63\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 81%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 40.9\n\nConsidered a popular destination for expats due to its high standards of income, health, education, and safety, Mexicans are also bound to have an experience of a lifetime living here. The country typically allows permanent residency on arrival or after a few days, thereby accelerating the process of integration for immigrants. Furthermore, there are more than 80 work visas through which immigration can be achieved and new workers in search of jobs can also benefit from targeted help. The employment rate also points to a high probability of gaining employment in New Zealand. Therefore, this Pacific Ocean country can be considered as one of the easiest countries for Mexicans to relocate to. The county is also one of the best countries to relocate to. Check out our article on 20 Best Countries to Relocate to for further details.\n\n12. South Korea\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 60\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 65\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 67%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 41.9\n\nAttracting expats through a high quality of life, affordable living costs, and high salaries, Mexicans seeking better work opportunities would find South Korea a very viable option. The country offers various types of work visas, and access to self-employment and public jobs, as well as general and targeted support for newcomers, is also quite favorable. The permanent residency status is secure, and the employment rate is high enough to encourage people to move there for work purposes. Thus, for people from Mexico looking to immigrate, Korea emerges as one of the easiest countries.\n\n11. Belgium\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 75\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 56\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 59%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 43.9\n\nSituated in the heart of Europe, Belgium has been an international hub for years. Non-EU/EEA residents can choose from a variety of work visas to move to this country. Incoming immigrants can expect better access to public jobs and vocational training in Belgium compared to other types of jobs. In addition, the employment rate is also quite favorable for prospective employees.\n\n10. USA\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 63\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 69\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 70%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 44.2\n\nThe US is a favorite spot for Mexicans due to many reasons, including better work opportunities, education, and family reunification. While targeted support is limited, the country, however, does provide equal access to the job market. Permanent residency is also somewhat favorable for immigrants. In addition, the employment rate points to a high chance of employment for foreign-born individuals. Thus, the US is not only a popular immigration destination but also finds a place in the list of one of the easiest for relocation.\n\n9. Italy\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 67\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 67\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 59%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 44.9\n\nDisplaying a historically rich and diverse heritage, Italy has been enticing people from around the world. With many ways open for immigration to Italy, including work visas, people of Mexican citizenship will also find this country as one of the easiest to immigrate to, as they have done for years now. Non-EU citizens moving in can hope to find access to basic employment as well as self-employment. Moreover, long-term residents of the country have a higher and more secure chance of integration. While the employment rate for foreign-born individuals is not very high, it still bodes well for new entrants to find some form of employment.\n\n8. Germany\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 54\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 81\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 68%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 45.2\n\nAs one of the biggest economies in the world, Germany offers a plethora of advantages, especially for people moving with the intention of improved chances of work. Ranked in the international Top Ten in the labor market mobility area, the German government ensures equal opportunities for non-EU residents to access a broader labor market and find stable and quality employment. Permanent residents are also encouraged to stay long-term and secure more stable jobs. Overall, the country is one of the easiest to immigrate to from Mexico.\n\n7. Spain\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 75\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 67\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 60%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 47.5\n\nCommon language, cultural, and familial links are some of the reasons Mexicans have been seen moving to Spain in the past years. The country can further enhance these attributes by providing a high quality of life at affordable costs. In addition, non-EU residents can enjoy equality when it comes to access to employment, self-employment, and general employment support. Permanent residency is also quite secure in this country and provides social security and assistance. Furthermore, foreign-born individuals can also hope to be gainfully employed in the country.\n\n6. Estonia\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 75\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 69\n\nEmployment Rate of Foreign-born: 71%\n\nInsider Monkey Average: 48.2\n\nAlthough a small country, Estonia has many tempting points with respect to immigration, as evidenced by a higher rate of expats settling in. In the mix of different routes for immigration, a long-term work visa can also help initiate the process. The new worker can partake of equal rights in vocational training and targeted measures for employment. Furthermore, the country presents great opportunities for the integration of its permanent residents. The data for the employment rate of foreign-born individuals also depicts a very favorable picture for those interested in gaining jobs. Thus, Estonia stands out as one of the easiest countries to immigrate to from Mexico.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Cities with the Highest Quality of Life in the US 12 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship 20 Best English Speaking Countries to Retire, Live, or Visit\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Easiest Countries to Immigrate to from Mexico is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "Big-name tech stocks posted strong earnings to start the year. But, if you missed the boat on Meta (NASDAQ:META) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), don’t lose hope. These tech stocks to buy now have plenty of room to run, and, in some cases, short-term news is putting undue downward pressure on share prices – offering an ideal entry opportunity for long-term investors looking for the next big thing.\n\nRanging from artificial intelligence, cloud computing, satellites, and more, these tech stocks to buy now could make up the next Magnificent 7 as their respective markets mature and they continue expanding at their current pace.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) easily tops the list of top tech stocks to buy now after its recent earnings strength, but remember that the tech stock isn’t a one-trick pony. In fact, the most recent quarterly report is the company’s fifth consecutive profitable quarter, affirming its S&P 500 eligibility. Remember that the S&P methodology requires four consecutive profitable quartersplus profitability for the most recent quarter, though that parameter doesn’t apply to incumbents.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, index inclusion aside, more bullish factors put Palantir at the top of the list of tech stocks to buy now. The biggest deal, and what drove bearish sentiment in the past, is Palantir’s accelerating commercial contract pipeline. In the past, concern centered around Palantir’s over-reliance on government contracting. That’s a valid consideration, but the company’s year-end commercial revenue grew 20% year-over-year (YoY), while government sales value climbed 14%. Though both top-line numbers point to strong momentum, commercial sales expansion points to Palantir successfully breaking free from its “defense stock” misconception.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Arista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSome top analysts see Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) as the “next big thing” for artificial intelligence, but, thus far, it’s been eclipsed by other big-name tech stocks competing for investor attention. But that could change in 2024.\n\nAnalysts, including those at Citi, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and more, rate Arista as a Buy based on future cloud sector expansion and AI opportunities. Specifically, Citi analyst Atif Malik said that Arita benefits from both the “generative AI megatrend” and broad “early AI-related opportunities.”\n\nThough the company hasn’t yet posted earnings, analyst forecasts trend toward the bullish side as well. Consensus estimates peg earnings per share at $1.70, or 20% higher YOY. The company’s last report beat expectations, with management painting a rosier-than-expected picture for Q4 and its end-of-year report. All eyes are on this tech stock to buy before its February 12th earnings call as AI investor sentiment cycles back to the “hard tech” side of the equation.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares suffered thus far in 2024 after a convertible note offering spooked investors wary of dilution. But the company’s 20% drop likely won’t last long – making today’s pricing entry point ideal among small-cap tech stocks. Most already know that the company secured a $515 million contract to launch and service select space assets, but wider institutional attention has only recently accelerated.\n\nSpecifically, like Arista, Citi analysts are bullish on RocketLab. The rating and analysis side of the banking giant set a Buy rating for the stock with a $6.00 price target, or about 40% above today’s per-share pricing. Citi set the target based on a 3x multiple of the company’s current sales projection, indicating that the substantial government contract is just the beginning of an expanding sales cycle as the company matures and proves competitive with existing space stocks. Small-cap tech stocks tend to have the best long-term upside potential at the cost of higher volatility, so getting in with RocketLab today is a surefire way to capture a slice of a $1 trillion growing industry.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nI talked last year about the investment opportunity that the Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and VMware merger represented from an equity arbitrage perspective. But, now that the deal is closed, there’s a tech stock opportunity in Broadcom now that VMware’s acquisition softens its reliance on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nHistorically, Apple accounts for about 20% of Broadcom’s revenue based on its ongoing 5G and wireless component deal. Expanding into cloud computing massively increases Broadcom’s total addressable market. Broadcom expects VMware integration to healthily boost its bottom line, although the first year also must account for about $1 billion in transaction costs that will cut into early-stage profitability. Still, a short-term hurdle is a small price to pay for long-term synergies, and Broadcom’s current per-share pricing (which has bearish undertones) positions it as a tech stock ready to surge once management fully divests unused VMware segments and begins working in sync with its new sectors.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications. World wide web on phone via wireless satellite network technology. Smartphone digital connection at clouds services of all earth. Holographic abstract interface. ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) can’t stop its winning streak after announcing a new, secret deal with the U.S. government. While “announcing” and “secret” might seem counter to one another, the secretive nature of the deal surrounds what AST will provide and for how much. But swirling unknowns don’t impact the main message. Like RocketLab, the U.S. government throwing its hat in with ASTS is an important endorsement of the company’s viability and offerings. That endorsement rings especially loudly, considering ASTS is firmly in the pre-revenue stages, with its first widespread commercial launches planned for later this year.\n\nThe news comes, of course, on the heels of ASTS’ massive strategic funding deal that includes big-name investors like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). That deal was soon followed by a dilutive share offering announcement, sending shares close to penny stock territory. But, with all the bullish tailwinds propelling this small-cap tech stock forward, expect big things in 2024 for ASTS.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: SoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) seems to have finally found its spot between “pure” next-gen fintech and bigger-picture legacy banking. At the end of January, the cheap tech stock banked its first-ever profitable quarter at a slim two cents per share. But profit is profit, and the fact that SoFi successfully nailed its first in a “higher for longer” macroclimate means that the stock should surge as rates settle.\n\nUniquely, SoFi is now pivoting toward a wider range of offerings to cement its place as a one-stop financial services stock when coupled with its range of banking and borrowing solutions. SoFi recently announced that it now offers alternative investments within its investment platform, letting investors access otherwise off-limit assets like private credit and venture capital through managed funds.\n\nNot all are as bullish on SoFi’s future as recent developments would imply, though, as Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the stock based on “[SoFi] pricing in too much optimism on the path to 2026 profitability laid […] while staring in the face of a worsening top-line growth outlook for 2024.” But investors have plenty to justify optimism, and the tech stock is still priced to buy well below past highs.\n\nFabrinet (FN) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip. Gloved Hand Holding Piece of Technological Wonder. Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN), a small-cap semiconductor stock, is another tech stock positioned for massive upside in the coming years. The company counts Nvidia among its big-name client list, underscoring its long-term potential. Even as chipmakers battle for supremacy, Fabrinet’s focus on data transmission makes it a major supplier to the best-in-class semiconductor stocks. This helps shield it from company-specific risk while capturing the entire segment’s long-term upside.\n\nThough the company reported underwhelming earnings last week, management’s long-term outlook remains rosy. Executives project a slight bump for next quarter’s earnings, though its forecast remains slightly below past analyst expectations. Slowing growth in the short term means consolidation and accumulation opportunities for investors before tech stocks’ next leg up as the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors keep maturing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

Last week, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) reported its fourth quarter earnings and it topped estimates fueled by AI demand that continues to be unrelenting in the U.S.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Palantir reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $608.4 million, topping LSEG’s estimate of $602.4 million. Net income grew from $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share Palantir earned in 2022’s comparable quarter to $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of 8 cents were in line with LSEG’s estimate.\n\nHeavy Reliance On Government Deals Is No Longer An Issue\n\nPalantir reported its customer base grew 35% YoY to 497 customers it served during the fourth quarter, showing it is enjoying a surging demand in the private sector whose customer count rose 44% annually. Therefore, Palantir showed it is successfully building its business outside its legacy government sector. What’s even more impressive is that Palantir used a low-cost mechanism to get customers into its pipeline.\n\nCustomer Acquisition At Its Finest\n\nWhile Microsoft infused billions into OpenAI, with Amazon and Alphabet following suit by investing into Antrophic, Palantir tried to stand out with a unique lead generation strategy. By hosting almost 600 immersive seminars that it calls \"boot camps”, Palantir aimed to fuel interest in its AI platform as it gives attendees the opportunity to try out its software and understand the value of Palantir’s contribution in generative AI-drive use cases. In 2023 alone, Palantir successfully hosted over 500 of those boot camps with growth of its private sector software users showing they did a good job of luring them in.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Operates In The Shadows Of Big Tech But It Won Its Place Fair And Square\n\nPalantir has delivered when it comes to profitability and it passed the test of consistency. Although its market cap of only $51 billion doesn’t place it in the basket tech mammoths like Microsoft, its latest jaw-dropping report had no shortage of impressive key performance indicators that sent its stock to the Moon as it rocketed by roughly 50% over the five trading days that followed its latest report. Like Microsoft and Amazon, Palantir showed what AI can do for business with expanding margins flowing to the bottom line, along with compounding cash flow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "Snap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) versus Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was always something of a David versus Goliath story. Meta, formally Facebook, was founded in 2004 while Mark Zuckerberg attended Harvard University, seven years before Evan Spiegel's Snapchat was started at Stanford University. Through the years, Meta has consistently looked to fend off up-and-coming rivals through any means necessary.\n\nIn 2013, just two years after Snapchat's founding, Facebook came in with a $3 billion offer to buy the nascent company to gain the younger users that Snapchat was seeing massive success in attracting.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Los Angeles startup is closing a real estate market gap worth hundreds of billions and you can invest in it with as little as $100. Cheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success.\n\nThat offer was rejected by a bold Spiegel, sealing the two company's fates as competitors in the social media space. While Snapchat was likely worrying about how it could take on industry giant Facebook, fresh off its 2012 initial public offering (IPO), it might not have realized Facebook's secret weapon would be another of its recent acquisitions.\n\nFor $1 billion, Facebook acquired Instagram, a core tool to soon copy Snapchat's innovative features, while still reaching the coveted younger demographic. Given that Facebook was not able to buy the newest thorn in its side, Facebook decided it had to build the features that made Snapchat enticing. Take Instagram stories, a feature similar to Snapchat stories. Instagram stories are used by over 500 million users every day.\n\nDaily users of that single Meta-owned feature surpass the 414 million daily active user count Snapchat reported in its most recent earnings release.\n\nTrending: Even if you're not ultra-wealthy, this startup could potentially become the success story you’ll retell at dinner parties.\n\nThe size of that gap, on top of a brutal quarter where Snapchat saw its stock dive about 35% on the day after its Feb. 6 earnings were released, has only grown more alarming as Meta's stock has soared about 36% year to date.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The company's rebound hasn't kept pace with the big tech titans,\"  Insider Intelligence principal analyst Jasmine Enberg told the Financial Times. According to Enberg, it’s not just Snapchat but the fight smaller companies are having against their larger competitors in general. \"We’re seeing the bigger companies get bigger and smaller companies are slower to rebound,\" she said.\n\nIn an attempt to explain an earnings report where revenue fell well short of Wall Street's expectations, Snapchat cited \"the onset of the conflict in the Middle East\" as \"a headwind to year-over-year growth of approximately 2 percentage points.\"\n\nRegardless of the recent sell-off in the stock, Snapchat has done well as an independent company, still valued at about $18 billion, or six times more than what Meta was willing to pay for it in 2013.\n\nHowever, if you invested in Meta stock at the start of 2013, you'd be up over 1,700%, well higher than the return Snapchat's team got by rejecting the offer to try to compete against the industry giant.\n\nRead Next:\n\nJoin the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups.

        "title": "OpenAI Dethroned? AI Giant Is Falling Behind As New Startup Takes the Top Spot Using The Same Strategy As Meta And Elon Musk's Grok",
        "content": "OpenAI, backed by Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) and known as the pioneer of AI innovation, now faces competition from up-and-coming players leveraging the potential of open-source models. Despite its early success with ChatGPT, OpenAI’s dominance is being challenged as newer AI companies gain momentum.\n\nOne such contender, Abacus.AI, has recently emerged as a frontrunner on the prominent LLM leaderboard, Hugging Face.\n\n\"Smaug-72B from Abacus.AI is available now on Hugging Face, is on top of the LLM leaderboard, and is the first model with an average score of 80!! In other words, it is the world's best open-source foundation model,\" posted Bindu Reddy, CEO of Abacus.AI X.com.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThis Los Angeles startup is closing a real estate market gap worth hundreds of billions, and you can invest in it with as little as $100. How to achieve your boldest financial goals in 2024? These investors have the latest tips.\n\nAbacus.AI’s flagship model, Smaug-72B, has swiftly claimed the spotlight, surpassing GPT-3.5 by a significant margin of 7%.\n\nThe rise of Abacus.AI underscores a broader trend within the AI community, where open-source initiatives are gaining traction and reshaping the competitive landscape.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), the prominent tech giant, has echoed this sentiment, advocating for greater transparency and openness in AI development and deployment.\n\n\"While we recognize there are times when it's appropriate for some proprietary models not to be released openly, broadly speaking, we believe openness is the best way to spread the benefits of these technologies,\" said Meta.\n\nTrending: Even if you're not ultra-wealthy, this startup could potentially become the success story you’ll retell at dinner parties.\n\nElon Musk has also been a vocal advocate for the need for AI development to be open-source. When naming OpenAI, the ‘Open' part was meant to mean open source. Now, Musk is building Grok, an open-source AI bot, under his xAI brand.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile acknowledging the validity of proprietary models in certain contexts, Meta emphasizes the benefits of openness in mitigating concerns surrounding AI’s impact.\n\nMeta’s stance aligns with the ethos embraced by Abacus.AI, which champions the potential of open-source language model (LLM) frameworks.\n\n\"Here at Abacus.AI, we are strong believers in the potential of open-source LLMs. The gap in performance with the major commercial closed-sourced models has steadily been decreasing over the last 6 months, thanks to first Llama, then Llama 2, and more recently Mistral and Mixtral, among many others,\" according to Abacus.AI's website.\n\nOpenAI may need to reassess its strategy to maintain relevance in an increasingly competitive landscape. While its contributions to AI innovation remain undeniable, embracing openness and collaboration may hold the key to sustaining its position at the forefront of technological advancement. As the AI race intensifies, adaptation and evolution are imperative for organizations aspiring to retain their competitive edge in this dynamic ecosystem.\n\nRead Next:\n\nJoin the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Add to Your Portfolio as S&amp;P 500 Roars Past 5,000",
        "content": "Easing inflation and rising optimism surrounding rate cuts sent stocks on a rally at the end of last year and the positive sentiment has been continuing. On Feb 9, the S&P 500 hit yet another milestone, breaching the 5,000 mark for the first time to close at 5,026.61 points.\n\nThe S&P 500’s rally has been continuing this year after a solid 2023 when it ended 23.9% higher. The index is now more than 6% higher on a year-to-date basis. A number of factors are boosting investors’ confidence, which has been helping Wall Street.\n\nRobust economic data, slowing inflation, and expectations of multiple rate cuts this year, along with solid four-quarter earnings, have lifted investors’ sentiment.\n\nU.S. GDP grew a solid 3.3% in the fourth quarter of 2023, surpassing estimates of a rise of 2%. Overall, U.S. GDP grew 2.5% in 2023, higher than 1.9% a year earlier.\n\nAlso, inflation has declined sharply over the past year, thanks to the Federal Reserve’s aggressive monetary tightening policy that saw it hike interest rates by 525 basis points to take its benchmark policy rate to the range of 5.25-5.50%.\n\nCore CPI, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, fell to 3.9% annually in December from 4% in November. Also, core PCE inflation, the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge, increased a meager 0.2% month over month in December, while it increased 2.9% annually, the lowest annual rate of interest since March 2021.\n\nInvestors are now trying to gauge when the Federal Reserve will go for its first rate cut. Although Fed Chair Jerome Powell sounded a bit hawkish and said that a March rate cut is unlikely, investors are pricing in at least five rate cuts of 25 basis points each this year. Investors are now expecting the first rate cut in May.\n\nAlso, the fourth-quarter earnings season has turned out to be quite impressive. As of Feb 9, 338 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their quarterly results, with total earnings of these companies up 5% compared to the same period last year, while revenues are up 3.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe optimistic scenario has also resulted in a solid rebound in consumer confidence. The Conference Board said that the U.S. consumer confidence level index rose to 114.8 in January, from December’s reading of 108, the highest since December 2021.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, American Express Company AXP, Colgate-Palmolive Company CL, Meta Platforms, Inc. META and Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN thathave a strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. Over the years, NVDA’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to artificial intelligence-based solutions that now support high performance computing, gaming and virtual reality platforms.\n\nNVIDIA has an expected earnings growth rate of 268.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last 60 days. NVDA presently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nAmerican Express Company is a diversified financial services company offering charge and credit payment card products, and travel-related services worldwide. AXP offers business travel-related services through its non-consolidated joint venture, American Express Global Business Travel (the GBT JV).\n\nAmerican Express Company has an expected earnings growth rate of 13.9% for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3% over the last 60 days. AXP currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company’s business strategy closely defines efforts to increase its leadership in key product categories through innovation in core businesses, tracking adjacent categories’ growth and expansion into new markets and channels.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 1.2% over the last 60 days. CL currently has a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. is the world’s largest social media platform.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) has surged over 5,000 for the first time largely due to significant increases in a few massive tech stocks.\n\nThe runs of stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), who are among the group that was dubbed the Magnificent Seven, have been well documented to this point. And we recently pointed out that their market dominance has made sense when considering their outsized contribution to the benchmark's earnings projections.\n\nIf earnings are the ultimate driver of long-term stock performance, then it's logical that the companies that contribute the most earnings growth to the benchmark will see outsized stock returns.\n\nBut the run of Magnificent Seven tech stocks leading earnings projections isn't projected to last for all of 2024.\n\nNew research from Bank of America's head of US equity and quantitative strategy Savita Subramanian shows the other 493 companies in the S&P 500 are expected to grow earnings by more than the Seven in the fourth quarter of 2024.\n\nAs seen in our chart of the day, the earnings recovery of the other 493 stocks would mark a significant reversal of earnings leadership in recent quarters. To Subramanian, this could signal a shift in stock market leadership too.\n\n\"We believe the narrowing growth differential will be the catalyst for the market broadening out,\" Subramanian and her Bank of America colleague Ohsung Kwon wrote in a note to clients on Monday.\n\nThis earnings shift puts fundamental backing to one of the most prominent calls on Wall Street to start 2024: The stock market rally will broaden. Subramanian says this will likely come in \"June or earlier.\"\n\nOn top of the earnings turnaround, Subramanian also highlights the Fed's interest rate path will play a key role in why market returns are expected to broaden. The June prediction is in line with projections from the bank's economics team for the first rate cut to come in June.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd this speaks to a larger thread that's formed among the folks who see a broadening coming — that the Fed's rate path needs to be more certain first.

(Robert Nickelsberg/Getty Images) (Robert Nickelsberg via Getty Images)\n\nFundstrat head of research Tom Lee wrote on Friday that his prediction for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200 is \"looking too conservative.\" But in the shorter term Lee believes \"uncertainty\" around the Fed could cause investors to get anxious.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider recently explained a similar theory to Yahoo Finance that once investors stop \"worrying so much\" about when exactly the Fed will cut, the rally can broaden as investor's come to terms with earnings expectations like those seen in Subramanian's chart.\n\n\"If I'm looking out over the next six or 12 markets, I do think we'll see an expansion in market breadth,\" Snider said.\n\nAnd it's not about seeing the Big Tech stocks tumble, he added. \"I think it's more likely you start to see more robust performance across the remainder of the equity market.\"\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, Meta Platforms Inc. META, NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Microsoft Corp. MSFT and Micron Technology Inc. MU.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nNasdaq Composite Back in Action: 5 Top Picks\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. — the world's largest contract chipmaker — recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nFuture Catalyst\n\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\n\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration’s R&D efforts.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoths with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance.\n\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\n\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nZacks Names \"Single Best Pick to Double\"\n\nFrom thousands of stocks, 5 Zacks experts each have chosen their favorite to skyrocket +100% or more in months to come. From those 5, Director of Research Sheraz Mian hand-picks one to have the most explosive upside of all.\n\nIt’s a little-known chemical company that’s up 65% over last year, yet still dirt cheap. With unrelenting demand, soaring 2022 earnings estimates, and $1.5 billion for repurchasing shares, retail investors could jump in at any time.\n\nThis company could rival or surpass other recent Zacks’ Stocks Set to Double like Boston Beer Company which shot up +143.0% in little more than 9 months and NVIDIA which boomed +175.9% in one year.\n\nFree: See Our Top Stock and 4 Runners Up >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "US judge blocks Ohio law restricting children's use of social media",
        "content": "By Nate Raymond\n\nFeb 12 (Reuters) - A federal judge on Monday prevented Ohio from implementing a new law that requires social media companies, including Meta Platform's Instagram and ByteDance's TikTok, to obtain parental consent before allowing children under 16 to use their platforms.\n\nChief U.S. District Judge Algenon Marbley in Columbia agreed with the tech industry trade group NetChoice that the law violated minors' free speech rights under the U.S. Constitution's First Amendment.\n\nIt marked the latest court decision blocking a state's law designed to protect young people online as federal and state lawmakers look for ways to address rising concerns about the dangers posed by social media to the mental health of children.\n\nOhio's Republican attorney general, Dave Yost, had argued that the state's Social Media Parental Notification Act, which the legislature passed in July, was a valid measure aimed at protecting minors from damage to their mental health and sexual predators.\n\nBut Marbley agreed with NetChoice, whose members include TikTok, Elon Musk's X, Alphabet's YouTube, and Meta's Facebook and Instagram, that the law was \"not narrowly tailored to those ends.\"\n\n\"Foreclosing minors under sixteen from accessing all content on websites that the Act purports to cover, absent affirmative parental consent, is a breathtakingly blunt instrument for reducing social media’s harm to children,\" he wrote.\n\nMonday's ruling put Ohio's law on hold indefinitely while the litigation continues after the judge last month issued an order that temporarily blocked it from taking effect on Jan. 15 as scheduled.\n\nOhio Governor Mike DeWine, a Republican, called the ruling disappointing. He cited \"overwhelming evidence that social media has a negative effect on the mental health of minors, including increases in depression and suicide-related behavior.\"\n\n\"Since the federal courts are interpreting federal constitutional law as preventing the state of Ohio from protecting Ohio’s children, then Congress needs to act to protect our country’s children,\" he said in a statement.\n\nNetChoice last year won court rulings blocking a similar social media parental consent law in Arkansas and a children's digital privacy law in California. It is challenging restrictions adopted in Utah as well. (Reporting by Nate Raymond in Boston; Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Jonathan Oatis)",

        "content": "The S&P 500 closed above 5,000 for the first time on Friday, propelled by strong earnings from mega-cap technology companies. Now investors are focused on whether positive momentum can broaden out beyond the Magnificent Seven components.\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- The S&P 500 surging over 5,000 for the first time largely due to significant increases in a few massive tech names. But our stock market gains set to broaden in 2024. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. We have heard this before. We've heard this question before.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yes. Everyone's been talking.\n\n- Are they going to broaden? Do we now.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: --for months, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: One thing, though, guys that I did bring with us today is a little bit more evidence that shows why we might broaden. Because I think that's one thing that I know. I've gotten into many conversations with strategists about and I'm sure you guys have too is, OK, so we're going to broaden, well, one of my first questions is always, when are we going to see it in earnings? We have to see it in earnings at some point to prove what we probably see in price reaction and Bank of America was out with an interesting note today.\n\nPointing out the difference in Mag Seven earnings expectations versus the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, and essentially pointing out, you can see here with your purple and blue lines, the purple line is the 493, the non Mag Seven stocks. The light blue line is the Mag Seven stocks. You can see in Q4 right now analyst projections are for the 493 to finally cross the Mag Seven and have higher year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nNow we could probably point to the fact that Mag Seven is going to have tough comps at that point in Q4 as far as your earnings growth goes. But we're seeing that gap really come closer together guys. And I think that's the big takeaway here. And B of A made the point that that might lead to some level of broadening or at least support that to see that. Because remember, we were looking at that one graph with big tech a couple of weeks ago before earnings, and it was just a massive dispersion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we're seeing that come away a little bit.\n\n- Yeah. When you talk to strategists, Josh, do they say, OK, well, if this rally is going to continue, it has to broaden?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: It seems like that at some point. Yes. At some point, strategists argue we would have to see more than basically at this point you could argue. It's for stocks driving us higher. But I think the main thing that most strategists are pointing out is it's probably not going to happen tomorrow and it might not even happen this month, Josh. I think a lot of people are highlighting-- Bank of America specifically highlighting June.\n\nA lot of people are talking that area of time because what do we think we're going to see in May or June? Probably a little bit more certainty around the Fed. That's becoming the consensus call. When we talk about broadening now is we still think it's going to happen, but we need the Fed to get out of the way first. And then we might see that broadening happen.\n\nSo a lot of people do think, if we're going to go significantly higher than where we're at now with 5,000, maybe there is some sort of consolidation. We sell off a little bit. And then you move higher once we get the Fed out of the way, so to speak in a better understanding of where they're headed.\n\n- Out of the way. That's what we're watching for. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it.",

        "content": "Cloud computing has helped corporations increase productivity and reduce costs. Once a business uses cloud computing, it continues to pay annual fees to keep its digital infrastructure.\n\nCloud solutions can quickly turn into a company’s backbone. It’s one of the last costs some companies will think of removing. Firms that operate in the cloud computing industry often benefit from high renewal rates, recurring revenue and the ability to raise prices in the future. Investors can capitalize on the trend with these cloud computing stocks.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) had a record-breaking Black Friday and optimized its logistics to offer the fastest delivery speeds ever for Amazon Prime members. Over seven billion products arrived at people’s doors on the same or the next day or the order. It’s a testament to Amazon’s vast same-day delivery network that encompasses 110 U.S. metro areas and more than 55 dedicated same-day sites across the United States.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe delivery network makes Amazon Prime more enticing for current members and people on the fence. The company’s efforts paid off and resulted in 14% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nAmazon’s ventures into artificial intelligence (AI) can also lead to meaningful stock appreciation. The company’s generative AI investments have paid off and strengthened Amazon Web Services’ value proposition. Developers can easily scale AI apps with Amazon’s Bedrock. These resources can help corporations increase productivity and generate more sales.\n\nInnovations like these will help Amazon generate more traction for its e-commerce and cloud computing segments. The AI sector has many tailwinds that can help Amazon stock march higher for long-term investors.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a staple in many funds. The equity has outperformed the broader market with a 58% gain over the past year. Shares are up by 170% over the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares trade at a reasonable 22x forward P/E ratio. The stock initially lost some value after earnings but has parried some of its losses. The earnings report wasn’t too bad, with 13% YoY revenue growth and 52% YoY net income growth.\n\nInvestors may have wanted higher numbers since Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reported better results. However, a 7% drop in earnings didn’t make much sense. The business model is still robust and is accelerating revenue and earnings growth. Alphabet also has a lengthy history of rewarding long-term investors.\n\nMany analysts believe the equity looks like a solid long-term buy. The average price target implies a 9% upside. The highest price target of $175 per share suggests the equity can rally 16.5% from current levels.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is an information technology company with an advanced cloud platform that helps corporations increase their productivity and sales. The equity has comfortably outperformed the market with 1-year and 5-year gains of 77% and 248%, respectively.\n\nThe company currently trades at a 61x forward P/E ratio, meaning you’ll need a long-term outlook to justify the valuation. ServiceNow certainly delivers on the financial front, increasing revenue by 26% YoY in Q4 2023. ServiceNow also reported $295 million in GAAP net income, a 97% YoY improvement. The company generated $150 million in GAAP net income during the same period last year.\n\nRevenue is going up, and profit margins are accelerating. These are two promising signs for a company that boasts a 99% renewal rate for its core product. The company’s subscription revenue continues to grow at a fast clip and generates predictable annual recurring revenue.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in NOW.

        "title": "Snap Got Crushed By Growth Concerns",
        "content": "Last week, Snap (NYSE: SNAP) stock got crushed as they tumbled nearly a third after the social media company published its fourth quarter results on Tuesday, a day after announcing it will be cutting 10% of its global workforce as part of its reorganization that aims to reduce hierarchy and promote better collaboration. Even Facebook and Instagram owner, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Google and YouTube parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG) were not immune to layoffs that plagued the industry.\n\nBut the world’s biggest players got to benefit from online ad market recovery.\n\nSnap narrowly missed Wall Street’s expectations while its much bigger peers and world’s biggest advertisers, Alphabet and Meta Platforms scored far batter. Even Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) reported impressive online ad growth. Collectively, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon ad revenues grew more than $17 billion YoY in fourth quarteralone. Meta reported its ad revenue rose 23.8% YoY to $38.7 billion. Alphabet reported its ad revenue rose 11% YoYto $65.52 billion. Amazon reported its ad services grew at an impressive rate of 26.8% YoY to $14.65 billion primarily due to sponsored ads.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter that ended on December 31st, Snap reported that sales rose 5% YoY to $1.36 billion which was below $1.38 billion that Wall Street expected. However, its net losses narrowed from $288 million to $248 million.\n\nDisappointing monetization despite solid user growth.\n\nSnap reported better than anticipated sales growth but less optimistic sales conversion rates. Although Snap had 414 million daily active users which translate to a 10% YoY growth and sequential increase of 2%, average revenue per user (ARPU) dropped significantly from $3.47 made during last year’s comparable quarter to $3.20, clearly showing that revenue performance fell short.\n\nStory continues\n\nMixed guidance made Wall Street concerned about the sales makeup.\n\nSnap expects DAUs to increase to 420 million in the first quarter, but ARPU is expected to fall short again. Snap guided for revenue growth between 11% and 15% which implies revenue in the range between $1.095 billion and $1.135 billion.\n\nSnap and Pinterest have a different online ad narrative compared to Meta.\n\nLast week, Pinterest (NYSE: PINS) showed it is under monetized across the board. Pinterest reported revenue rose 12% but $981 million came short of LSEG’s estimate of $991 million. Along with the disappointing revenue, Pinterest also issued a weaker than expected guidance. In response, Pinterest turned to Google for help to get monetization done right, along with its existing Amazon partnership. Therefore, with Pinterest and Snap on one side, and Meta and Google on the other one, it is obvious that only the world’s biggest players got to benefit from the ad market rebound while smaller players still grapple with the consequences of the slowdown.\n\nSnap ended 2023 with 7 million premium subscribers who pay for its Snapchat+ and it will now focus its efforts on growing users and deepening engagement in ‘monetizable’ markets that include North America and Europe.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The tech companies best positioned to benefit most from AI",
        "content": "Wall Street firms are taking picks on which tech giants will come out on top of the artificial intelligence landscape. Jefferies analysts foresee Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to dominate in consumer AI offerings, while Evercore ISI expects Apple (AAPL) and its devices to benefit the most from large language models.\n\nYahoo Finance Live discusses where these companies will see the biggest opportunities from AI integration and when it will become most apparent in earnings figures.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: While artificial intelligence remains the talk of the town in 2024 after the boom in '23. As more companies expand AI investments, Wall Street is weighing in on who stands to benefit from the AI liftoff.\n\nJefferies shouting out Meta and Alphabet as best positioned to win the consumer AI opportunity. While Evercore ISI names Apple as an underappreciated artificial intelligence beneficiary here. Just a larger question of what artificial intelligence and generative AI consumers will flock into and who within, not just the software space, but also the hardware space, where it's extremely difficult to get that right out of the gate, where the early adopters will perhaps have a thought process or, at least, some type of praise that permeates even further into the condom-- the common consumer that's out there as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. Because when you think of perhaps adding generative AI on as something to add on that you don't already have versus the note that we saw from Evercore ISI analyst, Amit Daryanani, saying that the company isn't underappreciated AI beneficiary, but then really ties it to Siri. So something that you have-- millions of people who already have those phones in their pockets already use Siri. So really, a natural evolution there versus having to add ChatGPT onto something else that you're perhaps not familiar with.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRAD SMITH: Right. They said that. And in this Jefferies note, it was interesting, 89% of full-time office workers in the US have heard of ChatGPT. That's up from 52% in February of 2023. Now, the increased usage of AI tools-- they're also mentioning there that in tandem, it brings fear of AI job automation.\n\nWhat we've had a discussion about time and time again, whenever there is a job's day, and we're talking about when AI is going to show up in the productivity numbers, when generative AI is going to show up as a broader impact to the employment situation.\n\nWe're still a ways off from it, having a huge impact on either of those fronts. But it is a larger question of how many corporations are already starting to plan out, what resources look like, what spends on technology versus human resources also looks like to facilitate and unlock, perhaps, that next leg of productivity, and how many of us are working in tandem with some of that generative AI to complete menial tasks at the end of the day too.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. Because even though clearly a lot more people have heard of it in terms of how they use it in their work. I think a lot of people are still trying to figure that out, because it's one thing to have it sitting there, and then you're really not sure if it's something that you can use if you have permission to use it, how much of it you can use, the ethics around it.\n\nSo I think perhaps if there was a bit more clarity in how people could use it, and even how useful they find it, because usually, it's creatives or it's for some of these menial tasks. But if it's like mid-journey, something else, something creative-- but then when it comes to your everyday working life, where those guidelines are still not clear.\n\nBRAD SMITH: I think in marketing automation tools, it's one area. Easily, it could have a big impact. You think about all the different marketing automation campaigns. And I'm thinking of how this could impact a company in Oracle even and some of the subsidiaries that they have, or even in Salesforce, where as they had their AI Day last year, and we're talking about how it can help sales teams more efficiently craft an email that could be ready to go out.\n\nSo what type of jobs does that impact? How much quicker? Does it allow you to have that touch point and bring back in different points of contact that you've had with the customer?\n\nSo there's a bevy of different ways to think about how it could be implemented.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Still figuring all of that out, of course.",

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts Look Bullish on Meta Platforms (META): Should You Buy?",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Meta Platforms (META) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nMeta Platforms currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.29, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 45 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.29 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 45 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 39 are Strong Buy and one is Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 86.7% and 2.2% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for META Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for META\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Meta Platforms here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Meta Platforms, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nAre you wondering why? The vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover often results in a strong positive bias of their analysts in rating it. Our research shows that for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nThere is also a key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank when it comes to freshness. When you look at the ABR, it may not be up-to-date. Nonetheless, since brokerage analysts constantly revise their earnings estimates to reflect changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in predicting future stock prices.\n\nIs META a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Meta Platforms, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 10.8% over the past month to $19.62.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Meta Platforms. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Meta Platforms may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look atJim Cramer's 11 Latest Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nJim Cramer examined the recent market movements during his program on CNBC on February 10. Cramer said the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks. Cramer said this hasn’t happened since 1972.  He thinks amid strong earnings and rate cuts on the horizon, investors have learned that you are much better off \"owning stocks\" instead of trading them. Cramer said he's long been a believer of owning stocks and holding them for long periods of time. Cramer talked about the recent market rally and said it would take something really \"nasty\" to stop this rally.\n\nWhat is the Best Time to Buy Stocks?\n\nCramer said the best time to own stocks is between the Fed's last rate hike and the first cut. Cramer said that it would make sense for the Fed to postpone rate cuts amid inflation and investors can skill take benefit from strong earnings and rally in stocks.\n\n\"Authentic Stupidity\"\n\nCramer recently also talked about a trend which he calls \"authentic stupidity\" where some stocks that should go higher are either going down or unable to realize their true potential. Cramer believes Apple is one of the victims of this authentic stupidity. Cramer quoted a \"nameless analyst\" from DA Davidson who in January gave a $166 price target to Apple and a Neutral rating, citing lack of innovation. Cramer said the same analyst, after the launch of Apple's Vision Pro, upped his price target on Apple shares to $200 and said \"game changing innovation is back.\" Jim Cramer's Latest Stock Picks\n\nEveryone knows Cramer is bullish on mega-cap quality tech stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN). But what are his latest stock picks? For this article we watched Cramer's latest programs and picked some new stocks on the analyst's radar. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n11. Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 40\n\nJim Cramer believes Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH), which is down about 42% over the past one year, might finally be bottoming. Cramer said Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH) suffered because of rising interest rates since the residential solar industry was highly reliant on financing. Cramer quoted Enphase Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH) CEO Badri Kothandaraman who recently said in Enphase Energy Inc's (NASDAQ:ENPH) fourth quarter earnings call that things are expected to start turning around for Enphase Energy Inc (NASDAQ:ENPH) in the first quarter.\n\nCramer specifically highlighted the following comments of the CEO:\n\n\"We think Q1 could be the bottom quarter. Europe is already showing early signs of recovery, and we expect the non-California states to bounce back quickly.\"\n\nEnphase also talked about Q1 guidance during its call:\n\n\"Let’s now come to our Q1 guidance. We are guiding revenue in the range of $260 million to $300 million. We expect the sell-through of our products to be seasonally down in Q1. We plan to undership to the end market demand for our products by approximately $130 million in Q1. We are forecasting to undership in Q2 as well, although at a much reduced level, and expect the channel to be normalized by the end of Q2. Let’s talk about new products, starting with IQ batteries. Our sell-through for batteries has been increasing steadily over the last few quarters. Our third-generation battery delivers the best power specs and commissioning times of any Enphase battery today at a 15-year industry-leading warranty. The battery adoption rates are on the rise globally and we are well positioned to grow our battery sales in 2024.\"\n\nYou can read the entire earnings call transcript of Enphase by clicking here.\n\n10. Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 49\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on asset management and financial services company Oxford Lane Capital Corp (NASDAQ:OXLC). Cramer advised against buying the stock as he said we don’t know \"what they own.\" Cramer said he likes \"the concept\" of the industry and in this regard recommended investors to buy Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) instead.\n\n\"They really know how to do it,\" Cramer said.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX). The biggest stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX) is owned by Thomas Steyer's Farallon Capital which owns a $239 million stake in Blackstone Inc (NYSE:BX).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We remain optimistic about the long-term prospects for Blackstone Inc. (NYSE:BX) and Brookfield because we believe both companies are likely to increase market share in a secular growth opportunity for alternative assets.\n\nInstitutional allocations to alternative investment assets such as real estate, infrastructure, and private equity are likely to continue to grow significantly in the years ahead because alternatives have a long track record of generating attractive relative and absolute returns with less volatility than several other investment options.\n\nWe are bullish on the long-term prospects for Blackstone and Brookfield. Both companies are led by exceptional management teams that attract and retain exceptional talent. They are two of the largest real estate managers in the world with impressive investment track records. Both Blackstone and Brookfield have global franchises, strong brands, and loyal customers.\n\nWe believe the shares of both companies are attractively valued and are optimistic about the long-term potential for the Fund’s investments in both companies.”\n\n9. Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nSpecialty chemicals and ingredients company Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) ranks ninth in our list of the best stocks to buy now according to Jim Cramer.  A questioner recently asked Jim Cramer whether she should buy more Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) shares. Cramer said the answer is \"Yes.\" Cramer believes the water chemicals business had a tough year in 2023 but he sees only good times ahead for the sector.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN), compared to just seven hedge funds in the previous quarter. This shows a major increase in hedge fund sentiment.\n\nA total of 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Hawkins Inc (NASDAQ:HWKN) as of the end of the third quarter of 2023.\n\n8. Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 35\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on insurance company Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL). Cramer said the stock is a Buy. Cramer thinks Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL) shares should be bought because the insurance industry is thriving.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 35 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL).\n\nIn addition to Allstate Corp (NYSE:ALL), Cramer is also bullish on Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n7. Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 57\n\nJim Cramer recently praised Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) earnings on Twitter as well as during his program on CNBC. Cramer said that investors were wrong to be wary of Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) . During the fourth quarter Chipotle's adjusted EPS came in at $10.36, beating estimates by $0.63. Revenue in the quarter jumped 15.6% year over year to $2.52 billion, beating estimates by $30 million. Comparable sales jumped 8.4%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 57 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) . The biggest stake in the company is owned by Bill Ackman's Pershing Square which owns a $1.7 billion stake in the company.\n\nClearBridge Mid Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the consumer discretionary sector, Chipotle Mexican Grill, Inc. (NYSE:CMG) proved a detractor as investors were disappointed in management’s decision not to push additional menu pricing, which resulted in full year guidance falling short of expectations. However, we believe this is just a timing mismatch as their value proposition relative to peers leaves room for continued strong pricing power.”\n\n6. Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 63\n\nJim Cramer was asked about his thoughts on home construction company Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) in a latest program. Cramer said Lennar Corp (NYSE:LEN) is \"so good\" and praised Lennar Corp's (NYSE:LEN) leadership.

        "title": "Nasdaq Composite Back in Action: 5 Top Picks",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is back in action after an astonishing rally in 2023. The tech-heavy index soared 43.4% last year, recording its best year since 2020. The index’s smooth rally suffered a small hurdle last month, although finally, it closed January on a positive note with a mere 1% gain.\n\nHowever, the tech-laden index has regained momentum in February. Year to date, the Nasdaq Composite is up 8.3% compared with 6% gain of the S&P 500 and 2.5% of the Dow. Last week, the index advanced 2.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\n\nExplosion of Generative AI\n\nThe tech rally in 2023 was led by a massive thrust toward AI, especially generative AI. Some financial and technology experts believe that AI is much-hyped and may lead to a bubble. We believe that the AI-space is yet to unfold in the U.S. and international markets. Once that happens, it will generate huge business opportunities for technology companies to produce high-end products.\n\nMoreover, the robust fundamentals of the U.S. economy reduce concerns of a near-term recession. Additionally, the blockbuster earnings in the last reported quarter of NVIDIA — the largest global manufacturer of generative AI chipsets — raised expectations of investors that the market for AI will show strong growth in the coming decade.\n\nTaiwanese chipmaker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd. — the world's largest contract chipmaker — recently projected more than 20% revenue growth in 2024 on booming demand for high-end chips used in AI applications even as the broader industry faces weak smartphone and electric vehicle sales.\n\nSmart Devices Aiding Computing Demand\n\nSmart devices need computing and learning capabilities to perform face detection, image recognition and video analytics capabilities. These require high processing power, speed and memory, low power consumption, and better graphic processors and solutions, which bode well for the semiconductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe World Semiconductor Trade Statistics (“WSTS”) projects robust growth in 2024, with an estimated surge of 13.1% annually. As estimated by WSTS, global semiconductor sales should reach $588.4 billion in 2024.\n\nTechnology research and advisory firm IDC predicts 20.2% year-over-year growth in semiconductor sales in 2024, driven by demand from AI servers and end-point device manufacturers.\n\nGrand View Research estimates that annual spending across AI hardware, software, and services will see massive growth of 820%, from $197 billion in 2023 to $1.8 trillion in 2030, implying an annual growth rate of 37% over that time period.\n\nFuture Catalyst\n\nOn Feb 9, the Biden administration announced an investment of $5 billion in a public-private consortium to support R&D activities in advanced computer chips. On Aug 9, 2022, President Joe Biden signed the CHIPS and Science Act. This legislation allots $50 billion to help computer chip manufacturers and ease the shortage of components vital for a range of industries.\n\nThe National Semiconductor Technology Center (\"NSTC\") was funded through this act with $39 billion allocated to chip manufacturers and $11 billion set aside for chip R&D purposes. The newly released $5 billion will also be given to NSTC as the government recognized NSTC as the centerpiece of the administration’s R&D efforts.\n\nThe Biden administration has expressed concerns that the United States had a 39% share of global semiconductor and microelectronic production in 1990, which has drastically dropped to just 12% at present.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five Nasdaq Composite listed technology behemoth with solid exposure to AI. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in he last 30 days. Each of our picks carries either a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance.\n\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is gaining from the strong growth of AI, high-performance computing and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. The datacenter end-market business is likely to benefit from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with Mercedes-Benz and Audi is likely to advance NVDA’s presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. We expect NVDA’s revenues to witness a CAGR of 53.7% through fiscal 2024-2026.\n\nZacks Rank #2 NVIDIA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 54.7% and 64.4%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.9% over the last seven days.\n\nMicrosoft Corp. MSFT has gained from strong Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes revenues. Productivity and Business Processes revenues of MSFT rose due to a strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions.\n\nMicrosoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 78.4 million. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses, frontline worker offerings and a gain in revenue per user drove the top line. Intelligent Cloud revenues of MSFT were driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services. Solid adoption of Azure AI, which now has a clientele of more than 53,000 customers holds promise.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Microsoft has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.9% and 18.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending June 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has enhanced its chip packages with AI, machine learning and deep learning. Using AI and analytics, MU has produced hardware with increased storage capacity, faster memory, and high-quality data filtering.\n\nThe expectation of supply normalization by mid-year 2024 is likely to drive pricing, while the boom in AI spending is expected to fuel demand for MU’s chips used in the data center end market. Additionally, 5G adoption in the IoT devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for MU’s memory and storage.\n\nZacks Rank #2 Micron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 42.8% and 90.3%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 2.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "5 Must-Buy S&amp;P 500 Stocks as Index Crosses Key Milestone",
        "content": "On Feb 9, the S&P 500 Index — popularly known as the Wall Street benchmark — achieved a key milestone. The index closed at 5,026.61, marking its first close above the crucial technical barrier of 5,000. The index touched the 5,000 level, for the first time in its history, the previous day, but stayed there for a brief period.\n\nThe S&P 500 Index ended 2023 on a strong note, rallying 23.9%, after a highly disappointing 2022. The momentum continues in early 2024 as the benchmark is up 6% year to date. Last week, the index advanced 1.4%, posting the fifth straight winning week and the 14th positive week in 15.\n\nRobust Economic Data\n\nFundamentals of the U.S. economy remain robust. The Department of Commerce reported that the economy grew at a rate of 3.3% in fourth-quarter 2023, well above the consensus estimate of 2%. U.S. GDP rose 2.5% in 2023 compared with 1.9% in 2022. At the beginning of 2023, the consensus estimate for full-year GDP was 2%.\n\nSolid nonfarm payrolls in January, solid consumer spending in December, and an improving manufacturing index in January eliminated market participants’ concerns about a near-term recession. Both consumer confidence and consumer sentiment indexes jumped in January.\n\nIn December, core PCE inflation — the Fed’s favorite inflation gauge — increased 0.2% month over month and 2.9% annually. The annual rate of increase in December was the slowest since March 2021.\n\nStrong Q4 2023 Earnings Data\n\nAs of Feb 9, 338 companies on the S&P 500 Index have reported their financial numbers. Total earnings for these 338 index members are up 5.5% from the same period last year on 3.7% higher revenues, with 80.5% beating EPS estimates and 65% beating revenue estimates.\n\nAt present, total earnings of the S&P 500 Index in fourth-quarter 2023 are expected to be up 4.9% on 3.1% higher revenues. This would follow 3.8% earnings growth on 2% higher revenues in the third quarter and three back-to-back quarters of declining earnings before that.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh Expectations for Rate Cut\n\nIn the January FOMC meeting, the Fed gave enough indications that the much-hyped cut in the benchmark lending rate in March is out of sight. Notably, the central bank paused rate hikes in Jalu 2023 and kept it steady in the range of 5.25-5.5%.\n\nDespite the Fed’s tepid rate cut signal, market participants are hopeful about interest rate cut to a good extent this year. At present, the CME FedWatch tool shows a 60.7% probability of a 25 basis-point rate cut in May and four more rate cuts of the same magnitude during the rest of 2024.\n\nOur Top Picks\n\nWe have narrowed our search to five U.S. corporate behemoths (market capital > $50 billion) in the S&P stable. These stocks have strong growth potential for 2024 and have seen positive earnings estimate revisions in the last 30 days. Finally, each of our picks sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of our five picks in the past three months. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. The strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive. Additionally, a strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance.\n\nAn expanding AWS services portfolio is continuously helping AMZN gain further momentum among customers. Robust Alexa skills and an expanding smart home products portfolio are positives. AMZN’s strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses remain tailwinds.\n\nAmazon has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11.4% and 39%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.2% over the last seven days.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. META is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver. META is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook.\n\nMETA’s innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3 is likely to drive growth. Reels continued to impress across both Instagram and Facebook backed by growing adoption. People reshared Reels 3.5 billion times every day during the fourth-quarter.\n\nMeta Platforms has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 17.4% and 31.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last seven days.\n\nNetflix Inc. NFLX added 13.12 million paid subscribers globally in fourth-quarter 2023, with a rise of 1% in average revenue per subscription. NFLX attributed the robust top-line growth to its paid subscription-sharing offering (part of its password-sharing crackdown), recent price changes and the strength of its business in general.\n\nNFLX is expected to continue dominating the streaming space, courtesy of its diversified content portfolio, which is attributable to heavy investments in the production and distribution of localized and foreign-language content.\n\nNetflix has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.3% and 40.7%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 5.9% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe Progressive Corp. PGR continues to gain on higher premiums, given its compelling product portfolio, leadership position and strength in both Vehicle and Property businesses. Focus on becoming a one-stop insurance destination, and catering to customers opting for a combination of home and auto insurance augurs well for PGR.\n\nPolicies in force and retention ratio should remain healthy for PGR. Competitive pricing to retain current customers and address customer needs with new offerings should continue to drive policy life expectancy.\n\nThe Progressive has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 14.7% and 40.6%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 3.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nHCA Healthcare Inc.’s HCA revenues increase on the back of a surge in admissions and outpatient surgeries. HCA expects equivalent admissions to grow in the range of 3-4% in 2024. Significant growth in its Managed Medicare operations is expected to drive its performance.\n\nMultiple buyouts aided in increasing patient volumes, enabled network expansion and added hospitals to the portfolio. EPS is predicted within $19.7-$21.2 in 2024, higher than the 2023 figure. The company has been gaining from its telemedicine business line.\n\nHCA resorts to prudent capital deployment via share buybacks and dividend payments. HCA increased its quarterly dividend by 10% to $0.66 in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nHCA Healthcare has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 6% and 6.8%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 4% over the last 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta's New Strategy Resembles Apple",
        "content": "After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\n\nA closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.\n\nMargin expansion is a major bright spot\n\nFrom a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic investments to drive growth\n\nMeta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.\n\nMeta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.\n\nThe company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.\n\nFirst, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.\n\nSecond, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.\n\nThird, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.\n\nOverall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.\n\nMeta has taken a leaf out of Apple's playbook\n\nJust over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.\n\nApple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.\n\nMeta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.\n\nInvestors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.\n\nTakeaway\n\nMeta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "What trends should we look for it we want to identify stocks that can multiply in value over the long term? One common approach is to try and find a company with returns on capital employed (ROCE) that are increasing, in conjunction with a growing amount of capital employed. Put simply, these types of businesses are compounding machines, meaning they are continually reinvesting their earnings at ever-higher rates of return. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), we liked what we saw.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. To calculate this metric for Meta Platforms, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.25 = US$49b ÷ (US$230b - US$32b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nSo, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 25%.  In absolute terms that's a great return and it's even better than the Interactive Media and Services industry average of 9.0%.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you're interested, you can view the analysts predictions in our freereport on analyst forecasts for the company.\n\nThe Trend Of ROCE\n\nIt's hard not to be impressed by Meta Platforms' returns on capital. The company has consistently earned 25% for the last five years, and the capital employed within the business has risen 119% in that time. Now considering ROCE is an attractive 25%, this combination is actually pretty appealing because it means the business can consistently put money to work and generate these high returns. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn summary, we're delighted to see that Meta Platforms has been compounding returns by reinvesting at consistently high rates of return, as these are common traits of a multi-bagger. And long term investors would be thrilled with the 188% return they've received over the last five years. So while investors seem to be recognizing these promising trends, we still believe the stock deserves further research.\n\nOne more thing, we've spotted  1 warning sign  facing Meta Platforms that you might find interesting.\n\nIf you want to search for more stocks that have been earning high returns, check out this freelist of stocks with solid balance sheets that are also earning high returns on equity.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Supercharged Tech Stocks to Buy Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "Many tech stocks soared over the past year as the bullish enthusiasm for artificial intelligence (AI) hardware, software, and chips broadly offset the bearish concerns about high interest rates, geopolitical conflicts, and other macro headwinds.\n\nBut with the Nasdaq Composite now hovering near an all-time high, some investors might be reluctant to add more tech stocks to their portfolios. However, I believe it's still safe to buy more shares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), ASML(NASDAQ: ASML), and Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) as the bears fret over a potential downturn. Here's why I would buy these three supercharged tech stocks without hesitation. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms, the world's largest social media company, lost its luster in 2022 as Apple's privacy changes for iOS, fierce competition from ByteDance's TikTok, and macro headwinds curbed the growth of its core advertising business. At the same time, it ramped up its spending on its unprofitable Reality Labs business. During that challenging year, its revenue and earnings per share declined 1% and 38%, respectively.\n\nBut in 2023, Meta's revenue rose 16% as its earnings jumped 73%. Its advertising business recovered as Chinese e-commerce and gaming companies ramped up their spending on Facebook and Instagram, it revamped its algorithms to counter Apple's iOS changes, and it expanded Reels to keep pace with TikTok's short videos. That recovery indicated Meta could continue subsidizing Reality Labs' costly expansion with its higher-margin advertising revenue.\n\nTo top it all off, Meta ended the year with enough cash to initiate its first-ever dividend and boost its existing buyback plan by $50 billion. Analysts expect Meta's revenue and earnings to grow 19% and 31%, respectively, in 2024. Those are impressive growth rates for a stock that trades at just 24 times forward earnings -- so investors shouldn't hesitate to buy Meta right now, even as it trades slightly below its all-time highs.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. ASML\n\nASML is the world's largest producer of lithography systems, which are used to optically etch circuit patterns onto silicon wafers. It's also the only producer of extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography systems for manufacturing the world's smallest and densest chips.\n\nASML's dominance of that crucial chipmaking technology makes it a linchpin of the global semiconductor market. Its revenue rose 30% in 2023 as the world's top foundries installed more EUV systems, but it expects its revenue to stay nearly flat in 2024 as tighter export restrictions throttle its sales to Chinese chipmakers. Analysts expect its revenue to stay flat and for its earnings to decline by 4%.\n\nBut looking ahead, ASML expects to generate \"significant growth\" in 2025 as PC sales stabilize, the smartphone market warms up, and it ramps up shipments of its next-gen \"high-NA\" EUV systems for the production of even smaller chips. For 2025, analysts expect its revenue and earnings to grow 24% and 45%, respectively.\n\nASML's stock might seem a bit pricey at 43 times forward earnings, but its dominance of the lithography market justifies that higher valuation. Investors who are bullish on the semiconductor market should still buy this stock hand over fist.\n\n3. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom sells a wide range of wireless, optical, data storage, networking, mobile, and industrial chips. It also expanded into the infrastructure software market over the past six years by acquiring CA Technologies, Symantec's enterprise security division, and the cloud software giant VMware.\n\nBroadcom still generated a fifth of its revenue from Apple over the last two fiscal years. However, its acquisition of VMware last November -- which boosts its software business to about half of its top line -- should significantly reduce its dependence on the iPhone maker. It should also reduce its overall exposure to the cyclical semiconductor sector and make it a more diversified tech giant.\n\nAnalysts expect Broadcom's revenue and adjusted earnings to grow 40% and 10%, respectively, in fiscal 2024 (which ends in October) as it integrates VMware. In fiscal 2025, they expect its revenue and adjusted earnings to rise 11% and 20%, respectively, as it laps that acquisition and its integration expenses. Those are robust growth rates for a stock that trades at 27 times forward earnings and pays a forward yield of 1.7%. Investors looking for a stable tech play that offers balanced exposure to the semiconductor, infrastructure software, and cloud markets shouldn't hesitate to buy Broadcom stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "12 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 12 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to the 5 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship.\n\nGlobalization of the world has blurred boundaries that once separated societies, countries and people, fostering a palpable acceptance of one another. Moreover, living in this rapidly evolving time, uncertainty surrounding life has increased manifold. Geopolitical strife is a harsh reality, disrupting people all around the globe. In addition, economic upheavals witnessed, for instance, in the form of 2008 financial crisis as well as the recent Covid-19 pandemic, bears evidence to the damage that unpredictability can cause. To cope with these new challenges, people around the world have recognized the significance of hedging themselves through various means, including attaining second citizenship. In 2021, 2.1% of people (1.26 million) across England and Wales were found to have multiple citizenship. Overall in Europe, there was a 14% increase in the number of citizens residing in the EU for the year 2021. The United States has also been welcoming immigrants and, over the last decade alone, saw approximately 7.7 million citizens have been naturalized into the country.\n\nAs of 2020 data, about 76% of countries allow dual citizenship. While the acceptance for this phenomenon has worldwide implications, some countries were seen to accept it faster (Americas and Oceania) than others (Asia and Africa). 91% companies in America and 93% in Oceania have accepted dual citizenship. They are followed by Europe (80%), Africa (70%), and Asia (65%). Now, the focus is not only on obtaining a second passport but also on finding the fastest and easiest countries to get citizenship.\n\nSecond Citizenship Vs Dual Citizenship\n\nAs the rejection of “one citizenship one passport” paradigm took root, the recognition of dual citizenship spurred, initiating policy reforms in various countries. However, it is important to note a difference between dual citizenship and second citizenship. With dual citizenship, an individual can hold passports from two countries and both nations officially acknowledge the rights and obligations of that individual. On the other hand, with second citizenship, an individual can possess multiple passports but each country recognizes the person solely as its citizen. For a complete analysis of dual citizenship, consult our article on Dual Citizenship Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements.\n\nStory continues\n\nInterpreting Fastest and Easiest Countries for Second Citizenship\n\nEach of us, with our distinct needs and perceptions, approaches the selection of countries for second citizenship based on our individual criteria. While tailoring our choices to personal preferences is a sound strategy, caution is paramount when making such significant decisions. It is crucial, for instance, to discern between dual citizenship and second citizenship. Although tolerance for dual citizenship has become more common, some countries still reject this privilege, and pursuing it may lead to the cancellation of one's original citizenship.\n\nIn general, there are several ways to acquire citizenship, including options such as citizenship by birth, descent, naturalization, marriage, and citizenship through investment. Depending on individual circumstances and preferences, one form of citizenship might prove to be the fastest and easiest route for obtaining a second citizenship. However, not all countries allow citizenship through all these options, and some options may not be feasible for certain individuals. For example, while citizenship through investment programs has been associated with quick acquisition, they often require a substantial initial investment, which may not be viable for the majority of people. Therefore, it is crucial to carefully examine such programs, considering the type and amount of investment involved, before opting for this fast-track approach. In conclusion, when deciding on the fastest or easiest countries for citizenship, making an informed and individual centric decision is necessary.\n\nPrevalence of Second Citizenship\n\nOne of the prominent figures associated with second citizenship through naturalization is Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR), as well as the first outside investor in Facebook—Meta (NASDAQ: META). Thiel’s life journey serves as an inspiration for many. Born to German parents, Thiel arrived in US at the age of one, and through hard work became a highly successful entrepreneur. Beginning with PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), Thiel went on to establish Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR) and later joined Meta (NASDAQ: META) through an angel investment. Although, he is no longer associated with Meta (NASDAQ: META), and PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL), he continues to hold the position of Chairman for Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE: PLTR). Since 2011, Theil has also been a citizen of New Zealand. 12 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship\n\n12 Fastest and Easiest Countries to Get Second Citizenship\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the 12 Fastest and easiest countries to get second citizenship, we have utilized data from the CIA’s World Fact Book to identify countries that allow dual citizenship. We also refer to this book to extract information on the easiest countries based on the availability of citizenship through multiple avenues, which includes citizenship by birth, descent, and naturalization. Countries allowing citizenship through these three criteria are been considered the easiest and included in our preliminary list. To further refine our selection for fastest countries, we examine the number of years of residency required for naturalization-- a process in accessible range of most people. The countries with the shortest residency requirements are included in the final list. In cases where the residency requirements are the same, we use the Passport Index 2024 ranking as a tiebreaker.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

In process is the legislation that would allow Liberians accelerated citizenship. Recognizing the concept of dual citizenship, Barbados also offers citizenship by birth and descent. The naturalization process takes only five years, a significantly shorter time-frame compared to many other countries worldwide. Consequently, Barbados is considered one of the fastest and easiest countries to obtain second citizenship.\n\n7.

Since the green flag waved in January 2020, the three major stock indexes -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite -- have teetered back and forth between bear and bull markets in successive years. It's a solid reminder of just how unpredictable the stock market can be over short time frames.\n\nWhen volatility picks up is precisely when investors usually seek out the safety of time-tested, industry-leading outperformers. In other words, it's precisely why the FAANG stocks have crushed the broader market over the trailing decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe FAANG stocks bring well-defined competitive advantages to the table\n\nWhen I say \"FAANG stocks,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nWhat these five companies offer investors is seemingly insurmountable competitive advantages.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent behind the world's top social media assets. Collectively, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are four of the most downloaded apps globally and were responsible for luring nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter. Apple has been a dominant domestic player in the smartphone arena since introducing the iPhone. It's also in the process of transforming itself into a services-focused company. The icing on the cake is that Apple's share repurchase program is unrivaled -- over $600 billion worth of buybacks since initiating a repurchase program in 2013. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brought in nearly $0.40 of every $1 in U.S. online retail sales in 2022, according to an estimate from Insider Intelligence. Further, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, with an estimated 31% share, per tech-analysis firm Canalys. Netflix is the domestic and international streaming share leader. Additionally, no streaming service has come remotely close to its expansive library of original content. Alphabet's Google was responsible for 91.5% of global internet search share in January. It's also the parent of streaming service YouTube, the second-most-visited social site behind Facebook; and Google Cloud, the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider worldwide by market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlook for each FAANG stock differs greatly. In February, one historically inexpensive FAANG stock stands head and shoulders above its peers as a phenomenal buy, while another highflier is set to face a mountain of potential headwinds.\n\nThe FAANG stock to buy hand over fist in February: Alphabet\n\nOut of the five longtime outperformers listed above, it's Google, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo parent Alphabet that stands out as the smartest buy in the shortest month of the year.\n\nTo be fair, even the best stocks that look like no-brainer buys face potential headwinds. For Alphabet, the biggest concern is the likelihood that the U.S. will fall into a recession at some point this year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's leading recession probability indicator, along with an assortment of money-based metrics, suggest that a downturn is likely. Since Alphabet generates a majority of its revenue from advertising, the expectation would be for a slowdown in its growth and profits if a recession materializes.\n\nHowever, there are two sides to this coin -- and it most definitely favors investors who are patient. Even though recessions are a normal, inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 downturns that have occurred since the end of World War II lasted 12 months. By comparison, almost every economic expansion since September 1945 has endured for multiple years. Ad-driven businesses with sustainable competitive advantages are perfectly positioned to thrive over long periods.\n\nGoogle's absolutely dominant position as the world's leading search engine isn't going to change anytime soon. It's been almost nine years since Google last held less than a 90% monthly share of worldwide search, based on data from GlobalStats. This suggests it'll have little issue maintaining exceptional pricing power and increasing its operating cash flow over time.\n\nBut most investors (including myself) are more excited about what Alphabet's ancillary operating segments have to offer. For instance, daily views of YouTube Shorts (short-form videos typically lasting less than a minute) have grown by more than a factor of eight since 2021. This should help YouTube's ad-pricing power and encourage users to sign up for high-margin subscriptions.\n\nPerhaps even more exciting is Alphabet's rapidly growing cloud segment. Following years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating profit in 2023. Not only is enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, but the margins associated with cloud services are usually considerably higher than those associated with advertising. As Google Cloud grows into a larger share of net sales, expect Alphabet's operating cash flow to expand even faster.\n\nLastly, Alphabet is cheap. Its forward-year earnings multiple of 19 is lower than the benchmark S&P 500, while its multiple of 13.4x consensus cash flow in 2025 is roughly 26% below its average cash-flow multiple over the trailing five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe FAANG stock worth avoiding in February: Netflix\n\nAlthough the FAANG stocks have been virtually unstoppable for more than a decade, not all five components are worth buying. In February, the highflier worth avoiding is none other than streaming service Netflix.\n\nJust as Alphabet has headwinds as a stock to buy, Netflix has possible catalysts as a stock I'd suggest avoiding. The single biggest driver for Netflix is that its vast content library affords it substantial subscription pricing power. Historically, Netflix has lost very few customers when it's raised its monthly subscription prices. It also doesn't hurt that the company is offering more streaming options than ever, including the addition of an ad-supported tier.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix's cash flow needle is moving in the right direction. Netflix generated $6.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) last year, more than quadrupling the $1.6 billion in FCF from 2022. Significant growth in cash flow has allowed Netflix to aggressively repurchase its stock -- 5.5 million shares bought back during the fourth quarter for roughly $2.5 billion. A reduced outstanding share count for steadily profitable companies can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS).\n\nUnfortunately, it's not all good news for Netflix.\n\nThe obvious issue is that competition for streaming services has been heating up. Walt Disney, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros. Discovery have all quickly grown their respective subscriber bases. These are brand-name media companies that have traditionally had profitable legacy TV segments. In other words, they have plenty of capital to endure temporary losses as they build out their streaming segments.\n\nHowever, streaming losses for Netflix's competitors may not continue much longer. Disney anticipates its streaming segment will turn the corner to recurring profitability by the end of its current fiscal year (i.e., by the end of September 2024). Meanwhile, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery should see notably smaller losses from streaming in the new year as advertising revenue perks up, cost-cutting takes shape, and subscription prices increase.\n\nAnother reason to cast doubt on Netflix is the company's decision to approve a sizable $10 billion share repurchase program in October. Though buybacks are shareholder-friendly, large repurchase programs are typically reserved for mature businesses or those running out of innovative ideas. An acceleration of buybacks could signal that Netflix is struggling to find new and innovative ways to move the needle, which would be particularly worrisome given its valuation.\n\nLastly, there's the company's premium valuation. Shares of Netflix are currently priced at approximately 27x forward-year earnings and 26x forward-year cash flow. It's the priciest FAANG stock relative to cash flow, which makes it an easy stock to avoid for the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Shares of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have crushed the broader market handsomely in the past year with impressive gains of 154%, driven by robust growth in its top and bottom lines. It looks like its eye-popping rally is here to stay following its latest earnings report.\n\nMeta Platforms released its fourth-quarter and full-year 2023 results on Feb. 1. Shares of the company jumped 20% the following day thanks to its better-than-expected numbers and guidance. The good part is that Meta stock remains affordable, and investors who haven't bought this tech giant yet should consider buying it hand over fist right now.\n\nMeta Platforms is becoming a bigger player in the digital ad market\n\nMeta Platforms reported Q4 revenue of $40.1 billion, an increase of 25% over the year-ago period. Additionally, the company reduced its costs and expenses by 8% during the quarter, which allowed it to triple its adjusted earnings on a year-over-year basis to $5.33 per share. The numbers were better than consensus expectations of $4.96 per share in earnings on revenue of $39.2 billion.\n\nIt is worth noting that Meta's Q4 revenue grew at the fastest pace since the middle of 2021 and outpaced the company's full-year revenue increase of 16%. The tech giant's full-year earnings were up 73% to $14.87 per share on account of its focus on controlling costs and improving the efficiency of its business operations in 2023.\n\nMeta benefited from an improvement in digital ad spending last year. According to eMarketer, digital ad spending increased 10.7% in 2023 to $627 billion. So, Meta grew at a faster pace than the market in which it operates. Moreover, its 2023 revenue indicates that it controlled 21.5% of the digital ad space last year. That's an improvement over the 20.5% share in 2022.\n\nEven better, Meta's revenue forecast for the first quarter of 2024 indicates that it could continue to corner a bigger share of the digital ad market. The company is anticipating almost $36 billion in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range. That would be a 25% increase over the prior-year period's figure of $28.6 billion. Meanwhile, overall digital ad spending is estimated to jump 13.2% in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) could be a key reason why Meta is gaining ground in the digital ad space. The company pointed out on its latest conference call with analysts that it continues to \"leverage AI across our ads systems and product suite\" in a bid to improve monetization efficiency. Meta's offerings such as Advantage+, which allows advertisers to create automated ad campaigns with the help of AI and optimize those campaigns to drive greater returns on ad dollars spent, are gaining solid traction among its customers.\n\nThe company also released new generative AI features in the previous quarter for advertisers, with which they can generate multiple background images that complement product images and create alternative versions of advertising text so that they can choose the one that will help them improve reach. Meta management says that the \"initial adoption of these features has been strong and tests are showing promising early performance gains.\"\n\nThe adoption of AI in the digital marketing space is forecast to increase at an annual rate of almost 27% through 2030. AI in digital marketing is expected to generate annual revenue of $79 billion in 2030 compared to just $1.8 billion in 2022. So, Meta is pulling the right strings to ensure that it can keep winning a bigger share of the digital ad market by giving advertisers more AI-focused tools.\n\nStronger growth could lead to more upside\n\nIt is not surprising to see analysts expecting Meta's growth to remain solid in the coming years. META Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above shows, Meta has received a nice bump in analyst revenue estimates for 2024, 2025, and 2026. What's more, analysts are expecting Meta's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 32% for the next five years. That would be a big jump over the 8.5% CAGR the company has clocked in the last five years.\n\nAssuming Meta does clock 32% annual earnings growth over the next five years, its bottom line could increase to almost $60 per share in 2028. Multiplying that 2028 figure by the company's five-year average forward earnings multiple of 22 points toward a stock price of $1,320. That suggests 180% gains from current levels.\n\nGiven that Meta is trading at 25 times forward earnings right now, investors seem to be getting a good deal on the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nConventional thinking suggests that artificial intelligence is driving major disruption at large publicly traded companies.\n\nAnd you wouldn't be wrong in buying into that prevailing thought.\n\nWhy else does Nvidia's (NVDA) stock price refuse to go lower for any long stretch? The company's leading-edge generative AI chips are extremely in demand by deep-pocketed companies doing the global disruption.\n\nWhy are layoffs sweeping through Big Tech companies such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN)? Executives are resetting their cost structures to reinvest in AI, which they believe is needed to annihilate their less-nimble foes.\n\nBut there is way more disruption going on in corporate America than AI running amok and changing the standard ways of executing.\n\nIf you stick with the disruptors, you stand to build wealth over time. Conversely, if you fail to spot the disrupted, it's probably going to end badly for your portfolio, full stop.\n\nI would like you all to build wealth, not see it go up in smoke, so here are a few examples to use as a template when assessing your own portfolio for disruptors and those being disrupted:\n\nBig media\n\nMighty Disney (DIS) just reinforced the blurring lines in media consumption and why it's probably going to be a winner over time.\n\nLast Wednesday, in a stroke of genius, the company joined forces with Epic Games for a new digital ecosystem. Digital ecosystems are only likely to grow in importance in the years to come, and Disney realizes this. Why do you think Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) are all in on virtual and augmented reality? Disney's classic IP Mickey Mouse is seen at an outdoor square in Shanghai, China, on April 28, 2023. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nWith this announcement, Disney likely has the folks at Electronic Arts (EA) shaking in their Madden cleats. Comcast (CMCSA) execs are probably wondering why they didn't pull the trigger on buying EA last year, as was speculated.\n\nStory continues\n\nCouple that with Disney's new streaming sports tie-up with Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and the company has laid the foundation for a decade of disrupting rivals in media.\n\nFor instance, what does this new streaming deal mean for Paramount (PARA), which has a lucrative NFL deal through 2032? You can learn more about this disruption in my Yahoo Finance Live interview with Paramount CEO Bob Bakish.\n\nBottom line: AI is not a huge factor in this big media disruption; it's just good old-fashioned structural industry changes.\n\nLegacy tech\n\nPayPal’s (PYPL) earnings this week reaffirmed the view among many on the Street that it’s a legacy tech company being seriously disrupted, and new CEO Alex Chriss has a tall order in front of him to get investors excited again.\n\nAs Evercore ISI analyst David Togut wrote: \"PayPal continues to confront the twin challenges of market share and customers loss in its branded PayPal wallet business and negative mix shift toward its high-growth, low-take-rate payments platform, Braintree.\"\n\nWho is PayPal being disrupted by? It may be Stripe, Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Yet, why are people blah on using PayPal and maybe even Venmo, and what does this all mean for PayPal investors who have endured a 28% stock price decline in the past year?\n\nBeats me, but it's all disruption that may get worse before it gets better for the storied payments giant.\n\nBottom line: PayPal's biggest issue also isn't an AI one.\n\nNew tech\n\nWhat an absolutely awful quarter and conference call for Snap (SNAP) and CEO Evan Spiegel this week.\n\nThe stock deserved to be hammered by 34% on Wednesday, as it's another earnings period in which Snap's executive team seems to be out to lunch on the mood among its investors.\n\nBut this disaster says a lot about the flywheel of power for Meta, TikTok, and even Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. These three platforms are growing stronger every single day, while Snap appears to be heading down a path of irrelevancy amid intense disruption.\n\nFor instance, Meta is so back in its groove that it's handing out a dividend for the first time, whereas Snap is handing out pink slips again to 10% of its workforce.\n\nOne year from now, Snap's story is probably not going to be pretty as its rivals get more entrenched in their winning ways. Blame disruption.\n\nBottom line: There's a little bit of AI disruption in this case, but it's not the overwhelming factor. morning brief image\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "If You Invested $1,000 in Microsoft When It First Declared a Dividend, This Is How Much You'd Have Now",
        "content": "When a company starts paying a dividend to its shareholders, it is often seen as a signal of confidence that the company is at a stage where it can produce stable and growing earnings and cash flow. But when a tech growth company like Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) starts paying a dividend, it's often seen as a sign that the high-growth days are over. That's a signal for some that it's time to invest elsewhere.\n\nIn reality, a dividend is mostly just a signal that management may not see as many investment opportunities, so instead of wasting the money or letting it sit in its coffers, they return funds to shareholders. That should be a signal for investors to get into the stock.\n\nWhen talking about tech companies, particularly software companies, this is the point where their high operating leverage generates more and more revenue every year without a significant increase in operating expenses. So when a tech company starts paying a dividend, it's more often a signal that it's reached \"escape velocity\" so to speak, and that leverage will start producing a lot more free cash flow and earnings well into the future.\n\nThat's been quite evident in the returns Microsoft has produced since it first declared a dividend in 2003. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe past 21 years have been transformational\n\nMicrosoft declared its first dividend for shareholders on Jan. 16, 2003, alongside its second-quarter earnings report for that year. The dividend, paid annually, was $0.16 per share, or just $0.08 per share after the stock split in February of that year.\n\nA lot has changed at Microsoft since then.\n\nIn 2003, Microsoft was generating the bulk of its revenue from sales of the Windows operating system and Office suite. The two combined to account for about 60% of sales in the first six months of fiscal 2003. Its server platform business was focused on providing software tailored toward different enterprise applications. It also had a burgeoning home and entertainment segment bolstered by Xbox.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal revenue in the first six months of fiscal 2003 was $16.3 billion, which resulted in a profit of $5.3 billion and $8.9 billion in cash from operations.\n\nMicrosoft looks a lot different today.\n\nMicrosoft's biggest segment these days contains that server platform business. It also added Github, a code repository for software developers. However, the biggest driver of the segment is its Azure cloud computing platform. The product didn't even exist in 2003, but it's become the driving force behind Microsoft's business over the past decade. The segment accounted for over 40% of revenue through the first half of the year, and it's the fastest-growing reporting segment at the company.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has seen shifts in its Office business, which is now largely a software-as-a-service subscription business. Windows is lumped in with its devices and gaming segment, which recently added Activision Blizzard to the mix.\n\nIn the first six months of fiscal 2024 (July to December 2023), Microsoft generated almost $119 billion, resulting in $44 billion in net income and $49 billion in cash from operations. That's a sevenfold increase in sales and an eight-fold increase in net income since 2003.\n\nHere's how much you'd have if you invested $1,000 in Microsoft\n\nIf you bought shares of Microsoft the day after it announced its dividend (since it was announced after the bell), the most you'd pay would be $53 per share. Let's say you bought 19 shares for $1,000. After the stock split in February 2003, you'd have 38 shares.\n\nThose 38 shares are now worth about $15,700.\n\nBut that's just the half of it. Microsoft also paid you a dividend every year.\n\nTotal dividends received from those 38 shares would amount to $1,067 in that time. That's right, you'd have received more in dividends than your original investment. But if you'd chosen to reinvest those dividends instead, you'd have seen your total investment climb to about $24,800. That's over $8,000 more than if you took your dividends in cash.\n\nMicrosoft's total return over the last 21 years blew away the S&P 500. $1,000 invested an S&P 500 index fund would've turned into a respectable $8,300, but that's just one-third of what you'd have today by investing in Microsoft. MSFT Total Return Level Chart\n\nWhat's next for Microsoft and big tech?\n\nMicrosoft continues to show strong momentum, producing tons of profit and cash flow for shareholders. It's consistently raised its dividend most years, now paying $3 per share annually.\n\nThe outlook remains strong, as its investment in OpenAI put it in a leading position in drawing AI developers to its Azure platform. It's one reason shares remain attractive even as they trade around their all-time high.\n\nBut there's a broader lesson for investors in Microsoft's story. Investing in a tech company when it declares a dividend can be a great idea as the company begins leveraging fixed costs and growing earnings. What's more, it's not an admission that it has no better way to invest cash to grow the company -- see the growth of Azure, the transformation of Office, and the acquisitions of LinkedIn, GitHub, and Activision Blizzard.\n\nThat should point investors to take a closer look at Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), which just initiated a dividend alongside its fourth-quarter earnings release.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "3 Sorry Social Media Stocks to Sell in February While You Still Can",
        "content": "The Senate Judiciary Committee’s recent hearing has intensified the scrutiny on social media giants, including Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and TikTok, painting a grim reality of the platforms’ impacts on youth. As the legislative hammer looms with potential regulations, the sentiment to dispose of social media stocks to sell grows.\n\nWith heart-wrenching accounts from parents whose children fell prey to exploitation, the insufficiencies of social media businesses in safeguarding their users were laid bare. Senators grilled CEOs over their prioritization of bottom-line expansion over user safety, yet apologies and promises seemed hollow against a backdrop of repeated failures. Hence, investors must reconsider their stakes in an industry under fire for its ethical lapses by effectively separating the wheat from the chaff.\n\nWeibo (WB)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWeibo (NASDAQ:WB), the Chinese microblogging titan, has been stumbling of late. Despite the effective handling of operational costs, which led to a slight earnings beat in its third quarter, the company’s revenue barely budged. The significant slowdown in sales at 13% year-over-year is a sign of China’s broader economic woes and perhaps a reflection of Weibo’s challenges amidst a competitive social media landscape. Moreover, its forward revenue growth estimates stand at a dismal 13%, along with a negative 7% EBITDA growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, despite the company’s stock price taking a hit, its valuation hardly tempts the value-seeking investor, with the current sentiment leaning towards caution. Analysts at Tipranks assign a consensus ‘hold’ rating to WB stock, supporting the wary outlook. Holding on to Weibo’s shares, given its slightly over fair valuation and the shadow of modest growth projections, appears to be a judicious course for now.\n\nJOYY (YY) Logos for social media apps displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: mama_mia / Shutterstock.com\n\nPopular social media player JOYY (NASDAQ:YY) grapples with a lackluster fourth-quarter forecast, as its revenue projections chillingly lag behind market expectations, signaling a -6.6% year-on-year drop. This gloomy prediction overshadows its slight revenue beat and substantial earnings per share triumph in the third quarter. Investors fixated on the forewarned revenue shrinkage are wary of the financial hurdles looming on JOYY’s horizon. Its progress is patchy at best, with some regions lagging in the wake of more prosperous markets.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmid this backdrop, there is enthusiasm surrounding YY stock, partly thanks to a robust share repurchase approach that outstripped its peers. The company’s aggressive buyback, scaling up to triple last year’s budget, adds to its attractiveness. However, this silver lining is clouded by the stark reality of subdued revenue growth, hinting that any share price jump may be capped by its fundamental growth challenges.\n\nDigital World (DWAC) An image of blocks with different social media icons on them; Instagram, Snapchat, Twitter, YouTube, Facebook; SNAP, META, TWTR. Social Media Stock Picks for 2023\n\nSource: Bloomicon/Shutterstock\n\nThe hullabaloo around Digital World (NASDAQ:DWAC) epitomizes the uncertainty of a market enthralled by the spectacle of politics rather than the soundness of financial strategies. DWAC’s bet on Truth Social, despite the allure of Donald Trump’s online presence, has somewhat failed to spark the viral growth or user engagement pivotal for a social platform’s survival. With repeated merger delays and dwindling fortunes, this SPAC saga pegged to political pulses, illustrates a deep disconnect between campaign trail triumphs and solid corporate achievements.\n\nInvestor sentiment surged recently following Trump’s candidate’s win in the Iowa caucus and New Hampshire primary, yet the dissipation of the “Trump trade” buzz post-New Hampshire is a sobering reminder to investors. It is less of an investment in a tech venture and more of a wager on the topsy-turvy tides of political fortune. With the company’s fate still up in the air, DWAC’s story remains muddled with trouble. This make it one of those social media stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Has Invested 38% of His Portfolio in These 5 Dividend Stocks",
        "content": "Is David Tepper an income investor? Nope. The hedge fund manager (and Carolina Panthers owner) probably doesn't factor dividends into his thinking much, if at all, when picking stocks.\n\nHowever, that doesn't mean Tepper doesn't own plenty of dividend stocks. There are more of them in the billionaire's Appaloosa Management hedge fund than you might think. He's invested 38% of his portfolio in these five dividend stocks.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) ranks as the top holding in Tepper's Appaloosa hedge fund. As of Sept. 30, 2023, it owned 1.95 million shares -- more than 11.5% of the overall portfolio at the time.\n\nUntil recently, Meta wouldn't have made a list featuring Tepper's dividend stocks. However, the social media leader announced on Feb. 1, 2024 that it's initiating a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. This translates to a dividend yield of around 0.44%. It's not great, but it's a start.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) trails Meta as Tepper's second-largest position. Appaloosa owned 1.64 million shares of the technology giant at the end of the third quarter of 2023, enough to make up nearly 10.2% of the hedge fund's portfolio.\n\nMany big tech companies don't pay dividends. Microsoft, though, initiated a dividend program way back in 2003.\n\nIts dividend currently yields 0.74%. The company has increased its dividend payout by an impressive 168% over the last 10 years.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) isn't the third-largest position for Tepper. That honor belongs to Amazon.\n\nHowever, the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker is the billionaire's No. 4 holding, comprising 8.8% of his total portfolio. Appaloosa owned 1.02 million shares of Nvidia at the end of Q3.\n\nUnlike Amazon, Nvidia pays a dividend. Granted, it's not a huge one: The chipmaker's dividend yield is only 0.02%. Still, the company has increased its payout by 88% since initiating a dividend program in 2015. With a dividend payout ratio of barely over 2%, the company could easily boost its dividend a lot more if it chooses.\n\nStory continues\n\n4. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) is Appaloosa's ninth-largest holding, lagging behind several stocks that don't pay dividends. At the end of the third quarter of 2023, the hedge fund owned 6.25 million shares of Intel, representing nearly 4.4% of its portfolio.\n\nOrdinarily, Intel's dividend yield of close to 1.2% wouldn't be anything to get excited about. Compared to most of Tepper's top holdings, though, this yield looks fantastic.\n\nHowever, there's a yellow flag to note: Intel slashed its dividend payout by more than 65% last year as part of a larger cost-cutting effort.\n\n5. Federal Express\n\nNot every dividend stock that Tepper owns is in the tech sector. Federal Express(NYSE: FDX) ranks as his 10th largest position. As of Sept. 30, 2023, Tepper's hedge fund owned 650,000 shares of FedEx, making up 3.4% of its portfolio.\n\nFedEx's dividend yield of over 2.1% is quite respectable. So is the company's payout ratio of under 29%.\n\nArguably, the best thing about FedEx's dividend program is its track record of dividend increases. Over the last 10 years, the shipping and logistics giant has boosted its dividend payout by a whopping 740%.\n\nThe best of the bunch\n\nI wouldn't recommend buying any of these stocks solely for their dividends. However, several of them should deliver strong growth over the next decade and beyond.\n\nIf I had to pick just one as the best of the bunch, I'd go with Meta Platforms. I like Microsoft and Nvidia, too, but Meta has been underrated by Wall Street, in my view. The company's recent blowout quarterly results underscore how much potential it has.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 12 stocks to buy in 10 different sectors for the next 3 months. If you want to skip our introduction to how spreading a portfolio across several sectors might help long term performance according to financial literature, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months.\n\nThe spread of technology and the broad use of the Internet by people belonging to all walks of life has significantly increased the exposure that people have to information. This is true for politics, sports, and finance - as both those who work in these industries and others whose well being is tied to their performance are able to stay abreast with the latest developments. Social media stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and private companies like Elon Musk's well known X (formerly called Twitter) enable a connected world and a much well informed global populace.\n\nFor instance, if you're interested to learn from those who spend the better part of their day dabbling in all things finance, then you can always consult Twitter. Diverse viewpoints are important when it comes to risking money on stocks, and another common way of hedging an investment portfolio's risk is through diversification as well. In finance theory, diversification reduces the variance that a broader portfolio's returns might face. In other words, it reduces the wild downswings that might significantly reduce principal value in case of an untoward event in one industry, providing investors with peace of mind and better chances of optimal cardiovascular performance.\n\nAdditionally, the sheer plethora of information available to investors through the Internet and traditional media also allows them to rapidly tailor and trim their investments in response to news. For instance, it takes mere seconds for all major stock indexes such as the NASDAQ, the S&P 500, and the NYSE to fall when the Federal Reserve surprises investors by beefing up interest rates, or rise when macroeconomic and political stability is assured. When it comes to investing in stocks that belong to different sectors, a well-informed investor is easily able to keep up to date with the performance of sectors that are completely different from each other such as high technology biotechnology stocks and good old oil crude oil exploration and production stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven if we were to ignore complex mathematical complications of standard deviation and other variables that professionals rely on when investing in stocks in different sectors, doing so also seems to make sense on an intuitive scale. For instance, let's consider two different sectors and recent stock market events to see how this might work. After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022 and the Federal Reserve started to increase interest rates in response to record inflation levels, the bifurcation of the stock market into different sectors became clear. We've briefly mentioned one of these, i.e., oil and energy, above, and the second sector is technology. After the Russian invasion and the official settling in of the Federal Reserve's latest interest rate hiking cycle, oil stocks soared as investors correctly realized that they would benefit from a shakeup in the global oil industry.\n\nAt the same time, tight macroeconomic conditions created by high interest rates and high inflation meant that big ticket technology and high growth stocks such as Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) posted double or even triple digit percentage losses on the stock market. For the investor who was prudent enough to have invested in different sectors at the start of 2022, the juicy returns and dividends offered by oil stocks would have helped ease or even reverse the pain that technology stocks experienced in 2022.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top stocks in different sectors. The notable picks are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Top 12 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months\n\nPhoto by Sunrise King on Unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks to buy in different sectors, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 910 hedge fund portfolios and picked out stocks from Technology, Materials, Real Estate, Financial Services, Healthcare, Industrial, Communications, Consumer Cyclical, Consumer Defensive, Utilities, and Energy sectors with the highest hedge fund shareholders as of Q3 2023. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were chosen.\n\nFor these best stocks from ten different sectors, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nTop 12 Stocks To Buy In 10 Different Sectors for the Next 3 Months\n\n12. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 60\n\nSector: Real Estate\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is the real estate stock with the highest number of hedge fund investors in our database. Perhaps this is unsurprising since it caters exclusively to the needs of the technology industry. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)'s shares are rated Buy on average and the average share price target is $229.59.\n\nDuring last year's third quarter, 60 out of the 910 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had held a stake in American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT). Charles Akre's Akre Capital Management was the firm's largest hedge fund shareholder due to its $1.1 billion investment.\n\nJust like Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is another top stock in different sectors.\n\n11. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 75\n\nSector: Basic Materials\n\nTeck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK) is a mining company that produces coal, metals, and other products. Amidst a slowdown in the global economy particularly due to China's troubles, the firm has struggled on the financial front as of late since it has missed analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters.\n\nAfter digging through 910 hedge fund portfolios for their Q3 2023 shareholdings, Insider Monkey discovered that 75 had held a stake in the firm. Teck Resources Limited (NYSE:TECK)'s biggest stakeholder in our database is Eric W. Mandelblatt's Soroban Capital Partners as it owns $433 million worth of shares.\n\n10. T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79\n\nSector: Communication Services\n\nT-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS) is an American telecommunications carrier headquartered in Bellevue, Washington. 2024 can shape up to be an important year for the firm, as it is targeting for more customer growth by partnering up with SpaceX to offer satellite phone services.\n\nAs of September 2023 end, 79 out of the 910 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research had bought and owned T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS)'s shares. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the largest stake which was worth $734 million.\n\n9. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 79\n\nSector: Energy\n\nExxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is the biggest non public oil exploration and production firm in the world. February 2024 is shaping up to be an important month for the firm as not only is it exiting from Equatorial Guinea after three decades, but Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM) is also increasing its focus on commodities trading by growing its presence in London.\n\nFor their third quarter of 2023 shareholdings, 79 out of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were the firm's investors. Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM)'s biggest stakeholder among these is Jean-Marie Eveillard's First Eagle Investment Management as it owns 13.1 million shares that are worth $1.5 billion.\n\n8.

        "title": "Why Apple's iconic Super Bowl ad still resonates 4 decades later",
        "content": "Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.\n\nThat all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS — and hadn’t fled to the kitchen for snacks — may have been intrigued by something completely different.\n\nIn between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, “Big Brother,” addressed them on a massive screen.\n\nExtolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated an imminent victory, free from “pests of any contradictory true thoughts.”\n\nThen, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.\n\nWearing a white tank top and red athletic shorts — and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) — she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother’s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'”\n\nHappy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.\n\nCreated by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), “1984” elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.\n\nThough Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. “It marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,” he told Yahoo Finance recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It was,” he added, “the first time where the audience went, ‘Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'\"\n\nBut Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.\n\nIBM = Big Brother?\n\nIn the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,named after Steve Jobs’ daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.\n\n“Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,” said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.\n\nBut then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job. John Sculley, left, and Steve Jobs at the Apple Computers shareholders meeting at Flint Center in Cupertino, Calif. on Jan. 24, 1984, to introduce the company's new Macintosh personal computer. (Cap Carpenter/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlong with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons.” But the ad’s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.\n\n“He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,” Hayden explained. “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.”\n\nThe advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said.\n\nA new age\n\nThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O’Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,\" she said. Those who tuned into the big game saw arguably the greatest Super Bowl ad of all time: Washington vs. Los Angeles, Jan. 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Fla. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images) (Focus On Sport via Getty Images)\n\nThe heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM —the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.\n\n“She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,” Hayden said.\n\nAdded Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.”\n\nBut there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,” he said. “It didn't match the traditional advertising forms.”\n\nBut Jean-Louis Gassée, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recallsthe first time he saw the ad at a 1983meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. “We had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],” he told Yahoo Finance. “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.”\n\nThough Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech, “saying that the Macintosh would change the world,” according to Gassée. “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.” Insisted on a new character: director Ridley Scott. (Mario Anzuoni/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHolding up\n\nIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.\n\nAt least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and X. It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.”\n\nHe added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.” he said. “So this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.”\n\nEnjoy the Super Bowl.\n\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.",

        "title": "12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.\n\nThe market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.\n\nThe trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.\n\nTo benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024\n\nPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on Unsplash\n\nBest NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024\n\n12.

(NASDAQ:MU), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter.

(NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”\n\n10. Netflix, Inc.

Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”\n\n9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi. Citi holds a Buy rating on AMD as of February 7.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc.

Apple also declared a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 15, to shareholders of record on February 12.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 163\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results. The GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.64 and the revenue stood at $86.31 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $1.04 billion, respectively.\n\nAlphabet Inc.

(NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $3 billion.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nThe FPA Crescent Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”\n\nClick to continue reading and 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nTop 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds 10 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Missed Out on Nvidia? 2 Soaring Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) is the hottest investment megatrend in recent memory, and few companies have benefited more than Nvidia, which supplies the hardware needed to train and run these applications.\n\nBut there are other ways to bet on the opportunity. Let's look at two of them and explore why Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ: SMCI) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) could also have places in your investment portfolio.\n\n1. Super Micro Computer\n\nWhile less well known than Nvidia, Super Micro Computer has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the AI opportunity. Shares have already risen 133% in 2024, capping off a gain of almost 700% over the last 12 months. And the company's stellar earnings suggest it isn't too late for investors to bet on its continued success.\n\nSuper Micro's second-quarter revenue roughly doubled year over year to $3.66 billion amid surging demand for its enterprise-level computers, used for data centers, websites, and, most importantly, hosting AI algorithms.\n\nThe company is hugely optimistic about the sustainability of this new core growth driver, with CEO Charles Liang claiming AI could have a bigger impact than the Industrial Revolution as it spreads to more industries like autonomous driving, education, and healthcare.\n\nThe future of AI tech remain to be seen. But Super Micro is a particularly good way to bet on the industry because of the company's focus on hardware, which shields it from some of the competition and risks involved in creating consumer-focused software in an increasingly crowded market.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms is a much larger company than Super Micro, but it is also capable of impressive growth, with shares already up around 30% year to date. While the social media giant has pivoted away from metaverse development to focus on AI, investors shouldn't lose sight of how the two opportunities could synergize over the long term.\n\nMeta's approach to AI development has been somewhat unconventional. The company is working on Llama, a large language model (LLM) similar to the technology behind OpenAI's ChatGPT, which will be capable of creating chatbots and other generative AI applications. However, unlike competitors, Meta has made its software open source and free for developers to use and modify to build their own programs.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta's open-source AI strategy undermines the market for rival software from Alphabet and Microsoft and could help its Llama LLM rapidly gain market share as a way to create the next generation of AI apps.\n\nTo be fair, it is still unclear how Meta plans to monetize its AI investments. However, the technology could have uses in the company's other core growth initiative: the metaverse. Generative AI is already capable of creating realistic dialogue and images. And as the technology improves, AI could be used to create practically limitless amounts of immersive content for the company's virtual reality (VR) experiences.\n\nThe industry is maturing\n\nAs time goes on, AI-related hype will probably die down, and companies that benefited from the surge of investment capital will have to demonstrate sustainable operational improvements to justify their stock gains. For Super Micro, this task looks easier because it focuses on the less risky \"picks and shovels\" side of the AI industry, supplying the tools other enterprises need to build and run their applications.\n\nMeta Platforms will likely face more risk as it develops generative AI software in an incredibly competitive field. That said, the new tech could synergize with its metaverse development, giving the company an edge.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nFrom FAANG to the Magnificent 7 and Beyond\n\nThe technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.\n\nRegardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.\n\nThe Three AI Amigos\n\nOn February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:\n\n\"Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.\"\n\nMost investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.\n\nBiden Administration's Investment in Chips\n\nIn an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead \"in the current generation of chips\" alongside the \"next generation.\" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.\n\nWith the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\nA technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\n11. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the original FAANG names. It is a streaming company that operates a popular online streaming platform by the name of Netflix. The company is based in Los Gatos, California.\n\nDZ Bank analyst Markus Leistner upgraded shares of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and placed a $600 price target on the stock on January 25.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was found in the 13F holdings of 102 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $7.8 billion.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the best FAANG stocks to buy now.\n\n10.

(NYSE:CRM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top FAANG+ stocks to invest in today.\n\n6. Apple Inc.

Their total stake value in the company was $179 billion.\n\nBireme Capital mentioned Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks 10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In is originally published by Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Snowflake (SNOW) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know",
        "content": "Snowflake (SNOW) Shares Skyrocket, What You Need To Know\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of data warehouse-as-a-service Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) jumped 5.3% in the afternoon session after the Bureau of Labor Statistics provided a revised inflation reading for December 2023, which came in lower than expected (+0.2% m/m versus the prior reading of +0.3%). This further supports the narrative that inflation is cooling, likely giving the Fed more reasons to start cutting rates in 2024.\n\nAlso, stocks continued to rally as the Nasdaq rose 1.2% and the S&P 500 gained 0.57% to end another strong week of earnings with positive results from most of the big tech stocks that reported so far this season. Notably, Meta reported strong top and bottom-line beats, hinting at a potential rebound for the advertising sector in 2024. Cloudflare also reported solid earnings with guidance for sustained growth momentum in 2024, further boosting the market's optimism toward software stocks, especially those with cloud and AI capabilities. In addition,\n\nOverall, it was also a strong week for equities, with the S&P 500 breaking past the 5,000 level for the first time as the market continued to maintain the strong momentum from the last quarter of 2023.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nIs now the time to buy Snowflake? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnowflake's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 28 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 7 days ago, when the company gained 9.4% as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 surged after solid earnings from tech giants, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), which soared more than 20% (MAU/DAU growth, guidance beat, and dividend initiation), and Amazon (solid revenue beat).\n\nIn addition, yields surged, with the 2-year Treasury yield rising to 4.38%, while the 10-year Treasury yield broke past the 4% mark as fresh labor market data exceeded expectations. The Bureau of Labour reported non-farm payrolls for January 2024, which revealed that the US economy added 353,000 jobs (versus expectations for +185,000 jobs). The strong jobs report points to a resilient economy despite worries about the lag effects of rate hikes potentially slowing down business activities. The strong market data could cause the Fed to delay cutting rates in 2024, with market participants expecting the first rate cut to be announced in the first half of the year.\n\nSnowflake is up 23.5% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snowflake's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $919.54.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best big company stocks to buy. To skip the latest news and analysts’ sentiments around the current economic conditions, go directly to the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nDespite the doubts, the market performed exceptionally in 2023. While several analysts believed it to be temporary, the new year isn’t showing many signs of weakness in the market. Although there have been a few hurdles, the overall prediction is that the Federal Reserve will manage to guide the US economy toward a soft landing rather than a recession, as was expected in the last two years. However, analysts still advise caution in the short term. Marko Kolanovic, Chief Global Markets Strategist and Global Co-Head of Research at J.P. Morgan, said:\n\n“As we approach 2024, we expect both inflation data and economic demand to soften, as the tailwinds for growth and risk markets are fading. Overall, we are cautious on the performance of risky assets and the broader macro outlook over the next 12 months, due to building monetary headwinds, geopolitical risks and expensive asset valuations.”\n\nNevertheless, the latest news suggests that the financial markets are heading in the right direction as the S&P 500 touched 5000 for the first time at the time of market opening on February 9 after December inflation data, which turned out to be even lower than initially reported. While the Fed recently revealed that it will take its time to review market data before making any decision to announce rate cuts, many analysts believe that the rate cuts can begin in the first half of 2024.\n\nDespite the positive predictions around the market, the varying opinions of experts can lead to further confusion among novice investors, which is why the best big company stocks are some of the safest bets for such people. These big company stocks bring a sense of safety among investors as the losses are never permanent, even during bear market conditions. Additionally, the best company stocks are usually cash-rich with strong balance sheets and can easily weather any economic disasters. Furthermore, their wealth also allows them to pay steady dividends. For example, one of the giants in the energy sector, Chevron Corporation (NYSE:CVX) has increased its dividends for the last 37 years, even though the last 10 years have seen some significant volatility in the energy sectors. Similarly, another blue-chip stock, PepsiCo, Inc. (NASDAQ:PEP) raised its dividend by 7% on February 9 despite year-over-year (YoY) revenue declines across major markets in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe big company stocks do not guarantee positive returns all the time but provide ample opportunities for investors when they fall. For example, earlier this month, we discussed the 10 blue-chip stocks at 52-week lows, which you should check out as these are also some of the best big company stocks that provide prime entry points for investors. However, our current list uses a different methodology, and some of our current best big company stocks include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). After an exceptional performance in 2023, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share on February 1 and increased its previous share buyback authorization by $50 billion. The company nearly gained 200% in the year and is up nearly 36% year-to-date (YTD) at the time of writing on February 9. 13 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\nA large stock market board displaying the S&P 500 and S&P 500 Growth Index.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo choose the best big company stocks, we used the FinViz stock screener to identify mega-cap stocks with an estimated 5-year EPS growth of over 15%. These stocks were then listed according to the number of their hedge fund investors in the third quarter of 2023. The hedge fund sentiment was taken from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest Big Company Stocks to Buy\n\n13. ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML)\n\nASML Holding N.V.

(NASDAQ:ASML) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another welcome change has been the recognition of generative artificial intelligence (AI) opportunities for companies outside the U.S. While our IT holdings trailed their mega cap U.S. counterparts for most of the year, semiconductor equipment makers ASML Holding N.V. (NASDAQ:ASML) and Tokyo Electron, which we consider enablers of AI, as well as enterprise software maker SAP and IT consultant Accenture, which we see as facilitators of AI adoption in new product lines and/or enhanced business models, rose strongly in the quarter. These companies are rolling out new, AI-enhanced products at higher prices which should positively impact earnings in the near term.\n\nOn an individual stock basis, the largest contributors to absolute returns in the quarter included ASML and Tokyo Electron in the IT sector.”\n\n12.

The company continues to execute well, both clinically and fundamentally, but much of the biopharmaceutical industry has been weak as investors are gravitating to other, more cyclical sectors.”\n\n11.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Stock selection was also positive in the sub-industry owing to strong gains from therapeutics-focused pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Lilly’s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas. Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises.

(NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n7. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is a multinational conglomerate headquartered in  Omaha, Nebraska. Through its subsidiaries, it offers various services like freight rail transportation, finance, and more. Most of Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B)’s revenue is generated from its insurance business.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database, hedge fund sentiment was positive toward Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in the third quarter, as 116 hedge funds had investments in the stock, up from 109 in the prior quarter.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) is our seventh best big company stock to buy.\n\n6. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nSalesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) is a California-based company that offers customer relationship management software and applications to customers worldwide. With 122 hedge fund investors, the company occupies the sixth spot on our list.\n\nOn January 23, Baird analyst Rob Oliver increased the price target on Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)’s stock to $310 from $300 and kept an Outperform rating on the shares.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) are some of the best big company stocks to buy, besides Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nPolen Capital stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Big Company Stocks to Buy.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n12 Highest-Paid Women CEOs 12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds 10 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Pinterest Gets Google's Help In An Amazon-Like Partnership As It Continues To Try To Make Monetization Happen",
        "content": "Unlike Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Pinterest Inc (NYSE: PINS) and Snap Inc (NYSE: SNAP) did not experience double digit growth of their ad business. Snap reported its fourth quarter sales grew 5% and it issued a weak guidance. On Wednesday, Snap shares tanked 35% as Meta set the bar high with its advertising revenue up 24%, more than double compared to Google and its 11% growth. Not to mention the fact that Amazon reported an impressive 27% YoY expansion of its ad business.  Pinterest shares surged 53% last year and until Thursday’s report, they rose 9.5% since the beginning of 2024. But like Snap, it got punished for the revenue miss with its stock falling about 20% after-hours before recovering. On its now long quest to monetize its platform, Pinterest enlisted the help of Google that is similar to its existing Amazon partnership in an effort to make that business equation finally happen. After announcing the integration with Google, shares rebounded to a decline of about 10%.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nAlthough revenue rose 12% to $981 million, it came below LSEG’s estimate of $991 million. Net income rose from last year’s comparable quarter when it was $17.49 million, or 3 cents a share to $201 million, or 29 cents a share. Unlike revenue, adjusted earnings of 53 cents per share topped LSEG’s consensus estimate of 51 cents.\n\nAlthough the Google integration went live a couple of weeks ago, it was not a significant contributor in the reported quarter, but it is expected to bring improvement in the current quarter and beyond, as it already helped lift third party ad demand.\n\nPinterest reported its costs decreased about 10% YoY to $785 million, but this is mainly the result of lowered sales and marketing expenses. Also, Pinterest trimmed its workforce by 5% last year as layoffs plagued the entire industry.\n\nAlthough its monthly active users rose 11% to 498 million and topped analyst estimates of 487 million, global average revenue per user of $2 came below analyst estimates of $2.05.\n\nStory continues\n\nBig Tech Spoiled The Fun Of The Ad Rebound For Smaller Players\n\nOne cannot but not notice that ad recovery is selective, with Big Tech reaping the rewards of the rebound and leaving scraps for others. Fortunately, the world’s multiyear slump is expected to soon become history. Pinterest guided for first-quarter revenue in the range between $690 million and $705 million, which equates to YoY growth of 15% to 17%, while the average analyst estimate is at the higher end that range, at about $703 million.\n\nPinterest Needs To Solve The Monetization Equation\n\nAt the end of the day, Pinterest needs to lift its revenue and get its users to buy goods they see on its platform. Its Amazon partnership looked promising and the Google integration is another step in the right direction. But, by no means will Pinterest have it easy with intense, not to say scary, competition for ad dollars.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "5 Leveraged ETFs Winning on the Tech Sector Rally",
        "content": "The technology sector is back and dominating the stock market rally once again this year. Strong corporate earnings, corporate actions and optimism over artificial intelligence (AI) are driving the sector higher (read: 5 Technology Stocks Powering S&P 500 ETF to Record Highs).\r\n\r\nWhile almost every corner of the technology sector is shining, the demand for leveraged ETFs has increased, as these could see huge gains in a short time frame compared to simple products. We have highlighted five of them that are making the most of the sector rally. These are GraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF NVDL, GraniteShares 2x Long META Daily ETF FBL, BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN FNGU, ProShares Ultra Semiconductors USD and Direxion Daily Technology Bull 3x Shares TECL. These funds will continue to be investors’ darlings, at least in the near term, provided the sentiments remain bullish.\n\nRobust Earnings\n\nPer the Earnings Trends report, total earnings of 74.7% of the sector’s market capitalization in the index are up 21.9% from the same period last year on 6.4% higher revenues, with 88.6% beating EPS estimates and 72.7% beating revenue estimates. The Q4 earnings and revenue growth rates for these tech companies are notably tracking higher than in other recent periods. While the EPS beat ratio is tracking above the 20-quarter average, the revenue beat ratio is below the 20-quarter average.\r\n\r\nInvestors should note that the tech sector is solely responsible for keeping Q4 earnings growth in the positive territory. The \"Magnificent Seven\" has been the biggest engine of growth and currently accounts for 29.3% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization.\r\n\r\nFor the \"Magnificent Seven\" companies, combining the actual results of the six companies that have come out with estimates and the one still-to-report company, total Q4 earnings are on track to be up 48.7% from the same period last year on 14.5% higher revenues. Additionally, the earnings outlook for these tech titans is improving steadily. The 30.4% earnings\r\ngrowth expected for the group in the first quarter of 2024 is up from 25.7% last week, with estimates for the subsequent quarters going up (read: Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings).\n\nStory continues\n\nRecord Cash Generation\n\nFive technology behemoths — Apple Inc. AAPL, Microsoft Corp MSFT., Alphabet Inc. AAPL, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, and Meta Platforms Inc. META —reported unprecedented cash inflows. According to Bloomberg's analysis, these giants amassed a staggering $140 billion in cash from operations in the final quarter of 2023, setting a new benchmark for the sector. This financial prowess not only highlights their market dominance but also positions them to enhance shareholder value significantly.\r\n\r\nThe companies will likely channel their surplus free cash flow back to shareholders, given their strong balance sheets and high net cash positions. Currently, Apple, Microsoft and Meta have implemented dividend plans, a testament to their commitment to returning value to their shareholders.\r\n\r\nNotably, Meta stock soared as much as 21% after its big earnings beat, buyback and dividend plans, adding roughly $200 billion to its market capitalization. This marks the the biggest single-day market value addition, eclipsing the $190 billion gains made by Apple and Amazon.com in 2022 (read: Meta Soars on Solid Q4 Earnings, First Dividend: ETFs to Buy).\n\nSolid Sector Fundamentals\n\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector. The global digital shift has accelerated e-commerce for everything, ranging from remote working to entertainment and shopping, thereby bolstering strength in the sector. The rapid adoption of cloud computing, big data, the Internet of Things, wearables, VR headsets, drones, virtual reality, machine learning, digital communication, blockchain and 5G technology will continue to fuel a rally.\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF (NVDL) – Up 81.8%\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long NVDA Daily ETF magnifies exposure to a single trade, seeking two times (200%) the daily percentage change of the common stock of Nvidia (NVDA). It has an expense ratio of 1.15% and has amassed $551.7 million in its asset base.\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long META Daily ETF (FBL) – Up 64.1%\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long META Daily ETF tracks two times the performance of the stock of Meta Platforms. It has accumulated $54 million in its asset base and charges 1.15% in annual fees.\r\n\r\nBMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN (FNGU) – Up 48.6%\r\n\r\nBMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN seeks to offer three times leveraged exposure to the NYSE FANG Index. The Index includes 10 highly liquid stocks that represent industry leaders across today’s tech and internet/media companies. BMO REX MicroSectors FANG+ Index 3X Leveraged ETN charging 95 bps in annual fees. It has accumulated $3.8 billion in its asset base.\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors (USD) – Up 47.3%\r\n\r\nProShares Ultra Semiconductors offers two times exposure to the daily performance of the Dow Jones U.S. Semiconductors Index. It has gathered $512.8 million in its asset base and charges 95 bps in fees per year from investors.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Technology Bull 3x Shares (TECL) – Up 37.8%\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Technology Bull 3x Shares targets the broad technology sector with three times exposure to the Technology Select Sector Index. It has amassed about $3.4 billion in its asset base and charges 92 bps in fees per year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs a caveat, investors should note that these products are extremely volatile and suitable only for short-term traders. Additionally, the daily rebalancing — when combined with leverage — may make these products deviate significantly from the expected long-term performance figures (see: all the Leveraged Equity ETFs here).\r\n\r\nStill, for ETF investors bullish on the tech sector for the near term, either of the above products can be an interesting choice. Clearly, a near-term long could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance and a belief that the trend is the friend in this corner of the investing world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta Platforms (META) Is Up 20.51% in One Week: What You Should Know",
        "content": "Momentum investing revolves around the idea of following a stock's recent trend in either direction. In the 'long' context, investors will be essentially be \"buying high, but hoping to sell even higher.\" With this methodology, taking advantage of trends in a stock's price is key; once a stock establishes a course, it is more than likely to continue moving that way. The goal is that once a stock heads down a fixed path, it will lead to timely and profitable trades.\n\nEven though momentum is a popular stock characteristic, it can be tough to define. Debate surrounding which are the best and worst metrics to focus on is lengthy, but the Zacks Momentum Style Score, part of the Zacks Style Scores, helps address this issue for us.\n\nBelow, we take a look at Meta Platforms (META), a company that currently holds a Momentum Style Score of A. We also talk about price change and earnings estimate revisions, two of the main aspects of the Momentum Style Score.\n\nIt's also important to note that Style Scores work as a complement to the Zacks Rank, our stock rating system that has an impressive track record of outperformance. Meta Platforms currently has a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy). Our research shows that stocks rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and #2 (Buy) and Style Scores of A or B outperform the market over the following one-month period.\n\nYou can see the current list of Zacks #1 Rank Stocks here >>>\n\nSet to Beat the Market?\n\nIn order to see if META is a promising momentum pick, let's examine some Momentum Style elements to see if this social media company holds up.\n\nLooking at a stock's short-term price activity is a great way to gauge if it has momentum, since this can reflect both the current interest in a stock and if buyers or sellers have the upper hand at the moment. It's also helpful to compare a security to its industry; this can show investors the best companies in a particular area.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor META, shares are up 20.51% over the past week while the Zacks Internet - Software industry is flat over the same time period. Shares are looking quite well from a longer time frame too, as the monthly price change of 27.14% compares favorably with the industry's 0.91% performance as well.\n\nConsidering longer term price metrics, like performance over the last three months or year, can be advantageous as well. Shares of Meta Platforms have increased 40.64% over the past quarter, and have gained 164.16% in the last year. In comparison, the S&P 500 has only moved 14.46% and 23.05%, respectively.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to META's average 20-day trading volume. Volume is a useful item in many ways, and the 20-day average establishes a good price-to-volume baseline; a rising stock with above average volume is generally a bullish sign, whereas a declining stock on above average volume is typically bearish. META is currently averaging 21,937,472 shares for the last 20 days.\n\nEarnings Outlook\n\nThe Zacks Momentum Style Score also takes into account trends in estimate revisions, in addition to price changes. Please note that estimate revision trends remain at the core of Zacks Rank as well. A nice path here can help show promise, and we have recently been seeing that with META.\n\nOver the past two months, 13 earnings estimates moved higher compared to none lower for the full year. These revisions helped boost META's consensus estimate, increasing from $17.64 to $19.62 in the past 60 days. Looking at the next fiscal year, 9 estimates have moved upwards while there have been no downward revisions in the same time period.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven these factors, it shouldn't be surprising that META is a #1 (Strong Buy) stock and boasts a Momentum Score of A. If you're looking for a fresh pick that's set to soar in the near-term, make sure to keep Meta Platforms on your short list.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "History shows stocks will still go up even if the 'Magnificent 7' lose steam",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is creeping near 5,000 for the first time ever. And once again, the stocks leading it higher are the biggest members of the benchmark average.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have produced a nearly 20% return to start the year, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. The returns from these four stocks alone account for roughly 69% of the S&P 500's gain this year.\n\nBut not all of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are off to a strong start. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.\n\nFortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the marketshould probably still go up.\n\nA recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historicallyhave been quite good.\n\nA chart from Belski shows that since 1992,on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\n\n\"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,\" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which topstocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn't a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it's been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"That's part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them,\" the analyst told Yahoo Finance. \"And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher.\"\n\nFor the S&P to hit new records without significant contributions from the Magnificent Seven, there would need to be a broadening out in the market, where other lagging sectors begin to pick up steam. This has been seen recently in areas such as large-cap Healthcare (XLV), which is up 17% from its October lows, and the Financial Select Sector ETF (XLF), which is up 24% from October lows.\n\nWith 70% of S&P 500 companies topping analysts' earnings per share forecasts in the fourth quarter, above the historical average of 63%, Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed to the increased breadth in earnings growth as a positive catalyst moving forward.\n\n\"You're seeing [an] even higher percentage [of] companies posting positive earnings this quarter than last quarter,\" Kwon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"So actually, earnings breadth is improving as well, and that's a positive cycle for equities.\"\n\nSnider thinks this broadening out is the most likely scenario this year once investors feel more confident in the Federal Reserve's interest rate-cutting path.\n\n\"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we'll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,\" Snider said.

        "title": "Meta removes Instagram and Facebook accounts for Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei",
        "content": "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) — Meta has removed Instagram and Facebook accounts run on behalf of Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei after criticism over his support for Hamas after its Oct. 7 attack on Israel that sparked the monthslong war still raging in the Gaza Strip, the company confirmed Friday.\n\nMeta, based in Menlo Park, California, offered no specifics about its reasoning. However, it said it removed the accounts “for repeatedly violating our Dangerous Organizations and Individuals policy.”\n\n“We do not allow organizations or individuals that proclaim a violent mission or are engaged in violence to have a presence on our platforms,” the policy states. That includes those designated as terrorists by the U.S. government.\n\nIran's mission to the United Nations did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nKhamenei and his vast patronage network inside Iran have long been targeted by American sanctions. Khamenei himself has been targeted by U.S. sanctions since 2019 by the administration of then-President Donald Trump as tensions began to spiral in the Middle East over Trump unilaterally withdrawing America from Tehran's nuclear deal with world powers.\n\nHowever, pressure has been growing on online platforms to remove Khamenei in recent years, particularly after the mass protests that followed the 2022 death of Mahsa Amini after her arrest allegedly over how she wore the mandated headscarf in Iran.\n\nKhamenei’s use of Facebook has drawn criticism in the past. The social network has been banned in Iran since its 2009 disputed presidential election and the Green Movement protests that followed. Iran began blocking Instagram and Meta’s WhatsApp messaging service after the protests over Amini's death.\n\nKhamenei still maintains an account on X, formerly Twitter.\n\nKhamenei and accounts associated with the supreme leader had been praising the Hamas attack on Israel that killed 1,200 people and saw some 250 others taken hostage. Immediately after the attack, Khamenei backed Hamas in a speech, saying: “We kiss the hands of those who planned the attack on the Zionist regime.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIran has provided arms and support to Hamas, though Tehran isn't believed to have directed the Oct. 7 attack. In the time since, Israel's war on Hamas in the Gaza Strip has killed over 27,000 Palestinians and sparked tensions across the wider Middle East. Iranian-backed militias like Lebanon's Hezbollah and Yemen's Houthi rebels, also armed by Iran, have launched attacks against Israel in the time since.\n\nJonathan Greenblatt of the Anti-Defamation League praised Meta's decision.\n\n“He’s used these platforms for years to incite violent antisemitism, to legitimize militant anti-zionism and to make genocidal threats,” Greenblatt wrote online.",

        "content": "Last year was an amazing year for tech stocks. Coming off a disappointing 2022, tech rallied to make up much of its losses and set the stage for further gains in 2022.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq composite was up 43% in 2023, and many of the top tech-themed exchange-traded funds did even better. If you were holding tech stocks, you likely had a very good 2022.\n\nAnd tech is off to a solid start this year, with the Nasdaq up 5% to keep pace with top tech ETFs. Investors are still bullish on tech and advances in artificial intelligence, machine learning and the Internet of Things.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech stocks have greater-than-average growth potential because of their disruptive tendencies. Tech companies are looking to break new ground, create new products or devise new ways to accomplish tasks. Many tech stocks can also be considered growth stocks because they’re aggressively looking to scale up and show gains in growth and earnings.\n\nWhile there are some amazing tech stocks to buy out there, we’re using the Portfolio Grader today to identify the best of the best and figure out which ones have the best chance of catching fire in 2024.\n\nSome of the names on this list are well-known and others fly under the radar. But all of them show massive potential as we roll into 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft (MSFT) logo on a corporate office building during the day time.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of those well-known names we talked about. In fact, it’s the biggest publicly traded company in the world, with a market capitalization of more than $3 trillion.\n\nAbout $1 billion of that came in 2023 when advances in generative AI helped push Microsoft stock up 56%. Microsoft invested $13 million into OpenAI, the maker of ChatGPT, and infused the technology into its universe of products.\n\nMicrosoft reported earnings for its fiscal second quarter of 2024 on Jan. 30. And while the results included revenue growth of 18% to $62 billion and earnings per share were up 33% to $2.93, MSFT stock has been a little stagnant ever since.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I’m still a Microsoft bull. I agree with analysts like BNP Paribas’ Stefan Slowinski who says that major free cash flow improvements related to Microsoft’s gen AI commercialization could begin in the next fiscal year.\n\nMSFT stock will have a strong 2024, although I can’t promise another 50% gain. It still gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) AI. Circuit board. Technology background. Central Computer Processors CPU concept. Motherboard digital chip.

Advances in AI are made possible only by the most powerful semiconductors.\n\nSynopsys has a key partnership with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), the semiconductor company with the biggest market share in semiconductor chips for generative AI. It also collaborates with Microsoft and other major tech companies.\n\nSynopsys, meanwhile, is making moves to be an even bigger player. In January, it announced plans to buy Ansys (NASDAQ:ANSS) in a $35 billion deal to be a leader in the silicon-to-systems design solutions space.\n\nAs semiconductors continue to grow in importance, so do the prospects of SNPS stock. The stock is up 54% in the last year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Meta Written On The Googles - Man Wearing Virtual Reality Goggles Inside A Metaverse. FTC investigating META.\n\nSource: Aleem Zahid Khan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt one point, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) was best known as a social media company. And while it still has Facebook and Instagram as its dominant holdings, Meta is evolving into something more: an advertising company, a content company and a top tech company.\n\nMeta is using AI to help it monetize its Facebook and Instagram platforms. Advertising is hugely important for Facebook and Instagram as Meta works to keep audiences engaged and show users content and ads that are the most relevant.\n\nThe fourth quarter of 2023 was a good one. Meta reported revenue of $40.1 billion, up 25% from a year ago. And net income of $14 billion was a huge increase from $4.6 billion in the same period last year.\n\nMeta also saw an 8% increase in daily active users to 3.19 billion.\n\nI also love that Meta announced its first dividend – 50 cents per share – and pledged to pay out a quarterly dividend moving forward.\n\nMETA stock is up 146% in the last 12 months and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nYelp (YELP) yelp app on a mobile phone with headphones\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nYelp (NYSE:YELP) can make or break business.

And it recently launched over 20 new features, including improved home feeds and business summaries.\n\nThe continued investment is paying off in improved revenue and growth. The third quarter saw revenue of $345.1 million, up from $308.8 million a year ago. Income of $58.2 million or 79 cents per share, was a dramatic improvement from $9.1 million and 13 cents per share in the same period a year ago.\n\nYelp has now seen revenue grow by double digits for 10 consecutive quarters.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Technology stocks are having a great few months as investors regain confidence in this sector thanks to new catalysts such as artificial intelligence (AI). This goes part way to explaining why the tech-laden Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index is up a solid 45% in the past year.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) played a central role in driving the impressive surge in tech stocks. Shares of the graphics card specialist have tripled over the past year thanks to AI. The company will release its fiscal 2024 fourth-quarter results later this month, and analysts expect Nvidia's revenue to increase a solid 119% year over year to $59 billion. What's more, Nvidia's earnings are set to jump from $3.34 per share in fiscal 2023 to $12.30 per share in fiscal 2024 as per consensus estimates.\n\nEven better, Nvidia could sustain its healthy stock market momentum as analysts have been raising their growth estimates thanks to the company's dominant position in AI chips. That could lead to eye-popping multiyear growth for the company. NVDA Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nHowever, Nvidia's expensive price-to-sales multiple of 37 and price-to-earnings multiple of 87 may lead value investors to look for better bets in the technology space (even if Nvidia is able to justify its expensive valuation by delivering stellar growth). The good news is that there are a couple of other tech stocks significantly cheaper than Nvidia that investors should consider buying right away before they fly higher.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nShare prices of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) shot up 155% in the past year, and the company's latest earnings report suggests that the rally is here to stay. Meta stock jumped 20% on the day after the company released its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1.\n\nThe social media giant reported a nice year-over-year jump of 25% in revenue to $40.1 billion, while earnings increased a whopping 103% to $5.33 per share. The numbers were well ahead of Wall Street's expectations, as analysts would have settled for $4.82 per share in earnings on $39.1 billion in revenue. More importantly, Meta's revenue guidance of $34.5 billion to $37 billion for the current quarter turned out to be better than consensus expectations of $33.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe midpoint of the guidance range points toward a year-over-year increase of 25%. However, there was another factor that led to a sharp spike in Meta stock following its earnings release -- the company's announcement that it is initiating a quarterly dividend. Meta will pay a cash dividend of $0.50 per share next month, and it intends to pay a quarterly dividend going forward.\n\nGiven that the digital ad market that Meta serves is set to grow 13.2% in 2024, up from last year's 10.7% growth, it won't be surprising to see the company sustain its impressive growth momentum through 2024. Additionally, digital ad spending is predicted to increase by 11% in 2025, followed by almost 10% growth in 2026. All this indicates why analysts recently raised their growth expectations for Meta. META Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nMeta stock is trading at 9 times sales right now, which is almost in line with its five-year average sales multiple and is a significantly cheaper multiple than Nvidia. Assuming it can maintain such a multiple next year and hits $197 billion in revenue, as the chart above indicates, its market cap could increase to $1.77 trillion over the next three years. That would be a nice jump of 46% from its current market cap.\n\nHowever, if the market rewards Meta with a higher sales multiple thanks to its accelerating growth, it could deliver more upside. That's why investors looking to buy a top tech stock right now should consider buying Meta before it jumps higher.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another tech stock that got a nice boost following the release of its fourth-quarter 2023 results on Feb. 1. Shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant jumped 8% as the company's revenue increased 14% year over year to $170 billion, beating the $166.2 billion consensus estimate.\n\nAmazon's earnings, on the other hand, jumped from just $0.03 per share in the year-ago period to $1 per share last quarter, handsomely exceeding the $0.80 per share Wall Street estimate. The company's robust year-over-year growth was driven by improvements across all of its business segments, while a slower increase in its expenses led to a strong bottom-line jump.\n\nWhat's more, Amazon is expecting to deliver double-digit growth once again in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range. It forecasts revenue to land between $138 billion and $143.5 billion in the current quarter, an increase of 8% to 13% over the prior-year period. The company's operating income guidance of $8 billion to $12 billion points toward a big jump from the year-ago period's figure of $4.8 billion, and it is ahead of the $9.1 billion Wall Street estimate at the midpoint.\n\nHowever, don't be surprised to see Amazon clocking faster growth as it has been tapping AI to make its mark in fast-growing markets.\n\nFirst, the company is integrating generative AI tools into its e-commerce platform. It has rolled out an AI-powered shopping assistant, christened Rufus, which Amazon says has been \"trained on Amazon's product catalog and information from across the web to answer customer questions on shopping needs, products, and comparisons, make recommendations based on this context, and facilitate product discovery.\"\n\nThe company believes that Rufus will make it easier for customers to find and purchase products on its platform. Such tools can help Amazon capture a greater share of the e-commerce market, which is expected to clock 9.4% growth in 2024 and generate $6.33 trillion in revenue. By 2027, the global e-commerce market is anticipated to clock annual sales of over $8 trillion. So, Amazon's focus on giving tools to customers that could help elevate their shopping experience could act as a catalyst for its long-term growth.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon is in a nice position to capitalize on the fast-growing market for AI in the cloud. The company has been collaborating with Nvidia to bring the latest hardware and software to customers so that they can train AI models and build generative AI applications in a cost-effective manner. Amazon Web Services is the top provider of cloud infrastructure services in the world, with a market share of 32%.\n\nWith the market for AI in the cloud predicted to jump to $887 billion in 2032 from $43 billion in 2022, Amazon's focus on this market could eventually lead to huge gains in the long run. As such, it is not surprising to see why analysts are predicting the company's earnings to increase at an impressive annual rate of 87% for the next five years.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to buy Amazon stock while it is trading at a relatively cheaper 59 times trailing earnings when compared to Nvidia's multiple of 83, especially considering that the latter's earnings are forecast to grow at 102% a year for the next five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Many U.S.-listed Hong stocks have suffered substantial losses over the previous years as Chinese equities have continuously declined. The trend was exacerbated by last year’s ordered liquidation of heavily indebted property developer Evergrande (OTCMKTS:EGRNY). It deteriorated even further to see outflows from Chinese and Hong Kong stocks reaching their highest since 2014 in January. It marked the sixth consecutive month of net capital leaving the country.\n\nHowever, U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks rose on Tuesday. It followed the Chinese government announcing various measures to support the stock exchange. Hong Kong’s Hang Seng index saw a rise of 4%, whereas Mainland China’s CSI 300 accelerated by 3.48%. Measures taken included state-owned enterprises purchasing exchange-traded funds (ETFs). The securities regulator even stated they would “encourage” companies to buy shares.\n\nBefore the support measures were announced, hedge funds had already purchased large volumes of Chinese businesses, primarily with listed shares or American depositary receipts (ADRs). Hedge funds invested almost $12 billion over January 23-25 in ADRs, A-shares, and Chinese companies listed in Hong Kong. Naturally, this included U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks. The 3-day frenzy marked the biggest purchase in five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFollowing the announcement, U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks extended recent gains at Wednesday’s open. In recent trading, the Hang Seng index price-to-earnings (PE) ratio has decreased from around 10.50 at the beginning of January to 9.98. This suggests that various U.S.-listed Hong Kong stocks could be undervalued and poised to reverse.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite the share price of Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) having declined 77% from its 2020 peak, its stock is currently trading at a pierce-to-earnings (PE) ratio of 10.8. In contrast, its largest American counterpart, Amazon, trades at a PE ratio of 58.3.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts foresee potential upside for BABA as the company expands its cloud segment and AI initiatives. The average price target implies around 60% growth, making the U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock a favorable choice.\n\nAside from optimism amongst analysts, Alibaba’s founders, Jack Ma, and Joe Tsai, have recently purchased $200 million worth of stock.\n\nNetEase (NTES) man in suit holding a tablet with graphic above showing oversold stocks to buy\n\nSource: undefined undefined / Getty Images\n\nThe U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock NetEase (NYSE:NTES) trades at a PE ratio of 18.2 compared to its American counterpart, Electronic Arts (NASDAQ:EA), which has a PE ratio of 34. Despite economic headwinds, NetEase grew its EPS 26% annually over three years and improved profit margins. The company also grew its EBIT margins, generating more profits from increasing sales.\n\nInsiders, including management, own 46% of NetEase’s shares. This strongly aligns with other shareholders’ interests, suggesting the company is motivated to create shareholder value. While NTES’ performance looks promising, some analysts note that insider buying would provide further confidence. Nevertheless, Wall Street analysts estimate a 30% share price increase\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NYSE:BIDU), the Chinese technology giant, trades at a PE ratio of 17.9. There is no directly comparable American company to Baidu, given its operations span search engine, cloud storage, social media and artificial intelligence development. However, similar companies may include Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG), which trades at a PE ratio of 24.9; Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), with a PE ratio of 36.5; and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), with a PE ratio of 30.6.​\n\nThe U.S.-listed Hong Kong stock has declined nearly 70% from its early 2021 high, with a further drop of almost 12% in January amid the broader downturn in Chinese equities. However, analysts maintain a positive outlook for the company. This is partly due to Baidu reporting $26 billion in cash and liquid assets in its most recent earnings. The consensus price target among analysts is $167.66 per share, representing an upside of just under 60% from current levels.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Big Tech is taking the spoils of the ad resurgence",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA rising tide might lift all boats, but the resurgence in the ad market is flowing mostly to the giants.\n\nThe companies that measure their market cap in the trillions are the ones reaping the rewards of the advertising rebound of 2024, leaving much of the legacy media and even tech's smaller players out of the comeback story.\n\nThis year Google and Meta, the top two in the digital ads market, are expected to haul in more than $140 billion, according to forecasts by Intelligence Insider. The duo is on track to once again claim nearly half of all digital ads revenue. Even as brands spend their way out of a multiyear ad slump, it's mega enterprises who will be feasting while mostly everyone else claws for scraps.\n\nInvestors pummeled Snap this week for posting merely 5% revenue growth, the latest example of Wall Street punishing anything that doesn't look like Zuckerbergian conquest. Meta set the bar for expansion. The social media king catapulted its advertising revenue 24% higher, more than doubling the pace of rival Google's 11%. Wall Street dinged Google for that too.\n\nWhere ad dollars flow underscores the selectiveness of the recovery. Amazon last week reported its ads business swelled 27% year over year. While the company sits in third place in the digital ads market, Amazon is poised to gobble even greater share. It's in the early stages of converting an untapped Prime Video streaming service into an ad platform with a massive, built-in audience. Watch it on Amazon then buy it on Amazon.\n\nOverall, worldwide digital ad spending is projected to increase 13.2% this year, the data shows, compared to traditional media ad growth of 2.4%.\n\nThe other major players expected to amplify their ads business are following a similar playbook of platform economics, capturing the eyeballs of enormous online ecosystems: Walmart and TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs if it couldn't get any harder to run with Big Tech, the same companies that upended the ads business through search and social media are deploying their huge cash piles to invest in new AI tools. They stand to rejigger markets and the attention economy further in their favor.\n\nEven Disney (DIS), fresh off a significant earnings beat, a dividend boost, and a burst of flashy announcements, still struggles with the baggage of a legacy media business. Its linear networks segment fell 12% compared to the same period last year, the company reported Wednesday, while the unit's operating income fell 7%.\n\nFox's (FOX) ad revenue, which makes up nearly half of the company's total sales, tumbled 20% in the December quarter versus the year prior, it disclosed earlier this week.\n\nAnd while other media names are scheduled to report later this month, including Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount (PARA), it's likely their ad-reliant finances, without Bob Iger's streaming head start and dealmaking pizzazz, will reveal more of the same. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 9, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META and Netflix NFLX.\n\nSurging Momentum: 3 Tech Stocks on the Verge of Another Breakout\n\nBig tech has continued to prove its incredible resilience and ability to produce massive profits following the most recent earnings reports. Amazon, Meta Platforms and Netflix all reported impressive earnings, and all gapped up significantly following the meeting.\n\nFurthermore, each stock enjoys a top Zacks Rank, indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and strong near-term expectations for the share price.\n\nAlthough I understand some investors are hesitant to buy now or add to positions in the large cap technology stocks after they have rallied so much over the last year, but just because a stock goes up doesn’t always mean it can’t go up more.\n\nThese three stocks are all trading at historically fair relative valuations, so investors need not fear buying into an overvalued market. In fact, after seeing such strong growth and profitability in the most recent quarterly reports, and experiencing earnings estimates upgrades, the valuations appear even more reasonable.\n\nNetflix\n\nAt the most recent quarterly earnings meeting Netflix beat estimates on both the top and bottom line, and recorded record subscriber growth. Netflix’s platform now has 261 million paid subscribers, adding 13 million in Q4 alone.\n\nAt the meeting, management announced a plan to expand the content offerings on the streaming platform, and just signed a deal with the WWE to show stream the Raw wrestling program weekly.\n\nNetflix has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts have near unanimously upgraded their earnings estimates over the last two months, with current quarter expectations rising by 10.5% to $4.41 per share and FY24 earnings climbing 6.3% to $16.93 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis technical setup of NFLX stock is a prototypical post-earnings gap and bull flag and offers a high probably trade. If NFLX can trade above the $564 level, it would signal a breakout. However, if it loses support at and trades below $553, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms also just shared a banner earnings report, also beating on both sales and earnings estimates. Sales in Q4 jumped 25% YoY to $40.1 billion and expenses decreased 8% YoY.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms announced its first dividend payment after its cash pile expanded to $60 billion. They also announced a $50 billion share buyback program in an effort to return even more cash to shareholders.\n\nMETA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts unanimously raising earnings estimates over the last two months and across timeframes.\n\nLike the others, META stock has formed a picture-perfect post earnings bull flag. If the stock can move above the $474 level, it would indicate a breakout. Alternatively, if it trades below the $454 level of support, it may fill that gap before moving higher again.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nFinally, the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, Amazon looks to have everything going for it. Another quarter of beating analysts’ estimates, a booming new advertising business, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating makes AMZN stock a worthy investment to consider.\n\nThese post earnings bull flags are the theme here today, and Amazon stock is no different. If the stock moves above the $171.50 level, it signals a breakout and should send the stock swiftly higher. But below that lower bound of $168, and it may take some time for it to set up again.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 best cities for hedge fund managers. If you would like to skip our analysis of the hedge fund industry, you can go directly to the 5 Best Cities for Hedge Fund Managers.\n\nAccording to reports, the US currently dominates the hedge fund industry, with a 65% market share, followed by the UK and Hong Kong. Despite experiencing a decline in recent years, the industry witnessed a record number of new hedge fund launches in 2020 and 2021. However, 2022 recorded the lowest number of launches since 2010, with approximately 900 new funds entering the market. Equity long/short funds were the most common type of new fund launches, followed by crypto and multi-strategy funds.\n\nAmongst the hedge fund categories, equity long/short represents around 27% of all hedge funds. Meanwhile, other equity strategies, such as market neutral and long-biased, along with credit funds, each represent about 15% of the industry. Multi-strategy funds constitute 13% of the overall hedge fund sector. In terms of investment styles, the discretionary approach is the most commonly used method, accounting for 53% of hedge funds. However, a clear trend towards quantification is now evident, with nearly a third of hedge funds adopting a hybrid discretionary and systematic approach. Around 14% of funds apply a fully systematic approach.\n\nAfter achieving double-digit returns in 2021, the hedge fund industry saw contrasting success in 2022. While the overall industry, as represented by composite hedge fund indices, outperformed both the stock and bond markets, individual hedge funds generally recorded losses. Tiger Global and Third Point are among the major hedge funds that faced losses during 2022. These losses amounted to billions of dollars. Tiger Global’s long/short equity fund lost 56% in value, while the long-only fund dropped by 67% during 2022. The hedge fund lost a total of $18 billion during the entire year. Tiger Global’s top four stock holdings include Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Take-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO).\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2022, many institutional investors initiated a trend of profit-taking from hedge fund positions. This pattern continued in 2023 and may extend into 2024 as well, possibly limiting some of the growth observed in hedge funds. There's an increased focus on strategies providing diversification and featuring more flexible liquidity terms. Investors are increasingly turning to risk-mitigating strategies to diversify equity risk.\n\nFactors Shaping Hedge Fund City Selection\n\nIn terms of regional analysis, North America leads the industry with a 68% market share, followed by Europe at 18% and Asia at 7%. Hence, many US cities feature in the list of best cities for hedge funds. Reports also suggest that France is preparing a new strategy to enhance Paris' appeal as a major finance hub in the European Union. This move comes amidst an initial wave of relocations following Brexit. French President Emmanuel Macron is set to unveil new measures in 2024, although the specific details are yet to be publicly disclosed.\n\nThe goal is to build on Paris' success in attracting prominent US banks and hedge funds. Hedge funds tend to choose cities based on various factors, such as regulatory environment, talent availability, infrastructure, proximity to financial centers, and client base. A regulatory environment can include low tax rates, lenient regulatory bodies, and strong legal frameworks. Major cities have large pools of skilled professionals in finance, law, and technology fields.\n\nFurthermore, reliable infrastructure is essential for the efficient operation of firms, and proximity to financial centers facilitates easier access to resources and markets. In addition to this, some cities also have large populations of high-net-worth individuals who are among potential clients for hedge funds. It's these considerations that make cities like New York and London particularly attractive to many hedge funds.

These cities have the highest number of hedge funds located in them due to numerous factors, such as a favorable regulatory environment, strong talent pool, and infrastructure.  The best cities for hedge fund managers have been ranked in ascending order of the percentage of hedge funds located in each one of them. We used Preqin's annual reports to get information regarding the concentration of hedge funds in the top 10 cities. For the remaining 5 cities, we had to explore other avenues and use slightly dated information due to a lack of more recent data.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n15 Best Cities for Hedge Fund Managers\n\n15. Stamford\n\nHedge Funds = 0.17%\n\nAs per reports, Stamford, Connecticut, is home to about 52 hedge funds. It makes up 0.17% of hedge funds globally and 0.27% of hedge funds in the US.

        "content": "(Repeats story with no changes to text)\n\nBy Praveen Menon\n\nSYDNEY, Feb 9 (Reuters) - Meta's oversight board said on Friday it will examine two cases on how the social media giant handled potentially misleading posts that were shared ahead of the Australian referendum on Indigenous recognition in October last year.\n\nThe board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, said the cases were selected to assess Meta's content moderation policies on false or misleading voting information and voter fraud.\n\nAustralians in October last year decisively rejected a proposal to constitutionally recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. The vote was held amid a deeply divisive debate in the country, and amid fears that a misinformation campaign was influencing voters.\n\nThe board said two Facebook users separately posted screenshots showing partial information shared by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe board said screenshots from the AEC posted by the Facebook users included the following language: “If someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate, and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted.”\n\nThey also show another comment that the secrecy of the ballot prevents the AEC from “knowing which ballot paper belongs to which person.”\n\nHowever, the screenshots did not show that voting multiple times is an offence in Australia, the board said.\n\nThe first Facebook user shared the screenshot with the accompanying caption: “Vote early, vote often, and vote NO.” The second user posted the same screenshot saying: “so you can vote multiple times … they are setting us up for a ‘rigging’ … smash the voting centres … it’s a No, No, No, No, No.”\n\nIn both cases, Meta proactively identified the posts, which were automatically sent for human review, the board said, adding that following human review, the posts were both removed.\n\nBoth users appealed Meta's decisions to remove their posts. In their statements to the board, both users claimed they were posting content from the AEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe board said these cases fall within its strategic priority of Elections and Civic Space.\n\nAs part of its decisions, the Board can issue policy recommendations to Meta. While recommendations are not binding, Meta must respond to them within 60 days.\n\nThere will be more scrutiny on social media firms this year as countries making up more than half of the world's population hold elections, including the U.S., India and Russia. Social media platforms such as Facebook and X have become more popular platforms for election campaigns around the world. (Reporting by Praveen Menon)",

        "title": "The 7 Best AI Stocks to Buy for 100% Returns by 2025",
        "content": "2023 was the year that artificial intelligence (AI) stocks exploded. All as the emergence of generative AI and large language models propelled artificial intelligence into the mainstream. Nowadays, 2024 is shaping up to be a continuation of the massive growth experienced in 2023, which is great news for some of the best AI stocks on the market.\n\nWhile investors fear that the artificial intelligence hype may be overblown, there’s still plenty of reason to remain bullish. After all, artificial intelligence is just starting to change life as we know it — another solid catalyst for some of the best AI stocks.\n\nLet’s look at seven of the best AI stocks that could double this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy far, one of the best AI stocks to own is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). At the moment, it trades for about $625, with a target price of $1,100. That’s less than double, but it did start the year at $481.68.\n\nNvidia showed investors in 2023 that analysts –  even bullish ones –  underestimate its potential. All of 2023 was marked by extraordinary earnings beats from Nvidia. For example, in each of the last three quarters beginning in April of 2023, the company produced EPS and revenue results that exceeded estimates by double-digit percentage margins.\n\nNvidia benefits from having the largest and most capable supply chain in the AI industry per its admission. Yet despite its strengths, it continues to struggle to fulfill demand for its AI chips. That has led to incredibly high prices for its products. and with its h200 chips scheduled to be launched this year, that beneficial business mix is likely to persist. Those strong Dynamics continue to suggest that NVDA shares have all the potential to double this year.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) Is Nvidia’s primary challenger for the booming demand across enterprises for AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nRecently, it was revealed that Microsoft and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) gobbled up 60% of the 500,000 chips sold by Nvidia. Those firms are on record stating that they will switch to AMD as their chip provider. AMD’s M1 mi300x chips give the company a real shot at dethroning Nvidia and will certainly chip away at its lead if nothing else.\n\nCEO Lisa Su believes in the continued opportunity in AI data centers. She sees the opportunity ballooning to $400 billion by 2027. According to NewStreet analyst Pierre Ferragu, even if that opportunity only reaches $200 billion, it could result in a tripling quadrupling of AMD’s price.\n\nIf rapid AI data center adoption continues to materialize, many believe AMD is the strongest way to benefit from that growth. Whether that results in a doubling of share price in 2024 remains to be seen But the future is indeed very bright for AMD.\n\nUiPath (PATH) The UiPath (PATH) app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock.com\n\nArtificial intelligence continues to fundamentally change the future of workplace productivity. UiPath‘s (NYSE:PATH) software helps enterprises to streamline repetitive tasks. For example, RPA technology helps to reduce the time required when filling out a repetitive legal document as one example.\n\nThe company is particularly well regarded because its fundamentals are improving as demand for its technology grows. During the third quarter, revenues increased by 24% to $326 million. Sales are expected to increase to approximately $386 million during the fourth quarter.\n\nMoving forward, generative AI is likely to play an increasing role in UiPath’s growth. The company will continue to grow and challenge other software firms including Salesforce (NYSE:CRM). When it comes to workplace automation and efficiency increases, UiPath is definitely a name to consider in 2024 and beyond.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SOUN stock: SoundHound's Headquarters exterior featuring a sign with the company's logo in the foreground and a parking lot and building in the background.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is a stock to consider for. conversational AI.\n\nConversational AI refers to voice recognition tools that have wide application in industries from automobiles to fast food to banking and more. The company has partnered with firms across many of those Industries including Stellantis (NYSE:STLA), for example. Its technology is also used across the fast food industry with partners across many smaller but well-known brands.\n\nShares currently trade for $1.75 and have a low target price of $3.60. Those prices range to a high of $5 so there’s some real potential in SoundHound AI. The topic of conversational AI as an investment opportunity will continue to grow particularly because it has such important implications for firms.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) doubled throughout 2023 and continues to be a stock to watch in 2024.\n\nSure, Palantir continues to be maligned by much of the investment world. Specifically, Jefferies believes that the AI hype surrounding the firm is overblown. That assertion led it to downgrade its target price for Palantir to $13.\n\nHowever, PLTR has plenty of bulls on its side, too. Many note the company has been delivering several quarters of profitability. Plus, its AI tools are being used by the U.S. military and government, which should continue to serve as a strong catalyst moving forward.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) rocketed from $250 to $400 over the last 12 months. Forecasts suggest that those prices could rise to $600 throughout 2024. That is of course not a 100% return, and instead closer to 50%.\n\nHowever, Microsoft has emerged as one of the leading two AI firms overall and it’s hard to discount it and its continued potential. The markets aren’t particularly impressed by the company’s fourth quarter earnings release. However, 18% Top Line growth is impressive particularly in consideration of Microsoft’s size.\n\nCEO Satya Nadella notes that the company has implemented AI throughout its tech stack. Perhaps more importantly, Microsoft’s Cloud revenue increased by 24% during the quarter.\n\nThe marriage between cloud computing and artificial intelligence is of particular interest to investors and those interested in the wider economy. Microsoft’s Azure Cloud is one of the biggest competitors in that regard. The company is incredibly strong in AI Cloud applications and will continue to thrive due to its early investment in OpenAI.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is China’s leading internet search provider and as such often draws comparisons to Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL). Both firms continue to invest heavily in AI. That investment promises to result in stronger share prices for both moving forward.\n\nIn fact, Baidu’s AI investment is already bearing fruit. In the third quarter, the company provided unexpectedly strong results due to AI. Sales and earnings were higher than expected which was particularly welcomed by the firm given the slowdown currently affecting the Chinese economy.\n\nCompany management reiterated what so many other tech firms are stating in regard to AI: it will continue to invest heavily in generative AI in order to build out its artificial intelligence platform’s capability.\n\nAs negative sentiment continues to swirl over Chinese stocks Baidu has emerged as a strong contrarian opportunity. China’s tech leaders are very analogous to those in the United States. both will continue to seize the opportunity in AI through massive investment. That investment should help those large leading firms further consolidate their dominance over their respective geographies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Strong Buy Large-Cap Stocks to Add to Your February Must-Watch List",
        "content": "Without a doubt, large-cap stocks have been performing much better than small-cap stocks since the beginning of this year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average, which is made up of all large-cap stocks, has climbed 2.5% so far this year, while the S&P 500, whose performance is primarily driven by several strong buy large-cap stocks, is up 4.6% in 2024. Conversely, the Russell 2000, which tracks small-cap stocks is down 4% so far in 2024.\n\nGiven this data, it seems as though investors’ phobia of small-cap companies that are not yet profitable, which took a highly justified hiatus late last year, has returned. Consequently, momentum traders and momentum investors should look to buy large-cap, highly profitable stocks whose issuers have strong balance sheets. Here are three strong buy large-cap stocks for them to consider.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nDriven by strong demand for its AI software and services, as well as its hybrid cloud offerings, IBM (NYSE:IBM) reported impressive fourth-quarter results on Jan. 25.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpecifically, its income from continuing operations climbed 14.5% year-over-year to $3.285 billion. Moreover, Big Blue’s free cash flow surged 1.7% year-over-year to $6.09 billion. Finally, the firm provided 2024 free cash flow guidance of $12 billion, well above Bank of America’s (NYSE:BAC) estimate of $11 billion to $11.5 billion.\n\nIBM’s AI business is growing rapidly, as its bookings related to the technology soared 100% in Q4 versus Q3. With many companies quickly integrating AI and turning to IBM for help with doing so, the phenomenon should continue to provide a major positive catalyst for the firm’s profitability and for IBM stock going forward. This raid growth makes IBM one of the market’s strong buy large-cap stocks.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) develops computer chips for many different products, and it’s also a leader in the Wi-Fi and server storage sectors. Like IBM, AVGO has been a major beneficiary of the AI Revolution.\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) recently began coverage of AVGO stock with an “overweight” rating, based on the strength of its AI chips business. Specifically, the bank expects the firm to benefit from strong demand for its chips used by datacenters which are both creating AI and facilitating much of its utilization at this point.\n\nMoreover, Broadcom’s partnerships with both Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) should also boost its top and bottom lines in the medium-term and the long-term.\n\nAlso noteworthy is that AVGO has acquired Vmware, which should benefit from its alliance with the largest AI chipmaker, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Additionally, VMware has made Broadcom less dependent on its four largest customers, decreasing the risk that it faces.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) Image of General Motors (GM) logo on corporate building with clear sky in the background.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) stock surged on Jan. 30 after the automaker delivered fourth-quarter results that came in significantly above analysts’ average estimates. While the shares have largely tread water since then, they do appear to have formed a bullish reverse head-and-shoulder pattern this month.\n\nWhat’s more, as we get closer to the U.S. Federal Reserve cutting interest rates, I believe that the shares are likely too pop. That’s because lower rates makes buying vehicles much cheaper for the vast majority of purchasers who take out loans on them.\n\nAnother factor that could boost GM this year is the rapid winding down of the work-from-home phenomenon. As many more Americans resume commuting five days per week, the demand for GM’s vehicles should surge.\n\nBank of America has a $75 price target on the shares, far above their current level of around $39.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The benchmark S&P 500 index is at a record high and on the cusp of closing above 5,000 for the very first time. While the index is comprised of the 500 largest publicly traded companies in America and is viewed as a diverse collection of both small and large cap stocks, its gains continue to be driven by a small group of technology companies, most of whom are leaders in the area of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe majority of stocks in the index continue to lag its overall performance. So lopsided is the current performance of the S&P 500 that when the index rose 1% on Feb. 2, the average stock in the index was down on the day. The gain in the S&P 500 on Feb. 2 was mostly due to a 20% rise in the share price of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) on news that the company plans to pay a dividend for the first time. The current rally may eventually broaden out.\n\nBut for now, it remains highly concentrated in a few names. Here are three doomed S&P 500 stocks to dump before they dive: February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe New York Times Co. (NYT) A photo of a person reading the Feb. 16, 2020 issue of the New York Times.\n\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) suddenly looks vulnerable. While the newspaper publisher’s fourth quarter 2023 print contained some impressive figures, it also unveiled some worrying trends. On the positive side, the company added 300,000 paid digital subscribers in the final months of last year, and the continued growth pushed its annual revenue for digital subscriptions above $1 billion for the first time. But the Times also saw a drop in advertising and raised concerns about artificial intelligence.\n\nOverall advertising at The New York Times declined in Q4 by 8.4% to $164.1 million. Digital advertising fell 3.7% while print advertising dropped 16.2%. The number of print subscribers also continues to decline, falling to 660,000 at the end of 2023 from 730,000 at the end of 2022. And the Athletic, the sports site the company bought two years ago, continues to lose money, posting a $4.4 million loss for Q4 2023. The share price fell 8% after its latest print, making The New York Times look like a doomed stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnited Parcel Service (UPS) Envelopes with UPS logo on them. UPS stock.\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nUnited Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) continues to struggle after the Covid-19 pandemic ended. So far in 2024, UPS stock is down 7%, bringing its 12-month decline to 22%. The company’s shares have been sliding lower ever since it lowered its forward guidance for this year, citing weak demand for its services. The world’s largest delivery and logistics company said that it expects 2024 revenue of $92 billion to $94.50 billion, which is below Wall Street forecasts of $95.57 billion.\n\nThe company said that it continues to wrestle with weak demand, particularly among e-commerce shipments. For the final quarter of 2023, UPS reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.47, which was a smidge ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.46. Revenue totaled $24.92 billion, missing the consensus expectation among analysts of $25.40 billion and marking the sixth consecutive quarter that the company’s revenue missed expectations. Sales were down 8% from a year earlier. Along with its latest print, UPS announced 12,000 job cuts.\n\nBP (BP) BP stock: the BP company logo on a building\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock.com\n\nBritish Petroleum (NYSE:BP) put the best spin possible on its most recent earnings report. Or rather than company distracted media and analysts by announcing that it plans to buyback a total of $14 billion of its own stock through 2025, including $3.50 billion in this year’s first half. News of the increased stock buybacks dominated the headlines and led to BP stock rising 5%. However, beneath the cheering there were some worrisome signs in BP’s latest print, including a big drop in its annual profit.\n\nBP reported a net profit for all of last year of $13.80 billion. That was half of the record $27.70 billion the company earned in 2022 when crude oil prices were above $100 a barrel. The company also announced that its net debt stood at $20.90 billion at the end of 2023, basically the same level it was at a year earlier. And the European oil giant now has a new and unproven CEO in Murray Auchincloss, who replaces former CEO Bernard Looney who resigned last fall after a workplace scandal.\n\nBP stock has declined 5% in the last 12 months and is down 15% over the past five years, making it a doomed S&P 500 stocks to dump before it dives further.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Before the surge in popularity of Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s ChatGPT, the tech industry was abuzz with discussions about a different groundbreaking concept: the metaverse. Investors rushed to gain exposure to the “next big thing.” However, be cautious because many of these doomed metaverse stocks and companies behind them find themselves in trouble a few years later.\n\nSome analysts saw metaverse as a potential new phase in the evolution of the internet, and often described as the next significant revolution in digital technology. Metaverse envisions a fully immersive, three-dimensional virtual space where users can interact, work, play, and participate in a digital economy, transcending the traditional boundaries of the internet as we know it today.\n\nThis digital universe proposes to blend virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and video where users “live” within a digital universe. Mark Zuckerberg, a leading voice in tech, was particularly instrumental in propelling the metaverse narrative. Demonstrating his commitment to this vision, Zuckerberg took a significant step in October 2021 by rebranding Facebook to Meta (NASDAQ:META), signaling a strategic pivot towards the metaverse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, more than two years after this bold move, Zuckerberg’s ambitious vision for the metaverse appears to be encountering significant challenges. Reality Labs, Meta’s division dedicated to virtual and augmented reality technologies, has incurred losses measured in tens of billions of dollars.\n\nWhile Meta stock has skyrocketed in recent months, the rally is a result of improving cost efficiencies and Reels taking off rather than metaverse investment paying off. While these losses can be attributed to long-term investments, with Meta not anticipating immediate returns, the lack of substantial progress raises concerns about the viability of such a massive gamble.\n\nHere we look at 3 doomed metaverse stocks that investors should avoid until the macroeconomic environment improves.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) mobile phone screen displaying match group's (MTCH stock) logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH) is a leading provider of dating products designed to help people connect online and help them find relationships. The company has become synonymous with online dating through its portfolio of well-known brands.\n\nIts key products include Tinder, the swipe-based app that revolutionized the dating scene; Match.com, one of the first dating websites that cater to individuals seeking long-term relationships; Hinge, marketed as the app “designed to be deleted” for those looking for serious connections; and OkCupid, which uses a question-based algorithm to find compatible matches.\n\nTogether, these platforms cater to a diverse range of preferences and demographics, making Match Group a dominant force in the global online dating market. However, this dominance hasn’t really translated into a strong stock performance with shares down ~80% from the record high set in 2021.\n\nAmid these issues, Match Group decided to reduce its focus on developing metaverse dating features within Tinder and has abandoned its plans to introduce a Tinder Coins currency within the app.\n\nThe company recently reported an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.81 for the quarter, significantly better than the anticipated $0.50. Its revenue was reported at $866.2 million, exceeding analyst expectations of $861.33 million.\n\nHowever, Match Group disclosed a 5% YoY drop in its paying user base during the fourth quarter, with the number falling to 15.2 million. For the upcoming first quarter, the company projects its revenue to be in the range of $850 million to $860 million, which was slightly below the average analyst forecast of $867 million.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Illustrative Editorial of Matterport's (MTTR stock) website homepage. MATTERPORT logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMatterport Inc. (NASDAQ:MTTR) is a technology company specializing in spatial data capture and creating digital twins of physical spaces. Its innovative platform enables users to create, modify, navigate, and share 3D spaces online, revolutionizing industries like real estate, architecture, and construction by enhancing virtual tours, property listings, and project planning processes.\n\nThe company reported results for the third quarter in November with a 35% YoY increase in total subscribers, reaching 887,000. It also saw a 28% rise in spaces under management, totaling 11.1 million. Total revenue grew by 7% from the previous year to $40.6 million, with subscription revenue climbing 20% to $22.9 million.\n\nOverall, Matterport stock surged on these results. However, these gains did not prove to be sustainable with shares plunging in December. The decline in Matterport’s stock price in December was driven by a change in investor sentiment regarding the company’s short-term earnings potential, which appears to be years away from aligning with its substantial market capitalization. Hence, investors are likely to stay away from this doomed metaverse stock in the near term.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnity Software Inc. (NYSE:U) is one of the leading platforms for creating and operating interactive, real-time 3D content. Widely used by game developers, it also serves industries such as film, automotive, and architecture. Unity’s comprehensive suite enables the development, management, and monetization of 2D, 3D, VR, metaverse, and AR experiences for mobile, console, and desktop platforms.\n\nIts shares fell more than 25% in the last few weeks as the company continues to cut jobs in an effort to reduce costs as it fights to accelerate its top-line growth. Just in November, Unity’s shares dropped almost 15% after the company refused to provide a financial forecast for Q4 2023. Moreover, investors are likely to stay away from Unity stock in the near term amid rising uncertainty.\n\nThe company cited ongoing changes that may result in further job reductions and the discontinuation of certain products as reasons for this decision. Overall, Unity stock is down about 15% over the last 52 weeks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Big tech has continued to prove its incredible resilience and ability to produce massive profits following the most recent earnings reports. Amazon AMZN, Meta Platforms META, and Netflix NFLX all reported impressive earnings, and all gapped up significantly following the meeting.\n\nFurthermore, each stock enjoys a top Zacks Rank, indicating upward trending earnings revisions, and strong near-term expectations for the share price.\n\nAlthough I understand some investors are hesitant to buy now or add to positions in the large cap technology stocks after they have rallied so much over the last year, but just because a stock goes up doesn’t always mean it can’t go up more. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThese three stocks are all trading at historically fair relative valuations, so investors need not fear buying into an overvalued market. In fact, after seeing such strong growth and profitability in the most recent quarterly reports, and experiencing earnings estimates upgrades, the valuations appear even more reasonable. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNetflix\n\nAt the most recent quarterly earnings meeting Netflix beat estimates on both the top and bottom line, and recorded record subscriber growth. Netflix’s platform now has 261 million paid subscribers, adding 13 million in Q4 alone.\n\nAt the meeting, management announced a plan to expand the content offerings on the streaming platform, and just signed a deal with the WWE to show stream the Raw wrestling program weekly.\n\nNetflix has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions. Analysts have near unanimously upgraded their earnings estimates over the last two months, with current quarter expectations rising by 10.5% to $4.41 per share and FY24 earnings climbing 6.3% to $16.93 per share.\n\nThis technical setup of NFLX stock is a prototypical post-earnings gap and bull flag and offers a high probably trade. If NFLX can trade above the $564 level, it would signal a breakout. However, if it loses support at and trades below $553, the setup is invalid, and investors may want to wait for another opportunity.\n\nStory continues TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms also just shared a banner earnings report, also beating on both sales and earnings estimates. Sales in Q4 jumped 25% YoY to $40.1 billion and expenses decreased 8% YoY.\n\nAdditionally, Meta Platforms announced its first dividend payment after its cash pile expanded to $60 billion. They also announced a $50 billion share buyback program in an effort to return even more cash to shareholders.\n\nMETA has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts unanimously raising earnings estimates over the last two months and across timeframes. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLike the others, META stock has formed a picture-perfect post earnings bull flag. If the stock can move above the $474 level, it would indicate a breakout. Alternatively, if it trades below the $454 level of support, it may fill that gap before moving higher again. TradingView\n\nImage Source: TradingView\n\nAmazon.com\n\nFinally, the e-commerce and cloud-computing giant, Amazon looks to have everything going for it. Another quarter of beating analysts’ estimates, a booming new advertising business, and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating makes AMZN stock a worthy investment to consider.\n\nThese post earnings bull flags are the theme here today, and Amazon stock is no different. If the stock moves above the $171.50 level, it signals a breakout and should send the stock swiftly higher. But below that lower bound of $168, and it may take some time for it to set up again.

        "title": "Big Tech’s $140 Billion Cash Haul Points to Shareholder Returns",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech is bringing in more cash than ever before, priming the group to return money to shareholders and potentially adding fuel to a rally that’s already sent most of the group into record territory.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China Epstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings Claim Ukraine’s Army Chief Leaves After Rift With Zelenskiy Citadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley’s Block-Trading Leaks Xi’s Markets Shakeup Surprised Insiders, Showing Alarm Over Rout\n\nThe five biggest technology companies that have reported earnings so far — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — generated a record $139.5 billion of combined cash from operations in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors can “expect excess free cash flow to largely be returned to shareholders given these companies already possess strong balance sheets and high net cash positions,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “Greater focus on capital returns will help contribute to shareholder value over time and is better than holding onto excess cash on the balance sheet.”\n\nOnly Apple, Microsoft and now Meta have dividend plans in this group. While having cash in the bank is a good position to be in, investors appreciate when companies invest any excess money for better opportunities or return it to shareholders.\n\nIn some ways, it has become more challenging for the firms to spend it. Amazon last month abandoned a $1.4 billion purchase of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after clashing with European Union regulators. Microsoft eventually completed its $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, but only after two-years of trans-Atlantic scrutiny that threatened to scupper the deal.\n\nBuybacks on the other hand are seen as a way to return profits to investors while reducing the number of shares outstanding — theoretically increasing the value of the remaining stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch moves enable firms to demonstrate that they are profitable, well-performing and believe their shares are still undervalued. “The confidence signaled by the payment or increase of a dividend can be a powerful boost to sentiment,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nRead More: Meta’s $197 Billion Surge Is Biggest in Stock-Market History\n\nMeta showed what aggressive capital returns can do when it initiated a quarterly dividend and earmarked $50 billion in funds for share repurchases. Aided by a stronger than expected sales forecast, its stock on Friday saw the biggest single-day market value gain in market history.\n\n“You rewind 10 years ago when a tech company starts giving a dividend — it’s usually the beginning of the end of growth,” Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an interview. But Meta’s dividend came alongside continued investments signaling “they believe they can achieve growth in AI and Reality Labs by doing this themselves,” he said, referring to the unit building the firm’s version of the metaverse.\n\nStill, there are also reasons for investor caution, notes AJ Bell’s Mould, citing how buybacks can be used to juice earnings per share figures by reducing share count, for example.\n\nBig Tech has spent about $186 billion on buybacks over the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have consistently spent billions in buying back stock, Amazon has been a notable hold out recently.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is one of the most obvious candidates to increase its capital returns.

        "content": "By Praveen Menon\n\nSYDNEY (Reuters) - Meta's oversight board said on Friday it will examine two cases on how the social media giant handled potentially misleading posts that were shared ahead of the Australian referendum on Indigenous recognition in October last year.\n\nThe board, which is funded by Meta but run independently, said the cases were selected to assess Meta's content moderation policies on false or misleading voting information and voter fraud.\n\nAustralians in October last year decisively rejected a proposal to constitutionally recognise Aboriginal and Torres Strait Island people. The vote was held amid a deeply divisive debate in the country, and amid fears that a misinformation campaign was influencing voters.\n\nThe board said two Facebook users separately posted screenshots showing partial information shared by the Australian Electoral Commission (AEC) on X (formerly Twitter).\n\nThe board said screenshots from the AEC posted by the Facebook users included the following language: “If someone votes at two different polling places within their electorate, and places their formal vote in the ballot box at each polling place, their vote is counted.”\n\nThey also show another comment that the secrecy of the ballot prevents the AEC from “knowing which ballot paper belongs to which person.”\n\nHowever, the screenshots did not show that voting multiple times is an offence in Australia, the board said.\n\nThe first Facebook user shared the screenshot with the accompanying caption: “Vote early, vote often, and vote NO.” The second user posted the same screenshot saying: “so you can vote multiple times … they are setting us up for a ‘rigging’ … smash the voting centres … it’s a No, No, No, No, No.”\n\nIn both cases, Meta proactively identified the posts, which were automatically sent for human review, the board said, adding that following human review, the posts were both removed.\n\nBoth users appealed Meta's decisions to remove their posts. In their statements to the board, both users claimed they were posting content from the AEC.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe board said these cases fall within its strategic priority of Elections and Civic Space.\n\nAs part of its decisions, the Board can issue policy recommendations to Meta. While recommendations are not binding, Meta must respond to them within 60 days.\n\nThere will be more scrutiny on social media firms this year as countries making up more than half of the world's population hold elections, including the U.S., India and Russia. Social media platforms such as Facebook and X have become more popular platforms for election campaigns around the world.\n\n(Reporting by Praveen Menon)",

        "content": "Earnings performances have perpetuated beliefs there are still \"haves and have not\" companies, according to Roundhill Investments Chief Strategy Officer Dave Mazza, who includes the Magnificent Seven components in his summary of fourth-quarter earnings winners.\n\nMazza joins Yahoo Finance to break down what he is seeing in earnings trends as tech stocks fly high on AI drivers.\n\n\"You can choose really two companies in any sector and say who's done it right and who's done it well, and really what investors are focusing here is on that efficiency,\" Mazza says. \"It's a sad thing to say, but companies that have embarked on layoffs are being rewarded by the market because it's improving their profit margins and the like.

Listen, earnings season rolls on, after the bell today. Disney, PayPal, just interested to get your thoughts on what you make of earnings season so far. You've seen about 70%, I think you have companies beat expectations. That is above the historical average, but what have been your big takeaways?\n\n- Yeah, earnings actually have been generally pretty good. I think investors are happy to see that we're out of this-- the earnings recession and the slump that we saw there, but we're still in an environment, to me, that is these haves and have nots, and that's something that-- a thesis that I've been talking about for some time, is that there's a select group of companies, some of this is the Magnificent Seven, and there's others in other sectors that are winners.\n\nAnd then the have nots are these losers. So for stock pickers or people looking to stay, let's take some risk and move back into areas that either had done well a few years ago, it's been challenged and we're seeing that in earnings season. Look at the bifurcation between Meta and Snap. You can choose, really, two companies in any sector and say, who's done it right and who's done it well? And really what investors are focusing here, is on that efficiency, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's kind of a sad thing to say, but companies that have embarked on layoffs are actually being rewarded by the market because it's improving their profit margins and the like. So to me, it's not clear that it's all clear on the earnings side, but we are seeing some companies really put up some strong numbers.\n\n- Although Snap is one that's cutting and maybe the market thinks it's not cutting it up. We've been sort of playing a fun parlor game that seems to be happening in the market right now, which is, is the Magnificent Seven still the Magnificent Seven and what's the new Fang or Mag Seven, or whatever you want to call it? Or, is it still just the Mag Seven?\n\n- Yeah, it's interesting. So it was FANG, then FANGM. And then more recently, Magnificent Seven. Now we're hearing Sensational Six, or keeping--\n\n- Dynamic Duo, I've heard that one.\n\n- Right? It's like, you know, now people are saying keep the Magnificent Seven because we kind of like it and then maybe swap out Tesla. But what's fascinating to me is, I actually went back and looked through time, Magnificent Seven as a term didn't exist in 2013. But I went back to Meta's IPO to measure this and if you look at the divergence, the average range between the best performing and the worst performing name out of the Magnificent Seven, there are some years where it's over-- on a rolling 12 month basis-- over 1,000%.\n\nNow some of that is Tesla's outsized gains. But also remember, Meta was in a huge slump for some time. There's been times where people have counted out Apple. So I'm not ready to give up at all on the Magnificent Seven, even including Tesla. Of course, time will tell, but these companies on average-- at least compared to the other 493, are showing high top line revenue growth, high strong margin growth. And in a market, which has this uncertainty, whether it's from commercial real estate or other areas, that's where investors are saying, hey, it's not so bad what I want to sell stocks. But if I'm going to buy, I'm going to stick to the mega caps.",

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 About to Hit 5,000: More Reasons for Further ETF Rally",
        "content": "On Wednesday, Wall Street rallied as investors analyzed a fresh wave of quarterly earnings reports, while the discussion regarding the timing of potential interest rate cuts remained a talk of the town.The Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed by 0.4%, equivalent to approximately 150 points, while the S&P 500 saw a notable increase of over 0.8%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite logged a significant uptick of nearly 1%. Notably, the S&P 500 achieved a closing milestone at 4,995, marking a new record high and positioning itself on the brink of breaching the 5,000 level for the first time in history.\n\nLet’s find out the factors that could boost S&P 500 ETFs even more.\n\nFed to Cut Rates by the End of 2024?\n\nDespite the market's speculation regarding potential interest rate cuts, Fed officials reiterated their cautious approach. Boston Fed President Susan Collins emphasized that rate cuts could be on the horizon \"later this year.\" However, the central bank would require additional evidence of inflation cooling before taking such actions. This stance underscores that the Fed is also weighing the options of rate cuts – a monetary policy stance investors are craving for.\n\nUpbeat Earnings, Especially from Magnificent Seven\n\nAbout two-thirds of S&P 500 firms are out with their earnings results this season. On average, these results have surpassed Wall Street expectations, contributing to the positive sentiment in the market. Notably, the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, NVIDIA NVDA, Meta Platforms META and Tesla TSLA, which account for almost 30% of the S&P 500 index, have come up with upbeat results this season.\n\nThese stocks were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023 and have been contributing to the S&P 500 rally this year as well. In fact, most experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise (read: Magnificent 7 ETFs Rise on Blockbuster Earnings).\n\nStory continues\n\nAI Boom to Continue\n\nIn 2023, numerous companies gained from the excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), but their performances have varied in 2024. Nvidia and Meta are at the forefront of the ongoing AI boom, whereas Tesla has fallen behind.\n\nThis gap has widened recently, following the release of financial results by almost all these companies. Meta's earnings report was especially positively received, causing the stock price of the social media behemoth to jump by more than 20% (read: Should You Buy Nvidia After Its Huge Run? ETFs in Focus).\n\nDividend Boosts by Some Heavyweight S&P 500 Companies\n\nDisney DIS announced a significant increase in its cash dividend by 50%, alongside the release of its fiscal first-quarter earnings report, which surpassed expectations. Meta also declared its first-ever dividend this reporting season. Meta Platforms said the dividend would be 50 cents per share. It also announced it had authorized an additional $50 billion in share repurchases.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nAgainst this upbeat backdrop, if you have faith in the potential market breadth of Wall Street, investors may track S&P 500 ETFs like Vanguard S&P 500 ETF VOO, iShares Core S&P 500 ETF IVV and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY.\n\nInvestors can also play the growth part of the index with SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG and the value part of the index with SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Value ETF SPYV. SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 High Dividend ETF Fund SPYD is a good bet for the dividend plays of the index.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best augmented reality stocks under $5. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the augmented reality industry, head directly to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5.\n\nAugmented reality technology is found in broad applications within entertainment, training, brand engagement, augmented surgeries, virtual tours, and quality control, among others. Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.\n\nThe AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the \"Vision Pro,\" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple's entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple's New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device's impressive interface, describing it as a \"magical way to control\" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro's debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple's history.\n\nNew entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years. The company anticipates generating $100 million to $150 million in revenue in 2024 and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025.\n\nAlthough the augmented reality market is dominated by tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), we discuss AR stocks under $5 in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a stock screener and filtered out augmented reality stocks that were under or close to $5 as of February 6.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best communication stocks to buy according to hedge funds. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the communication industry, head over to 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nIn 2023, the communication services sector experienced a remarkable year. The sector's success was partly a rebound from the previous year's lackluster performance and partly fueled by investor enthusiasm for artificial intelligence. Despite the strong showing in 2023, the communication services sector appears to have significant potential heading into 2024. By the end of 2023, valuations within the sector remained attractive, and positive shifts were observed in earnings estimates. Despite reaching record earnings and displaying momentum, stock prices in the sector had not yet returned to their previous peak levels.\n\nFitch Ratings' 2024 outlook for the North American Telecommunications and Cable sector remains neutral. The sector shows a divergence, with large wireless and tower operators expected to de-lever, while some telecom and cable operators face competitive and secular challenges, along with increased debt costs. The sector is viewed as relatively resilient due to the essential nature of broadband and connectivity services. Despite potential risks like consumers opting for lower-priced services, wireless subscriber growth is anticipated, supported by implemented price increases. Fitch projects modest revenue growth and improved free cash flow for the sector in 2024-2025, with EBITDA margins expected to slightly improve. The decline in 5G-related capital expenditures is anticipated to drive an overall increase in aggregate free cash flow, allowing certain operators to focus on debt reduction in 2024.\n\nAccording to PwC, the telecommunications industry is grappling with a strategic challenge akin to mature industries, facing increased data consumption but limited pricing power in commoditized services. Despite a threefold increase in global data consumption by 2027, revenues from internet access are expected to grow modestly at a 4% CAGR to $921.6 billion. Telecommunications companies face significant investment needs, projected to spend $342.1 billion in 2027, particularly with the ongoing transition to 5G. PwC's Global Telecom Outlook suggests that, amid cost-cutting efforts, telcos can explore growth in areas like IoT solutions, private 5G networks, home broadband, and tailored digital services for sectors like entertainment, healthcare, manufacturing, and mobility. Adapting to broader ecosystems is seen as a strategic imperative in this evolving industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the best communication stocks to invest in according to hedge funds include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose the top communication stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\nA skyscraper adorned with telecommunication equipment, symbolizing the industry.\n\nBest Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds\n\n12. SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 32\n\nSBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) owns and manages wireless communication infrastructure, including towers, buildings, rooftops, distributed antenna systems, and small cells. The company has communication sites spread across the Americas, Africa, and the Philippines. It is one of the top communication stocks to invest in.\n\nOn December 15, BMO raised its rating on SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) stock from Market Perform to Outperform. This shift is attributed to an appealing valuation for investors and a positive macroeconomic environment for tower REITs. Regarding valuation, SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) is currently traded at 18 times the estimated AFFO per share for 2024, representing what BMO perceives as a \"favorable opportunity to invest in a top-tier business with robust long-term growth potential.\"\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) was part of 32 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 42 in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 1.3 million shares worth $262.6 million.\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR), SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) is one of the best communication stocks to invest in.\n\nBaron Asset Fund made the following comment about SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We reduced our stake in long-term holding SBA Communications Corporation (NASDAQ:SBAC), which owns and operates cellular towers, on concerns that higher interest rates will increase its debt servicing costs and indications that its primary customers will spend less on upgrading their cellular networks.”\n\n11. Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 40\n\nFrontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR) delivers communication and technology services within the United States. Its offerings include data and Internet services, voice communication, video services, and other related services. It is one of the best communication stocks to buy.\n\nOn February 5, Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR) disclosed that it is carrying out a formal strategic review process. The review encompasses an examination of optimizing operational and financing strategies, evaluating strategic partnerships, joint ventures, divestitures, mergers, and business combinations. This strategic review was prompted by activist Jana Partners, who urged an immediate assessment and potential sale of the company. Jana believes that Frontier's low valuation and strong presence in the fiber broadband sector could make it appealing to wireless carriers and private-equity-owned assets in the industry.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 40 hedge funds were long Frontier Communications Parent, Inc. (NASDAQ:FYBR), compared to 39 funds in the prior funds. Matthew Barrett’s Glendon Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 24.2 million shares worth $379 million.\n\n10. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 43\n\nTwilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) offers software and communication solutions in the United States and internationally. The company runs a cloud communications platform for developers to construct, expand, and manage customer engagement within software applications. Established in 2008, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) is based in San Francisco, California. It is one of the top communication stocks to invest in.\n\nOn January 8, Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) revealed the appointment of a new CEO and provided optimistic projections for the upcoming quarter. The company anticipates that the fourth-quarter guidance, initially disclosed on November 8, will surpass expectations. Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) foresees adjusted earnings in the range of 53 to 57 cents per share, coupled with a revenue outlook between $1.03 billion and $1.04 billion.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 43 hedge funds were bullish on Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO), compared to 49 funds in the prior quarter. David Blood and Al Gore’s Generation Investment Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 8.6 million shares worth $505.6 million.\n\nAristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy made the following comment about Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) in its Q4 2022 investor letter:\n\n“We sold Twilio Inc. (NYSE:TWLO) and thereby reduced our subsector weight in software. The company reported a decent third quarter, but disappointed on fourth quarter 2022, full year 2023, and long-term guidance. The company is seeing macroeconomic headwinds and a slowdown spreading from technology, social media and cryptocurrency to retail and e-commerce. The other negative disclosure and a driver of this gross margin “miss” was that Twilio’s software sales are not accelerating at the rate that we expected. We are disappointed with this lower topline and low operating margin improvement guidance. The business transformation is taking longer than expected, and there is the heightened possibility that the new software growth could be stifled by more formidable competition as Twilio has made too many missteps.”\n\n9. AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52\n\nAT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) is a global provider of telecommunications and technology services. The company offers wireless communication services, sells devices, and provides a range of data services to businesses, government entities, wholesale customers, and residential customers. It is one of the best communication stocks, ranking 8th on our list.\n\nOn February 1, J.P. Morgan upgraded AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) based on expectations of sustained, long-term growth in both wireless and broadband segments. The primary source of growth is identified in AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T)’s broadband division, particularly through its ongoing fiber buildout, which is seen as creating additional opportunities within existing markets, according to J.P. Morgan analyst Richard Choe. The analyst increased his rating to Overweight from Neutral and raised the year-end price target to $21 from $18.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were bullish on AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), compared to 56 funds in the prior quarter. John Overdeck and David Siegel’s Two Sigma Advisors is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 22.6 million shares worth $340.7 million.\n\nMiller Value Income Strategy made the following comment about AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our third-largest holding at quarter end was AT&T Inc. (NYSE:T), a leading provider of communications and connectivity services in the US. At $15/share, the stock trades at the same price it did almost thirty years ago. The share price is much less interesting to us in relation to where it has traded in the past than in relation to how much cash the company generates and what management is doing with it. At just over 6x earnings, the stock trades near its lowest price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple ever, also representing close to its largest-ever P/E discount to the stock market. The business converts most of its earnings to free cash flow, implying a forward free cash flow yield north of 15%. Just under half of free cash flow is going toward the dividend (7.5% yield), while much of the balance is going to debt paydown. In other words, if the stock does not fall below its lowest-ever valuation, investors clip a rock-solid 7.5% in cash, while owning a growing portion of a very steady business as management reduces debt outstanding. A discounted cash flow model will suggest that intrinsic value for shares begins with a “2,” suggesting the stock is undervalued on an absolute basis. The lack of volatility in the underlying fundamentals also makes it unique when compared to many other things we own, which reduces the probability of permanent capital impairment and argues for a significant weight in the portfolio.\n\nAT&T looks particularly attractive when compared to some of the larger names dominating the S&P 500. Compare the stock to Apple, for instance, whose revenues and profits are likely to shrink this year, even as it trades at 29x this year’s earnings estimate. The ongoing return to rationality and capital accountability, along with extreme valuations in the megacap tech stocks, have us more excited about our portfolio’s prospects than we can remember for quite some time. As always, we remain the largest investors and welcome any questions or comments.”\n\n8. Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 52\n\nLiberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) is engaged in the communications sector. The company provides a range of services such as data, wireless, video, and voice to residential and business customers in Alaska. The company, incorporated in 2014, is headquartered in Englewood, Colorado. It is one of the best communication stocks to invest in.\n\nOn November 6, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) reported Q3 GAAP earnings per share of $1.10 and a revenue of $240 million, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $2.05 and $14.5 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 52 hedge funds were long Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), compared to 56 funds in the preceding quarter. Harris Associates is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 6.72 million shares worth $614.2 million.\n\nMadison Mid Cap Fund stated the following regarding Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The bottom five detractors for the quarter were Arch Capital Group, Liberty Broadband Corporation (NASDAQ:LBRDA), Brown & Brown, Markel Group, and CarMax. Shares of Liberty Broadband, a holding company with a large investment in cable operator Charter Communications, were weak in the quarter as internet subscriber trends continue to disappoint. While the competitive environment is currently tough, we believe it will improve over time. Cable’s technology infrastructure is demonstrably superior, in both cost and performance, to what some of the legacy telecommunications carriers are currently rolling out in the form of “fixed wireless” broadband. Thus, their potential subscriber base is limited to a segment of the population base. We believe it likely therefore that the carriers will soon be limited in the competition they provide to Charter.”\n\n7. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 60\n\nAmerican Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) is a leading global real estate investment trust that owns, constructs, and operates multitenant communications real estate. The company owns a massive portfolio of communications sites and data center facilities in the United States. American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) ranks 7th on our list of the best communication stocks.\n\nOn December 14, American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) declared a $1.70 per share quarterly dividend, a 4.9% increase from its prior dividend of $1.62. The dividend was paid to shareholders on February 1.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 60 hedge funds were bullish on American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), same as the prior quarter. Charles Akre’s Akre Capital Management is the biggest stakeholder of the company, with 6.7 million shares worth more than $1 billion.\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Early in 2023, we sold the majority of our position in American Tower Corporation (NYSE:AMT), a global operator of over 200,000 wireless towers, and even further reduced our modest position in the third quarter of 2023. We had concluded in late 2022 and early 2023 that growth expectations were too high given forthcoming headwinds from significantly higher financing costs (20%-plus exposure to floating rate debt), upcoming debt maturities, continued payment shortfalls from a key tenant in India, foreign exchange headwinds, and a reduction in mobile carrier capital expenditures.\n\nFollowing a sharp decline in American Tower’s shares in the first nine months of 2023, we began rebuilding our position because we believed that the company’s shares had become more attractively valued, growth headwinds were better understood, and the potential monetization event of its India business would ultimately be value accretive to its business. Further, we believe that 2023 will mark the trough in earnings growth for American Tower and growth should reaccelerate in the next few years.”\n\n6. Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 61\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) offers communication, technology, information, and entertainment services globally. The company operates through two segments – Verizon Consumer Group and Verizon Business Group. On January 23, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) reported Q4 non-GAAP earnings per share of $1.08, in-line with Wall Street estimates. The revenue of $35.1 billion outperformed market expectations by $550 million. Verizon achieved a total of 413,000 new broadband connections, marking the fifth consecutive quarter in which the company reported over 400,000 additions to its broadband customer base.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 61 hedge funds were bullish on Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), compared to 53 funds in the earlier quarter. Paul Marshall and Ian Wace’s Marshall Wace LLP is the biggest position holder in the company, with a stake worth $218 million.\n\nVerizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) ranks 6th on our list of the best communication stocks. Other hedge fund favorites include Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), T-Mobile US, Inc. (NASDAQ:TMUS), and Charter Communications, Inc. (NASDAQ:CHTR).\n\nAriel Global Fund made the following comment about Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“By comparison, global communications and technology leader, Verizon Communications Inc. (NYSE:VZ), continued to weigh on performance following an article in the Wall Street Journal outlining concerns on lead cable lines posing a significant public health threat. Although the lead covered cable lines remain an overhang on shares, we find Verizon’s valuation to be compelling. The company delivered a solid earnings report, with subscriber and financial metrics in-line or ahead of consensus. Management also reiterated full year guidance and noted it may exceed its outlook for free-cash-flow. From a competitive and financial standpoint, we view Verizon to be among one of the best positioned telecoms in the world. Looking forward, we expect free cash flow to grow significantly in the years ahead as the company moves past the secular peak in 5G capital spending.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n15 Biggest Agriculture Stocks in 2024 Dorsal Capital Partners Sees a 13% Boost in 2023: Its Top 15 Stock Picks 10 Best Stocks To Invest In 2024 For Beginners\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best Communication Stocks To Buy According To Hedge Funds is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Stock's On An Uptrend: Are Strong Financials Guiding The Market?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 46% over the last three months. Given the company's impressive performance, we decided to study its financial indicators more closely as a company's financial health over the long-term usually dictates market outcomes. Specifically, we decided to study Meta Platforms'  ROE in this article.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. In other words, it is a profitability ratio which measures the rate of return on the capital provided by the company's shareholders.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nThe formula for ROE is:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n26% = US$39b ÷ US$153b (Based on the trailing twelve months to December 2023).\n\nThe 'return' is the yearly profit. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.26 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nWe have already established that ROE serves as an efficient profit-generating gauge for a company's future earnings. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming all else is equal, companies that have both a higher return on equity and higher profit retention are usually the ones that have a higher growth rate when compared to companies that don't have the same features.\n\nA Side By Side comparison of Meta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 26% ROE\n\nTo begin with, Meta Platforms has a pretty high ROE which is interesting. Secondly, even when compared to the industry average of 11% the company's ROE is quite impressive. Probably as a result of this, Meta Platforms was able to see a decent net income growth of 9.4% over the last five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext, on comparing with the industry net income growth, we found that Meta Platforms' growth is quite high when compared to the industry average growth of 6.2% in the same period, which is great to see. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is an important metric to consider when valuing a stock. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. By doing so, they will have an idea if the stock is headed into clear blue waters or if swampy waters await. Is META fairly valued? This infographic on the company's intrinsic value  has everything you need to know.\n\nIs Meta Platforms Using Its Retained Earnings Effectively?\n\nSummary\n\nOn the whole, we feel that Meta Platforms' performance has been quite good. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings are expected to accelerate.

        "content": "Technology is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the stock market. With implications like generative AI and quantum computing having implications in sectors ranging from retail to healthcare, it is no wonder that investors are always looking for the next big disruptive tech company to invest in. Of course, despite the explosive growth and popularity of AI, it can be difficult to pinpoint a good investment due to this sector’s recent surge in valuation. With so many companies hitting all-time highs and beating sector median P/E ratio valuations, many investors have become hesitant to enter an already overvalued market. This has led to this list of undervalued tech stocks to buy.\n\nFurthermore, with so many complex parts in the tech industry such as learning how semiconductors work, understanding cloud software, to a range of other sectors, it can be difficult for even the most intelligent investors to find promising companies amidst walls of complex terminology and information.

As such, it is expanding out to investors and has recently signed deals to bring its services to 25 additional cities and therefore grow its customer base. This makes it one of those undervalued tech stocks to buy.\n\nWith a forward PEG ratio of 1.29x compared to the sector median of 1.65x, Alphabet stands relatively undervalued compared to its competitors when we consider its earnings growth potential over the next year. Analysts expect EPS to grow at over 16% for next year which showcases the company’s growth prospects. As this well-known tech giant recovers from its dropoff early last year, investors should all consider scooping a few Alphabet shares before this stock’s valuation loses its attractiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a company that focuses on social media and technology, offering platforms where people can communicate online. The stock is up over 140% in the past year with an average 1-year Yahoo Finance analyst price target of $475.96, far above the current share price of around $450.\n\nThe company recently had an earnings report on February 1 of this year and reported an EPS of $5.33, which beat expectations by $0.36. With a revenue of $40.11 billion, it also beat revenue expectations by over $940 million. This highlights how even with concerns over Zuckerberg’s MMA fighting, the company is still more than thriving.\n\nTaking a look at its valuation, Meta has a PEG ratio of 0.44x compared to the sector median of 0.86x. Thus, Meta is relatively undervalued compared to its competitors when we consider its earnings growth potential. With EPS expected to grow at over 34% next year, the company has explosive potential to continue growing with the AI boom into 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the largest semiconductor manufacturer and plays a vital role throughout the tech industry. It is the backbone of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, making chips for some of the largest companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, it has a market cap of $472 billion. Yahoo Finance analysts project a one-year range of $100-$133, with an average price of $120.\r\n\r\nThe semiconductor industry is valued at around $570 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. One of the main ways TSMC intends to capitalize on this growth is by expanding its foundries throughout the globe. Its plans to develop sites in both Arizona and Germany marks its first ventures outside Asia.\n\nTSMC currently has a P/E ratio of around 23.1x, mostly aligning with industry standards. While this valuation may not be the most undervalued, given TSMC’s continued average earnings growth of around 23.6% and its rapid stock increase driven by demand from AI, this valuation puts Taiwan Semiconductor as an exception tech pick for this month.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Reasons to Sell Nvidia, Wall Street's Hottest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock",
        "content": "For the past three decades, there have been no shortages of next-big-thing investment trends to captivate the attention of Wall Street and investors. Everything from the advent of the internet to game-changing applications such as genome mapping has changed the course of innovation.\n\nAt the moment, there's no next-big-thing investment trend hotter than artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nAI involves using software and systems to oversee tasks that would generally be handled by humans. What makes AI such a game changer is machine learning, which allows these systems to \"learn\" over time and become more efficient at their tasks. AI has applications in virtually every sector and industry, which is likely why the researchers at PwC believe it can add up to $15.7 trillion to global gross domestic product by 2030. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia is the face of the artificial intelligence revolution\n\nThough there are dozens of publicly traded companies that can benefit from the AI revolution, none has been a hotter commodity for investors than semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nThe company has rapidly become the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement. Its A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) allow for split-second decisions to be made by AI systems in high-compute data centers. In July, analysts at Citigroup opined that Nvidia could account for \"at least 90%\" of AI-accelerated data-center GPU share.\n\nIt's an especially exciting time for Nvidia, given that its production of A100 and H100 chips should meaningfully grow in the current calendar year (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January). Specifically, a sizable ramp up in chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity by chip-fab giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing should help Nvidia meet more of its customers' demands in fiscal 2025.\n\nThe proof is in the pudding that Nvidia has been the AI stock to own. Shares have surged a whopping 367% and added well over $1.3 trillion in market value since the start of 2023. Nvidia's sales are expected to climb from a reported $27 billion in fiscal 2023 to an estimated $93.7 billion by the end of fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet despite this jaw-dropping ascent, all I see are a growing number of reasons Nvidia will disappoint investors. Though the company's stock has proven me wrong thus far, here are seven reasons to sell Wall Street's hottest artificial intelligence stock.\n\n1. Nvidia is about to become its own worst enemy\n\nPerhaps one of the most logical reasons to sell shares of Nvidia is the irony that increasing output of its A100 and H100 chips will almost certainly weigh on its gross margin.\n\nDuring the first half of Nvidia's fiscal 2024, the company's cost of revenue declined as data center sales soared. What this tells investors is that the entirety of Nvidia's data center gains were derived from a substantial increase in pricing power predicated by AI-focused GPU scarcity. Even by the end of the company's fiscal third quarter, the cost of revenue had risen only modestly on a year-over-year basis.\n\nWith Nvidia now able to meet more of its customers' demands, the price of its A100 and H100 chips will fall. Although revenue is undoubtedly headed higher, we've likely seen a peak in the company's gross margin.\n\n2. External competition is heating up\n\nThis probably goes without saying, but Nvidia's overwhelming success in high-compute data centers will encourage aggressive competition from businesses itching to get their piece of the pie.\n\nIn June, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) introduced its MI300X AI-GPU, which will be a direct competitor to Nvidia. AMD CEO Lisa Su views these AI-accelerating chips as a more than $150 billion addressable opportunity by 2027. Though AMD launched the MI300X last year, it'll really begin ramping up production in 2024.\n\nLikewise, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) plans to go head-to-head with Nvidia. This past December, Intel introduced its Gaudi3 generative AI software chip, which is expected to ship sometime this year. Gaudi3 will be a direct competitor to Nvidia's H100 chip. In other words, Nvidia's days as the lone wolf in AI-accelerated data centers are over.\n\n3. Internal competition is ramping up, too\n\nPerhaps what's even more worrisome than external competition is that many of Nvidia's biggest customers have ambitions of developing AI-accelerated chips of their own.\n\nFor example, social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is one of Nvidia's largest customers by total revenue. Meta, which has its sights set on becoming a key player in virtual and augmented reality, intends to deploy a second-generation version of an in-house AI-GPU chip into its data centers this year. In-house developed infrastructure is designed to lessen Meta's reliance on Nvidia over time.\n\nSimilarly, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), which is Nvidia's largest customer by total revenue, unveiled its own custom AI chip for large language models (LLMs) last year. Microsoft's Azure Maia AI chip will compete directly with Nvidia's H100 GPUs targeted at generative AI software. Like Meta, Microsoft's in-house-developed AI chips are being launched in 2024.\n\n4. Regulatory restrictions put a ceiling on Nvidia's growth potential\n\nA fourth reason to sell shares of Nvidia is the increasing pressure the company is facing from U.S. regulators.\n\nIn response to initially announced export restrictions of AI-driven GPUs to China, Nvidia developed slower versions of its top chips. The company's goal with its A800 and H800 chips was to capture billions of dollars in preorder demand from China, which is a key market for the company's success.\n\nIn October 2023, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced a second round of export curbs that would restrict the specifically developed A800 and H800 chips to China. Although Nvidia isn't the only chip developer impacted by these export restrictions, they could ultimately cost the hottest name in AI billions of dollars in potential sales each quarter. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n5. Insiders aren't buying -- why should you?\n\nAnother reason to steer clear of Nvidia or bid its stock adieu is that executives and board members have done nothing but sell their shares for more than three years.\n\nTo be fair, there are a lot of reasons for insiders to sell stock, and some of them are completely benign. For example, options have to be exercised within a defined time frame, otherwise they expire. Executives and directors may receive a significant portion of their compensation in stock and stock options. Shares may be regularly sold to have capital handy to cover their federal tax bills.\n\nBut there's only one reason insiders buy stock: They believe shares are undervalued. No insider has purchased shares of Nvidia stock since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress added a mere 200 shares in December 2020. If insiders won't buy, why should you?\n\n6. History isn't on its side\n\nNvidia and the artificial intelligence movement are also squaring off against history, which is thus far undefeated.\n\nAs I pointed out earlier, there have been an assortment of next-big-thing trends that have garnered plenty of attention on Wall Street over the past 30 years. Unfortunately, every single one of these trends endured an early-stage bubble. This is to say that the uptake or acceptance of new innovations or technologies didn't match investors' lofty expectations.\n\nWhile many of these next-big-thing trends worked out well for select businesses over the long run, the short term can be bumpy. AI is unlikely to be an exception to what's seemingly the rule. NVDA Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\n7. It's priced for perfection in an imperfect industry\n\nLast but not least, Nvidia is priced for perfection in an industry that's full of unknowns.\n\nBased on Wall Street's cash-flow consensus for fiscal 2024 (the company has yet to release its fourth-quarter operating results), Nvidia is valued at a jaw-dropping 63X cash flow. It's also trading at 90X trailing-12-month cash flow. It's almost hard to believe that Nvidia was regularly valued at less than 20X cash flow as recently as 2014, 2015, and 2018.\n\nGiven the factors described above, I'd expect gross margin erosion to take shape in fiscal 2025 and for increasing external and internal competition to lower Nvidia's sales ceiling and taper its growth rate.\n\nThere are considerably smarter ways to take advantage of the AI revolution than buying or holding Nvidia stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The layoffs are coming even as executives post robust revenue and earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the magnitude of the current bout of layoffs has not matched the dramatic cuts of 2023, the announcements have come relentlessly. In January, Google (GOOG, GOOGL) laid off hundreds of workers to trim costs and refocus on its business priorities. Amazon (AMZN) eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios, as well as more than 500 people at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch. Earlier this week, Snap (SNAP) cut 10% of its staff. And on Wednesday, Bloomberg reported that Tesla (TSLA) workers are bracing for potential cuts after managers were asked if their employees’ positions are critical. Meta, one of Big Tech's leading stocks, added $197 billion last Friday to its market capitalization, the biggest single-session market value addition, according to Bloomberg data. (AP Photo/Thibault Camus, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nSimilar to last year, a copycat dynamic among companies built momentum and offered ready-made justification for subsequent layoffs. Wall Street celebrated the steep cuts of major players like Amazon and Meta (META), whose stocks over the past six months have risen 18% and 44%, respectively. While employers and recruiters have emphasized that major layoffs can leave remaining staff with the workloads of multiple jobs and create morale problems,some executives see productivity stretching to meet the moment.\n\nDuring Meta’s earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed how his company’s hiring pace is on a new, minimalist trajectory.“My operating assumption is that we will also try to keep it relatively minimal because I think that — until we reach a point where we’re just really underwater on our ability to execute, I kind of want to keep things lean because I think that’s the right thing for us to do culturally,” he said.\n\nIn part due to Meta’s boosted efficiency, shares have popped more than 15% since then.\n\nThe moves to appease Wall Street, which often cheers the firing of people, could backfire. Cutbacks spark fear among staff and leave remaining workers with the burden of doing more with less. Layoffs can also damage a company's reputation, as they signal to employees and potential recruits that staffers are disposable and that the penalty of management decisions falls on workers, rather than the executives in charge.\n\nDespite the recent bout of high-profile layoffs, however, broader labor market data show resilience. Tech companies added nearly 18,000 workers last month, and job postings for open positions recorded a rebound, according to CompTIA, a nonprofit association for the tech industry. And the unemployment rate for tech occupations was 2.3%, the data show, compared to the national unemployment rate of 3.7%.\n\n“The fact that investors have rewarded companies for recent job cuts is likely a signal that they view those moves as strategic shifts that may lead to greater profits and not a sign of concern for company performance,” said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

Wall Street celebrated the steep cuts of major players like Amazon and Meta (META), whose stocks over the past six months have risen 18% and 44%, respectively.\n\nEmployers and recruiters have emphasized that major layoffs can leave remaining staff with the workloads of multiple jobs and create morale problems. But some executives see productivity stretching to meet the moment.\n\nDuring Meta’s earnings call last week, CEO Mark Zuckerberg expressed how his company’s hiring pace is on a new, minimalist trajectory.“My operating assumption is that we will also try to keep it relatively minimal because I think that — until we reach a point where we’re just really underwater on our ability to execute, I kind of want to keep things lean, because I think that’s the right thing for us to do culturally,” he said.\n\nIn part due to Meta’s boosted efficiency, shares have popped more than 15% since then.\n\nThe moves to appease Wall Street, which often cheers the firing of people, could backfire. Cutbacks spark fear among staff and leave remaining workers with the burden of doing more with less. Layoffs can also damage a company's reputation, as they signal to employees and potential recruits that staffers are disposable and that the penalty of management decisions falls on workers, rather than on the executives in charge.\n\nDespite the recent bout of high-profile layoffs, however, broader labor market data show resilience. Tech companies added nearly 18,000 workers last month, and job postings for open positions recorded a rebound, according to CompTIA, a nonprofit association for the tech industry. And the unemployment rate for tech occupations was 2.3%, the data show, compared with the national unemployment rate of 3.7%.\n\n“The fact that investors have rewarded companies for recent job cuts is likely a signal that they view those moves as strategic shifts that may lead to greater profits and not a sign of concern for company performance,” said Cory Stahle, an economist at Indeed Hiring Lab.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "The EU is throwing its weight around the business world",
        "content": "The European Union is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data, social media content, and the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers. And it has readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe actions are raising the stakes for how companies operate both inside and outside the EU. Just last month, EU opposition to a union of two American tech companies — Amazon (AMZN) and robot vacuum maker iRobot (IRBT) — was enough for the firms to call off their $1.4 billion merger.

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nResistance from the EU was also enough to persuade Silicon Valley-based Photoshop maker Adobe to give up on plans to acquire San Francisco-based web-based design platform Figma and motivate US biotech giant Illumina to sell off a cancer-screening company called Grail.\n\nBig companies in the US and across the globe now face a critical decision: Do they adjust the way they make products and provide services to the EU’s more aggressive laws, or bet that more lenient regulations will take hold in other countries where they operate?\n\n'The Brussels effect'\n\nSome giant companies that operate globally aren’t willing to take the chance of tiptoeing around the EU, which remains the world’s third-largest economy and is home to roughly 450 million people.\n\n\"We've seen businesses say, ‘I'm going to build my products, my widgets, my service, to align with the most restrictive guidelines and not have different jurisdictional approaches,'\" Jordan Fischer, a lecturer on cross-border information governance at the University of California Berkeley and partner at Constangy.\n\nThis pressure to adopt the EU’s version of business compliance even outside its jurisdiction is growing, though isn't new. It's known as \"the Brussels effect,\" a term coined in 2012 by Columbia Law School professor Anu Bradfordto to describe how the EU's aggressive legislation exerts “unprecedented and deeply underestimated global power.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBrussels, in Belgium, is considered the unofficial capital of the EU.

(Bosca78 via Getty Images)\n\n\"Companies with customers, or hopes of future business, in the EU decide to comply with the regulations in order to be able to continue selling into the EU, and interacting with potential EU consumers,\" said Meredith Kolsky Lewis, director of cross-border legal studies at University at Buffalo School of Law.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US.\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell even though that industrial union had received approval in the US. In 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions. GE Chairman and CEO John Welch, left, and Honeywell Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore, right, shake hands during a press conference in 2000 where GE agreed to acquire Honeywell. The firms eventually called off the deal due to EU opposition.

The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations of companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) , Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\n\"Where regulation like the GDPR has the biggest effect — it's actually outside of Europe, in countries in the developing world,\" said Charles Kenny, an economist and senior fellow at the Washington think tank Center for Global Development.\n\n“And I think that's sad. I think it's something that European rule makers and regulators tend not to take into account.\"\n\nIn response to tech regulations that include GDPR, which Kenny said made no exceptions for startups, a group of African Union nations formed an alliance to advocate for rules more friendly to entrepreneurs in poor nations like Sierra Leone and Ghana.\n\n\"It's not a big problem for the Googles of the world, or the Facebooks of the world, to comply. It is a big problem for small tech startups,\" Kenny said, adding that he agrees that certain levels of regulation are needed.\n\n\"I worry the same might happen with these AI regulations.\"\n\nThe EU does intend to apply new legal restraints around artificial intelligence this year after EU members last week signaled their agreement on the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate AI.\n\nThe new rules will focus on uses of AI technology and classify how heavily they are regulated depending on how risky the application is, with facial recognition and certain medical innovations requiring approval before being made available to customers.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US, and it’s unknown whether that will happen.\n\nThe combination of the added tech regulations from the EU and confusion within the US as to its own intentions means more uncertainty and further complexity for global businesses, Lewis said.\n\nDespite the hard line that the EU has taken with its tech laws, Fischer said there is reason for companies to hope that the EU and the US will come into greater alignment. She pointed to a framework concluded with the US this year known as the Trade and Technology Council.\n\n\"I think that makes a lot of companies breathe a little bit easier. Not easy. But easier,\" Fischer said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Meta Platforms and Albemarle have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 8, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Meta Platforms META as the Bull of the Day and Albemarle Corp. ALB as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on MercadoLibre MELI, StoneCo STNE and Amazon AMZN.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks.\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nA member of the beloved ‘Magnificent 7,’ Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders handsomely, up an astounding 30% just in 2024. The stock sports the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with expectations moving considerably higher across the board.\n\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the company resides in the Zacks Internet – Software industry, which is currently ranked in the top 38% of all Zacks industries. Aside from the favorable industry standing and positive earnings outlook, let’s take a closer look at how Meta currently stacks up.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nSince finding a bottom in early October of 2022, Meta shares have been on an absolute tear, adding nearly 420% on the back of robust quarterly results. As shown below, shares have consistently enjoyed post-earnings positivity.\n\nDigging deeper into the quarterly performance, Meta has delivered some sizable beats as of late, exceeding the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by an average of nearly 20% across its last four releases. Revenue results have also been positive, with the company posting double-digit percentage Y/Y growth in three consecutive releases.\n\nShares aren’t overly expensive given the company’s forecasted growth, with the current 25.7X forward earnings multiple (F1) beneath five-year highs of 31.5X and comparing favorably to the respective Zacks industry average of 38.1X.\n\nConsensus expectations for its current year suggest 30% earnings growth on 17% higher sales, with FY25 earnings and revenue forecasted to see growth of 15% and 13.6%, respectively. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncome-focused investors seeking technology exposure could soon be interested – Meta unveiled its first-ever dividend following its latest print, which is payable on March 26th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22nd.\n\nSeveral other notable highlights coming from its latest set of quarterly results include an additional $50 billion in share buybacks and the company’s operating margin moving well higher to 41% vs. 20% in the same period last year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\n\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nMeta Platforms would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nAlbemarle Corp. is a global leader in providing essential elements for mobility, energy, connectivity, and health. Analysts have taken their earnings expectations lower over the last several months, pushing the stock into an unfavorable Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell).\n\nIn addition, the company currently resides in the Zacks Chemical – Diversified industry, which is currently ranked in the bottom 10% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a closer look at a few other aspects of the company.\n\nAlbemarle\n\nShares have had a rough showing over the past year, down more than 50% and widely underperforming relative to the S&P 500. Recent quarterly prints haven’t supported shares much, moving lower post-earnings in back-to-back releases.\n\nConcerning its latest quarterly release, the company fell short of the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate by nearly 26% and posted sales 3.4% below expectations. Falling lithium prices have stunted ALB’s growth.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the company is scheduled to reveal its next set of results on February 14th after the market’s close. Analysts have taken revenue expectations lower along with earnings expectations, with the $2.3 billion expected down nearly 7% since last November.\n\nThe unfavorable price action has boosted ALB’s yield, with shares now paying out 1.4% annually paired with a sustainable 8% payout ratio. Albemarle has also shown a nice commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders, currently carrying a 2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nBottom Line\n\nNegative earnings estimate revisions from analysts stemming from falling lithium prices paint a challenging picture for the company’s shares in the near term.\n\nAlbemarle is a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), indicating that analysts have taken a bearish stance on the company’s earnings outlook.\n\nFor those seeking strong stocks, a great idea would be to focus on stocks carrying a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) – these stocks sport a notably stronger earnings outlook paired with the potential to deliver explosive gains in the near term.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nDo Not Fight This Market! 3 Top-Ranked Stocks to Join the Rally\n\nAfter such a strong finish in 2023 and follow through at the start of 2024, investors are wondering when the correction is coming. While it is natural to expect some sort of pull-back I think investors would be best off not trying to predict, and instead continue buying top-ranked stocks.\n\nFurthermore, there are many powerful investment themes keeping the markets bid, including a robust economy, exciting technological developments, and tremendous government spending deficits. That last item is definitely worth considering when wondering when the economy is going to slow down.\n\nBecause of the massive spending behind the most recent infrastructure bill, where more than $1 trillion is going to be spent, many laid off workers are likely to be soaked up by the public sector, and spending to continue.\n\nBased on these influential economic developments, investors should focus on continuing to buy leading stocks with top Zacks ranks, because a major economic slowdown is becoming less and less likely.\n\nHere I will share three stocks with top Zacks ranks, and market beating performance over the last month. I particularly like to look for stocks showing relative strength while the market continues to grind higher.\n\nMercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre is the Latin-American version of Amazon, building an e-commerce platform that continues to boom in popularity. MercadoLibre has been one of the most exciting stocks in the last few years and its returns continue to delight investors willing to own shares.\n\nIn addition to a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating, reflecting upward trending earnings revisions, the company is forecasting impressive growth in sales and earnings.\n\nThis year, sales are expected to climb 36% YoY to $14.3 billion, while EPS are set to expand 134% to $22.30 per share. That growth is projected to continue on to the next year as well, with sales expected to grow 22.3% the following year, and EPS to increase 57.6%.\n\nIn addition to the fundamental developments in MercadoLibre, its technical advances are compelling as well. In addition to relative strength against the market, it has been forming a very nice technical trade pattern to measure a breakout trade from.\n\nFor investors waiting for a technical signal to enter MELI, a move above $1764 would market a clean breakout from this bullish consolidation.\n\nStoneCo\n\nStoneCo is a Brazilian financial technology company specializing in payment processing solutions. Founded in 2012, StoneCo provides a range of services, including electronic payments, credit card processing, and point-of-sale technology for businesses of varying sizes.\n\nStoneCo has seen earnings estimates steadily trend higher over the last 10 months, giving it a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating. Additionally, the company is entering a period where EPS are expected to expand significantly. Earnings are forecast to grow 167% YoY this year, and 36.1% next year.\n\nLike MercadoLibre, StoneCo stock is forming a convincing technical pattern. STNE stock was hit hard at the end of 2022 and traded sideways at a depressed level for nearly two years.\n\nHowever, at the end of 2023, the stock initiated a stage one breakout, indicating investors had been buying the depressed stock. Now over the last two months, STNE price action has built out a weekly bull flag, leading me to believe another big breakout is coming.\n\nIf STNE stock trades above the $18.50 level, investors could rush in to buy the stock sending it significantly higher.\n\nAmazon.com\n\nFinally, one of the world's leading companies, Amazon just reported an incredibly strong quarter of financials sending the stock much higher.\n\nFollowing the earnings gap up, Amazon stock is forming a post earnings consolidation, a very high probability trading setup. Above $171 and AMZN should make a run at its all-time high.\n\nAmazon has also been garnering interest from analysts, who have been steadily upgrading earnings estimates. Current quarter earnings have been revised higher by 22% and current quarter earnings by 12.5%.\n\nEarnings at the e-commerce and technology giant are expected to grow by an impressive 28.1% annually over the next 3-5 years, driven by its AWS and new advertising business segments.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe great thing about investing in stocks is that the best ones offer tremendous asymmetric opportunities. There is no reason to try and predict market selloffs, because so long as you focus on buying top-tier securities, the returns take care of themselves. That is not to say that risk management isn’t key, but good investors are often optimists.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "META, AMZN, MSFT: Which Stock Is Best after Their Magnificent Earnings?",
        "content": "The so-called Magnificent Seven have pulled the curtain on their earnings results. Though most Magnificent Seven members clocked in some magnificent quarters, there was one EV maker that delivered results that can only be described as less-than-magnificent. In any case, this piece will focus on a trio of Magnificent Seven members (META, AMZN, and MSFT) that stepped up to the plate and swung one out of the ballpark, sparking an impressive rally alongside a wave of analyst price target upgrades.\n\nTherefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to check in with the three aforementioned stocks that delivered and could continue to do so in the year ahead, thanks in part to a bit of help from their growing stake in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)\n\nMeta Platforms delivered the most impressive quarterly results this earnings season, sparking one of the biggest single-day rallies in the company’s history. Undoubtedly, Meta stock’s more than 20% surge represented the largest-ever single-day market cap gain of $204.5 billion. Put that one in the record books.\n\nWith a fresh dividend, AI tailwinds at its back, and the wildcard of its Reality Labs business, many analysts on Wall Street see the red-hot stock climbing even higher as it enters its dividend-paying era. All things considered, I find it hard to be any less bullish following the latest spike.\n\nIn fact, Morgan Stanley seems to think Meta is a stock to keep buying after its blowout earnings results. The company’s new AI tools are just one of the drivers that has the bank staying bullish. In a prior piece, I highlighted the potential of ad automation tool Advantage+ and its ability to give the ad business a real shot in the arm.\n\nJust because Meta is maturing, with a dividend to pay (0.44% yield at writing), does not mean it’s steering off the growth track. If anything, Meta may be the most exciting Magnificent Seven member, given how effectively Mark Zuckerberg and his team have turned a corner following its “Year of Efficiency.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAs the company moves into a year (or should I say decade) of AI, the stock certainly seems too cheap at 23.7 times forward price-to-earnings, far below most Magnificent Seven members. The lowest-hanging fruit may have been picked amid last year’s efficiency push, but don’t expect management to settle into cruise mode as it looks to pull ahead in the so-called AI race while keeping up with peers in the virtual- and augmented-reality scene.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of META Stock?\n\nMeta stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 38 Buys, two Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average META stock price target of $522.00 implies 11.2% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAmazon stock has also been riding higher following its own slate of quarterly earnings results. The numbers were exceptional, helping power shares more than 7% higher in a single trading session. With new all-time highs in sight (around 8% away), plenty of AI rally fuel, and a strong holiday season in the books, analysts seem right on the money to stay bullish on the stock post-earnings.\n\nLike Meta, Amazon wants to equip advertisers with the right tools. With the firm launching new privacy tools in the European market while starting ads (and a paid option to eliminate them) on its streaming service Prime Video, it seems positioned to make a growing dent in the ad market.\n\nIndeed, Amazon’s many Prime users will not be happy to have to view ads as they enjoy their paid Prime content. And though some may question the value proposition of being a Prime member (have the perks added up, or only the price hikes?), the consumer will speak with their money. For now, Prime looks sticky enough to not shed too many users due to the inclusion of ads on Prime Video.\n\nCombine AI tools with ads, and it’s no mystery as to why RBC Capital views Amazon as one of its top tech picks (one of the others is Meta) to play the digital ad market in the new year. I think they’re right to praise the company as it looks to go above and beyond just being an e-commerce and cloud retailer.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of AMZN Stock?\n\nAmazon stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with unanimous 40 Buys assigned in the past three months. The average AMZN stock price target of $207.72 implies 21.8% upside potential.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft also stood tall following its earnings report, with investors impressed by the company’s AI muscles. In many ways, Microsoft is still the AI stock to own for those who prefer to bet on software over hardware. While Microsoft is poised to gain some skin in the AI chip game, the company still remains a software titan that’s likely to continue having its way with rivals.\n\nWith a Super Bowl ad for its AI software CoPilot ready to go, it will be interesting to see where adoption of the Microsoft ecosystem goes from here as more are drawn in by its impressive AI capabilities. It’s hard not to be bullish, even with shares at fresh highs and a trailing price-to-earnings multiple now well above 35 times.\n\nApart from AI, Microsoft seems to be opening up its Xbox gaming ecosystem by sharing plans to bring its Xbox-exclusive games over to its rival console, PlayStation. Indeed, such a move could curb demand for its console while also dealing a heavy blow to the so-called “console wars.”\n\nThat said, by expanding the total addressable market for its games, I view the move as a net positive, even if it rubs some Xbox gamers the wrong way. If the friendly gesture is reciprocated by Sony (the firm behind PlayStation), the move could be a net positive for both console combatants as more emphasis is placed on growth in software.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of MSFT Stock?\n\nMicrosoft stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 32 Buys, one Hold, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. The average MSFT stock price target of $469.45 implies 13.4% upside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks could continue higher if they continue smashing quarterly earnings this year. Undoubtedly, AI could be the magic that helps them keep pulling rabbits out of hats come future earnings seasons. Of the trio, analysts see the most upside (21.8%) in AMZN stock.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Netflix Stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) Reigns Supreme in the Streaming Kingdom",
        "content": "Netflix stock (NASDAQ:NFLX) is reigning supreme in the steaming kingdom, with its most recent results showcasing sustained industry dominance. Boasting over 260 million paid members, the streaming giant keeps posting robust growth in revenues and earnings despite the industry suffering from oversaturation. In fact, improved profitability has enabled management to return significant capital to shareholders, boosting the stock’s appeal. I believe this trend is set to be sustained. Thus, I am bullish on NFLX stock.\n\nSubscriber Growth Accelerates Against All Odds\n\nNetflix continues to astound with its remarkable ability to consistently attract paid subscribers, even with the fierce competition in the saturated streaming and social media landscape. In an era where tech and media giants fight for consumers’ attention, the company’s sustained subscriber growth is nothing short of astonishing.\n\nThink about this for a minute. The streaming and social media space is more saturated than ever, with numerous players battling for viewers’ precious watch time. Initially, Netflix dominated the space, primarily facing off against outdated cable networks. However, the dynamics have shifted, and Netflix now contends with a multitude of streaming services, including Disney’s (NYSE:DIS) Disney+, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Video Service, AT&T’s (NYSE:T) HBO, Hulu, Peacock, and various smaller players.\n\nMoreover, Netflix faces competition in the “attention economy” from tech giants like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL), YouTube, TikTok, and Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) Reels. They all strive to capture market share in viewership to increase their advertising revenues. In fact, TikTok’s and Reels’ focus on promoting both short-form and long-form views and even producing shows on their own is proof of their competition with Netflix.\n\nDespite these challenges, Netflix maintains a robust subscriber base, and its paid subscriber growth has even accelerated in recent quarters, including in its latest Q4 results. To illustrate, here are Netflix’s quarterly paid subscriber growth rates over the past two years.\n\nStory continues\n\nQ1 2022: 6.7% Q2 2022: 5.5% Q3 2022: 4.5% Q4 2022: 4.0% Q1 2023: 4.9% Q2 2023: 8.0% Q3 2023: 10.8% Q4 2023: 12.8%\n\nThese figures vividly depict a moderation in paid subscriber acquisition throughout 2022, following the unprecedented surge in subscribers over the preceding two years. The widespread stay-at-home trend during the pandemic fueled remarkable growth in 2020 and 2021, with Netflix experiencing a remarkable 20%+ expansion in paid memberships during that period. Consequently, a deceleration in growth for the subsequent year, 2022, was predictable as the situation began to stabilize.\n\nHowever, as conditions normalized, subscriber growth rebounded significantly in 2023, showcasing a notable uptick quarter-over-quarter. The most recent quarter’s growth of 12.8% is especially noteworthy, pushing Netflix’s paid subscriber base to a staggering 260.3 million.\n\nRevenues & Earnings Surge, Outlook Appears Very Promising\n\nPowered by an acceleration in subscriber growth, revenue growth has also followed a similar trend. The same goes for earnings, as margins have been on the rise, with the income statement benefiting from improving unit economics. In the meantime, Netflix’s outlook for the first quarter of 2024 suggests that this trend is set to persist.\n\nTo illustrate, Netflix posted record revenues of $8.54 billion in Q4, a year-over-year increase of 12.5%. As you can see in the table below, revenue growth has also accelerated, in line with subscriber growth. Notably, this increase was the best for the company since Q4-2021’s growth rate of 16%. Simultaneously, NFLX’s operating margin jumped to 16.9%, notably higher than last year’s 7.0%. This combo allowed net income and EPS to skyrocket to $938 million.\n\nNoteworthy is also the fact that Netflix’s share count declined by 1.6% to 444.3 million, with management deploying just over $6.0 billion in buybacks in Fiscal 2023. While not a massive drop, management’s clear intention to boost buybacks should translate to a gradually accretive effect on earnings per share, which is welcomed.\n\nBut besides closing the year on a high note, investors were left particularly impressed with management’s Q1-2024 outlook, which points to further acceleration in revenues and a significant expansion operating income margin expansion. In particular, revenues are expected to grow by 13.2%, while operating income margin is expected to reach 26.2%, implying a notable expansion from last year’s 21% and last quarter’s 16.9%.\n\nIs NFLX Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nRegarding Wall Street’s view on Netflix, the stock has drawn a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 27 Buys, 13 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $574.01, the average Netflix stock forecast implies 2.6% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re wondering which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell NFLX stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Jason Helfstein from Oppenheimer, with an average return of 43.42% per rating and a 100% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nNetflix’s relentless dominance in the streaming realm remains impressive, defying industry saturation and intense competition. The recent acceleration in paid subscribers and surging revenues and earnings paint a promising outlook for the future. With prudent rising share buybacks and optimistic targets by management entering 2024, Netflix stock appears positioned for continued success in 2024.\n\nDisclosure",

They were responsible for more than 62% of the S&P 500’s total return in 2023.\n\nMost experts anticipated a broadening of the market rally in 2024; however, market leadership has narrowed further this year. These stocks have driven more than 80% of the index's rise.\n\nAll these companies benefited from the AI hype in 2023, but we've seen divergent performances in 2024 as investors assess which will emerge as the biggest beneficiaries of the forthcoming AI boom.\n\nNvidia and Meta are leading the group, while Tesla significantly lags. This divergence has expanded in the past few weeks, as all but one reported their financial results. Meta's results were particularly well-received, sending the shares of the social media giant up more than 20%.\n\nTesla has been punished for missing both earnings and revenue estimates. The EV giant’s earnings were down almost 46% amid weakening margins. The stock has lost 26% of its value this year.\n\nWhile NVIDIA is yet to announce its results, its stock has already appreciated by 42% in 2024, following a 240% increase in 2023, as most other giants disclosed aggressive AI investments.\n\nThe Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF MAGS provides equal weight exposure to these stocks.

Politico was the first to report about Meta's move.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by David Gregorio)",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss Dorsal Capital Partners sees a 13% boost in 2023: its top 15 stock picks. If you want to skip about some more stocks in Dorsal Capital Partners’ portfolio, go directly to Dorsal Capital Partners Sees a 13% Boost in 2023: Its Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nFounded in 2009, Dorsal Capital Management is a long/short hedge fund seeking to produce risk-adjusted total returns uncorrelated to the broad stock indexes. The hedge fund whose main fund has never suffered a large annual loss is the brainchild of Ryan David Frick and Oliver Evans, two SAC Capital alums.\n\nAn MBA graduate from Stanford University, Frick boasts tremendous experience in the investment world and has served as a portfolio manager at CR Intrinsic Investors, an affiliate of SAC Capital, for four years. He also gained rich experience as an analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston. Having also doubled up as analyst covering media and internet segment at Kicap Management, he is currently the Managing Partner and Chief Investment Officer at Dorsal Capital Management.\n\nEvans has been a retired partner since 2014 and currently manages direct public equity at the family offices of Apercus Holdings and Keystone LP. Having completed his MBA at the Harvard Business School in 2004, he also worked as an analyst at CR Intrinsic for two years before founding Dorsal Capital Management.\n\nDorsal Capital Management mostly invests in technology stocks that account for about a third of the total portfolio. It also boasts significant exposure in the services sector, with consumer goods holdings summing up the top three investment areas. However, the Redwood City, California-based hedge fund is not open to funds from outside investors.\n\nAs of the third quarter of 2023, Dorsal Capital Management had stakes in some of the biggest tech companies that fueled the bull run in 2023. The long-short hedge fund boasts of investments in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) that posted triple and double-digit percentage gains in 2023. Likewise, the hedge fund finished 2023 on a high, up by about 13%.\n\nStory continues Dorsal Capital Partners Sees a 13% Boost in 2023: Its Top 15 Stock Picks\n\nThe tech services and consumer-focused hedge fund manages about $2.92 billion while applying long- and short-term investment strategies. In addition, it considers itself an expert in managing pooled investment vehicles. Investments in tech stocks allow the hedge fund to gain exposure to some of the fastest growth areas at a time of artificial intelligence operations. Investments in consumer goods also offer exposure to inflation-immune segments.\n\nWhile the hedge fund underperformed the S&P 500, which gained 24% in 2023, its returns showed a significant improvement from 2022. As the overall equity market came under pressure in 2022 amid a ferocious sell-off triggered by runaway inflation and a push by the US Federal Reserve to hike interest rates, Dorsal Capital Management narrowly escaped losses with a 0.9% decline. The 0.9% decline in 2022 was impressive considering that the S&P 500 was down by about 19% the same year.\n\nDorsal Capital Management's impressive track record of returns dates back to 2018, when it delivered a gain of 2.18%  compared to a loss of 4.38% for the S&P 500. The hedge fund continued the impressive run in 2019 as it delivered a half-year return of 7.4% through June 2019 with an annualized return of 7.5%. Even as the COVID-19 pandemic caused havoc in 2020, sending the markets into a tailspin, the hedge fund came on top, delivering 9.7% gains in the year's first half. The impressive run would continue into 2021 as the hedge fund achieved a 4.1% return.\n\nInvestments in Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) present massive opportunities as Dorsal Capital Management looks to profit from the explosive AI theme in 2024. In addition, the hedge fund's significant exposure to technology stocks presents yet another massive opportunity as the Federal Reserve moves to tweak its monetary policy. The Fed cutting interest rates as expected is one of the catalysts expected to send most tech stocks higher, as has always been the case during periods of lower interest rates.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nDorsal Capital Management is one of the few hedge funds that has navigated the equity market successfully, and never posted a large loss since inception. Its long-short investment strategy focusing on high-growth stocks in tech, consumer goods, and services sectors has proved to be a great success. After analyzing 13F filings, we have listed the hedge funds' top stock picks. The stocks are ranked in ascending order based on the value of the hedge fund’s equity stakes.

That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nDorsal Capital Partners Sees a 13% Boost in 2023: Its Top Stock Picks\n\n15. EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM)\n\nDorsal Capital Management’s Equity Stake: $83.10 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 34\n\nEPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) is one of Dorsal Capital Management's top stock picks and one of the latest additions to the portfolio. The hedge fund acquired stakes worth $83.10 million in the information technology services company to gain exposure to digital platform engineering and software development services.\n\nDorsal Capital Management took advantage of a significant pullback to acquire stakes in EPAM Systems, Inc.

According to Insider Monkey's database data, 34 elite hedge funds held positions in EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) stock in the third quarter of 2023.

(NYSE:EPAM) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“EPAM Systems, Inc. (NYSE:EPAM) provides outsourced software development to business customers. Shares declined 24.8% due to investor concerns over the negative potential impact of GenAI, slowing growth and a weaker financial outlook. Greater economic uncertainty is causing a pullback in customer demand as corporate clients temporarily focus on near-term cost optimization rather than more strategic digital transformation projects. Management reduced its full-year guidance twice during the quarter, which was highly unusual given the company’s strong execution track record. We believe this slowdown is temporary and continue to own the stock due to EPAM’s long runway for growth and strong technical capabilities.”\n\n14. V.F.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Burlington Stores, Inc. (NYSE:BURL) participates in the off-price retail category and competes against well-known players such as TJ Maxx and Ross Stores. BURL recently suffered from an inventory overhang that dented margins and is also suffering from a slowdown in same store sales. With that said, the company has capacity to double its stores, double its margins to levels consistent with peers, and expand same-store sales growth. On normalized margins, which the company last achieved in fiscal 2019, BURL is trading at ~10x earnings, with potential to grow to\n\n12. Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE)\n\nDorsal Capital Management’s Equity Stake: $120.68 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 30\n\nFive Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) was one of the catalysts behind Dorsal Capital Management's 13% return in 2023. The consumer cyclical investment plays operating as a specialty value retailer increased by 21% in 2023. The rally came as Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) benefited from improved consumer spending on jewelry, hair, and accessories, among other personal living space products.\n\nDorsal Capital Management increased its stake in Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) by 42% in Q3 2023 to $120.68 million. By the end of this year’s third quarter, 30 out of the 910 funds polled by Insider Monkey had held Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE)’s shares. Ryan Frick And Oliver Evans’s Dorsal Capital Management is the company's largest stakeholder through its $120.68 million investment.\n\nHere is what Wasatch Global Investors said about Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Another weak stock in the strategy was Five Below, Inc. (NASDAQ:FIVE). This discount retailer has set itself apart with its branding and unique approach of, as its name suggests, pricing most items at five dollars or less. Second-quarter revenues and earnings met expectations, and management projected that third- and fourth-quarter revenues would be in line with forecasts and better than industry peer comparisons. But the stock was down because upcoming quarterly margins and earnings are projected to decline due to theft and expenses associated with theft prevention. While this news was disappointing, we think management has responded appropriately. We still expect the company’s new-store growth rate to accelerate from the low teens to the high teens over the next 12 months. Five Below plans to add approximately 250 new locations, which we think will position the company to take advantage of both the 2023 and 2024 holiday shopping seasons.”\n\n11. Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR)\n\nDorsal Capital Management’s Equity Stake: $125.43 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 48\n\nBellevue, Washington-based Smartsheet Inc.

(NYSE:SMAR):\n\n“Smartsheet Inc. (NYSE:SMAR) provides a workflow and customer engagement platform for teams and organizations. Mixed fiscal first quarter results caused a -20% retreat to the share price. That included in line revenues and profits; however, billings fell short due to macro conditions impacting small-to-mid sized businesses and elongated sales cycles among larger enterprises.”\n\n10.

(NASDAQ:Z) investors. Robert W. Koehn’s Ivy Lane Capital was a prominent shareholder of the company in the fourth quarter of 2023, with stakes worth $13.60 million.\n\n7. Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nDorsal Capital Management’s Equity Stake: $162.22 Million\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 122\n\nSalesforce, Inc.

Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n6.

        "title": "3 Nasdaq Stocks to Buy for the Next Bull Run: February 2024",
        "content": "Over the past two weeks, the Nasdaq 100, a barometer for tech-heavy and growth-oriented stocks, has shown a resurgence. This comes amid some impressive earnings reports, especially from Nasdaq stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As this positive news propels markets higher, we discuss some stocks that promise robust returns in the impending bull run.\n\nThree Nasdaq-listed companies stand out for their potential. Each has demonstrated adaptability to changing consumer behaviors. Moreover, they are showing they can leverage market dynamics in their respective industries in their favor.\n\nToday, they possess unique strategic strengths to capitalize on future opportunities. Although their sectors — travel, entertainment, and gaming — are diverse, they are unified by transformative growth driven by technological innovation. Additionally, according to Finviz, each will achieve over 20% annual earnings per share (EPS) growth in the next five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese Nasdaq stocks are leading innovators and deserve a place in your portfolio. They have also shown incredible earnings resilience in the face of past market volatility, which is why they provide an opportunity going forward. They are compelling picks for investors aiming to ride the next wave of Nasdaq’s bull run.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is a global online travel and related services leader. With its vast portfolio of brands, including Booking.com, Priceline, Kayak and Agoda, it stands at the forefront of the post-pandemic travel revival. It offers a comprehensive range of services, from accommodation bookings to flight reservations, car rentals and travel insurance.\n\nIn terms of innovation to power growth, its investments in technology to enhance user experience have been commendable. In 2023, it launched an AI trip planner that utilizes natural language. Now, users can search for subjects like “plan a trip to Paris” and create an itinerary that suggests places to stay and sites to visit. Users can also request suggestions based on their budget.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese innovations position Booking Holdings to capture the growing demand for travel in a post-pandemic world. Revenue growth is already impressive with Q3 revenues soaring 21.3% year-over-year. Room units, rental car days and airline tickets sold grew 14.9%, 20% and 56.6%, respectively, from last year highlighting strength across the board.\n\nFinancially, Booking Holdings has capitalized on robust demand to drive profitable growth. Indeed, it’s one of the most profitable Nasdaq stocks. For the nine months ended September 2023, it generated $5.7 billion in free cash flow, some 34.7% of total revenues. Given the robust cash generation, it repurchased $7.7 billion of its shares which reduced its share count by 8%.\n\nStill, with $16 billion of the $24 billion authorization left, there is room to reduce its share count further. Management expects to complete the buyback in four years. Booking’s global footprint and robust balance sheet, with $14 billion in cash, provide a solid foundation for growth. Moreover, innovation in artificial intelligence and digital payment solutions will enhance its competitive edge.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) An image of a phone with the Netflix logo on the screen, laying next to a container of popcorn with popcorn splayed across\n\nSource: xalien / Shutterstock\n\nDespite stiff competition from new entrants in the streaming space, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has maintained its growth momentum. As Q4 2023 results showed, the pioneering streaming service is dominating the entertainment landscape.\n\nThe platform continues to attract more customers with its vast content library spanning various genres and languages. In Q4 it added 13.1 million global streaming subscribers compared to 7.7 million in the year-ago quarter. That addition was a quarterly record highlighting the impressive momentum.\n\nThe company’s strategy of investing heavily in original content and licensing the best intellectual property from peers is working. It is attracting new subscribers and retaining existing ones, contributing to its robust subscriber numbers and revenue growth. Notably, it closed 2023 with 260 million paid memberships and achieved Q4 revenue growth of 12.5%.\n\nIn terms of forward growth, management is optimistic, expecting 13.2% revenue growth this quarter. With a bold slate for 2024, including dramas like The Diplomat, Squid Game, and Empress, and unscripted series like Love is Blind, Tour de France: Unchained and F1: Drive to Survive, audiences have a wide selection to choose from.\n\nLast, its foray into gaming and advertising offers new avenues for engagement and revenue. In its Q4 shareholder letter, management outlined a $600 billion revenue opportunity in pay TV, film, branded advertising and games. If Netflix captures a fraction of this market, it will be one of the best Nasdaq stocks.\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software (TTWO) Image of two boys playing video games\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTake-Two Interactive Software (NASDAQ:TTWO) is a leading developer and publisher of video games. Its portfolio features blockbuster franchises such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and NBA 2K, garnering a loyal and growing fan base.\n\nThis gaming giant’s success can be attributed to its high-quality game development. Its blockbuster Grand Theft Auto V is the best-selling console and PC-only game. By the end of its fiscal 2024 second quarter, it had sold over 190 million copies as of the game. Red Dead Redemption 2 is another incredible title that sold over 57 million units.\n\nBesides new game releases, the company has utilized effective monetization strategies to spur growth. These include in-game purchases and advertising. Through strategic partnerships, advertising revenues grew from $257 million to $359 million for the six months ended Sept. 30, 2023.\n\nOver the next year, Take-Two Interactive stands out as one of the most exciting Nasdaq stocks. It has a roster of upcoming game releases spearheaded by the much-awaited Grand Theft Auto VI. Given the huge interest the trailer garnered, analysts are optimistic about its revenue potential. Jeffries expects TTWO stock to glide higher as we approach the 2025 launch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy to Outperform ‘The Magnificent Seven’",
        "content": "You’ve likely heard a lot about the “Magnificent Seven” stocks lately. These companies included in this group are: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This group of Big Tech elite companies have been trouncing the broader market over the past year with their strong returns.\n\nBut there are still great opportunities to find stocks that can outperform these heavyweights. Don’t get me wrong – the Magnificent Seven should form the core of most growth stock portfolios. However, by digging deeper, smaller yet rapidly-growing companies in high-potential sectors could supercharge your investment returns.\n\nMy aim isn’t to uncover “the next Amazon” or predict which small caps will reach trillion-dollar valuations. Instead, I look for quality businesses with vast addressable markets, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to compound earnings substantially over long periods. The seven stocks revealed here check all those boxes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nFTAI Aviation’s (NASDAQ:FTAI) performance has been nothing short of remarkable lately. This high-flyer has skyrocketed 143% over the past 12 months, with momentum only accelerating as of late. Just take a look at the company’s five-year return – up a whopping 348%!\n\nNow, stocks posting triple-digit gains tend to make me cautious, wondering whether their share price is getting detached from financial realities. However, one glance at FTAI Aviation’s financial statements shows this is no house of cards.\n\nFTAI owns and manages commercial aircraft engines, focusing on the widely-used CFM56 models. The company also invests in other aviation assets and aerospace products, churning out strong cash flows with room for earnings growth. Revenue in Q3 2023 hit $291.1 million, a 26.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, net income landed at $41.3 million, representing fat profit margins of 14.2%. To put it bluntly, this is a much more profitable enterprise than 85% of its business services peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, the good times look set to continue. Consensus estimates call for 50% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years, with the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times 2024 estimates. It’s not exactly cheap, but you’re paying up for quality. And at 4.5-times expected 2024 revenue, I don’t think the company’s valuation is outrageous by any means.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decade. Artificial Intelligence Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been an absolute superstar, too. Shares have gone vertical over the past few weeks, riding the mounting hype around artificial intelligence. There’s no denying Super Micro has made all the right moves to capitalize on this mega trend. However, with the company’s stock price detached from its fundamentals, we could see significant downside if AI mania cools off.\n\nLet’s take a sober look at the numbers. SMCI stock currently changes hands at roughly 30-times forward earnings and 2.2-times expected FY2024 sales. That’s pretty rich for a company projected to grow revenue at a 20% annual clip moving forward. Still, profits should expand even faster, given what was reported in Super Micro’s blowout Q4 report. The company trounced earnings per share estimates by 8.3% and beat the revenue consensus by 12.5%. Indeed, those are strong results by any measure. Plus, it should be noted that semiconductor companies trade at much steeper premiums. This valuation isn’t out of the ordinary in its industry.\n\nIf AI hype continues gaining momentum, SMCI stock has ample room to grow into its lofty valuation. But with this stock seemingly priced to perfection, one slight disappointment could spell trouble. Consider me cautiously optimistic here. I like what Super Micro is building.\n\nSurgePays (SURG) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar pick, allow me to highlight SurgePays (NASDAQ:SURG). This tiny company has somehow flown completely beneath Wall Street’s radar, meaning hardly any analysts provide coverage on the company. But once you peek under the hood, I think you’ll agree that SurgePays has intriguing potential.\n\nSurgePays offers a suite of financial and telecom products catering to underbanked and underserved groups across the United States. The company’s core product is a fintech platform empowering retail clerks to handle transactions like prepaid wireless plans, gift cards, and debit services at the point of sale. It’s a win-win arrangement – partner stores profit on each transaction while providing valuable services to customers. SurgePays also utilizes federal subsidies to supply tablet devices and cellular broadband to income-eligible households.\n\nRight now, SurgePays sports a market cap equal to annual revenue. Shares trade at just 4.7-times forward earnings, despite just $5.5 million of debt against $12.7 million of cash in the coffers. This year, SurgePays acquired ClearLine Mobile in a $15 million deal funded by a recent equity offering. Growth is the name of the game, and I applaud the recent move to scoop up a fast-growing target while SURG stock itself remains attractively-priced.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) has been an absolute star player in the broader semiconductor space. As a leading electronic design automation (EDA) outfit, Synopsys provides mission-critical tools and services that chipmakers rely on to design and manufacture advanced semiconductors. With the industry running on all cylinders, it’s no surprise SNPS stock has lit up the scoreboard.\n\nIn Q3, Synopsys grew revenue to over $1.6 billion, a 24.5% year-over-year surge. Meanwhile, its net margins approached 22%, powering 83% profit growth over the same period last year. This level of expansion is tremendously impressive. Due to this tremendous performance, SNPS shares have tacked on 55% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nAs a long-term partner enabling Nvidia’s innovations, Synopsys has also benefited handsomely from the GPU giant’s success. The bottom line is that Synopsys is significantly more profitable than 95% of industry peers. At 42-times forward earnings, the valuation gives me minimal pause, considering the quality of this business. So long as AI and next-gen chips drive multi-year growth runways, I expect SNPS stock to continue compounding at an enviable clip.\n\nTransDigm Group (TDG) a jet takes off on a clear runway.\n\nSource: m.photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) is a leading designer and producer of highly-engineered aircraft components and systems. Through its 48 subsidiaries, TransDigm boasts an impressive portfolio serving both commercial and military aircraft manufacturers.\n\nI love seeing the profit engine firing on all cylinders here. TransDigm reported a 22.4% net margin last quarter, handily besting more than 90% of aerospace and defense peers. Zooming out further, the company’s three-year annualized earnings per share growth rate comes in at nearly 40% (excluding non-recurring items). And if we just look at the past year, earnings per share growth excluding these items came in hot at a blistering 63.5%.\n\nRevenue rose 21% in 2023, supported by 27% growth in the high-margin aftermarket commercial segment. TransDigm continues to benefit from the ongoing recovery in global air travel. Shares trade at 35-times forward earnings, which I’m perfectly comfortable paying for durable earnings growth in the high single-digits. Additionally, the company’s 4Q report was superb, with TransDigm beating estimates across the board on revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Plus, management announced a special $2 billion dividend on top of upbeat 2024 guidance. Sign me up!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) A drone being used by soldiers.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is undoubtedly pricy by traditional valuation standards. Shares trade hands at 67-times forward earnings and 12.4-times expected 2023 sales. But I believe the TASER maker’s entrenched position supplying non-lethal weapons to global law enforcement agencies warrants a premium.\n\nExpected to deliver 30%+ revenue growth this year alongside 76% bottom line expansion, Axon is firing on all cylinders. The company continues rolling out innovative technologies like body cameras, records management software, drone solutions, and training to become the premier public safety tech provider.\n\nWith elections nearing, we could see rising tensions on the streets. Axon would likely benefit from a tough-on-crime stance from future administrations. The recent Fusus acquisition and new body camera line for commercial markets should also boost the company’s total addressable market (TAM) by more than $20 billion. So, while this stock’s sticker price gives me a moment’s pause, I remain firmly bullish on Axon’s long-term outlook.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I look at e-commerce and fintech growth exposure overseas, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) remains high on my buy list. Dubbed the “Amazon of Latin America,” MercadoLibre operates online marketplaces spanning 18 countries and serving more than 148 million users.\n\nDespite torrid growth, MercadoLibre’s balance sheet has surprisingly little debt with a 0.6-times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. This financial strength provides ample dry powder for continued growth. Consensus estimates call for 35% annualized earnings per share growth over the next decade, which would result in a profitability boost of 13x from 2023 to 2032.\n\nSo, while shares trade at a meaty 77-times forward earnings today, I believe that the multiple on MELI stock could actually prove conservative given MercadoLibre’s vast runway. As Latin America’s middle class expands, the adoption of e-commerce and digital payments should accelerate. With market leadership secured, MercadoLibre remains my top pick to capitalize on this multi-year tailwind.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An options trader appears to be looking to parlay a winning bet on Meta Platforms Inc. into an even bigger windfall if the tech giant doubles — again — in the next 18 months.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHaley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ Option China Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End Rout Tesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff Fears US Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to Europe Trump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court\n\nEarly Wednesday, a trader sold a block of 19,000 call options that expire in June 2025 and allow the holder to purchase 1.9 million shares at $600, in exchange for twice as many calls with a $950 strike price expiring a year later, collecting $11.4 million.\n\nHolders of call options in Meta and other megacap tech stocks have seen ballooning profits, both from the increase in share prices that makes the options more valuable, but also the seeming unquenchable demand from investors looking to bet on further gains. Unlike most stocks, where there is a pronounced premium for bearish option contracts versus bullish as investors look to protect against losses, the incessant tech rally has flipped that on its head.\n\n“Meta is an example of a stock with skew to the calls,” said Chris Murphy, co-head of derivative strategy at Susquehanna International Group, adding that it’s rare to see this in an large cap equity and is an indication of “panic to the upside.”\n\nSelling the earlier calls — which appear to have been bought in mid-July when Meta was trading around $309 a share — likely netted millions of dollars in profits, though it’s hard to be sure as the position may have been rolled in July from an even lower level as shares rallied.\n\nWhile $950 seems like a far-away level, Meta shares doubled from November 2022 to March 2023, and doubled again between then and January.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred Anymore HSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX Customers The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "title": "Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving",
        "content": "Why Snap (SNAP) Stock Is Nosediving\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of social network Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) fell 34.5% in the morning session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue and average revenue per user (ARPU) missing analysts' expectations amid elevated expectations around changes in the direct response business. User growth was steady, with DAU (daily active users) ahead of estimates as net additions in Europe and the Rest of the World more than offset the customer attrition recorded in North America. This North America attrition is sure to ring alarm bells about competition, with Meta (NASDAQ:META) recently reporting very encouraging results.\n\nWhile next quarter's revenue guidance was in line, adjusted EBITDA guidance was well below. This shows that Snap's growth is coming at higher costs or less efficiency than expected. Moreover, the ARPU miss and the weakness in North America DAU indicate a challenging road ahead if the company aims to surpass expectations in the upcoming quarter. During the earnings call, management hinted at potential growth investments in North America and Europe and expressed optimism about avoiding further declines in North America in Q1. Overall, this was a mediocre quarter for Snap as the market was likely expecting more, considering the strong result reported by Meta earlier in the season.\n\nThe stock market overreacts to news, and big price drops can present good opportunities to buy high-quality stocks. Is now the time to buy Snap? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnap's shares are quite volatile and over the last year have had 26 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Snap and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 5 days ago, when the company gained 7.1% on the news that Meta reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector also suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024.\n\nSnap is down 29.6% since the beginning of the year, and at $11.33 per share it is trading 35.1% below its 52-week high of $17.45 from February 2024. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snap's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $1,326.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "title": "Snap stock tanks after forecast disappoints: Investor patience is 'thinning'",
        "content": "Snap stock (SNAP) tanked on Wednesday, sinking more than 30% as investors digested another disappointing quarterly earnings report.\n\nThe Snapchat parent company posted Q4quarterly revenue of $1.36 billion, below Street estimates for $1.38 billion. The company has now missed revenue estimates on six of the last eight reports. And now, it says it expects to lose more money in the current quarter than Wall Street expected, too.\n\nThe company is now projecting an adjusted EBITDA loss in a range of $55 million to $95 million for the period, a wider loss than the $32.7 million Wall Street expected.\n\nSnap says that loss will come alongside a higher revenue growth rate than seen this quarter as the company continues on its \"investment plans.\"\n\nFor investors, the key question will be if those plans help Snap complete its turnaround story. RBC Capital Markets analyst Brad Erickson believes investors may be tired of waiting for it.\n\n\"Investors' patience for underwriting growth-oriented investments seems poised to continue thinning,\" Erickson wrote in a note to clients.\n\nInvestors had bid up the stock more than 60% over the last six months as excitement grew around a turnaround for Snap. But after Tuesday night's report, shares sold off. The stock has tumbled in reaction to each of the last seven earnings reports as investors struggle to see how a company whose shares were once priced at more than $80 creates a solid growth pitch again.\n\nMoffettNathanson senior research analyst Michael Nathanson that the market was \"once again fooling itself that this time would be different\" as Snap shares soared over the past several months. He added that the Snap story has often felt like investors are only a quarter away from seeing change \"every quarter.\"\n\n\"Truth is, with the ramping competition in AI-enabled product solutions at major, larger companies, it is hard to see how Snap’s competitive position and financial profile gets materially better,\" Nathanson wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap is lagging other social media companies' success in monetizing AI engagement and is seeing a worse advertisement environment than other competitors are.\n\nOn the company's earnings call, Snap CEO Evan Spiegel didn't provide precise numbers to explain how the company's investment in MyAI, its version of an AI chatbot, is paying off.\n\n\"Overall, our Generative AI efforts have been much more focused on image and video models and helping people edit their snaps or generate snaps in new and entertaining ways. And really using that as an on-ramp to Snapchat Plus.\"\n\nCiti analyst Ronald Josey wrote in a note to clients that as long as investment into AI products increases, gross margins are \"likely to remain challenged.\"\n\nAnd this could be a holdup for investors looking for long-term profitability, which Nathanson notes has been elusive. Put simply, Snap's low-single-digits advertising revenue in the prior quarter is another part of the puzzle that has investors questioning why Snap can't compete with others in the social media and advertising markets.\n\n\"With two behemoths in the space — Google and Meta — forecasted to grow advertising revenues in the high-single to low-double digit range over the same time period while also continuing to invest in their own businesses, we continue to question whether Snap truly has the ability to carve out a substantially profitable business,\" Nathanson wrote.

        "title": "Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us two big lessons — so far",
        "content": "Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.\n\nSo far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.\n\nShares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.\n\nAmazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.\n\nAnd while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.\n\nAI is still king\n\nIf you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.\n\nUBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.

        "title": "Big Tech’s earnings season has taught us 2 big lessons — so far",
        "content": "Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.\n\nSo far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.\n\nShares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.\n\nAmazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.\n\nAnd while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.\n\nAI is still king\n\nIf you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.\n\nUBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures.

        "title": "Meta accused of not taking Facebook Marketplace fraud seriously",
        "content": "Meta has been accused by MPs of not taking the problem of online fraud on its platforms seriously.\n\nThe parent company of Facebook and Instagram came under scrutiny from the Home Affairs Select Committee after representatives from the banking sector said the “majority” of scams they see start on Meta platforms.\n\nPaul Davis, financial crime prevention director at TSB, told the committee that Facebook Marketplace is the “main place” where purchase scams originate, which, along with investment and impersonation scams, are the most common types of fraud affecting bank customers.\n\n“For those three types, which as I say are the main ones, we see about 80% start on social media,” Mr Davis told MPs.\n\n“Indeed, let’s not walk past the fact that, when I say social media there, the majority of them start from the channels owned by one company in particular, which is Meta.”\n\n🗣️We are now live and questioning banks and big tech firms on how they protect people from fraud. We are hearing from:@TSB@RevolutApp@santanderuk@Meta@BTGroup@Microsoft\n\n📺Watch here: https://t.co/tzoMPErfmQpic.twitter.com/W9vtl7DRJe\n\n— Home Affairs Committee (@CommonsHomeAffs) February 7, 2024\n\nHe added: “Facebook Marketplace doesn’t have a payments channel attached to it, it’s not like a website you might use to buy something off a high street shop, for example, or Amazon. So, you have to get bank details from the seller of that item.\n\nStory continues\n\n“What we see are customers telling us that they get bank details from the seller, send them money and then the item never turns up.”\n\nIn response, Philip Milton, public policy manager for fraud at Meta, told the committee that the tech giant takes the issue “extremely seriously”.\n\nWhen suggested by the committee that evidence given to MPs by the banks shows Meta is not doing all it can to prevent online fraud, Mr Milton said: “I disagree with that.”\n\nHe went on: “To give you an idea of the scale that we’re putting in place to tackle this kind of thing, since 2016 we’ve invested 20 billion dollars on safety and security, and that’s not slowing down – five billion of that was in the last year alone.\n\n“We have 40,000 people working across the company on safety and security. Half of that number are involved in directly reviewing content, so we invest significantly in trying to prevent this kind of thing from happening.”\n\nHe added that fraud “fundamentally undermines the experience we’re trying to provide for people” and said this, combined with fraudulent advertising affecting trust in the company from advertisers and its wider reputation, means the firm is “directly incentivised” to do all it can to prevent criminal activity.\n\nHowever, committee member Tim Loughton, Conservative MP for East Worthing and Shoreham, argued that the five billion dollars Meta said it spent last year on safety and security equates to less than 4% of the firm’s annual revenue for the year – a figure he suggested is “not very high”.\n\nMr Loughton also questioned whether the 20,000 people reviewing content for Meta is an adequate number given the site has “four billion active accounts”, and suggested the social media giant is not taking the issue “terribly seriously” because, as Facebook Marketplace does not have a payments channel linked to it, the site is not financially liable if fraud takes place there.\n\n“You apparently have no financial skin in the game for clamping down on fraud on Facebook Marketplace other than potential reputational damage,” he said.\n\n“Unless there’s a clear link with advertisers walking away with their revenue because they’re concerned at (banking sector research showing) 80% of fraud starting on (social media platforms) and 68% of it specifically your platforms, then you don’t really have to take it terribly seriously – and the fact you’re spending five billion dollars out of an annual revenue of 134.9 billion, which, as I say, is three and a bit percent for a people-based service, is tiny.\n\n“So you’re not taking this problem seriously, are you?”\n\nIn response, Mr Milton said: “I don’t agree with that at all”, and argued that “the scale of our investment demonstrates how seriously we take this problem”, adding that it is “market-leading” levels of funding for safety and security.\n\nHe added that, in response to tactics from fraudsters who demand payment or ask for an item to be sent before it is paid for, Meta has “removed the ability to ship an item on Facebook Marketplace”, and that there is “no way to pay for an item” on the platform because the firm is trying to “design out” the ability for criminals to use the platform for fraud.",

        "title": "If You'd Invested $10,000 in Meta Platforms Stock in 2014, This Is How Much You Would Have Today",
        "content": "The rise of the internet has led to game-changing innovations and the growth of massive businesses. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is one such company.\n\nThe social media and digital advertising behemoth is one of the most valuable businesses in the world. And during its ascent, it has rewarded shareholders. If you were smart enough to invest $10,000 in this FAANG stock 10 years ago in February 2014, you'd be sitting on a balance of $75,900 today, good for a monster 659% gain.\n\nLet's look at Meta's path to get to this point, and then consider where the company might be headed.\n\nRiding the mobile wave\n\nFormerly known as Facebook, Meta benefited from some key tech breakthroughs on its journey. The mainstream adoption of smartphones, coupled with faster internet connectivity, helped this business gain a huge number of users as the world shifted from PCs to mobile devices.\n\nBetween 2013 and 2023, Meta's daily active users (across all of its apps) skyrocketed from 757 million to 3.19 billion. This means that now about 39% of the global population interacts with the company in some way each day. That's a wild statistic.\n\nThe success of the social media apps has resulted in powerful network effects. As more users interact with each other or post more content, it makes it more compelling for new people to join. Consequently, there's very little chance that Meta will get disrupted anytime soon.\n\nFocused on innovation\n\nSocial media undoubtedly remains Meta's bread and butter. But founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg is always thinking of the next step. His focus over the past few years has been leaning more toward metaverse ambitions and the development of a new computing platform. This is what the Reality Labs division is working on.\n\nSo far, the results have been disappointing. In 2024, this segment posted a staggering operating loss of $16.1 billion on revenue of just $1.9 billion. There's no reason to believe things are going to drastically improve anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, it makes sense that Zuckerberg is investing in this technology. He hopes to one day have a billion people spending money in the metaverse, with the ultimate goal of depending less and less on the top mobile operating systems, Apple's iOS and Alphabet's Android. If Meta controls the devices that people use to interact with the internet of tomorrow, it could prove to be a huge growth engine.\n\nFinancial prowess\n\nIt's anyone's guess if the metaverse will become a moneymaker for the business one day, but luckily Meta has the financial resources to continue pushing the envelope forward in terms of innovation. This is one of the most profitable companies on the face of the planet.\n\nMeta's operating margin was 40% in 2021, then it contracted to 25% in 2022. Last year, Zuckerberg embarked on a \"Year of Efficiency,\" and so the margin expanded to 35%.\n\nThis is a cash machine. The business generated $43 billion of free cash flow last year, helping to fund ongoing share repurchases. But for the first time ever, Meta announced a $0.50 quarterly dividend payout, which would add a tiny bump to investor returns. This reinforces my belief that the company is in a very strong financial position.\n\nMeta is clearly one of the most dominant and profitable enterprises ever. This success has rewarded shareholders along the way. But as we look toward the next decade, it's hard to know whether, 10 years from now, the business will still rely on its popular social media apps or if the metaverse will be the main revenue driver.\n\nHowever, at a current price-to-earnings ratio of 31 and a market cap of $1.2 trillion, I believe past returns aren't likely to repeat going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer said in a latest program that after listening to the Fed chair Jerome Powell he believes we are at \"crossroads\" since there is still \"some inflation\" and the \"dichotomy\" of hard landing versus soft landing is being \"replaced by no landing.\" Cramer said that we are \"back to reality\" and the reality, according to Cramer, is that interest rates are still \"not that high.\" Cramer believes the rates are at a level where the economy can keep working. Cramer wondered how and why the Fed would cut interest rates when strong employment numbers keep coming and inflation is also not going down significantly.\n\nDon't Wait for Rates Cuts to Invest in the Stock Market, Cramer Says\n\nJim Cramer tried to convince his viewers to invest in the stock market and said that while it would seem \"reckless\" to invest in the stock market because of the risks involved, it would be \"too late\" to invest in stocks once the Fed begins to cut interest rates. Jim Cramer said that stocks are in a win-win situation. If the economy keeps growing and the market remains strong, stocks will go up. If the economy begins to slow down, the Fed would cut rates sometime in the future, causing a rally in the stock market. Jim Cramer, however, acknowledged that stocks are risky when compared to the steady 5% income on CDs.\n\nCramer said \"great\" stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) can give you that \"5% from CDs\" in \"a week or even a day.\"\n\nCramer as \"No Illusions\"\n\nCramer said that he has \"no illusions\" and he is convinced that now is the right time to buy stocks. Cramer said he thinks many investors would be inclined towards investing in low-risk index funds or parking their cash in CDs or treasuries but he thinks big money will be made by investing in individual stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Jim Cramer is not bullish on all stocks. In fact over the past couple of years or so he's become quite selective in his choices and keeps recommending investors to sell or stay away from low-quality, money-losing or risky stocks and instead buy best of breed and high quality stocks.\n\nIn this article we will talk about some stocks Cramer is bearish on. Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These Stocks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to either stay away from or sell. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment where available. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: N/A\n\nSports and outdoor equipment company Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) recently went public in an IPO that fell short of expectations. Cramer had advised investors to stay away from the stock. He said:\n\n“So far, this is looking like another out of favor IPO, even if its lowball price allowed the stock to get a like, I guess you could call it a decent pop. And, I’ve got to tell you, Amer Sports is a great example of the kind of deals I wish we weren’t seeing.”\n\nOne of the reasons why Cramer is bearish on Amer Sports, Inc (NYSE:AS) is the company's high exposure to China.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on the stock, Canadian billionaire Chip Wilson, who also founded Lululemon Athletica, bought $324 million worth of shares at the company’s IPO.\n\nWhile Cramer is bearish on companies like Amer Sports, he's recommending buying high-quality mega-cap stocks like Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n9. Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 9\n\nLast month, Jim Cramer was asked about Lithium Americas Corp (NYSE:LAC). Cramer recommended the questioner to \"take a pass\" on the stock. Cramer said the \"greatest inventor of our time\" Elon Musk does not like lithium companies and he is trying to figure out a way to cut our dependence on them. Cramer said he would not go against Musk.\n\n8. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nSurgical facilities company Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on these days. When asked about Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) in a recent program on CNBC, Cramer said \"that industry is in up and down right now.\"\n\n\"I'm taking a hard pass,\" Cramer said of Surgery Partners.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 15 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The biggest stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is owned by Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $157 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”\n\n7. Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nJim Cramer in a recent program said he hasn’t \"liked Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) in 20 years, and it’s really rewarded my dislike.\"\n\nCramer said instead of Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) he's \"willing\" to recommend Verizon.\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 910 funds shows that 22 hedge funds had stakes in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD). The biggest stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD) is owned by Paul Marshall and Ian Wace's Marshall Wace LLP which owns a $37 million stake in Vodafone Group Plc (NASDAQ:VOD).\n\n6. CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 24\n\nGene editing platform company CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) ranks sixth in our list of stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from.\n\nWhile Cramer said that he \"likes\" CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP), the reason why he cannot recommend the stock is that CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) has been losing a lot of money. Cramer said he cannot recommend CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) stock on a \"fundamental basis.\"\n\nThe stock has gained about 17% over the past one year. Last month, Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:VRTX) said the US FDA approved its groundbreaking gene editing therapy, Casgevy, developed with CRISPR Therapeutics AG (NASDAQ:CRSP) for those aged 12 years and older with transfusion-dependent beta-thalassemia (TDT).\n\nUnlike Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Cramer likes a lot, the CNBC host is bearish on CRSP.\n\nClick to continue reading and seeJim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n11 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires 13 Best Jim Cramer Stocks To Buy Now George Soros and Jim Cramer Love These Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Outperformed, but Investors Are Getting Too Optimistic",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) ride up from the bottom it saw in 2022 has been nothing short of a fairy tale story for the company, its investors and its management. The company has come off its lows with one of its strongest performances in its recent fourth quarter. Meta has demonstrated incredible resilience in pivoting from its ill-fated singular gamble on the metaverse to re-focusing on its core strength: online ads. The fourth quarter of 2023 has also shown how the company used its Year of Efficiency to adopt a lean, strategic approach to long-term secular growth.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nHowever, my valuation model suggests markets are getting ahead of themselves while overstating the growth outlook for Meta. In my opinion, the strong outperformance in its earnings has led to outstretched valuation multiples. I think it would be prudent for investors to wait for a pullback before investing in the stock.\n\nEarnings recap\n\nMeta's recently released earnings report emphatically outperformed on all levels. The social media giant's fourth-quarter revenue rose 25% year over year to $40.11 billion, beating expectations by over 2%. For the year, revenue rose 16% to $135 billion. I believe the strong sales beat was driven by a continued rebound in its online ad business, which can be seen in the chart below. Meta Platforms Outperformed, but Investors Are Getting Too Optimistic\n\nFrom the chart above, I note how Meta's ad revenue jumped 25% on a year-over-year basis. Most of the growth in ad revenue was driven by increased spending in regions such as Europe, up 33%, and Asia Pacific, up 22.50%, while advertising revenue in the U.S. grew 18.50%.\n\nWhat is more interesting to me is the surge in revenue in Meta's Reality Labs division, which saw its biggest quarter yet, crossing $1 billion in revenue. This means that in addition to strong growth in its ad business, Meta also had some momentum starting to build in the sales of its mixed reality headsets, such as Quest and Ray-Ban smart glasses. However, the operating losses in the Reality Labs division widened to $4.60 billion due to expenses increasing 15% in this division. Management guided for a further meaningful increase in expenses within Reality Labs in 2024. While this could act as a deadweight for the company from a margin standpoint, I expect the sustained momentum in its overall ad business to continue to pull the company ahead and offset the losses in the Reality Labs division.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the earnings front, Meta's net profits more than tripled from a year ago to $14 billion, or $5.30 in earnings per share. As such, the company beat earnings expectations by over 7%. As if these results were not enough to entice the markets, Meta also announced it will begin rewarding investors with a 50 cent dividend, which, on an annualized basis, works out to a roughly 0.50% yield. On top of that, the company announced a $50 billion buyback.\n\nI believe Meta decided to reward its investors with buybacks and its first ever dividend because fiscal 2023 was a monumental year where its cash and cash equivalent items grew a massive 61%.\n\nAd platform saw wider adoption with new AI and automation tools\n\nSo far, management has demonstrated its ability to reassess priorities and build on its business strengths to return cash to shareholders. According to my analysis, I believe Meta was well positioned to do so because management turned its attention back to reinvigorating growth in its core online ads business rather than continue to deploy resources solely toward building the metaverse.\n\nIn my opinion, the key to monitoring Meta's future growth expectations will come from watching trends in its ad metrics, such as ad impressions and prices paid per ad. My reasoning is that it is primarily an ad-based business, with ads being served across its social media platforms. While monitoring user growth is an important indicator that suggests higher potential reach per ad on Meta's social networks, over time the efficiency of the ad targeting came into question.\n\nHowever, Meta was able to drive innovative changes to its ad tools to provide marketers with better ways to target users on its platforms, increasing the relevancy of ads served to its users. With the proliferation of artificial intelligence last year, Meta has become a frontrunner in the space by launching many open-source machine learning models. But on a more immediate basis, I observed how the company demonstrated agency by rapidly deploying AI capabilities into its ad tools for its enterprise customers, offering higher productivity.\n\nIn August 2022, the company launched Advantage , which allowed advertisers to automate many steps of the ad creative process, thus optimizing ad campaigns for marketers on the platform. Through the months that followed, Meta followed up with its innovation strategy by infusing AI into ad-based tools to further improve productivity for its marketers and customers.\n\nI believe these improvements have been critical in driving improvements in ad impressions, as can be seen in the chart below. Ad impressions increased 21% on a year-over-year basis. I think this a significant performance in its ad business given the company already demonstrated strong growth in its ad impressions in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Outperformed, but Investors Are Getting Too Optimistic\n\nThe augmentation that I see in the ad dynamics, as seen in the chart above, also tells me how Meta is a huge beneficiary of the trends above. I have added another chart below that shows that Meta's revenue from its ad business was up almost 24% in the most recent quarter. Meta Platforms Outperformed, but Investors Are Getting Too Optimistic\n\nOn the fourth-quarter earnings call, management also noted how businesses have been leveraging messaging apps to directly connect with their consumers. I have attached some commentary from the call below that illustrates this:\n\n\"Meta is continuing to invest in new and engaging on-platform ad experiences. Business messaging remains a priority here. Click-to-message ads continue to grow and we're seeing advertisers increasingly use these ads to drive down-funnel conversions. Paid messaging is growing quickly and we're focused on broadening adoption in 2024 by making it easier for businesses to buy marketing messages, easily adopt our Flows product to develop richer in-thread experiences for consumers.\"\n\nAllowing businesses to purchase paid messaging ads and click-to-message ads broadens the scope of the ad impressions metric that we saw earlier in this section, which is monumental in driving higher advertising revenue growth for the company. In emerging markets such as India, many businesses have already started adopting broadcast messages to connect with consumers. This adds further support to my argument that paid messaging could be an immediate revenue driver for Meta this year.\n\nValuation looks stretched for now\n\nUnfortunately, despite all the positive developments in Meta's core ad business, my valuation models suggest investors have gotten too optimistic. After the earnings beat, I have assumed the higher end of the consensus estimates for the company's 2024 revenue and earnings. My non-GAAP operating income estimates also include management's guidance on costs and expenses, which they currently project at between $94 billion and $99 billion. Moreover, management expects to fill its employee recruiting backlog while still keeping the organization lean. Therefore, I have assumed an average share float over the past three years of 2.67 billion in my valuation model. Meta Platforms Outperformed, but Investors Are Getting Too Optimistic\n\nTaking these assumptions into account, I estimate Meta will grow its operating income at a compound annual rate of 13.30%, driven by increased efficiencies in its ad business and higher productivity from deploying AI capabilities across its ad tools. My models show investors have fully priced in Meta's growth for this year on the basis of the results and commentary from Meta's Q4 FY23 report.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nThe single biggest risk to Meta's growth outlook hinges on the global gross domestic product outlook. The IMF currently projects the world's GDP will rise 3% in 2024. I believe the U.S., India and China to be important contributors to the world's GDP. These regions are also important for Meta's business. For example, Meta Chief Financial Officer Susan Li added in her prepared remarks that Meta benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets,\" while also mentioning that revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue.\"\n\nChinese e-commerce companies like Shein and PDD-owned (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu have been investing their ad dollars heavily into Meta's ad platforms throughout 2023. If the pace of ad business from Chinese e-commerce companies materially slows down, this could be a slight headwind to Meta's business. Moreover, if the growth outlook for any of these regions or the global GDP outlook were to deteriorate, the company's revenue would be severely impacted due to lower ad spend on its platform.\n\nIn addition to the global GDP outlook risks, many countries that are core to Meta's business also have elections this year. India will have its elections in May, followed by the U.S. elections at the end of the year. This may cause some volatility in the stock.\n\nFinally, Meta has a history of facing regulatory headwinds from sovereign authorities on a global scale. The FTC is still pursuing an antitrust case accusing the company of suppressing competition. If the FTC wins its case, it may have a significant impact on Meta's business and financial results.\n\nConclusion\n\nThere is no doubt Meta has enjoyed the success of achieving a turnaround in its ad business while also benefiting from improving growth outlooks in the U.S. and global economy. I am encouraged by the efficiency that management has demonstrated. However, the company's share price seems to have already priced in optimism from its fourth-quarter results.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Alphabet's Culture Issue Is Worse Than Its Earnings Issue",
        "content": "Google's parent company, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL), reported earnings on Jan. 30. Although revenue grew by double digits, the stock was down after the report because ad sales growth was slower than analysts' expectations. Google search and YouTube ads revenue had healthy double-digit growth, but the Google Network segment's revenue declined 2% year over year. Combined, Google ad revenue grew 11% year over year.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nCompared to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet's results were clearly disappointing.\n\nI have followed big U.S. and Chinese technology companies for more than 10 years now. I remember back in 2014, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and Alphabet both seemed invincible. But now, both companies are running into trouble. In my opinion, both Alibaba and Alphabet's biggest challenge is culture, which ironically used to be their strength. In the past I've written about Alibaba's cultural crisis. In this discussion, I will focus on Alphabet's culture with discussions of both its pros and cons.\n\nSummary of Alphabet's culture\n\nDuring the 2018 Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A) (NYSE:BRK.B) shareholder meeting, the late Charlie Munger commented on Alphabet's culture. He said, \"I've been to Google headquarters. It looked to me like a kindergarten.\" Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) added, \"A very rich kindergarten.\"\n\nI agree with Munger and Buffett's observations about Google because I have also been to its headquarters a few times. Personally I wouldn't use the word kindergarten to describe it, but the atmosphere is certainly very laid-back with plenty of on-site facilities. This atmosphere was designed from day one to help facilitate creativity, as laid out by Google's very first founders' letter, which states the following:\n\nGoogle is not a conventional company. We do not intend to become one. Throughout Google's evolution as a privately held company, we have managed Google differently. We have also emphasized an atmosphere of creativity and challenge, which has helped us provide unbiased, accurate and free access to information for those who rely on us around the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving the best talent is key to Alphabet's business model. To attract the best talent, the company created the unconventional decentralized atmosphere and offered the highest compensation package in the industry. As a result, it has always had a very high win-rate when recruiting talent. Once the best engineers join the company, they have maximum amount of flexibility and enjoy tremendous benefits such as a free gym, snacks, diverse on-site restaurants and much more. In other words, everything is taken care of by Alphabet. This is probably why Munger and Buffett call it a kindergarten.\n\nThis culture worked very well in the early years. I remember during my first visit to Google campus in 2014, I was really impressed by the open and vibrant culture. For a long time, this was key to Alphabet's moat.\n\nThe main issues with Alphabet's culture\n\nLike all other big tech companies, Alphabet grew its employee base rapidly over the past decade as its business continued to expand. In 2014, the company had only 53,600 employees. By the end of 2022, the number of employees had ballooned to 190,234. Inevitably, more employees means more bureaucracy. This is true for all big tech companies. The company realized it had too many employees so, for the first time in its history, it implemented layoffs, which decreased the employee count to 182,381 as of the latest quarter.\n\nBut bureaucracy is not Alphabet's main cultural issue. I think the biggest issue with its culture is complacency and sloth, which ironically is the accumulated result of the decentralized and creative culture it is proud of. It is analogous to spoiling your children. The best way to destroy a talented child is to spoil him or her with easy-to-get luxuries. For many years, Alphabet's engineers have been used to this hands-off and laid-back approach of management. This approach works as long as the business is booming. But once the competition picks up, Alphabet's culture can be detrimental. It is like going to war with an army of soldiers who are rusty at essential military skills.\n\nAnother issue with the company's culture is its lack of flexibility in terms of product design and development, which resulted in less user-friendly products. The best example is the cloud business. Alphabet developed the cloud technology years before Amazon. But Alphabet's product is not user-friendly at all because its engineers are not used to listening to customer feedback. Therefore, Alphabet's cloud business has grown much slower than Amazon and Microsoft. I'm concerned the company will repeat this problem again with Bard, which is its version of a conversational artificial intelligence tool.\n\nLast but not least, I think Alphabet is facing a problem of cultural division. This was inevitable as the company grew its employee base. To be fair, most big tech companies will face this problem. But with Alphabet, the issue is particularly severe because it is more open than the other tech companies. Therefore, there are fewer rules governing employee behaviors, which makes it harder for management to reconcile differences.\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet's earnings release is disappointing, but not too bad. For long-term investors, the more concerning issue is its culture. Unless management takes dramatic action, the cultural issues are here to stay. Fortunately, Sundar Pichai has realized the culture issues and has taken steps to address them. It remains to be seen whether he can successfully tackle them in the future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "3 Dividend-Paying Tech Stocks to Buy in February",
        "content": "When a lot of investors think about tech stocks, their minds don't typically go straight to dividends. Tech stocks are known for their stock price growth potential. But investors shouldn't ignore the income potential.\n\nWith volatility being as much a part of the stock market as stocks themselves, dividends can provide reliable income despite stock price movements. For investors interested in tech stocks that can provide dependable income, the following three are good options to add to your portfolio.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nYou're not alone if you're not used to seeing Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and the word \"dividend\" together. That's because Meta never offered a dividend until it announced one on Feb. 1 with its 2023 fourth-quarter and full-year earnings report.\n\nMeta's first-ever dividend will be $0.50 per share, payable on March 26, to investors with shares as of the close of business on February 22.\n\nDespite some missteps and bad PR over the past few years, Meta remains a cash cow. It made $134.9 billion in revenue in 2023, up 16% from a year ago. Its net income growth outpaced revenue, growing 69% in a year to just over $39 billion. This is a sign Meta is operating more efficiently, which has been a major goal for the company recently. META Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nMETA Revenue (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nMeta currently has over $80 billion authorized for share buybacks, which will likely boost shareholder value in the coming years, even with the stock trading at 52-week highs. As Meta continues to expand its customer base and become more competitive in the digital ad industry, it has avenues to continue its growth.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Meta made $11.5 billion in free cash flow. That's more than enough to cover the dividend obligation for its 2.57 billion outstanding shares. There shouldn't be any questions about the company's ability to sustain (and increase) its new dividend going forward.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC, is one of the world's most valuable tech companies. However, the average person might not know that because the company operates behind the scenes. TSMC is a semiconductor foundry that produces semiconductors for other companies to use in their own products. Its chips are in smartphones, cars, and dozens of other electronics.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe semiconductor industry is cyclical. When demand for electronics rises, semiconductor companies typically see increased orders; when demand for electronics falls, semiconductor sales typically follow. The industry has been on the downturn of this cycle for the past couple of years with inflation and rising interest rates, but signs point to this reversing soon with a rebound in smartphone and PC sales. TSM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nTSM Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) data by YCharts\n\nTSMC's quarterly dividend is $0.48, with a yield currently around 1.6%. It may not be the most impressive yield, but it's still more than the S&P 500 average. TSMC has explicitly said it's committed to its cash dividend, so investors can be confident in its reliability. It began paying a dividend in 2004, and has never reduced it.\n\nTSMC plays a critical role in the tech ecosystem, and its top-of-the-line chips give it a competitive advantage that won't be easily surpassed.\n\n3. AT&T\n\nThere aren't many tech stocks more sought after for their dividends than telecom giant AT&T (NYSE: T). When AT&T spun off its WarnerMedia business in early 2022, it slashed its dividend in half to $0.2775 per share. Even then, it remained one of the highest-yielding dividend stocks in the S&P 500 -- and still is, with a trailing 12-month yield of around 6.4%.\n\nIt's a good thing AT&T offers an attractive dividend, because its stock price has been lackluster over the past decade. Luckily for investors, the worst days may be behind AT&T. Instead of spreading itself thin, a refocus on its core wireless and internet businesses has gotten the business back on the right track. Its recent wireless and Fiber growth has been impressive.\n\nAT&T is a top player in an industry that has become vital to everyday American life. AT&T isn't going anywhere, and judging from its recent jump in free cash flow, neither is its dividend. In 2023, AT&T made $16.8 billion in free cash flow. That's $2.6 billion more than in 2022 and more than enough to cover its dividend and debt obligations.\n\nInvestors shouldn't anticipate an increase in AT&T's dividend (although it's not out of the question), but a yield routinely above 6% makes it an attractive option for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "7 Timeless Tech Stocks to Buy and Never Let Go",
        "content": "As we enter February 2024, it’s a good time to reevaluate our portfolios and ensure we’re positioned for long-term growth. Tech stocks have been some of the best performers over the past two decades, with massive shifts towards AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing propelling future gains. While I often cover intriguing under-the-radar names, today I want to discuss seven timeless tech stocks that should form the enduring core of your portfolio.\n\nMany of us get distracted chasing the latest hot tech stock, but making emotional snap decisions often leads us astray. Instead, I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on tech stalwarts with proven track records, dominant market positions, and secular growth trends that will drive revenue growth for years to come. These stocks may lack sky-high glamor but offer resilience and steady gains that outweigh short-term hype. Let’s take a look!\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs we kick off 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of my highest conviction long-term holds. This tech titan has been firing on all cylinders under Satya Nadella’s leadership, which is evidenced by its meteoric rise to become the world’s most valuable company. If you look at Microsoft’s stock chart over the past decade, it paints a picture of outstanding compound growth that I expect to continue flowing in shareholders’ brokerage accounts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft struck gold by funding OpenAI, providing immense leverage over ChatGPT and other coveted AI models set to penetrate the mainstream. Cloud computing has also fueled tremendous growth lately, with no signs of slowing as enterprises rapidly migrate more workloads to Azure. Microsoft also wields additional leverage in nascent quantum computing, aggressive gaming pursuits, and flourishing subscription services. This diversified tech giant consistently makes the right moves to drive revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite steep gains, Microsoft still trades at a reasonable 36.5-times earnings. I think that’s a cheap valuation, relative to its quality and growth prospects. For a dominant firm generating $62 billion in quarterly sales and 18% year-over-year growth, I believe this multiple remains attractive for long-horizon investors. Indeed, MSFT stock deserves a premium valuation given its expanding moat and history of adapting to industry shifts decade after decade.\n\nIn short, Microsoft checks all the boxes: visionary leadership, AI/cloud secular trends, reasonable valuation, fortress balance sheet, and a demonstrated capacity to penetrate new markets. That’s why I urge accumulating MSFT stock hand over fist if you have a 10-20-year investment horizon.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been largely overlooked amid the AI hype cycle, but don’t sleep on this cash cow. Despite recent lackluster stock returns compared to big tech peers, GOOG stock has still rallied 22.5% annually over the past decade. Google’s Bard debacle also overshadowed that YouTube monetization is hitting its long-awaited stride.\n\nAfter decades of patience with YouTube’s ad potential, Alphabet is finally squeezing money from its neglected golden goose. Blocking ad blockers and adding more premium features like enhanced bitrate has allowed Google to pull all the right profitability leverage. Notably, these levers are being pulled while Alphabet enjoys unrivaled competitive moats around YouTube and Search. These platforms drive significant profit margins and serve billions of users each month. Sustainable double-digit growth is likely for years to come.\n\nToday, the company’s revenue sits at $307.4 billion, up 10% year over year. With YouTube pitching in $9.2 billion last quarter alone, Google has barely scratched the surface of maximizing this asset. Its latest Gemini AI upgrade also aims to challenge OpenAI’s model in capability. Even if inferior, don’t underestimate Google’s ability to monetize AI with its wealth of data and domains.\n\nFor a dominant firm increasing sales 10%+ annually, GOOG stock’s valuation multiple of 21-times forward earnings seems reasonable, given its history of over-delivering. This is a buy-and-hold-forever stock if I’ve ever seen one.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of underappreciated monetization efforts, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has executed a phenomenal turnaround since the pandemic lows. After subscriber declines and fears it would stay permanently impaired, Netflix made savvy strategic moves that reinvigorated growth and turbocharged its earnings power over the past year.\n\nIt turns out those pandemic pull-forwards masked Netflix’s secular shift toward pricing power. Successfully cracking down on rampant password sharing, hiking subscription fees, and attracting wealthier customers have allowed impressive gains since my bullish call in November 2022. Additionally, Netflix is adding subscribers at a healthy clip, now that the dead weight has fallen off.\n\nWith market-leading originals fueling must-have exclusivity and no viable competitors at scale, I believe Netflix enjoys immense latitude to drive further average revenue per user gains in Western markets. There’s still a long runway left for growth in emerging countries, even if a recession temporarily cools subscription momentum.\n\nI estimate Netflix will expand operating margins back to 25% within a few years from 16% currently, fueling 20%+ annual earnings per share growth for the foreseeable future. The market has turned too bearish here just as Netflix enters its golden age. I suggest buying more on any dips – this comeback story has plenty of gas left in the tank, both fundamentally and optically, now that positive sentiment has returned.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been pounding the table on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) for two years now, first calling it a “buy” around $112 in 2022. In October 2023, I projected a move to $400 per share by 2024, driven by ad revenue resilience and metaverse potential. We fell a bit short, since META ended 2023 near $350, but it now trades around $460 per share post-market as of writing.\n\nFour months ago, I said,\n\n“Meta does not pay a dividend, unlike many mature tech stocks, and its valuation seems fair based on 2023 estimates. If Meta did return cash to shareholders instead of investing heavily in its metaverse vision, a dividend could make it more appealing for long-term investors.”\n\nJust as I suggested last fall, Meta announced a quarterly 50 cent per share dividend hours ago (as of writing), alongside a $50 billion share buyback authorization. This capital return program demonstrates management’s confidence in continued free cash flow generation even with heavy Reality Labs investment dragging on earnings. The dividend also sets a new tone for Meta as a shareholder-friendly tech giant capable of balancing growth prospects with delivering direct value today.\n\nI’m not going to backpedal now that META stock is trading where it is. That price tag still looks attractive for long-term investors due to the new buyback program and dividend. The company’s core advertising business boasts tremendous staying power thanks to unrivaled user engagement and data advantages. Meanwhile, Metaverse initiatives will bear fruit over the next decade across consumer and enterprise applications.\n\nPatience has already paid off for believers in this dominant social media ecosystem. Now, income and buybacks provide extra incentives alongside an improving growth narrative. I suggest buying more META stock, and holding forever. My October bull case assumed $500 per share by the end of 2025. I think $600 is achievable now.\n\nIs that a stretch? We’ll see.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother veteran tech company making strides lately is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which I flagged a year ago, saying, “IBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain.”\n\nSure enough, Big Blue is back after years of sluggishness. Strategic imperatives like hybrid cloud, security, and AI now generate most of IBM’s sales. Quantum hardware remains a key differentiator, too – IBM recently unveiled its new 433-qubit Osprey processor while competitors are far behind.\n\nUp 37% in one year, IBM seems to be regaining its groove. The company’s cloud, AI/ML, quantum, and blockchain segments indicate an effective pivot toward the most promising future technologies. Renewed revenue growth and expanding margins further cement my confidence. IBM should keep outpacing as enterprises quest to extract value from data across hybrid environments.\n\nTesla (TSLA) A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla (TSLA) store with several vehicles visible behind a glass door\n\nSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.com\n\nShifting gears, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has endured a painful stretch along with the broader electric vehicle complex. TSLA stock is down 24% just since 2024 began as spiking rates, inflation, and gloomy macro forecasts create strong headwinds for automakers. Competition is also heating up, with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) quickly moving up the ranks in terms of global EV sales.\n\nNonetheless, I remain staunchly bullish on Tesla over any investment horizon beyond 12-18 months. At less than $190 per share, as I write this, TSLA stock trades at the cheapest valuation I’ve seen since April 2023.\n\nRates won’t stay high forever. Inflation continues to moderate, as well. Once economic storm clouds clear, Tesla will still provide immense growth potential as the de facto leader of a rapidly-emerging mobility market. China’s production issues should sort themselves out over time, too. This creates a compelling risk/reward setup for patient investors.\n\nI expect TSLA stock to regain $300+ per share within two years as macro drags fade and the company’s vertical integration engine kicks back into high gear. EV penetration still stands very low globally. Thus, Tesla remains the best EV option to capitalize on mainstream adoption.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast and admittedly, the least conviction pick from my end, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world’s most valuable public company (depending on the day) has essentially traded sideways for six months now, absent any compelling growth narrative. iPhone sales still dominate the company’s top line, while tablets, personal computers, and wearables contribute much less individually. Unfortunately, streaming remains a money pit.\n\nRumors suggest the company is cooking up an autonomous electric vehicle behind closed doors. However, I wouldn’t bank on such a product moving the needle soon, even if released eventually. Meanwhile, Apple has largely remained on the AI sidelines, forfeiting major performance potential versus peers aggressively pursuing this vertical.\n\nNonetheless, shares seem reasonably valued at around 30-times earnings. The company’s Services and Accessories segments continue to grow nicely as Apple’s installed base marches higher. While unlikely to rally sharply anytime soon, I don’t see much downside risk to AAPL stock either. Steady dividend increases and buybacks are likely to provide extra support.\n\nFor now, Apple looks stuck in the mud – an acceptable hold, but not one I’m excited to buy more of amid fierce sector rotation. Still, its fortress balance sheet and ecosystem stickiness should prevent meaningful underperformance if tech stabilizes. I rank AAPL stock a tepid buy simply due to its relative resilience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goodbye Bears! 7 Winning Stocks to Buy for a Booming Economy.",
        "content": "If you go to certain corners of YouTube, targeting winning stocks for a booming economy is simply out of the question. The sky is falling, martial law will be declared and it’s time to buy gold, guns and patriot seeds. And there’s absolutely nothing wrong with being prepared. However, being too prepared for a negative outcome could lead to a disastrous opportunity cost.\n\nBecause if we’re looking at the data, going after winning stocks for a booming economy seems prudent. For one thing, the fourth-quarter GDP number came in at a 3.3% annualized rate, well above Wall Street’s estimate for a 2% gain. As well, the latest January jobs report showed that the economy added 353,000 jobs, better than the projected 185,000 increase.\n\nOf course, having said all that, a correction could materialize. So, it’s important to be sensible amid the optimism. Still, if we’re looking at the hard data, circumstances look rather auspicious for the time being. On that note, below are winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDraftKings (DKNG) Person holding smartphone with logo of US sports betting company DraftKings Inc. (DKNG) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOnline sports betting specialist DraftKings (NASDAQ:DKNG) might seem an odd idea for winning stocks for a booming economy. Don’t get me wrong, I believe the sports betting segment is a growing one and offers long-term upside opportunities. However, DraftKings also has competition in the form of FanDuel parent Flutter Entertainment (NYSE:FLUT). Still, the market could be big enough for the both of them.\n\nAccording to Grand View Research, the global sports betting market reached $83.65 billion in 2022. Further, analysts anticipate that the segment could expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 10.3% from 2023 to 2030. At the end of the forecast period, the sector could print revenue of $182.12 billion. Right now, DraftKings has a market capitalization of around $19 to $20 billion. Flutter is looking at around $37 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, certain states – especially the big two of California and Texas – do not allow sports betting. However, with so much pressure related to adult liberties and freedom of choice and all that jazz, it may be inevitable that these two will cave. If so, that makes DKNG – and FLUT – winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nToyota (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo repeat the mantra, electric vehicles are the future. And automotive manufacturing giant Toyota (NYSE:TM) wants a piece of the pie, pivoting toward EVs in recent years. However, the company wants to make the pivot the smart way. It’s not giving up on its combustion-engine acumen entirely and that may be a wise choice. After all, the stranding of EVs caught in extreme winter weather proves that the old platform is still viable.\n\nFurther, Toyota is hard at work experimenting with alternative promising technologies. For example, the company produced a new water electrolyzer to produce hydrogen. Given some of the weather-related concerns tied to EVs, this could yield a viable solution. However, it’s no slouch in the EV department, making significant progress on its possibly revolutionary solid-state battery. If the battery reaches commercial development, we’re talking about a range of 750 miles.\n\nPlus, a company like Toyota has the capability to scale production for average-income drivers. That should give it an edge of many other pure-play EV companies. As a result, TM should be on your radar for winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith so much talk about generative artificial intelligence, we have seen the usual suspects rise higher. And by that, I’m talking about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). However, it’s also time to give Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) some love. For sure, the company has received a ton of adoration – just look at its performance over the past year. Also, it announced a dividend for the first time.\n\nFurther, Meta is relevant for its social media network Facebook, which doubles as a data goldmine. Also, it’s heavily involved in the metaverse and related accoutrements; that is, virtual reality headsets. However, it’s very much a player in the generative AI ecosystem. And that’s important because Bloomberg recently reported that this industry could clock in a valuation of $1.3 trillion by 2032.\n\nHowever, I really appreciate the practicality behind Meta’s AI endeavors. Back in October last year, Reuters reported that Meta began rolling out generative AI tools for all advertisers. This enables advertisers to create content and develop variations of written text. Basically, it adds substantive value-add for its all-important digital ad ecosystem.\n\nWith more discretionary dollars potentially available, META is one of the winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nCameco (CCJ) periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowing. Uranium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhile Cameco (NYSE:CCJ) may be somewhat controversial among some circles because of its nuclear energy specialty, it’s also an unavoidable reality. According to the International Energy Agency, nuclear power represents an important low-emission source of electricity, providing about 10% of global electricity generation. And that number could rise higher as global population trends increase.\n\nYes, we can all wax poetic about renewable energy and such infrastructures do represent viable ideas for winning stocks for a booming economy, as you’ll see later. However, it’s not possible to just rely on one source of energy production, especially with population growth and migration trends. Further, if our booming economy translates to upside for other regions, guess what? We’ll have more people consuming more resources.\n\nPlus, we didn’t talk about the uranium supply shortage situation. With major international players unable to adequately secure the commodities necessary for nuclear fuel production, we could be looking at production shortfalls through 2025. If so, CCJ represents a cynical but compelling idea for winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a hydrocarbon energy giant which can trace its heritage back to the iconic Standard Oil, Chevron (NYSE:CVX) might not strike investors as a contemporary example of winning stocks for a booming economy. Instead, modern investors may prefer a company specifically and exclusively tied to the renewable energy ecosystem. And again, there’s certainly a place for that. However, we shouldn’t ignore the oil and gas space.\n\nBasically, it comes down to this harsh reality: the world runs on oil. It’s not just an empty statement. According to a Forbes article, oil supplies 33% of all energy needs, making it the global economic machinery’s primary fuel. And yes, alternative energy sources have made significant progress. However, the trend isn’t going to dent oil’s dominance anytime soon.\n\nFurther, hydrocarbons benefit from a physical attribute: high energy density. What that means is that a gallon of gasoline can move an average modern car about 30 miles down the freeway whereas the equivalent jug of electrons can’t do the same for an EV. Given the importance of big oil, Chevron is one of the winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite all the talk about traditional energy sources, we can’t ignore the viability of renewable energy. And therefore, we have to talk about NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE). Fundamentally, we can’t sidestep the issue of climate change. It can be a controversial subject and there are many underlying political, ideological, and even religious currents backing certain positions. However, as mentioned earlier, we have to look at the data.\n\nAccording to NASA’s website, the vast majority of actively publishing climate scientists (that’s 97%) agree that human activities cause global warming and climate change. One mechanism to help address the problem is to support renewable energy infrastructures. And going green can also yield green.\n\nPer Precedence Research, the global renewable energy market reached a valuation of $970 billion in 2022. Further, the segment should reach an impressive $2.18 trillion by 2032. That comes out to a CAGR of 8.5% from 2023.\n\nLastly, analysts believe that NextEra could recover from its funk last year and eventually reach $70.09 per share. And that might be a modest target given the robust jobs market. Thus, NEE ranks among the winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother controversial idea for winning stocks for a booming economy, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is both beautiful and devastating. If you’re a consumer looking for the ultimate in retail convenience, it’s difficult to top the e-commerce-giant-turned-tech-overlord. However, if you’re a mom-and-pop retail store serving local communities across the U.S., you might feel differently. Still, the data is undeniable: Amazon just keeps winning.\n\nIf we just look at the retail component of its vast business empire, we find much to be bullish about. Specifically, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail transactions slipped from its pandemic peak to a low of 14.4% in Q2 2022. However, since then, this metric has steadily risen to 15.6% in Q3 of last year. What makes this statistic more impressive is that during this period, consumers pulled back their discretionary spending.\n\nJust look at the personal saving rate to a peak of 5.3% last year (in May). Back in December 2022, the personal saving rate was only 3.4%. So, with consumers much more confident about their financial prospects, AMZN should be one of the winning stocks for a booming economy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Move Over, Tesla: 5 Stocks That Could Take Its Place in the Magnificent Seven",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long been the odd duckling of the Magnificent Seven, the group of seven high-performing tech companies that have dominated the S&P 500 over the past year and change.\n\nUnlike the other six…\n\nCosts. Tesla makes its money from high-cost manufacturing, which depresses gross margins and lowers cash returns on investment. Auto manufacturing has never been – and likely will never be – “scalable” like software and other tech products. Competition. The firm is facing greater competition than the rest. Last month, China’s BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) overtook Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker. Innovation. And its CEO’s top innovations are often siphoned into separate entities like Neuralink (brain implants) and Starlink (worldwide internet coverage). Tesla’s only revenue stream beyond EVs is in solar power.\n\nTogether, that makes Tesla’s balance sheet look more like an industrial firm’s than a monopolistic tech giant. By focusing his company on high-cost production, Elon Musk has left Tesla looking more like a regular automaker than the world’s next disruptor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A chart showing TSLA's gross margins and estimated earnings against the other Magnificent 7 members.\n\nThat’s caused some problems for Tesla’s stock. Since January, its market capitalization has shrunk by a quarter. Most recent estimates peg U.S. EV growth at just 19% in 2024, down from a 45% jump the previous year, while potential competition from China could spoil the market further. Analysts believe Tesla will see its revenues rise just 14% this year, its slowest pace on record.\n\nBut what company could replace Tesla in the Magnificent Seven? Few firms have the same monopolistic bargaining power as the other six: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). And even fewer have the raw financial resources to catch up or build their own “moats” in the tech industry.\n\nNevertheless, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com – our free investment news site – have several ideas of which firms could replace the EV company. Even though Tesla still commands an outstanding A+ grade in my AI stock-grading system, MarketMasterAI, several pure-play tech firms could soon steal its place.\n\nStory continues\n\n5 Stocks to Replace Tesla: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched the MI300, a 3D “superchip” designed to take on Nvidia’s top AI products.\n\nThe design is groundbreaking. The new chip is roughly 30% faster than Nvidia’s top-of-the-line H100 design. And orders are already streaming in. AMD’s management estimates that sales will top $3.5 billion in the first year. That vaults AMD back into competition with Nvidia, a firm that currently ships 86% of the world’s AI accelerator chips.\n\nIt’s why InvestorPlace.com’s Tyrik Torres believes that AMD could become the “Next Big Thing for Chip Investors in 2024”:\n\nThe Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit… work to train large-language models, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said these chips are comparable to Nvidia’s H100 but are “better on the inferenc[ing].”\n\nAll of this means, while AMD shares have risen more than 136% over the past 12 months, there is still enough upside potential to get new investors interested.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees. This week, David Moadel warns that optimism over AMD stock could be getting out of hand:\n\nIf you’re a contrarian investor, you may bristle at the ultra-optimistic consensus associated with AMD. You’ll bristle even harder when you discover that AMD’s GAAP-measured trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 1,353x. That not a misprint…\n\nIn other words, I don’t recommend pressing your luck with AMD stock at its currently stretched valuation.\n\nAMD also faces an enormous uphill battle in AI acceleration software, an area that Nvidia has dominated for the past decade. Any software optimized for Nvidia’s CUDA platform needs to be rewritten for AMD’s open-sourced ROCm system.\n\nStill, AMD is an attractive alternative for cloud computing firms seeking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. And given AMD’s recent successes against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the X86 server business, don’t be surprised if this underdog soon gives Nvidia a run for its money.\n\n2. Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of networking giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) came within striking distance of Tesla’s market capitalization last week. The $20 billion difference was almost a rounding error for the $560 billion firm.\n\nBroadcom is the most likely company to eclipse Tesla’s value in the coming months. The high-value chip and software business is a provenly strong aggregator of firms, and AI has recently turbocharged its networking business. Analysts expect net income to grow double-digits this year, outpacing Tesla’s growth fourfold.\n\nThat’s because demand for networking and wireless chips has been insatiable. Vendors from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) have seen revenues for networking chips rise double digits in the past quarter, offsetting far slower growth in other areas. Charles Munyi at InvestorPlace.com notes that Broadcom is an “AI beneficiary [that] increased its dividend by 14% and will see significant free cash flow growth”. Paul La Monica adds that Broadcom is one of five mega-cap stocks that could turn the Magnificent Seven into the ”Dynamic Dozen.”\n\nOf course, several issues stand in Broadcom’s way.\n\nThe most obvious is that Broadcom focuses on high-tech enterprise sales, which is a historically cyclical business. Sales are expected to slow to single digits in 2026 as growth ebbs.\n\nBroadcom’s M&A strategy also faces headwinds. The semiconductor industry now trades at enormous premiums, which largely eliminates Broadcom’s historical ability to cheaply buy up smaller companies and wring out efficiencies.\n\nStill, investors might not care in the end. “Sorry, Tesla and Elon fans,” La Monica writes. “It looks like investors are finding other large-cap stocks to embrace so far in 2024.”\n\n3. Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound, the company’s response to Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. Studies found that Lilly’s entry was more effective at treating patients on average, with a regular dose helping people lose 25% of their weight.\n\nMuch of this news had already been anticipated. An earlier version of Eli Lilly’s weight-loss treatment, Mounjaro, had already been approved in 2022, and the company’s shares had already risen two-thirds in the year leading up to Zepbound’s approval.\n\nBut more upside is likely on the way. Today, roughly a third of Americans are overweight, and 36% are obese, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. These figures have more than doubled since 1980, driven by worsening diets and a spike in childhood obesity. Zepbound’s efficacy has also taken the medical world by storm.\n\nThat’s made Wall Street particularly bullish about Eli Lilly’s prospects. Analysts at Morningstar believe that drugs combating weight will generate $120 billion in revenues annually by 2031, split evenly between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nThe figure could be even higher. While the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services currently does not cover weight-loss medications, lobbying to get these drugs approved for coverage from the American Medical Association has been intense. The benefits of weight-loss drugs also extend to diabetes, heart disease, and other risk factors that will be difficult for CMS to argue away.\n\nIt’s why Alex Sirois highlights Eli Lilly this week at InvestorPlace.com for its “strong buy” rating on Wall Street. Chris Markoch went a step further in January, calling Eli Lilly a firm with “massive upside”:\n\nThe real upside for Eli Lilly comes from projected earnings. In the next 12 months, the company expects to see earnings grow by 89%. Much of this is due to the success of its GLP-1 weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nStill, investors will want to tread carefully. Eli Lilly trades at a significant premium to its fundamental value of roughly $450, so it will need to achieve multiple years of super-normal growth to justify its current $660 price tag.\n\n4. Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2022, Forbes writer Peter Cohan proclaimed that “FAANG Is Dead.” Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the “N” in that group, had fallen 70%, and few believed that the streaming giant could beat better-funded rivals like Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Amazon. The latter would splash out $715 million to launch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power streaming TV series later that year.\n\nBut it turns out it’s harder to beat Netflix than it might seem. Amazon’s Rings of Power proved to be a flop; only 37% of people who started the series finished it, according to a study by Forbes. And even Disney has struggled to maintain momentum. In its most recent quarter, the media giant revealed that domestic paid subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service had increased by only 1% quarter-over-quarter. Disney-owned Hulu lost 100,000 online subscribers.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix has continued to push ahead. On Jan. 26, the firm revealed that subscribers had increased 5.3% quarter-over-quarter and 12.7% year-over-year. Margins have also expanded, rising from 7% to 16.9% in a year. Netflix now has roughly as many viewers as Prime Video and Disney/Hulu combined.\n\nIt’s why Netflix tops Joel Baglole’s list at InvestorPlace.com of “3 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.” In an update this week, Baglole notes how Netflix is not only reasserting itself as the world’s dominant streaming company, but also the only profitable one:\n\nAs of yesterday, NFLX stock is up 12% after another strong earnings print. Growing subscription numbers are driving the share price higher. In the last six months, the stock has gained 30%, including an 18% rise so far in 2024. News that the company added 13.1 million net new subscribers in Q4 of 2023 has shifted the share price into overdrive.\n\nOf course, an investment in Netflix comes with several risks. Firstly, subscriber growth will slow in 2024 as the benefits of cracking down on password sharing rolls off. Secondly, the firm is reaching saturation in the U.S. and Canadian markets, where roughly 55% of households already subscribe.\n\nFinally, valuations are relatively stretched based on the financial resources Netflix must pour into content creation. A bottom-up valuation prices the streaming firm’s stock closer to $450, well below its current $565 market price.\n\nStill, Netflix and most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have long shown that high-growth companies can often grow fast enough to fill in their valuations. With Disney and other competitors struggling, Netflix could take Tesla’s “Magnificent” crown.\n\n5. Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final pick to become the next “Magnificent Seven” stock comes down to four stocks:\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nEach of these firms dominates its industry and has gross margins that exceed 70%. They’re also fast-growing, with earnings growth expected to top 15% this year. In other words, all look much like a Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nEach also has its fans at InvestorPlace.com. Salesforce is favored by Michael Que for its GenAI-powered tools. Marc Guberti prefers Adobe for its relatively favorable valuations. And Luke Lango prefers Intuit for its strong AI tool set that is launching just in time for the 2024 tax year. (subscription required).\n\nMy favorite, however, is Visa, a company that has quietly become one of the fastest growing blue-chip stocks on the market. And here’s why I recommend it above all others.\n\nIn August 2023, my MarketMasterAI system began awarding Visa the top A+ score. And by December, the payments firm had risen into the Top 5.\n\nA look under the hood quickly reveals the reason. MarketMasterAI uses analyst estimates (among other data points) to predict how markets will perform over the next six months. And these figures have been steadily rising for the past several months, especially among consumer-focused firms. Earnings-per-share estimates for 2024 at cruise firm Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), a bell-weather of U.S. consumer demand, have surged from $6 at the start of 2023 to $9.30 today. Airlines, home builders, and other cyclical firms are seeing similar upgrades.\n\nThat tells us that payment firms like Visa should perform marvelously over the next six months. Payment companies rely on rising spending, and we’re currently seeing a “goldilocks” environment of strong consumption and low default rates. Cross-border transactions are also returning on rising international travel. This is a particularly lucrative source of profits for firms like Visa and should keep margins high going into 2025.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Visa remains a monopolistic business that’s riding a secular wave of electronic payments. Its services are accepted almost universally, and its ubiquity in the financial system means it doesn’t matter whether consumers use credit, debit, or mobile for payments. As long as consumers are ditching cash, Visa will benefit.\n\nThat makes Visa stand out from the rest. It’s fast growing, lucrative, and able to maintain its leading position with virtually no effort. In other words, a perfect “Magnificent Seven” stock.\n\nThe Real Magnificent Seven\n\nFans of old Westerns will have doubtlessly watched the 1960 movie The Magnificent Seven, an adaptation of the 1954 Japanese epic Seven Samurai. In it, the ensemble cast, including Steve McQueen and James Coburn, join forces to defend a village against a gang of bandits.\n\n[Mild spoiler alert] The fortunes of the seven vary wildly. Some survive the encounter, while others do not. The movie’s winding script, which leaned heavily on the Japanese original, is a masterclass on keeping viewers guessing.\n\nThis is probably not what Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett thought when he coined the term “Magnificent Seven” to describe America’s top tech stocks at the time. To the uninitiated, the phrase sounds more like a “can’t lose” list of investments.\n\nLife, however, often mimics art. Tesla’s 2030 bonds now trade at 82 cents on the dollar, depressed by fears of an EV slowdown. And analysts have cut their earnings per share estimates by 20% on average over the past 30 days.\n\nThat’s why Louis Navellierlaunches a new video this week that details how to navigate this new normal. In it, he reveals the Quantum Cashproject, his newly upgraded AI-powered income system. Quantum Cash recently paid out a $3,375 windfall in a one-month time frame… $4,650 in three months… $11,925 in five months… and $16,875 in 11 months.\n\nSo, if you’re feeling a little behind in your retirement savings and want to build a second income stream (even if you have a smaller portfolio)… consider setting aside five minutes of your time to watch Louis’ critical broadcast, here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held a LONG position in shares in GOOG and GOOGL.

        "content": "Facebook and Instagram users will start seeing labels on AI-generated images that appear on their social media feeds, part of a broader tech industry initiative to sort between what’s real and not.\n\nMeta said Tuesday it's working with industry partners on technical standards that will make it easier to identify images and eventually video and audio generated by artificial intelligence tools.\n\nWhat remains to be seen is how well it will work at a time when it's easier than ever to make and distribute AI-generated imagery that can cause harm — from election misinformation to nonconsensual fake nudes of celebrities.\n\n“It's kind of a signal that they’re taking seriously the fact that generation of fake content online is an issue for their platforms,” said Gili Vidan, an assistant professor of information science at Cornell University. It could be “quite effective” in flagging a large portion of AI-generated content made with commercial tools, but it won't likely catch everything, she said.\n\nMeta's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, didn’t specify Tuesday when the labels would appear but said it will be “in the coming months” and in different languages, noting that a “number of important elections are taking place around the world.”\n\n“As the difference between human and synthetic content gets blurred, people want to know where the boundary lies,” he said in a blog post.\n\nMeta already puts an “Imagined with AI” label on photorealistic images made by its own tool, but most of the AI-generated content flooding its social media services comes from elsewhere.\n\nA number of tech industry collaborations, including the Adobe-led Content Authenticity Initiative, have been working to set standards. A push for digital watermarking and labeling of AI-generated content was also part of an executive order that U.S. President Joe Biden signed in October.\n\nClegg said that Meta will be working to label “images from Google, OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, and Shutterstock as they implement their plans for adding metadata to images created by their tools.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle said last year that AI labels are coming to YouTube and its other platforms.\n\n\"In the coming months, we’ll introduce labels that inform viewers when the realistic content they’re seeing is synthetic,” YouTube CEO Neal Mohan reiterated in a year-ahead blog post Tuesday.\n\nOne potential concern for consumers is if tech platforms get more effective at identifying AI-generated content from a set of major commercial providers but miss what's made with other tools, creating a false sense of security.\n\n“There’s a lot that would hinge on how this is communicated by platforms to users,” said Cornell's Vidan. “What does this mark mean? With how much confidence should I take it? What is its absence supposed to tell me?”",

        "title": "7 Surprising Growth Stocks Ready to Crush Earnings Expectations in February",
        "content": "The biggest growth stocks – Meta (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), etc – posted top-tier earnings to kickstart 2024, sending the S&P 500 climbing back to all-time highs. But, of course, a major criticism is that most of the overall market today is held aloft by those same top tech stocks. The Magnificent Seven stocks, which include earnings report winners like Meta and Amazon, accounted for most of last year’s market gains, and early indicators point to the trend continuing.\n\nThat’s great for index investors – until it isn’t. Over-concentration also means overexposure, and it’ll just take a brief pause in momentum among those top tech stocks to bring markets crashing back down. That’s why diversifying into additional growth stocks now, while there’s still a chance, is needed if you want to protect your portfolio from the ups and downs of a handful of mega-caps.\n\nLuckily, the Mag 7 aren’t the only growth stocks set to post strong earnings this season. These seven stand to do the same, and investors cycling out of overexposed positions would do well to consider them as alternatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify Technology (SPOT)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (Pre-Market) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify Technology (NYSE:SPOT) is already front-running an expectedly strong earnings report. Last week, shares jumped by about 3% on the heels of a strong analyst assessment and upgrade from UBS. The note included a bullish view of SPOT’s margin management and an ultimate price target of $247 per share. That marks more than 10% upside from today’s per-share pricing – not bad considering the company already has a $43.4 billion market cap.\n\nSPOT’s February 6th earnings report comes after December’s widespread layoffs, including a 17% staff reduction before the holidays. While the timing wasn’t ideal, it points to an overall trend that investors should watch closely: far from a bearish indicator, layoffs among growth stocks previously subject to ZIRP-era headcount bloat are signs of adaptive and effective management. And, in a unique sign of honesty, Spotify’s CEO Denial Ek pointed to exactly that sentiment in his note to employees, saying, “In 2020 and 2021, we took advantage of the opportunity presented by lower-cost capital [but] we now find ourselves in a very different environment.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEk offered a breath of fresh air in a sector awash with corporate doublespeak, and early signs point to his honesty and practicality paying off in this week’s earnings.\n\nGrowth Stocks: Enphase Energy (ENPH)\n\nEarnings Date: Tuesday, February 6th (After Hours) Smartphone with logo of American company company Enphase Energy Inc. (ENPH) on screen in front of business website. Focus on left of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSolar stocks might not seem the safest bet among growth stocks this earnings season, but Enphase Energy’s (NASDAQ:ENPH) long-term potential and apparent undervaluation make it an exception. The company is, of course, unique among commercial and residential competitors in that its core focus is in its proprietary microinverter tech. However slim, this establishes a moat for ENPH that helps the company stay afloat even as broader green tech sectors lag.\n\nMarkets are generally pricing in low expectations for ENPH, and shares are down nearly 30% since the year started. And, while past results might align with bearish expectations, the company’s forward-looking outlook could be a catalyst to reinvigorate investor enthusiasm. Investors should pay close attention to international developments, as overseas segments have been Enphase’s best-performing markets and are less afflicted by U.S.-centric consumer trends eschewing solar.\n\n2022’s Inflation Reduction Act put wind into Enphase’s sails, and there’s a non-zero chance that this election cycle holds similar benefits and opportunities for Enphase and the wider clean energy industry. With that in mind, alongside the company’s per-share plummet, it’s hard to say Enphase isn’t worth a buy today compared to many growth stocks.\n\nArm Holdings (ARM)\n\nEarnings Date: Wednesday, February 7th (After Hours) The Arm logo seen at semiconductor and software design company Arm Holdings' US Headquarters in San Jose, California. ARM IPO\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nI was admittedly bearish on Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM), but it seems as though this is one stock that’s beating back competition and rising against all odds. Most of my negative outlook came from the company’s poor showing during its second-ever public earnings report, which included an adjusted earnings loss of 11 cents per share. At the time, management claimed that most of the loss was due to share-based compensation post-IPO and that future reports would be better since they wouldn’t include the one-time event series.\n\nMarkets seem to be taking that assertion seriously, and shares climbed more than 15% since its poor November showing. And its outlook is bright, considering Arm is pushing to expand its offerings to include chips integral to AI, automated vehicles, and cloud computing. Today, the company is hot within the mobile phone segment but that doesn’t offer the full breadth of income opportunity hotter sectors do – so Arm is smart to make like competitor growth stocks and expand its view to include next-gen tech.\n\nGrowth Stocks: Sharkninja (SN)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 15th (Pre-Market) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’m a Sharkninja (NYSE:SN) mega-bull, but somehow, this company continues to slide below collective investor radar. That’s likely because most don’t see consumer retail companies as offering the same upside as growth stocks, but Sharkninja has a trajectory that defies conventional wisdom. The appliance manufacturer’s shares rose 60% over the past 6 months, and a strong holiday sales season could boost it further after next week’s earnings report.\n\nSharkninja has posted a 20% CAGR since 2008, and its growth rate increased to 26% annually since 2018. That trend isn’t likely to slow, considering economic conditions for the holiday sales season proved better than expected. Likewise, the company’s rapid international expansion helps protect it against lackluster sales stateside and further reinforces its wide market share for ice cream makers, vacuums, blenders, and more.\n\nExpert analysts are generally bullish on the stock, with collective consensus marking it a Moderate Buy.\n\nAlteryx (AYX)\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 8th (TBD) The Alteryx (AYX) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlteryx (NYSE:AYX) is unique in that not only does it stand among growth stocks poised to post strong earnings, but it’s also one of the few “sure bet” merger arbitrage plays in today’s market. Private equity firm Clearlake Capital Group is set to buy Alteryx and take it private sometime in the first half of this year. The deal’s per-share price is $48.25, or just below 2% of today’s pricing. That represents an immediate opportunity to lock in gains, however meager, once the deal closes.\n\nSome estimates expect Alteryx’s imminent earnings report to post a 37% year-over-year income increase and a 12% quarter-over-quarter revenue climb. The downside to an Alteryx investment today is that the per-share price won’t likely exceed Clearlake’s price point even if the company blows earnings away. But shares could move rapidly to meet the $48.25 sales tag if earnings are sufficient, letting merger arbitrage investors lock in gains well before the expected deal closes.\n\nGrowth Stocks: Yelp (YELP) yelp app on a mobile phone with headphones\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarnings Date: Thursday, February 15th (After Hours)\n\nYelp (NYSE:YELP) is one of many consumer-facing companies leaning into the ongoing AI trend. And, if other companies’ strong earnings are an indication, AI could be a tailwind propelling Yelp back toward the top after a tough start to 2024.\n\nIn its last earnings report, Yelp more than doubled analyst expectations, generating $0.79 EPS compared to the anticipated $0.34. That’s also a 500% YoY gain, which is significant considering the report covered a period still awash with economic unease and reduced tourist tendencies. A strong holiday season, as many expect, could drive Yelp’s earnings even higher and get a 5-star rating from investors.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) logo on data network background, imaginary location in the future. Must-Buy Stocks on Major Deals\n\nSource: Spyro the Dragon / Shutterstock.com\n\nEarnings Date: Monday, February 5th (After Hours)\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) is probably at the top of the list of hotly-anticipated growth stocks this earnings season. Following on the heels of four consecutive profitable quarters, Palantir is now eligible for S&P 500 inclusion (and already valued more, by market cap, than 3/5 of the titleholders). Shares see-sawed over the past few weeks as bears and bulls debated whether Palantir could keep the ball rolling and maintain momentum, but early signs point to a strong showing this afternoon.\n\nPalantir’s last earnings report outlook ballparked $600 million in revenue for the quarter, but analysts are already frontrunning management expectations by anticipating a $603 million sales stat. Interested investors should look for info during the call about the company’s corporate strategy, which will be the big moneymaker moving forward, while government contracting helps maintain a base of consistent and reliable recurring revenue. Last year, company CEO Alex Karp claimed its commercial segment would hit a $1 billion run rate by 2025’s first quarter – if he reports that they’re on track to match or surpass the goal, Palantir could be the best-performing growth stock this season.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Jack Dorsey’s Bluesky Opens Social Network to Everyone",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Bluesky, the decentralized social network that was hatched by former Twitter Chief Executive Officer Jack Dorsey, is expanding its app to all interested users, abandoning an invite-only system that the service used to help regulate growth for the past year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court Xi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build Wall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift ‘Money Dysmorphia’ Traps Millennials and Gen Zers King Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\n\nThe social network opened to the public last February, and now claims 3 million users, but Bluesky only allowed new users via an invite code to ensure the technology supporting the network could handle the traffic.\n\nAnother key aspect of Bluesky, known as “federation,” is also coming at the end of February, said Jay Graber, Bluesky’s CEO. Federation is a central part of Bluesky’s mission, which will allow anyone to create their own social network using Bluesky’s technology protocol. Those various networks will be interoperable, and users of one network will be able to see posts from people on another, or jump between networks while taking their profile and followers with them. Each network would also have the freedom to set their own rules around speech, or create their own algorithms to determine what content users see.\n\nThe idea for Bluesky came about when Dorsey was still at Twitter, now called X, and was presented as a way to give users a new kind of social network not controlled by any single corporation or entity. The original idea was for Bluesky to create a social networking protocol that Twitter would then join, enabling people to take their Twitter profile and posts to other networks that also adopted the protocol.\n\nRead More: Bluesky Draws Celebs and Politicians as Twitter Alternative\n\nBluesky created a protocol, called the AT protocol, and also spun up its own social networking app to prove this theory could work, Graber said. “We started building an app only later and then the app was really intended to be a flagship client that shows off what we can do with this kind of an open protocol,” he said. “Since then we’ve built a community around it and we’ve put a lot of effort into making it a really good space for people.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThat community has emerged as one of the main alternatives to X, especially for those frustrated by owner Elon Musk. Dorsey left Twitter in late 2021, and while the Bluesky effort continued as a standalone entity, it’s unknown whether X will ever adopt the AT protocol as Dorsey once imagined. Dorsey is a Bluesky board member.\n\nBluesky was initially funded by Twitter, but in July announced it had raised an outside round of $8 million to help expand the network. Neo, a startup accelerator and seed fund, led the round.\n\nGraber said there remains a lot of uncertainty about which networks may eventually sign up for a decentralized protocol like the one she and her team built.\n\n“This is a moment for a lot of change for social,” she said. “There’s just a recognition that there’s limitations to having one company sort of be the arbiter of how our digital social communications works for public conversations for billions of people.”\n\nThe idea of decentralizing social media is gaining some popularity, and has made its way to Meta Platforms Inc., the parent company behind some of the largest networks in the world, Facebook and Instagram. Meta’s new competitor to X, called Threads, has tested integrations with a separate open protocol, known as ActivityPub. This would make Threads posts available on other networks using the same protocol, including Mastodon.\n\n“Making Threads interoperable will give people more choice over how they interact and it will help content reach more people,” Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote in December. “I’m pretty optimistic about this.”\n\n(Updates with funding round in the seventh paragraph. An earlier version was corrected to remove the co-founder title from Dorsey in the first paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

As Wall Street continues to focus on AI and tech leaders, many investors question who will be the top players in the space.\n\nRaymond James Managing Director Josh Beck joins Yahoo Finance to discuss why Meta's performance and investments in AI will make them a top leader in the space.\n\nBeck explains his bullish call on Meta when it comes to AI: \"They're a little bit of [an] unsung hero, I would say.

        "title": "Clegg admits Meta failing to detect fake videos amid online safety concerns",
        "content": "Sir Nick says Meta will introduce new rules to try and halt the spread of synthetic videos - Stefan Wermuth/Bloomberg\n\nSir Nick Clegg has admitted Facebook is struggling to combat the spread of fake videos, after Joe Biden and Rishi Sunak were targeted by AI impersonators.\n\nMeta’s head of global affairs said the company would introduce new rules to try and halt the spread of synthetic videos that seek to manipulate users, but added it lacked the technology to stop them outright.\n\nSir Nick said while Meta had now developed new tools to automatically detect images altered with AI, it could not yet replicate this for video or sound recordings.\n\nThe former deputy prime minister said Meta, which owns Facebook and Instagram, would tag synthetic, photorealistic pictures with a label explaining the image was “imagined with AI”. He said other AI companies had started adding “invisible watermarks” to their images, which Meta was able to detect.\n\nHowever, these identifying markers have yet to be added to video or audio, “so we can’t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies”, Sir Nick said.\n\nHe added the company’s efforts were “what’s technically possible right now. But it’s not yet possible to identify all AI-generated content”.\n\nMeta said it was working with AI companies to better detect manipulated videos, but in the meantime it would require users to proactively label videos that have been altered with AI, making it clear they are synthetic. Those that fail to do so could be penalised.\n\nSir Nick said the company was being “open about the limits of what’s possible”.\n\nThe admission comes as the tech giant faces growing pressure to tackle false videos and images ahead of multiple elections and faces accusations it is not doing enough to protect children online.\n\nOn Monday, the company’s Oversight Board, which reviews its moderation decisions, criticised Meta’s policy on “manipulated media”, calling it “incoherent and confusing”.\n\nThe Board raised questions over why Meta’s policy on digitally altered content only applies to videos, when fake audio clips have already been used to spread disinformation about elections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are fears AI-generated videos, which can look extremely realistic, could be used to spread misinformation during elections. The panel said Meta needed to “make revisions quickly, given the record number of elections in 2024”.\n\nA digitally altered video of President Biden, falsely implying he had groped a young woman, spread widely on Facebook last year.\n\nMore recently, videos with doctored audio from Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer and London Mayor Sadiq Khan have been posted to social media. Last month, it was reported that hundreds of adverts featuring deepfake footage of Mr Sunak had also been posted to Facebook, promoting an investment scam.\n\nIn January, Michelle Donelan, the Technology Secretary, said the Government planned to introduce “robust mechanisms” to tackle election-related deepfakes, but added “nobody has a silver bullet”.",

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +28.1%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.3% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 18.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.10 per share, indicating a change of +55.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +14.8% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $19.22 points to a change of +29.3% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $22.15 indicates a change of +15.2% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +9.9%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) for Meta Platforms.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $36.06 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +25.9%. For the current and next fiscal years, $156.59 billion and $178.1 billion estimates indicate +16.1% and +13.7% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $40.11 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +24.7%. EPS of $5.33 for the same period compares with $3 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $38.99 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.87%. The EPS surprise was +10.35%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #2 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "By Katie Paul\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - Meta Platforms will begin detecting and labeling images generated by other companies' artificial intelligence services in the coming months, using a set of invisible markers built into the files, its top policy executive said on Tuesday.\n\nMeta will apply the labels to any content carrying the markers that is posted to its Facebook, Instagram and Threads services, in an effort to signal to users that the images - which in many cases resemble real photos - are actually digital creations, the company's president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, wrote in a blog post.\n\nThe company already labels any content generated using its own AI tools.\n\nOnce the new system is up and running, Meta will do the same for images created on services run by OpenAI, Microsoft, Adobe, Midjourney, Shutterstock and Alphabet's Google, Clegg said.\n\nThe announcement provides an early glimpse into an emerging system of standards technology companies are developing to mitigate the potential harms associated with generative AI technologies, which can spit out fake but realistic-seeming content in response to simple prompts.\n\nThe approach builds off a template established over the past decade by some of the same companies to coordinate the removal of banned content across platforms, including depictions of mass violence and child exploitation.\n\nIn an interview, Clegg told Reuters he felt confident the companies could label AI-generated images reliably at this point, but said tools to mark audio and video content were more complicated and still being developed.\n\n\"Even though the technology is not yet fully mature, particularly when it comes to audio and video, the hope is that we can create a sense of momentum and incentive for the rest of the industry to follow,\" Clegg said.\n\nIn the interim, he added, Meta would start requiring people to label their own altered audio and video content and would apply penalties if they failed to do so. Clegg did not describe the penalties.\n\nStory continues\n\nHe added there was currently no viable mechanism to label written text generated by AI tools like ChatGPT.\n\n\"That ship has sailed,\" Clegg said.\n\nA Meta spokesman declined to say whether the company would apply labels to generative AI content shared on its encrypted messaging service WhatsApp.\n\nMeta's independent oversight board on Monday rebuked the company's policy on misleadingly doctored videos, saying it was too narrow and the content should be labeled rather than removed.\n\nClegg said he broadly agreed with those critiques.\n\nThe board was right, he said, that Meta's existing policy \"is just simply not fit for purpose in an environment where you're going to have way more synthetic content and hybrid content than before.\"\n\nHe cited the new labeling partnership as evidence that Meta was already moving in the direction the board had proposed.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis and Jamie Freed)",

        "content": "Meta (META) announced it is working on a means of better detecting and identifying AI-generated images across Facebook, Instagram, and Threads in the lead-up to the 2024 elections. The technology, which Meta’s president of global affairs, Nick Clegg, says is currently in development, would inform users when an image they see in their feed has been generated using artificial intelligence.\n\nCurrently, Meta adds a watermark and metadata to images generated using its Meta AI software. Now, however, the company is looking to expand that capability to images generated by contemporaries like Adobe (ADBE), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Midjourney, Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI, and Shutterstock (SSTK).\n\nClegg says Meta is working with the Partnership on AI, a nonprofit made up of academics, civil society professionals, and media organizations dedicated to ensuring AI has “positive outcomes for people and society,” to come up with standards that can be used to identify AI images across the web.\n\nExperts say generative AI images could create a tsunami of disinformation in the lead-up to the election. We’re already seeing some of what’s to come in real time. When former President Trump was arrested in New York in 2023, images of what appeared to be of him running from police began spreading across the web.\n\nAnd a likely AI-generated image of an explosion outside of the Pentagon that hit the internet last year briefly sent stocks sliding in New York in 2023 before officials said there was nothing out of the ordinary. Meta is adding the ability to detect AI-generated images to Facebook, Instagram, and Threads. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nWhile Meta’s moves will help identify AI-generated images, they won’t be able to recognize AI-generated videos or audio. To that end, Clegg said, the company is adding a feature that people can use to label AI-generated video and audio they share across Meta. If users don’t, he explained, they may face penalties.\n\n“While companies are starting to include signals in their image generators, they haven’t started including them in AI tools that generate audio and video at the same scale, so we can’t yet detect those signals and label this content from other companies,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI-generated audio and videos have already been used to spread disinformation. In 2022, a deepfake video of a phony Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky telling troops to put down their weapons hit the web. And in January, a deepfake audio recording of a fake President Biden telling voters not to take part in the presidential primary went out in New Hampshire.\n\nClegg also pointed out that though Meta will be able to identify AI-generated images, there are still ways that those markers can be manipulated or removed. To prevent that, he said, the company’s Fundamental AI Research (FAIR) team is working on a way of implanting a watermark into an image while it’s being generated so that it can’t be removed. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nGenerative AI content is still a new concept to many people on the web. And while the concept of Photoshopping an image isn’t novel, the ability to generate a huge number of images in no time and flood social media with them is.\n\nThe deluge of AI-generated explicit images of Taylor Swift that circulated across sites, including X, formerly known as Twitter, illustrates how easy it is for such content to propagate across huge swaths of the internet in no time. Meta’s solution is just one tool in what will have to be an expansive chest of options to combat the new generation of misinformation.\n\nOn Monday, Meta's Oversight Board criticized the company over how it currently handles manipulated video content. The board said it is \"concerned about the Manipulated Media policy in its current form, finding it to be incoherent, lacking in persuasive justification and inappropriately focused on how content is created, rather than on which specific harms it aims to prevent, such as disrupting electoral processes.\"\n\nThe board suggested Meta should, \"begin labeling manipulated content, such as videos altered by artificial intelligence (AI) or other means when such content may cause harm.\"\n\nThe board's remarks came in response to a video of President Biden that was altered without using AI and allowed to stay up because it didn't run afoul of the company's Manipulated Media policy. The group says Meta needs to add context to videos that are manipulated with means other than AI.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Meta to Detect and Label More AI-Created Posts as Elections Loom",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. will begin labeling more posts that were created using artificial intelligence tools as part of a broader effort to prevent misinformation and deception from spreading on Facebook, Instagram and Threads during a critical election year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Denied Immunity in DC Election Case by Appeals Court Xi to Discuss China Stocks With Regulators as Rescue Bets Build Wall Street Snubs China for India in a Historic Markets Shift ‘Money Dysmorphia’ Traps Millennials and Gen Zers King Charles Treated for Cancer in New Royal Health Scare\n\nMeta is working with other tech companies to create common technical standards for identifying these kinds of AI-generated posts, including adding invisible watermarking and metadata to images when they are created, the company said on Tuesday. Meta is then building software systems to detect these invisible markers so that it can label AI-created content even if it was made by a competing service.\n\nNick Clegg, Meta’s president of global affairs, said that in the next several months he expects Meta will be able to detect and label images that were created using tools from several other AI-focused companies, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, OpenAI, Microsoft Corp., Adobe Inc., Midjourney, and Shutterstock Inc.\n\n2024 is a busy year for elections, with voters in dozens of countries including the US, India, South Africa and Indonesia heading to the polls. While disinformation has been a challenge for voters and candidates for years, it has been turbocharged by the rise of generative AI tools that can create convincing fake images, text and audio.\n\nRead More: Deepfake Biden Audio Alarms Experts in US Election Lead-Up\n\n“I do not want to claim for one moment that this will cover all our bases or cross all the T’s and dot all the I’s,” Clegg told Bloomberg in an interview. “But a flawed approach should not be an alibi for inaction.”\n\nMeta’s system will initially only be able to detect AI-generated images created by other companies’ tools, not audio or video. Images generated by companies that don’t follow industry standards, or those that have been stripped of markers, will also be missed, although Meta is working on a separate way to automatically detect those.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe advancements in detecting AI deepfakes is a top priority for Clegg as Meta prepares for elections, including in the US. Last month at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, Clegg said that creating an industry standard around watermarking was “the most urgent task facing us today.”\n\nLast month, a doctored audio message of US President Joe Biden alarmed disinformation experts, with many warning that AI-generated content could play a pivotal role in the upcoming election if it’s not labeled or removed quickly. Clegg said he’s optimistic that won’t happen given the level of focus on the issue.\n\nThe presidential candidates’ teams will be on the lookout for deepfakes and “they’re going to shout about it in the press and they’re going to pick up the phone to us,” he said. He added that while Meta does not fact-check original posts created by politicians, it will label AI-generated posts no matter who shares them.\n\nOn Monday, Meta’s Oversight Board published a critique of Meta’s manipulated media policy, arguing that it was too narrow and that the company needs to do a better job of labeling posts created by AI instead of trying to remove them. Clegg said he largely agreed with the board’s analysis, and believes the watermarking updates are a step in the right direction.\n\nEventually, as the web becomes flooded with AI-generated material, the industry will need to tackle the problem from the other side — that is, by labeling legitimate media as well, Clegg said.\n\n“We’ll need to have a society-wide, or certainly industrywide, debate about the other end of the telescope, which is how do you flag for users the veracity or authenticity of non-synthetic content,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk About The Person I Hired Is Now My Boss.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Still Historically Cheap",
        "content": "One of the few guarantees Wall Street offers is that there's always going to be a next-big-thing investment trend to captivate investors' attention. At the moment, no trend is garnering more hoopla than artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nWhen I say \"artificial intelligence,\" I'm talking about the use of software and systems to handle tasks typically overseen by humans. The not-so-secret sauce to AI is the incorporation of machine learning, which allows software and systems to learn/evolve and become more efficient at their tasks over time.\n\nAccording to researchers at PwC, AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- and there's no way investors are going to overlook figures this large. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nForget about Nvidia. There are considerably better values among AI stocks\n\nWhile there are dozens of technology-driven companies that have embraced AI with open arms, the poster child of the AI revolution is semiconductor stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the infrastructure backbone of high-compute data centers. In other words, they're the brains that allow for the split-second decision-making required of AI-driven systems.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is expected to have more than doubled its sales in fiscal 2024 (the company's fiscal year ended in late January) on the heels of exceptionally strong data-center revenue, it's also a company that's seemingly priced for perfection in an imperfect industry with numerous unknowns.\n\nAs I've previously pointed out, Nvidia's biggest enemy looks to be itself in calendar year 2024. Whereas A100 and H100 GPU scarcity led to phenomenal pricing power that fueled almost the entirety of its data-center revenue growth through the first nine months of fiscal 2024, an increase in the company's GPU production in the current fiscal year could sap its pricing power and hamper its gross margin.\n\nSomething else to consider is that Nvidia isn't going to be the only GPU player in AI-accelerated data centers. Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and intends to ramp up production in 2024. Likewise, Intel unveiled its generative AI Gaudi3 chip as a direct competitor to the H100 in December, with plans to launch sometime this year. Nvidia's monopoly like market share in high-compute data centers is liable to fall.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo make matters worse, U.S. regulators have, on two separate occasions, restricted exports of Nvidia's high-powered AI chips to China. Not being able to export AI-focused chips to the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product could cost Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nWith Nvidia set to face a number of challenges, its estimated price-to-cash-flow ratio of 61 in fiscal 2024 is exceptionally pricey. The good news is there are two other AI stocks that are still historically cheap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe first historically inexpensive artificial intelligence stock that's a considerably better value than Nvidia is social media company Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Even after gaining more in market cap in a single day ($197 billion) than any other stock in history -- a feat accomplished on Feb. 2, 2024 -- Meta is still exceptionally cheap.\n\nThe company behind the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet is utilizing AI in a variety of ways. Meta AI offers a virtual chatbot that can entertain and educate people, while more than a dozen generative AI solutions are being tested to tailor advertisements and improve search functions, among other tasks.\n\nMeta also has its augmented and virtual reality segment known as Reality Labs. Even though Reality Labs is losing copious amounts of money at the moment, it could evolve into a key on-ramp to the metaverse in the latter-half of the decade.\n\nFor now, Meta's social media sites are its bread and butter. Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger are consistently among the most-downloaded apps globally, and they were collectively responsible (as part of Meta's \"family of Apps\") for attracting nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the fourth quarter. Businesses are well aware that their best chance to target broad audiences online is through advertisements with Meta. This is where generative AI could be especially useful.\n\nMeta also closed out 2023 with $47 billion in net cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and generated almost $46.8 billion in income from operations (even with Reality Labs weighing on its operations) for the year. With a clearly dominant foundational segment (social media), Meta has demonstrated that it can afford to take risks.\n\nDespite catapulting to an all-time closing high on Feb. 2, shares of Meta can be scooped up for 13 times forward-year cash flow. That's 17% below Meta's average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the previous five years.\n\nFurthermore, Meta shares are valued at 21 times forward-year earnings, which is more or less in-line with the benchmark S&P 500. But when factoring in Wall Street's expected annualized earnings growth of 32% for Meta over the next five years, we're left with a minuscule price-to-earnings-growth ratio (PEG ratio) of less than 0.7.\n\nAlibaba\n\nThe other unbelievably cheap AI stock that'll have you completely forgetting about Nvidia is China's leading e-commerce company, Alibaba(NYSE: BABA).\n\nThough Alibaba's e-commerce segment has long been its foundation: Taobao and Tmall account for almost 51% of China's online retail sales, according to the International Trade Administration. The company's future could rest on considerably higher-margin cloud services. As of March 31, 2023, Alibaba Cloud had gobbled up 34% of cloud-infrastructure service share in mainland China.\n\nThe most exciting application of AI for Alibaba is its large language model (LLM) known as Tongyi Qianwen. It's effectively Alibaba's own version of ChatGPT, the AI chatbot that ignited the AI craze a little more than a year ago.\n\nIn addition to traditional question-and-answer functionality like ChatGPT, Tongyi Qianwen's most important task might just be generative AI solutions within Alibaba's market-leading cloud. Generative AI could be tasked with improving search quality and comparisons, as well as tailoring marketing to individual consumer needs.\n\nAlibaba should also benefit in the years to come from a rebounding Chinese economy whose supply chains were crippled by lockdowns for multiple years during the COVID-19 pandemic. A steady rebound in consumer- and enterprise-purchasing activity, coupled with China's expanding middle class, increases the likelihood of sustained growth for Alibaba's leading e-commerce marketplace and cloud-service platform.\n\nAlibaba closed out September with north of $85 billion in cash, cash equivalents, short-term investments, restricted cash, and equity securities. If its net cash is backed out of the equation, shares of the company are valued at just 5 times forward-year earnings. That's the cheapest shares of Alibaba have ever been as a public company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta warns investors Mark Zuckerberg's MMA fighting could impact business",
        "content": "Facebook parent Meta warned investors in its latest annual report that its CEO’s passion for combat sports and other high-risk activities could harm its business if he were to be unavailable as a result of partaking in such activities.\n\nIn an annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), Meta noted that CEO Mark Zuckerberg practices combat sports, including mixed martial arts (MMA) and other activities that pose a high risk to his wellbeing that could impact the social media giant’s performance.\n\n\"We currently depend on the continued services and performance of our key personnel, including Mark Zuckerberg. Mr. Zuckerberg and certain other members of management participate in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death,\" the company said in the filing.\n\n\"If Mr. Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations,\" Meta continued in the report.\n\nMETA’S MARK ZUCKERBERG UNDERGOES SURGERY FOR KNEE INJURY DURING MARITAL ARTS TRAINING Meta warned investors that CEO Mark Zuckerberg's training in combat sports could impact the company's operations if he becomes unavailable for some reason. UFC president Dana White said last year that Zuckerberg and Musk were serious about their cage fight.\n\nZuckerberg has competed in Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournaments and was reportedly receiving training to receive his private pilot’s license in 2023. His passion for combat sports resulted in him being challenged to a cage fight by Elon Musk last year after Musk completed the acquisition of X, formerly Twitter, setting up what was to be a battle of billionaire social media tycoons.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nMusk said in an X post in June 2023, \"I’m up for a cage match if he is,\" which prompted Zuckerberg to screenshot a reply telling Musk to start his training and to \"send me location.\" Musk proposed that the fight be held at a UFC facility in Las Vegas, Nevada, and UFC president Dana White said the two were \"dead serious\" about the fight at the time.\n\nMusk said in August that while he had begun training for the fight, he had to get an MRI of his neck and upper back and may require surgery before a fight — though he later offered to drive to Zuckerberg’s house for a practice fight.\n\nStory continues\n\nMETA’S NEW DIVIDEND ADDS $200B IN VALUE; ZUCKERBERG NETS $29B IN 1 DAY Elon Musk challenged Mark Zuckerberg to a cage fight last summer, though the two billionaires have yet to finalize plans for the fight.\n\nA week later, Zuckerberg said in a post on Meta’s Threads, a rival to X, that the billionaire brawl was unlikely to go ahead in the near future.\n\n\"I think we can all agree Elon isn’t serious and it’s time to move on. I offered a real date. Dana White offered to make this a legit competition for charity. Elon won’t confirm a date, then says he needs surgery, and now asks to do a practice round in my backyard instead,\" Zuckerberg wrote.\n\n\"If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously,\" he added.\n\nMARK ZUCKERBERG’S HAWAII PROPERTY TO FEATURE GIANT UNDERGROUND BUNKER, TREEHOUSES: REPORT Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg underwent surgery in November 2023 for a torn ACL he injured during MMA training.\n\nLast fall, Musk left the door open to a future fight with Zuckerberg during an appearance on the Joe Rogan Experience podcast, saying he was willing to fight Zuckerberg \"any time, anywhere, any place any rules.\"\n\nWhen pressed by Rogan on his fitness and preparation, Musk said his cardio endurance \"will not be a factor\" and added that \"Dana White thinks it would be a big ticket fight.\"\n\nZuckerberg suffered a knee injury during an MMA training session that required surgery in November 2023.\n\n\"Tore my ACL sparring and just got out of surgery to replace it,\" Zuckerberg wrote in an Instagram post. \"Grateful for the doctors and team taking care of me.\"\n\n\"I was training for a competitive MMA fight early next year, but now that’s delayed a bit. Still looking forward to doing it after I recover. Thanks to everyone for the love and support,\" he added.\n\nFOX Business’s Sarah Rumpf-Whitten contributed to this report.\n\nOriginal article source:Meta warns investors Mark Zuckerberg's MMA fighting could impact business",

        "title": "Buyback Bonanza: 3 Buy-Rated Companies Scooping Up Shares",
        "content": "Stock buybacks, or share repurchase programs, are commonly executed by companies to boost shareholder value.\n\nA stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves.\n\nAnd as of late, several companies – Meta Platforms META, American Eagle Outfitters AEO, and HCA Healthcare HCA – have unveiled new repurchase programs. Let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta’s quarterly results stole the show, with shares popping post-earnings. The technology titan posted a 10% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate and reported sales 3% ahead of expectations, reflecting its fifth consecutive double-beat.\n\nUp a remarkable 150% over the last year, better-than-expected results have driven performance. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta authorized an additional $50 billion in share buybacks and unveiled its first-ever dividend, helping to explain the strong reaction post-earnings. The stock is currently a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with earnings expectations creeping higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company’s growth profile remains solid, with expectations for its current year (FY24) suggesting 20% earnings growth on 13% higher sales. Improved profitability has been a major tailwind for the tech giant, with Q4 costs and expenses falling 8% year-over-year.\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters\n\nAmerican Eagle Outfitters is a specialty retailer of casual apparel, accessories, outerwear, and footwear for men and women. The company authorized a 30 million share buyback, replacing its previous authorization.\n\nLike META, analysts have taken a bullish stance on the company’s outlook, landing the stock into a favorable Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s hard to ignore the company’s growth expectations, with estimates for its current fiscal year suggesting 45% earnings improvement paired with a 5% sales increase. A favorable operating environment with lowered costs has provided meaningful tailwinds for the company.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd shares aren’t valuation stretched given the forecasted growth, with the current 13.6X forward earnings multiple comparing favorably to the respective Zacks industry average of 15.7X. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Value.\n\nHCA Healthcare\n\nHCA Healthcare, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), is the largest non-governmental operator of acute care hospitals in the U.S. The company authorized an additional $3 billion share repurchase program in its latest quarterly print.\n\nThe company has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, particularly following the above-mentioned set of quarterly results in late January. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIncome-focused investors could also find HCA shares attractive, yielding a respectable 0.8% annually. Dividend growth is also apparent, with the company boasting a shareholder-friendly 10.6% five-year annualized dividend growth rate.\n\nBottom Line\n\nA common way that companies amplify shareholder value is through implementing share buybacks. They can provide a nice confidence boost for investors, indicating that the company is utilizing excess cash and can help put in a floor for shares.\n\nAnd recently, all three companies above – Meta Platforms META, American Eagle Outfitters AEO, and HCA Healthcare HCA – unveiled additional or fresh buyback programs.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Technical analysis may still be a controversial idea to some of the old guard but it’s the only methodology I’m aware of that will give you stocks flashing buy signals. Sure, it’s more “factual” for lack of a better word to rely on corporate earnings reports. However, these disclosures only arrive every three months. In the meantime, there’s a lot of trading action going on.\n\nAnother factor that stymies the no-technical-analysis-before-marriage crowd centers on the well-known adage: by the time you read about it in The Wall Street Journal, it’s already too late. Having been a longtime student (metaphorically speaking) and follower of John J. Murphy, I know exactly what he would say. Price discounts everything. In a way, that’s an unassailable logic.\n\nNo one is saying that fundamental analysis isn’t valuable. But again, by the time you’re reading about it in the WSJ, the market has already responded to the news. However, by assessing certain dynamics ahead of time, one may perceive actionable patterns. And that’s what these stocks flashing buy signals are all about.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to TipRanks’ technical analysis screener, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents the top security regarding stocks flashing buy signals. Overall, MSFT’s technical analysis score clocks in as a consensus “strong buy,” with the moving average signal pointing to a “strong buy” while its oscillators – which includes metrics such as the relative strength indicator (RSI) – points to a “buy.”\n\nRegarding the analyst view, MSFT represents a consensus strong buy. This assessment breaks down into 32 buys, one hold, and one sell. Overall, the average price target comes in at $469.45, implying a bit over 14% upside potential. Further, the high-side target hits $600, projecting growth of nearly 46%.\n\nFurther, looking at MSFT’s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, I see no indication of a chart pattern that implies brewing pessimism. So long as Microsoft continues marching higher, it should perform well – until it doesn’t.\n\nStory continues\n\nFundamentally, Microsoft ranks among the newly designated MnM stocks, a new artificial intelligence group of Microsoft, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). As long as generative artificial intelligence remains popular, MSFT should be a solid long-term opportunity.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnsurprisingly, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) landed in TipRanks’ screener for the best technical analysis scores. Like Microsoft, AMZN enjoys an overall technical consensus score of “strong buy.” Specifically, its moving average score rates highly – being well above its 50 and 200-day moving averages – as does its oscillating indicators.\r\n\r\nOn Wall Street, AMZN enjoys a unanimous strong buy rating. And we’re obviously not just talking about three or four experts but rather 39. In addition, the average price target lands at $204.29, implying upside potential of nearly 19%. That’s excellent considering that AMZN already shot up almost 15% since the beginning of this year. Further, the high-side target hits $230, projecting about 34% growth.\n\nInterestingly, AMZN printed a pattern in its P&F chart called an ascending triple top breakout. According to Stockchart.com’s educational segment, this pattern demonstrates an underlying strength indicative of a fresh uptrend.\n\nFundamentally, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail transactions continues to march higher since the second quarter of 2022. Therefore, I believe AMZN represents a credible example of stocks flashing buy signals.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile the broader financial industry suffered some question marks (to say the least) last year, you can’t keep the giants down for too long. Notably, TipRanks identified JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. Specifically, its moving average score reached a designation of “strong buy.” In terms of oscillators, it landed at “buy.”\n\nAnalysts, not shockingly, endorse JPM stock with a strong buy consensus view. This assessment breaks down as 17 buys, five holds and zero sells. Overall, the average price target hits $193.95, implying an upside of 11%. Further, the high-side target reaches up to $238, which comes courtesy of Oppenheimer. This forecast projects growth of over 36%.\n\nLooking at JPM’s P&F chart, I see no indication of a compelling upside indicator. However, I don’t see any negative signs either. Looking at a straight chart view, JPM trades robustly above its 50 DMA, which is encouraging. On a fundamental note, the implied economic stability stemming from the strong jobs print should be net bullish for JPM.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nA popular soft-drink giant and an icon of American capitalism, you really can’t go wrong with Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). With a predictable business and one that rewards its stakeholders through dividends, it’s no shock that technical indicators rate KO as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. According to TipRanks, KO’s moving average score rates as a “strong buy” while its oscillator score lands as a “buy.”\n\nAnalysts appreciate the KO, pegging it a consensus moderate buy. This assessment breaks down as six buys, three holds and no sells. Overall, the average price target lands at $64.88, implying growth of over 7%. While that might not sound like much, keep in mind that the company pays a dividend of 3.09%. In addition, the potential projected risk is limited, with a downside target of $60.\n\nLooking at KO’s P&F chart, StockCharts notes that it’s showing a low pole reversal. Per the investment resource, this pattern “implies that the supply that was making the prices fall has been absorbed and demand is taking over. The pattern is an alert that higher prices could be seen in the future.”\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA popular big-box retailing giant, Target (NYSE:TGT) incurred many troubles last year due to economic and social challenges. After some dark days, I’ve changed my tune on TGT. It’s good that I did because shares have been moving higher since then. Unsurprisingly, the TipRanks technical analysis screener identifies TGT as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. As with the other ideas, it features a “strong buy” moving average score and a “buy” reading regarding oscillators.\n\nAnalysts are also believers in the turnaround story, with the consensus view coming in as a moderate buy. However, it must be said that the average price target is conservative at $152.25. That implies only about 5% upside potential. Still, the high-side target clocks in at $180, projecting growth of nearly 24%.\n\nStill, the experts may be too conservative. According to TGT’s P&F chart, it’s printing a triple top breakout. According to StockCharts, this pattern implies that “buyers are now creating more demand than there is supply and therefore the prices are breaking out.”\n\nThat’s a good problem to have if you’re a shareholder.\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.\n\nSource: George Sheldon via Shutterstock\n\nOne of the top cynical beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis, Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) soared following the doldrums of 2020. That may be because of the people’s concerns of their suddenly sedentary lifestyles. At least with Dick’s, the retailer could offer a fun mechanism for staying fit. Since September of 2021, though, DKS has been choppy.\n\nBut here’s the good news. Per TipRanks, DKS may be one of the stocks flashing buy signals. Its moving average score clocks in as a “strong buy.” Curiously, though, its oscillator score landed at only “neutral.” And while analysts are bullish on DKS with a moderate buy view, the average price target sits at $141.29. That implies more than 9% downside risk.\n\nSo, what gives? Well, the high-side target is $179, which would take DKS to 15% up. Also, its P&F chart shows an ascending triple top breakout. As stated earlier with Amazon, this pattern demonstrates an underlying strength that denotes a possible uptrend.\n\nFundamentally, the strong jobs report should boost discretionary spending. As a result, DKS could be an interesting dark horse.\n\nKimco Realty (KIM) The Kimco Realty (KIM) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA real estate investment trust (REIT), Kimco Realty (NYSE:KIM) invests primarily in shopping centers. Now, that has caused some concerns among investors. Unfortunately, we’ve all heard about the end of the shopping mall as e-commerce becomes an ingrained component of our culture. Such a headwind puts KIM on the back foot. As a result, KIM is down more than 5% on a year-to-date basis.\n\nAdding to the concerns, it slipped more than 10% over the past 52 weeks. However, TipRanks identifies KIM as a “strong buy” opportunity overall based on technical analysis. Individually, it rates very highly in terms of moving averages while its oscillator score comes in as “neutral.” At the same time, analysts rate KIM a moderate buy with an average price target of $23.33. That implies almost 16% upside potential.\n\nTwo factors make KIM even more compelling as one of the stocks flashing buy signals. First, its P&F chart reveals a possible bear trap in play. Per StockCharts, such a signal could mean a “quick reversal” with higher prices ahead. Second, Kimco offers a forward dividend yield of 4.76%, which is very enticing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Did Meta and Amazon just save earnings season?\n\nBig tech earnings kicked off earnings season last week and not all of the results were so magnificent. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) got things started on Tuesday, and while both surpassed top and bottom-line expectations, it wasn't enough for investors. Weak advertising revenues for Alphabet resulted in a nearly 6% stock price decline in the wake of the report,[1] and light guidance from Microsoft also didn't go over well with investors.[2] Given the momentum tech had into these reports and rich price-earnings levels, investors were less willing to forgive minor stumbles. The same went for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which reported disappointing revenue from China on Thursday, the stock fell over 5% in the hours after the report before climbing back on Friday.[3]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nThe two standouts for last week were undoubtedly Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (AMZN?), both handily beating expectations on the top and bottom-line.[4] Even sweeter for Meta investors was the announcement of the company's first ever dividend of 50 cents as well as a $50 billion buyback plan.[5] CEO Mark Zuckerberg also vowed to \"keep things lean,\" a strategy that has worked well for the social media company who successfully pulled off the \"year of efficiency\" in 2023.[6]\n\nAs a result of better-than-expected reports last week, the FactSet blended S&P 500 EPS consensus now stands at 1.6%, an uptick from -1.4% the week prior.[7]\n\nBut that's not all that moved the markets last week, the first Federal Reserve meeting of 2024 ended up being a bust when Chairman Powell indicated they are not ready to begin cutting rates yet.[8] The CME Group FedWatch tool is now predicting a 60% probability of a rate cut at the May 1st meeting, with the likelihood of a March 20th cut falling to 21%.[9]\n\nWhile markets initially fell after that news on Wednesday, they perked back up after Thursday's tech results and Friday's blockbuster jobs number. Nonfarm Payrolls came in at 353,000 for January, and unemployment stayed at 3.7%, marking 24 consecutive months of sub-4% unemployment and the longest stretch since the 1960s.[10]\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustrials, pharma and consumer discretionary take center stage?\n\nWe get results from a smattering of sectors this week, including the restaurant space (MCD, CMG), Industrials (CAT, UBER), pharma (GILD, LLY) and always highly anticipated Disney (NYSE:DIS). Not All of Big Tech Posted Magnificent Results for the 4th Quarter\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week?\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[11]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their fourth-quarter 2023 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX), Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) and Catalent Inc. (NYSE:CTLT).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nQ4 earnings wave?\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 - March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 561 companies anticipated to report. Thus far, 64% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 18% have reported (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names). Roughly 46% of the S&P 500 has reported.

As a result, all these factors lead to higher output and economic growth.\n\nRecent years have seen strong growth in the higher education market size. It is expected to grow from $1.28 trillion in 2023 to $1.36 trillion in 2024, at a CAGR of 6.3%. Increased government funding, an increase in the number of private colleges and universities, and government initiatives for digital learning are the main growth drivers of this sector. The size of the colleges, universities, and professional schools market size is anticipated to increase steadily over the next few years, reaching $1.72 trillion in 2028, with a CAGR of 6.1%.\n\nThe primary factors propelling this market's growth are the increased focus on expanding university campuses abroad, growing student enrollment, and rising investments in online learning establishments. According to a report by The Business Research Company, the forecast period's primary factors include emphasizing partnerships, concentrating on metaverse technology, integrating a learning management system into teaching and learning to create an efficient educational system, and concentrating on artificial intelligence (AI) to enhance the teaching experience. In the aforementioned market, the Western Europe area held the top rank in 2023, with Asia-Pacific coming in second.\n\nFurthermore, the online education market is anticipated to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.49% between 2022 and 2027, adding $148.22 billion to the sector.\n\nEducational Technology:\n\nThe emergence of educational technology (EdTech), or the use of technology for teaching, learning, and education, has been attributed to the huge impact that the COVID-19 pandemic has had on the world's educational landscape.\n\nStory continues\n\nOver the past few years, EdTech companies have experienced exponential growth, but the popularity of AI programs like ChatGPT has excelled in the education sector. In 2023, the industry-leading provider of student-centered online learning, Chegg Inc. (NYSE:CHGG), announced that it is collaborating with Scale AI, the AI data infrastructure, to create exclusive large language models (LLMs) that will enable Chegg's personalized learning assistant to deliver generative learning experiences.\n\nIn 2023, Chegg Inc.(NYSE:CHGG) had $766.9 million in total net revenues, a 1% decline from the previous year. Revenues from Subscription Services increased 9% annually to $672.0 million, or 88% of total net revenues, up from 79% in 2021.\n\nChegg Inc. (NYSE:CHGG) is confident in its future growth despite the decline in revenue, the business will flourish by launching the initial section of its brand-new AI-powered user experience.\n\nCompanies Investing in The Education Sector:\n\nFacebook's parent company, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), declared in 2022 that it would contribute $150 million to the Immersive Learning initiative. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) will also launch 10 additional virtual campuses in the metaverse in collaboration with VictoryXR, a firm that develops software for extended reality education, eventually bringing the total to 100 universities.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) aims to train a new generation of metaverse producers through immersive learning so they can produce high-caliber immersive experiences. The organization claims that working together on projects will enable these creators to pick up new skills and pursue fulfilling jobs.\n\nThe University of Maryland Global Campus (UMGC), an exclusively online institution, is one example of a virtual campus. The university, which has over 45,000 students, will now offer spaces where students may interact and learn in the metaverse.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation also recently announced that it will invest $10 billion in OpenAI, the company whose artificial intelligence tool ChatGPT has gained widespread attention. In just a few days after its launch, the tool had over a million users, sparking a new discussion about the future of AI in the workplace.\n\nWith that said, here are the 25 Best Colleges with High Acceptance Rates. 25 Best Colleges with High Acceptance Rates\n\nMatej Kastelic/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology:\n\nTo pick out the 25 Best Colleges with High Acceptance Rates and maintain objectivity and relevance in our statistics, we have limited the selection of universities for this article to those included in the QS World University Rankings 2024, which provides a list of the top universities globally. Next, we gathered accurate data regarding their undergraduate program acceptance rates from reliable sources like College Raptor and EduRank. We have chosen institutes from every continent in the world to make our ranking truly global. To demonstrate that even some of the top-ranked colleges in the world can have extremely high acceptance rates, we only included universities with an acceptance rate of 80% or greater.\n\nIt is important to note that the acceptance rate, which typically appears as a percentage, is the ratio of all applications to all students who are accepted.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: February 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is coming back, creating a long list of hot metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nLook at Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) Reality Labs, for example. While it saw a massive loss of $4.6 billion in its recent quarter, revenue stood at $1 billion. A year earlier, the Labs’ revenue was $727 million. “We’ve invested heavily in both AI and the metaverse and will continue to do so,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg added.\n\nDespite the metaverse’s dismal history, it could be worth about $936 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. This is due in part to end-use industry demand from media and entertainment, education, and aerospace and defense.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith excitement only set to grow, investors may want to look into these top metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy on pullbacks is Roblox Corp. (NYSE:RBLX).\n\nOver the last few weeks, Roblox slipped from about $46 to $38, where it found double bottom support. Further, analysts at Roth MKM reiterated its buy rating on the stock.\n\nWe’ll get more information from RBLX earnings on Tuesday. Roth MKM raised its estimates after a strong year of engagement for the company. The firm also “boosted fourth-quarter bookings expectations to $1.08B — reflecting 20% growth, in line with the rest of Wall Street — and raised its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $188M,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRemember that RBLX is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse, with about 70.2 million daily active users.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake advantage of the recent dip to $32 on Unity Software (NYSE:U).\n\nDown but not out, it’s cutting its workforce by about 25%. Focusing more on profitability, U is working with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They are concentrating on immersive, real-time 3D apps for the tech giant’s Apple Vision Pro. Plus, with the metaverse showing signs of life, the company should see stronger demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America just reiterated a buy rating on Unity.\n\n“The bank has faith that Unity will emerge better positioned to compete in a stabilizing mobile game market with improved profitability and strategic focus. The wind-down of certain businesses will remove $300M in low-growth business that drags on profitability, and headcount reductions will result in savings of about $230M,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nFrom its current price of $32.84, I’d like to see Unity Software initially retest $42.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) An image of a person wearing a VR headset looking up, a nebulous digital cloud in the upper corner\n\nSource: Vit-Mar/Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at a low cost, check out the ProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.58%, the VERS ETF tracks the Solactive Metaverse Theme Index, which tracks stocks most relevant to the metaverse industry. Also, each company needs to generate at least 50% of revenues from metaverse operations. Top holdings for the ETF include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Meta Platforms, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nSince November, the VERS ETF ran from a low of about $33 to a high of $43. It dipped to about $39.62 and is just starting to push higher again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the US tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nUS Tech Stocks Continue to Attract Investors\n\nFor most of 2023, the tech sector seemed to have established itself as a safe haven for many investors with its prolonged rallies, helped by the rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing profitability of several large tech companies. It seems as though these positive trends are continuing in 2024, with many investors remaining faithful to their tech holdings and expecting higher profitability from their investments as the year progresses. With such strong optimism driving up the tech stocks, many are beginning to wonder whether this obsession with tech stocks ever come to an end and whether other names in the market will ever gain investor attention again.\n\nOn February 1, Mizuho Americas' Farzin Azarm joined CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" to discuss current trends in the US tech sector and this investor obsession with tech stocks. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"Everybody is in the US tech names, everybody, and nobody's selling these names because why would they? Every day you come in, NVIDIA's making a new all time high, look at what Meta is doing after hours look at what Amazon is doing after hours. It's been a safe haven and people are saying 'why should I abandon these names that have given me a return every day? Why should I move away from something like this and invest in something that risky, that hasn't given me any kind of a return?'\"\n\nThe Impact of the Tech Rally on China\n\nAccording to Azarm, this continued preference for US tech stocks is resulting in other stocks, notably those originating in China, being ignored. He believes that a \"crack\" in the US tech and AI trade is the only thing that will rotate money back into Chinese stocks at the end of the day. He added that because investors have already committed huge amounts to expensive American stocks, they do not have the appetite to invest further in more expensive companies. As such, he believes that when the US tech rally slows down, cheaper valuation Chinese companies may begin to attract investor attention. On this front, here's what Azarm had to say:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"People are looking for underperformance, people are looking for... cheaper valuation companies. The US names are trading at 30-35 times now, some of these names. They're priced to perfection. They're not going down, it's amazing to me, but once it does, and it's gonna come, I think that money may go to China.\"\n\nIn light of the above, it is unsurprising that major names such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight. 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.\n\nBest American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\n13. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nUpside Potential According to Analysts: 8.53%\n\nAverage Price Target: $46.42\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. It develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services.\n\nA Buy rating was maintained on shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) on January 26 by Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho, alongside a price target of $55.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), with a total stake value of $2.1 billion.\n\nUpslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\nLike Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\n12.

(NYSE:NOW) continues to grow revenue and earnings at above a 20% rate, as they have for many years. The company has a software automation platform that efficiently builds applications on top of and across many enterprise functions. The NOW platform can automate almost any workflow previously done through email, spreadsheets, or some other less-than-efficient method. Its addressable market is very large because of the sheer breadth and depth of the tasks that can be automated by using its software. ServiceNow’s offerings tend to save customers money and make their workflows less prone to error. The company’s growth has been among the most consistent in our Portfolio prior to, during, and after the pandemic.”\n\n10. Apple Inc.

Moreover, operating profits are rising due to an organization-wide focus on improving productivity and accelerating the time to market for new products. However, overall profitability continues to be weighed down by losses in the Reality Labs segment.

(NASDAQ:AMD) as of February 1.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\nLike Alphabet Inc.

The company is benefiting from steady user growth across all regions, particularly Asia Pacific. Increased engagement for its offerings like Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger and Facebook has been a major growth driver.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ is leveraging AI to recommend Reels content, which is driving traffic on Instagram and Facebook. Its innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels and Llama 2, is likely to aid prospects.\r\n\r\nHowever, challenging macroeconomic conditions remain a headwind for Meta’s advertising revenues, along with targeting and measurement headwinds due to Apple’s iOS changes. Slow monetization of Reels, along with mounting operating losses at Reality Labs, are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Meta Platforms here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Eaton have outperformed the Zacks Manufacturing - Electronics industry over the past year (+69.4% vs. +28.4%). The company’s research and development are allowing it to develop new products to provide efficient power management solutions.\r\n\r\nIt will benefit from improving end-market conditions, increasing demand from the new AI data center and contributions from its organic assets. Eaton is expanding via acquisitions and its rising backlog shows demand for its products.

The company has been resorting to prudent capital deployment moves through share repurchases and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nHowever, high leverage can affect its financial flexibility. Rising operating costs due to higher pharmacy and other service costs are a concern.

        "title": "3 Doomed Nasdaq Stocks to Dump Before They Dive: February 2024",
        "content": "The market continues to make new all-time highs, but the gains remain lopsided. Some stocks, such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are soaring. Yet others, like Moderna (NASDAQ:MRNA), continue to sink.\n\nThe reality is that mega-cap technology stocks are driving the market at the expense of small-cap stocks and just about every sector of the economy. Fourth-quarter 2023 earnings season hasn’t helped level the playing field. Several well-known companies are seeing their share prices dive after delivering disappointing financial results and offering weak guidance for the year ahead. As is often the case, analysts and investors are not forgiving of poor earnings and outlooks from companies. It’s not unusual for a stock to drop 10% or more immediately after a dismal earnings print.\n\nSo, many companies are grappling with problems that seem insurmountable, making their stocks ones to avoid. Therefore, consider dumping these three doomed Nasdaq stocks before they tank further.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla Motors (TSLA) now an SP500 company with a busy Pond Springs location in northwest Austin, TX\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome recent phrases to describe Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) recent Q4 2023 financial results include “train wreck” and “disaster.” And those were the nice reviews.\n\nTSLA has already dived, falling 24% since the start of the year. This occurred amid growing signs that the company’s sales are slowing worldwide. Further, the slowdown might be irreversible. During their Q4 earnings call, Tesla executives said that they expect electric vehicle volume growth this year to be “notably lower.”\n\nThe big problem is that Tesla has already done just about everything it can to try and fix its problem of slumping sales. That includes slashing prices at the expense of profit margins and introducing new vehicles such as the heavily hyped Cybertruck. Now, the company is teasing a new, lower priced EV. But it remains to be seen if that will help Tesla in the face of growing competition. Plus, the company continues to grapple with recalls, lawsuits, and its mercurial CEO Elon Musk. It’s time to sell TSLA stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) the Starbucks (SBUX) logo on a sign outside of a coffee shop\n\nSource: Grand Warszawski / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt could have been worse. That’s the best thing that can be said about the latest earnings from Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX). The company missed Wall Street forecasts across the board as both its domestic and international sales declined.\n\nHowever, SBUX staged a momentary relief rally because analysts and investors had been expecting a much worse result from the Seattle-based coffee roaster. Over the past 12 months, SBUX stock fell 12%, remaining flat this year after the brief earnings rally.\n\nThe issues at Starbucks are two-fold. The company is facing a boycott in its U.S. market over perceptions that the company supports Palestinians in the current war between Israel and Hamas. At the same time, Starbucks overseas sales are in decline, notably in China, which is going through an economic downturn. Also, their consumers have cut back their spending on lattes and cappuccinos. International same-store sales grew 7% in Q4, about half of the 13%.\n\nAdditionally, Starbucks continues to wrestle with unionization efforts by its workers in the U.S.. And, it’s adjusting to new CEO Laxman Narasimhan, making this a doomed Nasdaq stock to dump before it dives further.\n\nPeloton Interactive (PTON) A Peloton (PTON) store front\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThings keep going from bad to worse at Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ:PTON).\n\nThe maker of internet-connected treadmills and stationary bikes just guided for a loss in the current first quarter of as much as $30 million. Wall Street had a $2 million loss penciled in for the company.\n\nSo much for the turnaround strategy. Shares of Peloton have been among the worst performers in the Nasdaq index. They dropped 73% in the last 12 months and now trading as a penny stock.\n\nPeloton has never recovered from the end of the Covid-19 pandemic. Its sales and stock soared during lockdowns when people were forced to exercise from home. But sales and the share price have steadily fallen as people returned to their local gym and fitness center to workout. Barry McCarthy, who previously worked at Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) was brought in as Peloton’s new CEO. He pivoted to focus on monthly subscriptions rather than treadmill and stationary bike sales.\n\nHowever, in its just released Q4 2023 results, the management team said that they are struggling to grow their paid app subscribers and see an uncertain road ahead. PTON stock is definitely doomed and a security to sell before it dives more than it already has in the past year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Disinformation isn’t just an AI matter, as Meta’s Oversight Board just reminded everyone",
        "content": "The rapid proliferation of generative AI tools has rightly raised concerns about deepfakes in this extraordinary election year, but Meta’s Oversight Board just reminded everyone that the phenomenon of visual disinformation does not begin and end with AI.\n\nThe independent panel of experts, which Facebook set up in 2020 as a kind of supreme court for content moderation—it has the final say on whether certain controversial calls made by Meta’s moderators are in line with the company’s stated policies—this morning upheld Facebook’s decision to leave up a deliberately misleading video that claims President Joe Biden is a pedophile.\n\nThe board said the decision didn’t contravene Meta’s policy about manipulated media—but mainly because the policy is “incoherent.”\n\nThe video in question was, by looping a particular moment of genuine footage, edited to suggest Biden was leeringly touching his (adult) granddaughter’s chest. In fact, the clip was one of him placing an “I Voted” sticker above her chest after she asked him to do so. It was captioned to call him a “sick pedophile” and his voters “mentally unwell”; versions without this caption had already gone viral several months before, at the start of 2023.\n\nIs this manipulated media? Obviously. But Meta’s policy only forbids the posting of manipulated media that was AI-generated and that shows someone saying something they didn’t. Neither of those conditions applies here, so no foul. This seven-second video also has another condition that wasn’t met—the looping was crude and obvious, so the average person wouldn’t have been misled into thinking it was genuine—but nonetheless, the board seized its opportunity to lay into Meta’s narrow focus on AI-generated disinformation.\n\n“Meta should extend the policy to cover audio as well as to content that shows people doing things they did not do,” the panel said. “The board is also unconvinced of the logic of making these rules dependent on the technical measures used to create content. Experts the board consulted, and public comments, broadly agreed on the fact that non-AI-altered content is prevalent and not necessarily any less misleading; for example, most phones have features to edit content.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThat wasn’t all. The board pointed out that Meta has two versions of the policy (stand-alone and as part of its misinformation community standard) that aren’t exactly aligned, and also said Meta should clarify what sort of harms its policy is trying to prevent. How soon? “Quickly, given the record number of elections in 2024,” the board said.\n\nA Meta spokesman opted for quick-ish instead. “We are reviewing the Oversight Board’s guidance and will respond publicly to their recommendations within 60 days in accordance with the bylaws,” he said.\n\nAll this might give the impression that the Oversight Board wants to see Meta remove more content, but that’s not actually the case—instead, in cases where there aren’t some further policy violations, the board would prefer to see the content left up with labels “indicating the content is significantly altered and could mislead.” This, it argued, would “mitigate against the risk of over-removals,” while also avoiding “accusations of cover-up and bias.”\n\nAlthough it isn’t obliged to follow the board’s recommendations beyond its ruling about this specific case, let’s hope Meta is listening to all this—and if not, what’s the point of the Oversight Board?

        "title": "Meta's Ad Business Continues To Rebound, Its Metaverse Efforts Continue to Advance But Its Moral Integrity Remains Questionable",
        "content": "Last week, earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) closed out January.  Amazon stock rose more than 8% on Thursday in after-hours trading as the e-commerce and cloud titan reported better than expected fourth quarter figures that showed its earnings bounced back. Although Apple also surpassed Wall Street’s estimates and reported for the first time in a year its revenue grew, its stock fell after-hours. Microsoft reported a thriving bottom line along with impressive growth of its cloud business. But even Microsoft isn’t immune to corporate layoffs that are still plaguing the tech industry. Google also reported strong top and bottom-line figures but missed analyst estimates. Therefore, Google shares went down more than 6% upon earnings on Tuesday. Moreover, Google remains focused on cost-management.\n\nBut Meta did more than greatly surpass analyst estimates with its fourth quarter figures along with announcing its first ever dividend as it continues to work on making the metaverse happen with its Reality Labs division that hit $1 billion for the first time in the latest reported quarter.\n\nMeta Reported Its Profit Tripled In The Last Three Months Of 2023\n\nFor the quarter ended in December, Meta reported its revenue jumped 25% YoY to $40.1 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $39.18 billion as the ad business continued to rebound after a brutal 2022. Meta also lowered its expenses 8% YoY to $23.73 billion and as a result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives, its operating margin more than doubled to 41%. Therefore, net income more than tripled to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share. Earnings per share amounted to $5.33, also topping LSEG’s estimate of $4.96.\n\nAlthough its virtual reality unit recorded a loss of $4.65 billion, Reality Labs  passed $1 billion for the first time which shows Meta continues to advance on the metaverse and AI front.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg also revealed that AI advances helped boost the company’s ad business which grew faster than of its rival Google that earlier reported YoY growth of 11% for its latest quarter. Along with other social media executives, Zuckerberg was questioned during a law hearing on Wednesday for being accused for insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and even deaths by suicide. Zuckerberg has been working on restoring his image by examining ways to curb harm made by social media platforms, but these ‘products’ have created a lot of harm to the most fragile generations.\n\nOutlook\n\nMeta announced it pay its investors a dividend of 50 cents a share on March 26th.\n\nFacebook parent guided for first-quarter sales in the range between $34.5 billion and $37 billion, topping analyst estimates of $33.8 billion. Meta also guided for 2024 expenses to be between $94 billion and $99 billion.\n\nLike Google, Meta remains focused on keeping things lean. Although its greatest goal is to make the metaverse happen, it has perhaps an even harder task of having to prove its products are not harming the mental health and lives of its users. Moral integrity and responsibility for its actions is something all Big Tech still needs to live up to.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Oversight board urges Meta to rethink its policy on manipulated media in high-stakes election year",
        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — An oversight board is criticizing Facebook owner Meta's policies regarding manipulated media as “incoherent\" and insufficient to address the flood of online disinformation that already has begun to target elections across the globe this year.\n\nThe quasi-independent board on Monday said its review of an altered video of President Joe Biden that spread on Facebook exposed gaps in the policy. The board said Meta should expand the policy to focus not only on videos generated with artificial intelligence, but on media regardless of how it was created. That includes fake audio recordings, which already have convincingly impersonated political candidates in the U.S. and elsewhere.\n\nThe company also should clarify the harms it is trying to prevent and should label images, videos and audio clips as manipulated instead of removing the posts altogether, the Meta Oversight Board said.\n\nThe board’s feedback reflects the intense scrutiny that is facing many tech companies for their handling of election falsehoods in a year when voters in more than 50 countries will go to the polls. As both generative artificial intelligence deepfakes and lower-quality “cheap fakes” on social media threaten to mislead voters, the platforms are trying to catch up and respond to false posts while protecting users’ rights to free speech.\n\n“As it stands, the policy makes little sense,” Oversight Board co-chair Michael McConnell said of Meta’s policy in a statement on Monday. He said the company should close gaps in the policy while ensuring political speech is “unwaveringly protected.”\n\nMeta said it is reviewing the Oversight Board's guidance and will respond publicly to the recommendations within 60 days.\n\nSpokesperson Corey Chambliss said while audio deepfakes aren't mentioned in the company's manipulated media policy, they are eligible to be fact-checked and will be labeled or down-ranked if fact-checkers rate them as false or altered. The company also takes action against any type of content if it violates Facebook's Community Standards, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFacebook, which turned 20 this week, remains the most popular social media site for Americans to get their news, according to Pew. But other social media sites, among them Meta’s Instagram, WhatsApp and Threads, as well as X, YouTube and TikTok, also are potential hubs where deceptive media can spread and fool voters.\n\nMeta created its oversight board in 2020 to serve as a referee for content on its platforms. Its current recommendations come after it reviewed an altered clip of President Biden and his adult granddaughter that was misleading but didn’t violate the company’s specific policies.\n\nThe original footage showed Biden placing an “I Voted” sticker high on his granddaughter’s chest, at her instruction, then kissing her on the cheek. The version that appeared on Facebook was altered to remove the important context, making it seem as if he touched her inappropriately.\n\nThe board’s ruling on Monday upheld Meta’s 2023 decision to leave the seven-second clip up on Facebook, since it didn’t violate the company’s existing manipulated media policy. Meta's current policy says it will remove videos created using artificial intelligence tools that misrepresent someone's speech.\n\n“Since the video in this post was not altered using AI and it shows President Biden doing something he did not do (not something he didn’t say), it does not violate the existing policy,” the ruling read.\n\nThe board advised the company to update the policy and label similar videos as manipulated in the future. It argued that to protect users’ rights to freedom of expression, Meta should label content as manipulated rather than removing it from the platform if it doesn’t violate any other policies.\n\nThe board also noted that some forms of manipulated media are made for humor, parody or satire and should be protected. Instead of focusing on how a distorted image, video or audio clip was created, the company’s policy should focus on the harm manipulated posts can cause, such as disrupting the election process, the ruling said.\n\nMeta said on its website that it welcomes the Oversight Board’s ruling on the Biden post and will update the post after reviewing the board’s recommendations.\n\nMeta is required to heed the Oversight Board’s rulings on specific content decisions, though it’s under no obligation to follow the board’s broader recommendations. Still, the board has gotten the company to make some changes over the years, including making messages to users who violate its policies more specific to explain to them what they did wrong.\n\nJen Golbeck, a professor in the University of Maryland's College of Information Studies, said Meta is big enough to be a leader in labeling manipulated content, but follow-through is just as important as changing policy.\n\n“Will they implement those changes and then enforce them in the face of political pressure from the people who want to do bad things? That’s the real question,” she said. “If they do make those changes and don’t enforce them, it kind of further contributes to this destruction of trust that comes with misinformation.”\n\n___\n\nAssociated Press technology writer Barbara Ortutay in San Francisco contributed to this report.\n\n___\n\nThe Associated Press receives support from several private foundations to enhance its explanatory coverage of elections and democracy.

With stiff competition for ad revenue from Meta (META) and Pinterest (PINS) what must Snap do in order to succeed?\n\nRoth MKM Managing Director Rohit Kulkarni joins Yahoo Finance to discuss the company's performance, as well as what the company needs to fix in order to achieve some of those long-term growth plans and better engage with its competition.\n\nIn terms of competition, Kulkarni explains that \"What Facebook has done since, say, late '21, all of '22, and half of '23, they have invested in AI in a way that they can recover some of the lost signals from all of the changes that Apple and all the privacy changes that have been happening in the ecosystem. I would put it that Facebook is probably maybe 6, 9, 12 months ahead of a company like Snap when it comes to fixing what was broken because of Apple and ecosystem changes... Snap is facing its own issues. They're losing a lot of executives.

        "title": "Snap Is Cutting 10% of Staff as Social Media Copes With Ad Slump",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snap Inc. is reducing its workforce by roughly 10% worldwide, joining the chorus of technology companies that have announced fresh rounds of cuts since the start of the year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhy NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% Off King Charles Being Treated for Cancer After Hospital Stay Powell Tells ‘60 Minutes’ Fed Is Wary of Cutting Rates Too Soon China Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore Investors Eastern Europe’s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire West\n\nThe cuts are being made to “best position our business to execute on our highest priorities,” Snap said in a filing Monday. A spokesperson added that the social media company is reorganizing the team to reduce hierarchy and promote in-person collaboration. The stock was down 3.1% to $16.51 in New York, tracking a broader pullback in the stock market.\n\nLike its social media peers, Snap has been working to offset a deceleration in ad revenue, coping with the slump by cutting jobs and culling projects that are no longer seen as a priority. Snap, the parent of the Snapchat app, and Meta Platforms Inc. were badly affected by changes Apple Inc. made to its privacy policy in 2021, which made it harder for advertisers to track users. But Meta has bounced back, posting a 25% gain in sales in the fourth quarter, its biggest quarterly increase in two years.\n\nThe Santa Monica, California-based company employed about 5,400 workers as of September. A 10% reduction based off that total would amount to about 540 jobs lost. Snap said the mass layoffs may extend into the second quarter of 2024 while the company works to comply with local laws.\n\n“The layoffs don’t bode well for the state of Snap’s business,” ahead of its fourth quarter earnings reported scheduled for Tuesday, said Jasmine Enberg, an analyst at Insider Intelligence. “Meta’s blockbuster report is a tough act for Snap to follow.” Enberg expects Snap to report a 3.3% decline in ad revenue in 2023 from a year earlier.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree months ago, Snap reported a return to revenue growth after two periods of declines but cautioned that its progress may be blunted by advertiser delays brought on by the war in Israel and Gaza.\n\nSnap’s job cuts add to the slew of grim announcements that have been made by technology companies since the beginning of this year as they seek to cut costs after bulking up during the pandemic. Microsoft Corp., Google parent Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Salesforce Inc. are among the more than 100 tech companies that have signaled layoffs in the past month, affecting close to 32,000 employees, according to data compiled by Layoffs.fyi.\n\nInvestors have generally cheered the cost-cutting measures. Meta and Amazon added a combined $336 billion in market value last week after beating quarterly earnings and outlook estimates, validating the belt-tightening strategies that have come to define the tech industry in the past year.\n\nSnap has made deep cuts to its business before. In 2022 it fired 20% of its workforce and cut projects that it didn’t expect to help revenue growth or the company’s augmented reality technology. Chief Executive Officer Evan Spiegel later told employees he expected them to be in the office 80% of the time starting in early 2023.\n\nJust four months ago, Snap announced it was closing a division focused on making augmented reality services for businesses, pulling the plug on what was its latest attempt to diversify the ad-dependent company. Shuttering the business was expected to cut 170 jobs.\n\nSnap estimated that the reductions will result in pretax charges of $55 million to $75 million from severance and related costs, as well as other charges including $45 million to $55 million in future cash expenditures. Most of these costs will occur in the first quarter, Snap said.\n\n--With assistance from Alex Barinka.\n\n(Updates with spokesperson comment)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders  Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "After a weak start to 2024, the S&P 500 has staged a nice comeback, touching new record highs lately. In fact, the benchmark logged the fourth consecutive week of gains. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust SPY, the proxy version of the S&P 500 Index, has risen nearly 3% over the past month (read: ETFs in Focus as S&P 500 Confirms Bull Market: How Long Will It Last?).\r\n\r\nThe rally was driven by strong corporate earnings, AI developments and renewed confidence in the tech sector. As such, we have highlighted five stocks that have gained in double-digits in the past month, and have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), #2 (Buy) or #3 (Hold). These are Meta Platforms META, Nvidia NVDA, Advanced Micro Devices AMD, Juniper Networks, Inc. JNPR and Palo Alto Networks, Inc. PANW.\r\n\r\nTotal Q4 earnings of the 176 S&P 500 members that have reported results rose 1.7% from the same period last year on 2.6% higher revenues, with 81.8% beating EPS estimates and 69.3% beating revenue estimates. Earnings growth is tracking above the last reported quarter, while revenue growth is below the same period. EPS and revenue beat percentages are roughly in-line with the recent and historical periods.\r\n\r\nIn particular, strong earnings of mega-cap companies — Microsoft (MSFT), Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) — reconfirm their leadership position in the market, bolstering investors’ sentiment (read: Meta Soars on Solid Q4 Earnings, First Dividend: ETFs to Buy).\r\n\r\nLast month, the U.S. government announced the launch of a pilot program for AI research in collaboration with major tech companies and federal agencies under the umbrella of the National Science Foundation. This move has contributed to the positive sentiment of the tech sector.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, the bouts of data indicate a resilient economy, leading to risk-on trade. However, it scaled back the expectations for rate cuts anytime soon. Inflation is easing and the economy is improving. The personal consumption expenditure index — the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge — rose 2.6% in December. This marks the third time that inflation is below 3%. Meanwhile, the economy grew at a much more rapid pace than expected, with GDP rising at a 3.3% annualized rate in the fourth quarter of 2023, up from the Wall Street consensus estimate growth rate of 2%.\r\n\r\nThe labor market has also shown persistent strength as job growth accelerated in January and wages increased by the most in nearly two years. The economy added 353,000 jobs in January and the unemployment rate was unchanged at 3.7%.\r\n\r\nLet’s take a closer look at the fundamentals of SPY.\n\nStory continues\n\nSPY in Focus\n\nSPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust holds 503 stocks in its basket, with each accounting for no more than 7.3% of the assets. This suggests a nice balance across each security and prevents heavy concentration. The fund is widely spread across sectors with information technology, financials, healthcare and consumer discretionary accounting for a double-digit allocation each. SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust has an AUM of $485.5 billion and charges 9 bps in fees per year. It trades in average daily volume of 66 million shares and has a Zacks ETF Rank #3 (Hold) with a Medium risk outlook (see: all the Large Cap Blend ETFs here).\r\n\r\nBelow we have highlighted the abovementioned five best-performing stocks in the ETF.\n\nBest-Performing Stocks of SPY\n\nMeta Platforms is the world’s largest social media platform. The company’s portfolio offering evolved from a single Facebook app to multiple apps like the photo and video sharing app Instagram and WhatsApp messaging app due to acquisitions. The stock jumped 35% in a month and has an estimated earnings growth of 19.2% for this year.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms makes up for 2.1% of the assets in SPY and currently has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). It has a VGM Score of B. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNvidia is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of graphic processing unit or GPU. The stock has jumped 220% this year. It has an estimated growth of 268.3% for the fiscal year ending January 2024.\r\n\r\nNvidia makes up for 3.8% of the assets in SPY and has a Zacks Rank #2 at present. It has a Growth Score of A.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has strengthened its position in the semiconductor market on the back of its evolution as an enterprise-focus company from a pure-bred consumer-PC chip provider. The stock has rallied 28.2% over the past month and makes up for 0.7% in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nAdvanced Micro Devices has an estimated earnings growth rate of 36.9% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) (read: Tech Leads S&P 500 to Highs: Does Further Rally Await ETFs?).\r\n\r\nJuniper Networks is a leading provider of networking solutions and communication devices. The company develops, designs, and sells products that help to build network infrastructure used for services and applications based on a single Internet protocol network worldwide. The stock has gained 23.5% and accounts for a 0.03% share in the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nJuniper Networks has an estimated earnings growth rate of 3.1% for this year and has a Zacks Rank #2 at present.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks offers network security solutions to enterprises, service providers and government entities worldwide. The stock has gained about 22% over the past month and makes up for 0.25% of the SPY portfolio.\r\n\r\nPalo Alto Networks has an estimated earnings growth rate of 23.6% for the fiscal year ending July 2024 and a Zacks Rank #3.

        "title": "12 Most Advanced AI Assistants",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 12 most advanced AI assistants. If you want to skip our analysis of AI and its current developments, go directly to 5 Most Advanced AI Assistants.\n\nIn the last several decades, technology has undergone significant evolution. It's not just computers and smartphones that are now connected to the internet. Everyday items like light fixtures, televisions, large household appliances, vehicles, and even doorbells are becoming part of the online network. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, stands out as potentially the most significant technological breakthrough in our lifetimes. According to a PwC report, a mere year after the introduction of OpenAI's ChatGPT, 54% of surveyed companies had already integrated generative AI into various aspects of their business operations. Established companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) are at the forefront, launching AI products and services that have a far-reaching influence on billions of users worldwide.\n\nFor years, both consumers and enterprises have been leveraging artificial intelligence in various ways: interacting with voice assistants like Siri and Alexa, automating repetitive tasks, and employing algorithms to identify patterns and correlations in data. However, it was the emergence of applications capable of generating original text and digital art that truly marked a significant milestone—a new era where AI demonstrates its ability to mimic human creative processes and quickly becomes widely recognized. Of course, AI has long been a fast-moving field, but these past few years have led the industry through lightning-fast developments. In November 2022, ChatGPT was launched, and just four months later, OpenAI introduced a new and significantly enhanced large language model (LLM) named GPT-4. Additionally, Anthropic’s generative AI, Claude, made remarkable progress by May 2023, now capable of processing 100,000 tokens of text in a minute, equivalent to about 75,000 words—an average novel’s length. This was a substantial improvement from its initial capacity of roughly 9,000 tokens when it debuted in March 2023. Moreover, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has made several advancements with generative AI, including the introduction of a new Large Language Model (LLM) called PaLM 2 in May of last year, which serves to power the Bard chatbot, as well as other Google products, showcasing the company's commitment to pushing the boundaries of generative AI technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nSee also: 10 Best AI Stocks for 2024\n\nGenerative AI use in the enterprise will expand beyond just individuals, teams, and departments: There will be AI assistants in corporate boardrooms across the globe, helping companies navigate dynamic markets, increase profits, and gain an advantage over their competitors. When company execs are debating issues like whether they should ramp up hiring, or which market they should expand to next, there will be an AI assistant in the room that provides analysis and recommendations. Given the stakes, these companies will leverage technology that’s been customized for this purpose and for each business. These AI assistants will take into account a company’s industry, its competitors, business goals, historical industry data, etc., to provide executives with the most precise insights possible. As such, the influence of generative AI on productivity has the potential to contribute trillions of dollars in value to the global economy. According to McKinsey’s research estimates, the technology could bring about an annual addition of approximately $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nOld habits die hard, in investing and in life.\n\nTake for example an employee who has been doing the same thing for a decade, then gets a promotion in large part because of what they were doing the last decade. It's evolve or die in this new role — risk clinging to the past and its myriad of practices, or embrace the future and crush it.\n\nThe same could be applied to investors at this very moment in time.\n\nEvolve your thinking around the Magnificent Seven trade that has brought you immense paper profits the past year, or get your portfolio blown up in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAm I being too harsh? Maybe, but I need to be because I truly feel that investors have forgotten there are more ways to make money than hitting the buy button on seven tech stocks. And with their blinders on, they are overlooking new trends/news/info that warrant a short-term pause on the explosive Mag Seven trade.\n\nFirst thing that is fresh to the scene is an updated market narrative.\n\nIf late 2023 was all about interest rate cuts in an election year, then the first half of 2024 is shaping up to be about the potential for next to no rate cuts this year.\n\nHeadline job creation of 353,000 for January and big upward revisions for job gains in November and December signal an economy doing pretty darn well. It's an economy that in no way needs a rate cut this spring. An economy so strong as to justify a more hawkish Fed.\n\n\"Forget the anecdotal signs of tech layoffs and companies going for efficiency this year, the economy is producing hundreds of thousands of new jobs,\" FWDBONDS chief economist Chris Rupkey wrote in a client note.\n\n\"Fed officials are going to have to sharpen their pencils on the timing of any interest rate cuts this year because higher rates are sure not slowing the economy down.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, the incoming data from the last two weeks suggests no rate cuts are imminent — and that removes a key tailwind that powered market psychology (and inflated trading multiples) around Mag Seven stocks.\n\nThen, secondarily, there are the fundamentals of these tech behemoths as seen on their recent earnings days.\n\nI'm not sure about you, but I haven't been blown away by results out of Mag Seven stalwarts Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla. All of these reports had warts that should call into question trading multiples on them. Apple's performance in China was weak. March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet, it missed on cloud sales. Tesla's quarter and Elon Musk-led earnings call was littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — for now — that all its new AI is going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street in 2024. Stripping out the first-ever dividend by Meta being announced, its quarter was reasonable — but it's also jacking up its 2024 capex a ton.\n\nAmazon's quarter was the lone rockstar through and through. Accelerating sales out of AWS, impressive operating margin expansion, and a killer guidance.\n\nTake all of this new info together and the message should be clear to investors ... evolve your thinking on the Mag Seven, or else.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nBig Tech Crushes Earnings: Which One Should You Buy?\n\nWe saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.\n\nLast Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft and Alphabet, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nAll these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.\n\nEarnings Summaries\n\nMicrosoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.\n\nAlphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.\n\nAmazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nMeta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nValuations\n\nThe chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.\n\nAAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.\n\nThe success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.\n\nMeta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nAlphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business, does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubt it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.\n\nApple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.\n\nNonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 5, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Results Solidify Market Leadership\n\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\n\nThese companies, along with their peers in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of stocks – Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia – led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\n\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn’t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\n\nTesla’s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\n\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThis week’s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week’s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index’s total membership.\n\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week’s line-up includes a who’s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "Meta Oversight Board Warns Rules on Fake Posts Are ‘Incoherent’",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc.’s independent Oversight Board agreed with the company’s recent decision to leave up a misleading video of US President Joe Biden, but criticized its policies on content generated by artificial intelligence as “incoherent” and too narrow.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhy NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% Off Powell Tells ‘60 Minutes’ Fed Is Wary of Cutting Rates Too Soon Musk Took Drugs With Some Tesla Board Members, WSJ Says World Cup 2026 Final Goes to NYC-Area in Victory Over Dallas and LA The New Work-Life Balance: Don’t Have Kids\n\nThe board, which was set up in 2020 by management to independently review some of the company’s most significant content moderation decisions, on Monday urged Meta to update its policies quickly ahead of the 2024 U.S. general election.\n\n“The Board is concerned about the manipulated media policy in its current form, finding it to be incoherent, lacking in persuasive justification and inappropriately focused on how content has been created, rather than on which specific harms it aims to prevent, such as disrupting electoral processes,” the organization said in a statement.\n\nThe criticism from the board came after reviewing Meta’s decision to leave up a manipulated video of Biden, which was edited to make it look like he was inappropriately touching his adult granddaughter’s chest. The video included a caption that referred to Biden as a “pedophile.”\n\nRead More: Taylor Swift, Joe Biden, Dead Kids: Fake AI Content Floods In\n\nThe Oversight Board agreed that the video didn’t violate Meta’s manipulated media policies, but said those policies are far too narrow and insufficient. The board also recommended that Meta stop removing altered media that doesn’t violate any other policy against harmful content, but instead start to label it and leave it up.\n\n“We are reviewing the Oversight Board’s guidance and will respond publicly to their recommendations within 60 days in accordance with the bylaws,” a Meta spokesperson said. The company isn’t obligated to take the board’s recommendations, and at times has ignored its advice.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn January, an influx of deepfake content of high-profile individuals showed the public and lawmakers the pace at which manipulated content can appear online with the help of new AI tools. Explicit images of Taylor Swift inundated social platform X, formerly known as Twitter, while fake robocalls of Biden’s voice were sent to voters ahead of the New Hampshire primary, urging them not to vote.\n\nMeta’s current policy only blocks fake videos of people saying things they didn’t say. It doesn’t cover portrayals of people doing things they didn’t do – like the Biden post – and explicitly only applies to videos created with artificial intelligence tools. Content that’s been edited without using AI, like looping or reversing a video clip, could be misleading to the average user but isn’t prohibited.\n\nThe board recommended that Meta expand its policies to cover manipulated media that portrays an action a person didn’t actually take and to address fake audio. It also urged the company to make clear what harms it’s aiming to prevent, like interfering with the voting process, and focus more on those harms rather than whether content was created using AI tools or not.\n\n“As it stands, the policy makes little sense,” Michael McConnell, the board’s co-chair, said in a statement. “It bans altered videos that show people saying things they do not say, but does not prohibit posts depicting an individual doing something they did not do. It only applies to video created through AI, but lets other fake content off the hook.”\n\nMeta, along with peers like X and ByteDance Ltd.’s TikTok, will find itself dealing with more and more manipulated media as AI technology improves and the election inches closer. Meta first rolled out its policy ahead of the 2020 election, part of a broader effort by the company to crack down on election-related misinformation after the 2016 US campaign exposed how social networks could be gamed.\n\nRead More: Understanding Deepfakes and the Taylor Swift Images\n\nIn many ways, this type of situation is exactly why the Oversight Board was created. The independent body, which is made up of academics and others with public policy backgrounds, is funded by Meta, but is meant to serve as a check on the company’s power over content. In the past, the board has reviewed issues across Facebook and Instagram regarding election misinformation and drug-related posts. It upheld Meta’s suspension of Donald Trump following the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, while simultaneously criticizing the company’s implementation of the suspension.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders  Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Over the past four years, Wall Street has been a stomping ground for volatility. Beginning in 2020, the three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years.\n\nDuring periods of heightened volatility, it's not uncommon for investors to seek out the safety of time-tested outperformers. While the \"FAANG stocks\" have certainly fit the bill since 2013, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" that now find themselves in the spotlight. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThese seven industry-leading businesses have vastly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 since the start of 2023, and they all offer sustained moats and/or clear-cut competitive advantages that have made them attractive investments.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure ranks No. 2 in global cloud infrastructure services market share. Apple's iPhone has been the domestic smartphone share leader for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Apple's capital-return program is unrivaled by all other public companies. Alphabet's Google accounted for a monopoly esque 91.5% of worldwide internet search share in January 2024. Further, Alphabet is the parent of YouTube, the second most-visited social site, and Google Cloud, the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure service share. Amazon brought in nearly $0.40 of every $1 spent in U.S. online retail sales in 2022. It's also the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is responsible for nearly a third of global cloud infrastructure service share. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of all artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms holds the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet. Facebook is the most-visited social site, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger, in combination with Facebook, help to collectively draw almost 4 billion users to Meta's family of apps each month. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker -- nearly 1.85 million EVs produced in 2023 -- and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven in 2023, their outlooks in 2024 (and beyond) notably differ. As we move forward into the shortest month of the year, one component stands out as exceptionally inexpensive, while another is rife with warning signs.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in February: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven widely owned companies that comprise the Magnificent Seven, none stands out as a smarter buy for investors right now than Alphabet.\n\nWhereas most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have fared well during earnings season, Alphabet stock took it on the chin. Specifically, Wall Street was less than pleased with growth in the company's core advertising segments.\n\nArguably the biggest concern for Alphabet is that nearly 76% of its $86.3 billion in total revenue from 2023 came from advertising. It's no secret that advertisers will pare back their spending at the first hint of trouble for the U.S. or global economy. There are a couple of money-based metrics and recession-predicting tools that suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy is likely in 2024.\n\nBut it's equally important for investors to take this guessing game in stride. Even though we can't predict when recessions will occur, history pretty conclusively shows they don't last very long. Nine of the 12 recessions since 1945 have ended in less than a year, with none of the remaining three surpassing 18 months. On the other hand, periods of expansion are known to last for years. Buying ad-driven leaders during periods of short-lived economic weakness has, historically, been a genius move.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited about Alphabet when its foundational cash-cow segment appears impenetrable. As noted, Google accounts for 91.5% of worldwide internet search share. You have to go back almost nine years to find the last time Google didn't comprise at least 90% of global search on a monthly basis. It's the undisputed leader in search, which makes it a hot commodity for businesses wanting to target their advertising. In short, it gives Alphabet virtually unparalleled ad-pricing power.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's future cash-flow drivers are likely found in its ancillary operating segments. Daily views of YouTube Shorts catapulted from 6.5 billion in 2021 to more than 50 billion by early last year. This new monetization channel has been a nice lift for YouTube's ad revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud just delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of operating income following years of operating losses. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, which suggests there's a double-digit, exceptionally high-margin growth opportunity to be had with cloud infrastructure services.\n\nBut the top selling point for Alphabet might just be that it remains cheap. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 is actually lower than the forward P/E of the benchmark S&P 500 -- despite Alphabet's offering a higher growth rate. Furthermore, it's valued at less than 13 times forward-year cash flow, which compares to an average cash flow multiple of 18 times over the previous five years.\n\nTack on a $97.7 billion net cash buffer and it's easy to see why Alphabet is a screaming bargain in February (and beyond). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in February: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are worth buying. In February (and likely beyond), semiconductor giant Nvidia is worth avoiding.\n\nNvidia's claim to fame has been the rapid ascent and uptake of AI solutions. Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs have, thus far, handily outperformed the competition, which has allowed the company to absolutely dominate in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nOne of the more exciting developments in calendar year 2024 for Nvidia is a meaningful uptick in A100 and H100 output. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which will allow Nvidia to supply more of its game-changing AI chips this year.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Nvidia has benefited immensely from A100 and H100 GPU scarcity. Through the first-half of fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January), Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined. In other words, the entirety of the company's data-center revenue growth came from exceptionally strong pricing power.\n\nWhile there's no denying Nvidia has made its shareholders richer, there are a number of potential red flags.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia's gross margin is liable to come under pressure in fiscal 2025 as output of its A100 and H100 GPUs increases. As scarcity of its AI-GPUs wanes, there'll be less of a reason for businesses to pay a premium price for these chips. In short, Nvidia may be its own worst enemy -- at least from a margin standpoint.\n\nIt's also increasingly likely that Nvidia's market share of GPUs used by AI-accelerated data centers has peaked or is very near a peak. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and plans to ramp up the rollout of this Nvidia competitor in 2024. In December, Intel unveiled its generative AI Gaudi3 chip to compete with Nvidia's H100 chip. Gaudi3 is expected to launch sometime this year. AMD and Intel shouldn't have trouble grabbing share from Nvidia.\n\nU.S. regulators have given investors another reason to keep their distance from Nvidia. On two separate occasions, regulators have restricted the chips Nvidia could export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Even the slower GPUs Nvidia crafted for China failed to garner a thumbs-up from U.S. regulators for export. These restrictions have the potential to cost Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nThe final straw for Nvidia is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has resulted in an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have always overestimated the uptake of a new innovation or technology. I don't anticipate AI or its poster child (Nvidia) being exceptions to the rule.\n\nAt more than 61 times estimated cash flow in fiscal 2024, and with a laundry list of red flags, Nvidia makes for an easy avoid in February.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

        "title": "10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best Australian stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of some of the biggest stocks in Australia and how you might trade them, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Australian Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhen we talk about the fundamentals of macroeconomics, land, along with capital and labor, is a fundamental component of economic growth. After all, land is needed for setting up industrial plants, offices, and other facilities that constitute the fabric of any economy. Subsequently, it's unsurprising that several of the world's largest economies, such as the United States, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of India, and the Russian Federation are all among the largest countries geographically.\n\nThe exceptions to this, namely Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, rely on either their population or engineering technology to make up for a smaller geographical footprint. One country that is among the biggest in the world, at least when it comes to its size, is Australia. Occupying an entire island, Australia is one of three Anglo Western nations in the southern hemisphere, and it's among the most developed nations in the world.\n\nAustralian companies engage in billions of dollars of business each year, and the nation's gross domestic product per capita in nominal terms (GDP per capita) is $63,487 - the tenth highest globally. Additionally, Australia is relatively peaceful and ranks low in corruption perception indexes, making it unsurprising that hundreds of thousands of immigrants flock to its border annually to try to improve their living standards.\n\nLike most countries, Australia is also facing economic turbulence as we enter 2024. Its proximity to China makes it dependent on the second most populous nation in the world, and Australia's strong natural resources industry also ties its prosperity with the global economy.\n\nThese factors also affect when it comes to Australian stocks. Some top Australian stocks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX:CBA.AX) and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Additionally, since Australia is anything but geographically close to the United States, several Australian stocks that represent important portions of its economy are not available for trading on U.S. stock indexes such as the NYSE and the NASDAQ. However, other Australian stocks such as Woodside Energy Group Ltd (NYSE:WDS) do offer American investors to directly take advantage of their strengths locally through the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, if one were to simply rely on American stock indexes, then investing in Australian stocks would provide an incomplete picture. This is because if we use a stock screener to narrow out all Australian stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, then a clear divide is present in the form of market capitalization. For instance, while it's true that the most valuable Australian stock in terms of market capitalization is BHP Group whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) can be bought on the NYSE, the next couple of stocks are available only on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).\n\nSome such Australian stocks are also the most valuable. In fact, some high market capitalization stocks apart from the Commonwealth Bank, such as National Australia Bank Limited (NAB.AX), Fortescue Ltd (FMG.AX), and National Australia Bank Limited (NAB.AX) which have a combined market capitalization of hundreds of billions of dollars do not have their shares trade on U.S. stock exchanges. If you're interested in finding out which locally traded ASX Australian stocks bring in billions in revenue, you can take a look at 15 Largest Australian Companies by Revenue.\n\nHowever, one major Australian stock that trades directly on the NYSE is a technology firm. The U.S. consumer and enterprise technology industry is the most advanced in the world and often sees the world's best and brightest vie for an opportunity to work for mega cap giants such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Yet, it's Australia that also competes with the big guns when it comes to organizational, human resources, and project management software.\n\nThis is because among the handful of Australian stocks available for trading on U.S. exchanges is the Sydney based software firm Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM). Domiciled in Delaware, along with Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Atlassian was among the first firms in the world to develop project management software. Its main product Jira is widely recognized in the industry, and the firm's financial results for Q2 FY2024 reveal that Jira brought in a cool $1 billion in recurring revenue. The firm's Form-10Q for the quarter ending in September 2023 shows that out of the $977 million in total revenue or net sales, $426 million or 43.6% came from the United States. For this particular Australian stock, unlike others like BHP, the U.S. economy is much more important when it comes to analyzing share price performance and evaluating it as a candidate for investment. Since Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) is an enterprise focused firms, tighter economic conditions such as high inflation and interest rates end up acting as headwinds but also potentially priming it for future growth.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best Australian stocks to buy. Some notable picks are Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP). 10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best Australian stocks, we scanned far and wide and made a list of 21 Australian stocks that either trade directly on U.S. exchanges such as the NYSE and NASDAQ or have their American Depository Receipts available for trading. They were ranked by the number of hedge fund investors in Q3 2023 and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best Australian stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy\n\n10. Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 1\n\nMesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO) is one of the smallest companies on our list. Headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, the firm is a biotechnology company which has several products in trials to treat diseases such as retinopathy and inflammatory diseases.\n\nJust one hedge fund out of the 910 that are part of Insider Monkey's database had bought Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO)'s shares as of Q3 2023 end. This lone investor was Israel Englander's Millennium Management.\n\nMesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO) joins Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) in our list of the best Australian stocks to buy.\n\n9. Immutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 2\n\nImmutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP) is another biotechnology company. It is headquartered in Sydney and is developing treatments to tackle cancer. During its second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the firm had $103 million in cash and equivalents. It believes that these are sufficient to cover operations for the next couple of years.\n\nAs of September 2023 end, two out of the 910 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey were the firm's shareholders. Immutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP)'s largest investor in our database is Israel Englander's Millennium Management due to its $1.4 million stake.\n\n8. Opthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 4\n\nOpthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT) develops treatments for eye diseases that involve the organ's blood vessels and fluid management.

Tritium DCFC Limited (NASDAQ:DCFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 7\n\nTritium DCFC Limited (NASDAQ:DCFC) is the first non biotechnology Australian stock on our list. The firm is part of the highly critical electric vehicle charging industry that has to grow if EVs are to dominate the future. 2023 hasn't been kind to the Australian stock either, as not only did the shares drop by more than 80%, but Raymond James and B. Riley downgraded them to Market Perform and Neutral from earlier ratings of Outperform and Buy.\n\nBy Q3 2023 end, seven out of the 910 hedge funds surveyed by Insider Monkey were Tritium DCFC Limited (NASDAQ:DCFC)'s investors. Given the turbulence during Q4, upcoming hedge fund filings for the quarter will be interesting, to say the least.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens. You can skip our detailed analysis of methods of obtaining second passport as well as a look at the US MNCs in the European market and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.\n\nIn this ever-expanding world of opportunities, the idea of second passports has been hailed as a harbinger of many benefits, both economic and social. Whether it is a desire to live and experience the gems and natural wonders of this world, incentives for a higher quality of life, or even financial diversification, there is something for everyone here. About half a century ago, the concept of a second passport or dual citizenship was unfathomable and highly disliked by almost all countries. However, with time and advancement, the significance of a free flow of residents between countries has been acknowledged, and a more tolerant view has emerged as a consequence. Thus, we can now find various easy countries for a second passport for U.S. citizens.\n\nAs is the case with almost everything, there are both advantages and disadvantages to acquiring and maintaining a second passport. However, with the increasing trend towards dual citizenship, it appears that the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects. The perks include, but are not limited to, access to global travel, better social and economic benefits, more business and job opportunities, and certain tax reliefs. For a detailed analysis of dual citizenship advantages and disadvantages, check out our article on Dual Citizenship: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements. Thus, the appeal of obtaining a second passport can be understood, and the search for the easiest countries to achieve this, is justified.\n\nWhere are the Americans Moving?\n\nThe growing demand for a second passport has prompted many people, especially the rich, to relocate to various countries around the globe. According to a recent estimate from the State Department, approximately 9 million Americans are living abroad. It is observed that 40% of US residents abroad choose to move to the Western Hemisphere, which includes Canada, Central, and South America. Additionally, 26% move to Europe, 14% to East Asia and the Pacific, and another 14% to the Middle East. Many prominent US entrepreneurs have made headlines with news of their foreign citizenship. Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has acquired Indonesia’s Golden Visa. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), chose Cyprus’s Golden Visa, and billionaire Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), obtained New Zealand’s citizenship in 2011. Therefore, it is evident that there are countries where US residents can gain a second passport with ease.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Get a Second Passport\n\nTo acquire a second passport, there are primarily four paths to follow: citizenship through birth/descent, citizenship through marriage, citizenship through investment, and citizenship through a residency-by-investment program or naturalization. Citizenship through birth/descent is attained by being born to parents with citizenship, automatically granting the same for the child. Proof of an ancestral connection with a citizen can also lead to citizenship. Citizenship through investment is mainly acquired by making an economic investment in the country. Naturalization is a process through which citizenship can be achieved by gaining residency in a country, often through investment, and building a relationship with the country by spending a specified time there. Alternatively, citizenship can be granted by marrying a citizen of a country. Thus, depending on the method employed, there are many countries where US residents can access a second passport.\n\nIs it Just US Residents or Are Multinationals (MNCs) Expanding to Europe too?\n\nEuropean markets stand among the largest global economies. With an increasing influx of emigrants to these states, it's no surprise that more companies are expanding their operations there. Thirty percent of US companies move to Europe to achieve their profit goals, and thirty-two percent even introduce new products to tap into this burgeoning market.\n\nIreland’s economy, in particular, has experienced a staggering positive impact from multinationals in 2022. These companies contributed 56% to the total value added, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Notably, sectors such as information and communication, dominated by MNCs like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), witnessed the most significant expansion.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is actively expanding its operations in the European market, as indicated by recent developments. In October 2023, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), secured unconditional EU anti-trust approval for its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen (SGEN.O).\n\nSimilarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is making strategic moves to maintain a strong presence in the European market. On December 13, 2023, the company announced the expansion of its Self Service Repair program, now covering the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips. This extension includes the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) also confirmed the availability of this Self Service Repair program in 24 additional European countries, such as Croatia, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens\n\n15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, we conducted extensive research on the best and most straightforward options available. We also referred to our article from the previous year, highlighting the 15 Easiest Countries to Get Citizenship as an American. Additionally, we cross-referenced our findings with ImmigrantInvest.com’s list of countries that permit dual citizenship for US citizens. Our comprehensive approach considered various methods for obtaining dual citizenship, encompassing citizenship by descent, residency, naturalization through investment programs, and citizenship by investment programs. We made sure to include countries from diverse regions, spanning Latin America, Asia and the South Pacific, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nNow that we have thoroughly combed our sources and selected the easiest countries for second passport for US citizens, we present it to you in an ascending list:\n\n15. New Zealand\n\nIn the Asia and South Pacific region, numerous countries offer citizenship through various means. Considering the countries that permit dual citizenship for US residents and the fact that New Zealand falls under the category of the easiest countries to obtain citizenship through descent, we have placed this country at number 15 on our list.\n\nConsidered one of the most affordable and expedient methods to acquire a second passport, gaining citizenship in New Zealand is remarkably straightforward. If one of the parents is a citizen of New Zealand, the child can easily obtain citizenship by submitting an application, with the process typically taking about 30 working days. For those seeking an even faster turnaround, a reduced processing time of 10 days is available for an additional fee. New Zealand, being a developed country, ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Acquiring dual citizenship from this nation can prove to be a beneficial option for many Americans.\n\n14. Italy\n\nItaly, being one of the European countries, stands out as one of the easiest nations to obtain citizenship for US residents through descent. All that is required is proof of Italian descent, with a birth certificate of oneself and one's parents, grandparents, or any direct ancestor typically considered sufficient. Other acceptable documents may include death certificates, divorce or marriage certificates. However, two conditions must be met: the ancestor acquired citizenship before June 14, 1912, and this citizenship had not been renounced or replaced by a second citizenship before the birth of their child.\n\n13. St. Kitts and Nevis\n\nSituated in the Caribbean, this picturesque island is a favored destination for US residents. It not only provides the chance to enjoy natural marvels but also offers opportunities for financial gains through multiple tax advantages. The St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the easiest and quickest ways for US citizens to obtain a second passport. The program doesn't require any mandatory stay period in the country, and the immigration process is completed in just four months. The primary requirement is a $250,000 payment to the Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC).\n\n12. St. Lucia\n\nSimilar to St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean island stands out as one of the easiest options for obtaining a second passport for US citizens. The St. Lucia investment program is particularly cost-effective, requiring a contribution of $100,000 to St. Lucia’s Government Development Fund as the minimum investment. While this figure applies for a single person, a slightly higher amount for a spouse or children allows the qualified US resident to secure dual citizenship for themselves and their family in just three months.\n\n11. Vanuatu\n\nIn the Pacific region, Vanuatu takes the lead by offering the only citizenship-by-investment program. Individuals, including US residents, can acquire citizenship by investing $130,000. Beyond the relatively low investment requirement, the most significant advantage lies in the expeditious process, which can be completed in approximately 2 months. Vanuatu not only offers various tax benefits, including no income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax but also provides a straightforward and easy pathway for gaining a second passport for US residents.\n\n10. Ireland\n\nIreland is a popular destination for immigration, particularly through the Descent Program. The Irish government has made this process highly accessible, allowing individuals to qualify for citizenship rights by establishing an ancestral connection up to the great-grandfather. Additionally, other familial ties, such as marriage to an Irish citizen, provide an opportunity for citizenship, with the requirement of spending at least three years with the said spouse or partner. Although this period may seem relatively long, it is shorter compared to Portugal or Switzerland. Therefore, Ireland stands out as one of the easiest countries for obtaining a second passport for US citizens.\n\n9. Canada\n\nClose to the US, Canada is considered one of the easiest countries for US residents to apply for obtaining dual citizenship. Known for its welcoming environment, Canada boasts a straightforward immigration process. While US citizens don't require a visa for stays less than 180 days, a visa or residency permit is needed for longer stays.\n\nWhile the Quebec Investor Program is an option, the easiest route is through the Express Entry System. Under this program, individuals skilled in three major economic fields in Canada are evaluated using a point system. The higher the points, the greater the likelihood of obtaining a visa. Subsequently, a stay of at least three years or 1095 days out of 5 years would lead to citizenship. Other conditions include passing tests related to Canadian history and language (English or French) as well as fulfilling any necessary tax obligations.\n\n8. Cyprus\n\nThis European country is renowned as one of the easiest nations providing citizenship through a residency-by-investment program. The Golden Visa allows an individual to acquire residency rights within three months, with an investment of at least €300,000. This residency can eventually lead to citizenship in approximately seven years, provided essential government requirements are met. These include maintaining the investment and residency for seven years, adhering to the required time period for staying in the country, and visiting Cyprus at least once every two years.\n\n7. Antigua and Barbuda\n\nThe Caribbean Islands continue to offer some of the easiest paths for obtaining a second passport for US residents, with Antigua and Barbuda emerging as a prominent option. Notably, this stunning island stands out due to its low investment amount ($100,000) and a quick and hassle-free process. In contrast to many countries that increase the initial investment amount with the introduction of more family members, Antigua and Barbuda includes a spouse and two children in the same figure, with additional cost only on the form of fees. There are three ways to make the investment, and citizenship can be obtained in about three to four months. However, the country requires a presence of five days a year for passport renewal.\n\n6. Grenada\n\nGrenada secures the 6th position on our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, primarily due to the speed with which citizenship can be achieved. The country's citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the best in the Caribbean Islands. With a minimum investment through a donation of $150,000 for a single person (which increases to $200,000 and additional fees for a family of four), a qualifying investor can attain citizenship within three to six months.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024 15 Countries With Highest Mortgage Rates 12 Most Innovative Economies in Europe\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Facebook Turns 20: Where Are Its Five Founders Now?",
        "content": "Chris Hughes (left) and Mark Zuckerberg in 2005. MediaNews Group via Getty Images\n\nExactly 20 years ago, Mark Zuckerberg and his four Harvard classmates and roommates—Eduardo Saverin, Andrew McCollum, Dustin Moskovitz and Chris Hughes—launched thefacebook.com, a website where college students could post information about themselves, exchange messages and befriend one another online. thefacebook.com was built upon a website Zuckerberg had created a year prior, called Facemash, which allowed Harvard students to judge the attractiveness of their fellow students.\n\nThe founding story of Facebook (Meta (META)) was so full of drama that it inspired the 2009 book The Accidental Billionaires and its subsequent film adaptation, The Social Network in 2010. Only four years after the launch of thefacebook.com, Zuckerberg was the only founder still holding an executive role in the company. Under his leadership, Facebook turned its first profit in 2009 and went public in 2012. In 2021, Zuckerberg rebranded the company into Meta Platforms, marking a new chapter that focuses no longer on social media but on cutting-edge technologies like Metaverse and artificial intelligence.\n\nAlthough all of Zuckerberg’s cofounders left the company fairly early on, they are either billionaires or well-off enough to pursue their true passions today, thanks to their founding equity in Facebook.\n\nHere’s where Facebook’s original five founders are today and what they are up to:\n\nMark Zuckerberg, the CEO\n\nAge: 39 Current occupation: Meta CEO Net worth: $144 billion\n\nZuckerberg is the longest-standing member of Facebook, serving as the company’s CEO and board chairman since the beginning and holding all the power over the company’s major decisions. He lives in Palo Alto, Calif. with his wife, Priscilla Chan, and their three daughters.\n\nIn 2015, the couple launched the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, a family foundation through which they have pledged to give away 99 percent of their wealth over their lifetime.\n\nEduardo Saverin, the financial chief\n\nAge: 41 Current occupation: Venture capitalist Net worth: $22 billion\n\nStory continues\n\nSaverin currently lives in Singapore with his wife, Elaine Andriejanssen, investing in startups in Southeast Asia and India through his venture capital firm, B Capital.\n\nSaverin was a junior at Harvard when he met Zuckerberg, who was a sophomore. They initially each agreed to invest $1,000 in Facebook and later committed another $18,000 each. Saverin served as the company’s first chief financial officer and business manager. He was also the first to part ways and Zuckerberg. He left in 2005 after Zuckerberg reportedly diluted his shares and cut him off, according to an exposé by Business Insider in 2012.\n\nSaverin moved to Singapore in 2009 and renounced his U.S. citizenship two years later, which resulted in huge savings capital gains taxes when he cashed out his Facebook shares. Saverin claimed he renounced his citizenship because of his “interest in working and living in Singapore.”\n\nDustin Moskovitz, the “marathon coder”\n\nAge: 39 Current occupation: CEO and investor Net worth: $14.8 billion\n\nToday, Moskovitz is best known as the CEO of Asana, a productivity management platform that went public in 2020.\n\nshared a dorm room with Zuckerberg he came up with the idea of Facemash in 2003. He was Facebook’s first chief technology officer and was known as one of the then startup’s “marathon coders.”\n\nMoskovitz left Facebook in 2008 to started Asana. He cofounded with another ex-Facebook engineer, Justin Rosenstein. Moskovitz owns 2 percent of the company, which makes up the majority of his $14.8 billion fortune. Moskovitz reportedly has an agreement with Zuckerberg that allows Zuckerberg to vote on behalf of his Facebook shares.\n\nChris Hughes, the ‘Empath’\n\nAge: 40 Current occupation: Author and scholar Net worth: about $500 million\n\nHughes is currently writing a book on the history of American economic governance entitled Marketcrafting: How the Visible Hand Shapes the Economy, expected to be published in 2025. He is a senior fellow at the Wharton School’s Legal Studies & Business Ethics Department under the University of Pennsylvania.\n\nA history and literature major at Harvard, Hughes was the only non-tech cofounder of Facebook and was internally nicknamed “the Empath.” His work focused on the site’s functionality and user-friendliness instead of coding.\n\nHughes left Facebook in 2007 to join Barack Obama’s presidential election campaign, introducing social media into Obama’s campaign strategy. When Facebook went public in 2012, Hughes’s stake in the company was worth $500 million. The same year, Hughes bought The New Republic. After an unsuccessful attempt to reboot the left-leaning, century-old publication, Hughes sold the magazine in 2016 to Win McCormack.\n\nIt’s unclear when Hughes cashed out his Facebook shares. As of 2019, he said he didn’t own equity in any social media companies.\n\nHughes is a board member of several New York-based nonprofits. He chairs the Brooklyn-based Foundation for Community Psychoanalysis and sits on the boards of the Chamber Music Society of Lincoln Center and the Washington Square Park Conservancy.\n\nAndrew McCollum, the prototype builder\n\nAge: 40 Current occupation: CEO and investor Net worth: $20 million\n\nMcCollum is currently the CEO of Philo, a San Francisco-based internet TV company in which he is also an investor. McCollum is an angel investor with the venture capital firms Flybridge Capital Partners and New Enterprise Associates. As of 2020, McCollum had invested in 18 startups and exited nine.\n\nMcCollum paused school to join Zuckerberg’s startup in 2004. He designed Facebook’s initial web interface and prototype. He and Zuckerberg parted ways in 2006 to continue his education and graduated from Harvard in 2007 with a bachelor’s in computer science. He later earned a master’s in education from Harvard.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning A Guide to 'Anatomy of a Fall': Plot, Characters, Awards Chances and More The 11 People Running Meta's $1 Trillion Social Media and Tech Conglomerate 'Kingsman' Director Matthew Vaughn Assembles Cast for New Spy Thriller\n\nRead the original story Facebook Turns 20: Where Are Its Five Founders Now? and others by Sissi Cao at Observer.",

        "title": "Meta Is Now a Dividend Stock, but This Tech Giant Is a Better Buy",
        "content": "The big surprise in Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ: META) fourth-quarter earnings report last week was the initiation of the social media giant's first-ever dividend. Meta will pay $0.50 per share to shareholders of record on Feb. 22. On an annualized basis, that works out to a dividend yield of about 0.5%.\n\nThis dividend yield will likely grow over time as Meta boosts its payout, although share buybacks are still a big part of the equation. Along with the dividend announcement, Meta disclosed that an additional $50 billion had been allocated for share buybacks. Meta poured nearly $20 billion into buying back its own stock in 2023; the dividend will eat up just over $5 billion over the next year if it remains at its current level.\n\nA tough sell for dividend investors\n\nFor dividend investors, Meta is a tough sell. There's plenty of room to grow the dividend over time; Meta reported a net income of $39 billion and a free cash flow of $44 billion for 2023. However, share buybacks appear to be the priority. If Meta takes the same path as Apple, which has been paying a dividend for a decade but still sports a dividend yield of around 0.5%, the dividend will never be all that consequential.\n\nAnother wrinkle is Meta's valuation. The stock isn't overly expensive, but it's not cheap, either. With a market capitalization of around $1.2 trillion following a post-earnings rally, the stock trades for roughly 27 times free cash flow.\n\nWhile Meta reported strong growth in Q4, with revenue surging 25% year over year and net income more than tripling, there's plenty of long-term uncertainty. For one, the core social media business faces the prospect of increased regulation. \"We could regulate you out of business if we wanted to,\" said Senator Thom Tillis during a recent Senate hearing with top social media executives focused on child safety.\n\nMeta's vast investments in the metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI) also have unclear and uncertain payoffs. Reality Labs, Meta's metaverse-focused division, reported an operating loss of $16 billion in 2023, and the company is pouring additional cash into AI hardware. Improving its various platforms with AI features makes sense, but it will be an expensive proposition.\n\nStory continues\n\nA better deal for dividend investors\n\nFor those not sold on Meta's long-term potential, International Business Machines(NYSE: IBM) looks like a far better deal. IBM's artificial intelligence strategy is crystal clear: Help its enterprise clients deploy AI technology through a mix of software and consulting services.\n\nWhile IBM's watsonx AI platform is a key component of this strategy, consulting is what brings customers in the door. The company disclosed in its Q4 report that AI commitments from customers doubled in Q4 from Q3, with two-thirds of business driven by the consulting arm.\n\nIBM produced $11.2 billion of free cash flow in 2023, and strong demand for AI products and services will contribute to growth in 2024. The company is eyeing $12 billion of free cash flow in 2024, which puts the price-to-free cash flow ratio at about 14, or roughly half that of Meta.\n\nIBM is growing more slowly than Meta, with mid-single-digit revenue growth expected for 2024. However, IBM's business comes with less uncertainty. While demand for IBM's enterprise software and services will ebb and flow with economic conditions, the company doesn't face existential threats like Meta's social media business, and it isn't relying on a moonshot like Meta's metaverse business.\n\nThen there's the dividend. IBM has paid a quarterly dividend uninterrupted since 1916, and it's raised that dividend annually for nearly three decades. Based on the latest quarterly payment of $1.66 per share, IBM stock currently sports a dividend yield of about 3.6%, more than double the S&P 500's meager 1.4% yield.\n\nThat dividend is well covered by free cash flow. IBM is set to pay out approximately $6.1 billion in dividends over the next year, which will eat up a hair over 50% of its free cash flow. This leaves plenty left over for other uses, including debt reduction, acquisitions, and a potential restart of share buybacks. IBM suspended all share buybacks after its megadeal for software company Red Hat closed in 2019.\n\nShares of IBM have rallied over the past year, gaining nearly 40% as investors started to buy into the company's growth story. While IBM isn't a growth stock like Meta, a combination of less uncertainty, a discounted valuation, and a far more generous dividend makes IBM stock a better buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in International Business Machines right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in International Business Machines, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and International Business Machines wasn't one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. are generating returns not seen since their heyday over a decade ago, with $58.7 billion handed to shareholders last year and more to come in 2024, even if crude prices drop. And yet, they’re struggling to compete in a stock market beholden to Silicon Valley.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk Took Drugs With Some Tesla Board Members, WSJ Says Iraq Says 16 Killed in US Strikes, Calls Security Risk Grave Biden Swipes at Trump’s Personality in ‘Weirdest Campaign’ Yet Japan Assures Fans Taylor Swift Can Make It to the Super Bowl\n\nChevron hit record production in 2023 while buying back 5% of its stock and forecasts oil and gas growth of as much as 7% this year, led by low-cost barrels from the Permian Basin. It was rewarded with a 3% bump in its shares Friday, slightly better than Shell Plc’s gain a day earlier. Exxon, which is gushing cash from the fast-growing oil discovery in Guyana, fell 0.4%.\n\nTheir stellar operational performance wasn’t enough to prevent them slipping further behind tech giants Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., which surged 20% and 8% respectively. Meta, which already trades twice the price-to-earnings ratio of the oil giants, added $197 billion to its market value as it lifted buybacks and introduced a dividend. The owner of Facebook, Instagram and Whatsapp is now three times the size of Exxon.\n\n“We are an essential industry to the global economy, an industry that’s been around for a long time and will be around for a long time in the future,” Chevron CEO Mike Wirth said on Bloomberg TV, adding that the company has increased its dividend for 37 consecutive years. “There’s a real value opportunity here for patient shareholders.”\n\nThe US is now the world’s biggest oil producer, pumping about 45% more than Saudi Arabia, in large part due to Exxon and Chevron’s frenetic drilling in the Permian Basin of Texas and New Mexico. And it’s a commodity still in high demand despite efforts to transition away, with consumption expected to rise through 2030 and perhaps beyond. But investors don’t seem to care. Energy makes up just 3.7% of the S&P 500 Index.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It should be a signpost flashing green,” said Jeff Wyll, a senior analyst at Neuberger Berman, which manages about $440 billion. “How much smaller can the sector get given its importance in the global market?”\n\nEquity investors appear to be sending a clear message that Big Tech is the future, and Big Oil is the past. They’re not wrong. Artificial intelligence and cloud computing offer decades of potential profit growth while the transition to lower carbon energy poses an existential threat to the oil majors. The cyclical nature of oil prices, and dependence on curtailed supply from Saudi Arabia to prop up the market, mean investors view oil companies’ cash flows as more volatile than their rivals in tech.\n\n“For the sector to trade at a higher multiple, the investors need to view oil as moving back into an era of scarcity,” Wyll said. “We may be there in a few years, but we’re not there now.”\n\nExxon and Chevron are determined to build their business to withstand such swings, as they have done throughout their more than 140-year histories. Both companies are investing heavily in Guyana and the Permian, where oil can be pumped profitably at less than $35 a barrel, some $40 below current prices. Refining and petrochemicals provide natural hedges to oil while Exxon is expanding trading to boost profits.\n\nIt may be good business, but it’s a hard sell in this market, said Dan Pickering, founder and chief investment officer of Pickering Energy Partners.\n\n“Meta announced a share repurchase authorization that’s essentially the size of Devon plus Diamondback. That makes people look,” Pickering said in an interview. “Chevron says, ‘We’re doing good in the Permian.’ That doesn’t make people look.”\n\nAnd like all commodity markets, too much success can lead to their downfall. By growing Permian production by around 10% this year and next, Exxon and Chevron are adding to global supplies that risk outpacing demand. It also risks stealing market share from the Saudis, who crashed prices to flush marginal suppliers out of the market in 2014 and 2020.\n\nFor Wirth, those risks are real.\n\n“We’re very committed to capital discipline through the cycle,” he said. “It’s an industry that at times hasn’t necessarily exhibited that, and I think it’s important our company and other companies remember the lessons of commodity markets.”\n\n—With assistance from Mitchell Ferman.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Finding tech stocks with unprecedented surge potential isn’t easy.\n\nSure, a company like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or Meta (NASDAQ:META) could (and probably will) keep generating massive gains for shareholders. Sticking with these mainstays is a reasonable position. But the true long-term tech stock potential lies in picking tomorrow’s Nvidia or Meta today.\n\nAnd that’s where small-cap tech stocks come into play. Lower priced with shakier financial standing, these companies are more likely 10x over the long run than existing tech stock leaders with massive valuations.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOf course, small-cap tech stocks are a finicky bunch. That’s why finding those that fit within an overall, larger ecosystem while approaching trends in a novel way is the best bet for finding tomorrow’s top tech stocks.\n\nAehr Test Systems (AEHR) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAehr Test Systems (NASDAQ:AEHR) stands out among tech stocks as one prepared to ride the semiconductor wave onward, but with a twist. It’s operational model means it isn’t competing with waves of upstarts and industry stalwarts. That’s because AEHR’s niche lies in creating and providing test systems that guarantee the reliability and quality of semiconductors.\n\nThey’re making chips tinier, more complex, and pricier. To that end, demand for sophisticated testing systems will soon skyrocket. Likewise, newfound demand positions Aehr as a small-cap tech stock on the brink of massive upward momentum.\n\nThe company reported impressive financial performance earlier in January, with a 45% year-over-year (YOY) increase in revenue and a 63% rise in GAAP net income. CEO Gayn Erickson acknowledged potential challenges, noting a slowdown in the electric vehicle (EV) market’s growth rate. Consequentially, this affects the timing of orders from both existing and prospective clients. But, AEHR’s expertise extends beyond EVs, encompassing chips used in 5G technology, AI, machine learning, and more. Overcoming EV market-related hurdles, AEHR is on track for a record 2024 and onward.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) DUOL stock: A phone displaying the duolingo logo in front of a computer screen displaying the duolingo site\n\nSource: dennizn / Shutterstock\n\nDuolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) is an often-overlooked gem among education tech stocks. It saw its shares more than double last year, though it’s now limping through 2024 and losing 15% since January. But, based on its strength, today’s dip is one worth buying. Despite initial doubts about the commercial viability of its mobile language learning apps, Duolingo has become a hot commodity.\n\nThe secret to its success? Customers can’t get enough. Several factors contribute to its widespread appeal. This includes the growing dependence on smartphones, the proven effectiveness of self-directed learning, engaging gamification elements, and lingering post-pandemic habits.\n\nDuolingo’s latest earnings report revealed a 54% YOY surge in subscription rates, bringing in $121.3 million for the quarter. The number of paid subscribers skyrocketed to 5.8 million, marking a 60% YOY increase. Buoyed by this triumph, Duolingo recently unveiled plans to expand its educational offerings to include music and math lessons.\n\nAlthough some argue that Duolingo’s market valuation is too high, similar criticisms were once leveled against Nvidia. With virtually no rivals matching its position, Duolingo is well-poised to maintain its dominance into 2024.\n\nFabrinet (FN) Small cap displayed on a Wall Street ticker board. Small cap stocks. Small-cap stocks.\n\nSource: iQoncept / Shutterstock\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN) can reasonably be called a small-cap tech stock equivalent to Nvidia. With its AI-focused business approach and solid growth recently, it climbed more than 60% over the past year. And, speaking of NVDA, the semiconductor stock ranks among Fabrinet’s major clients. But while Nvidia and others compete for supremacy in the AI “gold rush,” Fabrinet profits by providing the essential tools, ensuring its success regardless of the victor.\n\nFabrinet produces and supplies optical cables capable of transmitting data across hardware platforms at speeds exceeding 800GB per second, a crucial factor for developing machine learning and AI technologies. This product line contributes $500 million to Fabrinet’s revenue. Further, the potential for growth remains high. Projections suggest the company’s operational income could more than double shortly.\n\nAdditionally, Fabrinet’s valuation appears reasonable at merely 3x sales and 28.8x earnings. If economic conditions keep improving and tech firms continue targeting AI, Fabrinet could be one of 2024’s biggest tech stock stories.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "The metaverse has taken a back seat in terms of media attention and investor sentiment about the future of the technology. However, companies continue to pour billions of dollars into the hardware and software that will allow people to connect in a virtual space. That suggests there might still be some investment opportunity to be had here.\n\nIf you're interested in the companies leading the way on the metaverse, three big tech companies should be front and center in your research. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), and Unity Software(NYSE: U) are the standout leaders in the metaverse today.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWhether it intends it or not, Apple is a leader in the metaverse. The company creates and sells some of the devices consumers will use to interact virtually, whether that's smartphones and computers or next-generation virtual reality headsets like the Vision Pro.\n\nApple will also play a role in the creation and capture of virtual spaces. Most Apple iOS devices now include LiDAR, which helps map rooms or give spatial information about how far distances are in a virtual space. Apple's Augmented Reality Kit (ARKit) is also a leading platform for digital assets, and it's built into hundreds of millions of devices.\n\nThe metaverse is going to need hardware to interact with the virtual space, and Apple will be at the center of that hardware race. Apple may not build the metaverse, but it will build the devices we use to get there.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms changed its name from Facebook to tell investors this is now a metaverse company. Mark Zuckerberg is spending over $10 billion per year building the hardware and software to make his vision a reality. So far, it hasn't led to financial success or widespread adoption, but that hasn't stopped Meta Platforms.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is Meta Platforms' latest virtual reality headset built to interact with metaverse assets the company is creating. It's hard to call this device (or VR in general) a success for Meta, but it may lead to the technology that ultimately becomes successful.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's Ray-Ban sunglasses are an example of where this technology could be used in more devices. They are capture devices today, but will likely add AR features in the future, bridging the digital world and physical world in ways that may be more natural than with Quest or Apple's Vision Pro.  Meta is also beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence, which could be revolutionary in the metaverse. Users could ask the AI to make a virtual call to someone, create 3D assets, or pull up a sporting event or TV show in the virtual world.\n\nMeta Platforms may not be the dominant VR company a decade from now, but it's hard to argue this won't be a connective tissue in the metaverse, and that's not a bad place to be.\n\n3. Unity Software\n\nThere are two game engines vying to be the metaverse leaders, Unity and Unreal. Unreal, made by Epic Games, has become the better high-fidelity game engine, but Unity's claim to fame is as the preferred tool for making iOS games and VR content, and it is a preferred partner of Vision Pro at launch.\n\nUnity has struggled to find its footing as a public company as its business model has changed and advertising revenue hasn't taken off as hoped. These are challenges management needs to overcome, but Unity's value to metaverse developers is not in question.\n\nThis is still the leading game engine for virtual worlds, and I think it's more likely Unity's quality improves than developers switch to Unreal wholesale.\n\nThe future of the metaverse\n\nWhat we don't know is what the metaverse will look like a decade from now. Will it be a \"place\" we go to meet friends and do business, or will it be more like a 3D conference call?\n\nNo matter where we go in the metaverse, Apple, Meta, and Unity will be major players. For investors, that provides a lot of upside and optionality.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 2 Stocks Hit a $1 Trillion Market Cap By The End Of 2024?",
        "content": "It wasn't long ago that investors were wondering if a publicly traded U.S.-based company would ever reach the $1 trillion threshold. But in early August 2018, Apple hit that coveted mark. Not long after that, the market saw a correction. The market sold off heavily in late 2018 over tensions with the U.S.-China trade war and uncertain Federal Reserve policy. It eventually recovered, but then the COVID-19 sell-off of spring 2020 hit.\n\nAnother recovery took hold in short order and Apple regained trillion-dollar status, even rising above $2 trillion. By early January 2022, Apple was knocking on the door of a $3 trillion market cap, Microsoft was hovering around $2.5 trillion, Alphabet was almost at $2 trillion, Amazon and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) were both over $1 trillion, and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) was less than 10% away from hitting $1 trillion.\n\n2022 turned out to be a brutal year for big tech. When the dust had settled, only Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet were still above $1 trillion in market cap.\n\nCycles happen, especially with companies with many different business units and an international footprint. Instead of trying to time the market by guessing which companies could surpass the $1 trillion threshold, a better idea would be to find the companies that can not only reach $1 trillion by the end of 2024 but are likely to build upon that valuation in the future.\n\nAfter Meta's blowout earnings report this week, six companies are currently over $1 trillion in market cap -- Microsoft, Apple, Amazon, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Meta.\n\nHere's why Tesla and Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) are two top stocks worth buying before returning to trillion-dollar valuations. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. More drama with Tesla stock\n\nTesla stock doubled in 2023 but it is still down nearly 50% from its all-time high. And for good reason. Despite hitting its 2023 production goal, Tesla's growth has slowed -- especially when you look at profits and revenue. Its margins are also down as Tesla had to cut prices to make up for weak demand.\n\nStory continues TSLA Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIf you look at trailing-12-month figures, sales are up just 11.5%, net income is down 8.5%, and the operating margin has fallen by over 25% to just 11.2%.\n\nCEO Elon Musk hasn't done the company any favors as of late either, saying he is \"uncomfortable growing Tesla to be a leader in AI and robotics\" unless he has more voting control of the company.\n\nTesla can be a roller coaster of a stock and will probably remain volatile not just because it is in a cyclical industry, but also because the top brass can pour a lot of emotion into the company. However, you can argue that this emotion has done more good than harm.\n\nTesla remains the undisputed leader in electric vehicles (EVs). And although competition is mounting, no company is close to holding a candle to Tesla when it comes to the balance between profitability, international exposure, growth potential, and the trajectory the company is on to release lower-priced EV models for customers.\n\nSix years ago, Tesla was inconsistently profitable and hadn't scaled production of the Model 3 to achieve consistent cash flows. At that stage, emotional comments carried more weight. But today, Tesla is much more secure. Elon Musk is the voice of Tesla, but he is far from calling all the shots or operating with unilateral control.\n\nTesla has the balance sheet and cash flows to endure a self-inflicted setback or an industrywide slowdown. There's also a good chance that Tesla will take market share during a slowdown rather than lose it because other companies with legacy operations and budding EV segments may be more inclined to cut EV spending than damage an existing cash cow.\n\nOverall, Tesla is a good balance of risk and reward if you can stomach the volatility.\n\n2. Berkshire Hathaway contains multiple pockets of hidden value\n\nHovering around an all-time high and a market cap of just over $800 billion, Warren Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway is the second-closest company to $1 trillion behind Meta. The company has a lot of ways it can get there. The value of its public equity portfolio alone is $368.8 billion -- leaving the rest of the business to be valued at about $438.3 billion.\n\nBerkshire owns dozens of companies outright and has stakes in several private businesses. The sheer size of the overall company can be difficult to wrap your head around. Berkshire could be undervalued based on the major contributors alone.\n\nBerkshire's insurance businesses alone hold a treasure trove of value thanks to their predictable earnings and stability. The property and casualty insurance businesses are split into the investing side and the underwriting side. Its underwriting operations include GEICO, Berkshire Hathaway Primary Group, and Berkshire Hathaway Reinsurance Group.\n\nBerkshire is a master underwriter and has built a sizable float that grew to approximately $164 billion at the end of 2022. Valuing the insurance business alone by its float, which would be ultra-conservative, would make this asset worth around 20% of the overall market cap of the company.\n\nThere's also Berkshire's ownership of BNSF railroad, which booked nearly $6 billion in net earnings in 2022. Berkshire also owns a 92% stake in Berkshire Hathaway Energy, which could be worth around $90 billion. Finally, Berkshire generated $12.51 billion in net earnings from its manufacturing, service, and retailing businesses in 2022.\n\nPutting just a 10 price-to-earnings multiple on BNSF railroad and the manufacturing, service, and retailing business would make those businesses worth over $180 billion combined.\n\nAdd it all up, and very conservative valuations make Berkshire worth what it is today. Reasonable valuations would easily push its worth up over $1 trillion. Berkshire can surpass and stay above $1 trillion for a variety of reasons, like growing its businesses over time or multiple expansions for what it already owns.\n\nQuality businesses with plenty of room to run\n\nInvesting in a stock just because it is going up is a good way to lose money. To buy shares in a business, you need to be able to justify that it will be worth more in the future than it is today. Tesla is an industry leader with clear growth paths. Berkshire Hathaway is a conglomerate that blends value and growth from various sectors.\n\nBoth stocks have done well over the last year and could pull back if the market sells off. But if the market keeps rallying, I could see both companies worth over $1 trillion by the end of the year. In three to five years, it would be very surprising if any of these companies were worth less than $1 trillion.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

        "title": "The Stock Market Just Hit a New All-Time High. Here Are 3 Incredible Stocks I'm Still Buying.",
        "content": "With the stock market recently hitting new all-time highs, there are many stocks I'm worried about being richly valued. While they might eventually grow into those valuations, I'm looking for stocks that are still reasonably priced that could benefit from a multiple expansion.\n\nThree that come to mind are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), and MercadoLibre (NASDAQ: MELI). All three companies are still reasonably priced, and I think they make for strong buys now.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is far more than an e-commerce store. It's becoming more of a service-driven business, with its third-party seller, advertising, subscription, and cloud-computing services providing a large chunk of its revenue.\n\nThis has raised its margins across the board as its service divisions grew to become a larger portion of the company. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWith its gross margin hitting all-time highs and operating and profit margins not far behind, the transition of Amazon from a marginally profitable to a high-profit company is becoming a reality. While this chart doesn't include Q4 figures, they were phenomenal, with its gross, operating, and profit margins coming in at 17.2%, 7.8%, and 6.2% respectively..\n\nHowever, when a company's margins rise, its valuation should also increase. This is because the business can squeeze more profits out of every dollar it brings in -- which is why software companies have much higher valuations than retailers.\n\nBut despite Amazon's gross margins nearly doubling since 2017, it's valued at the same level. AMZN Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis doesn't make sense, and with another year of strong profit growth, don't be surprised if Amazon's stock earns a greater valuation by the end of this year.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (probably better known by its former name, Facebook) has a lot of investments in the metaverse and the augmented- and mixed-reality space, but it's still primarily an advertising company.\n\nAnd that's a tough industry to be in because ad budgets are slashed if a company thinks a recession is ahead. This affected Meta in late 2022 and 2023, but the ad market has rebounded along with increased optimism.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fourth quarter, Meta's ad revenue grew 24% to $38.7 billion, a new all-time high.This strength is expected to continue into the first quarter, with management estimating total revenue will be $35.8 billion, for 22% growth.\n\nAnd because Meta is now optimized for profits, its earnings per share (EPS) should explode higher, making the stock look cheaper on a price-to-earnings (P/E) basis.\n\nSo, while Meta might look expensive from a trailing P/E basis (30 times earnings), its forward P/E (which uses analyst projections for the next 12 months) is a bit cheaper at 26 times earnings. As the ad market continues to strengthen, this will boost the business and bring its stock price along with it. As a result, Meta looks like a great buy now.\n\n3. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre has a similar story to Amazon, which makes sense: Many call it the \"Amazon of Latin America.\" While this is true for one aspect of the business (MercadoLibre has a dominant e-commerce store and shipping logistics division), that description sells the company short. What it has that Amazon doesn't is a fintech and consumer credit division.\n\nWith more than 40% of revenue coming from fintech, it's a well-balanced company. And like Amazon, MercadoLibre has dramatically improving margins. MELI Gross Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nWhile its gross margin has remained fairly steady, its operating and profit margins have expanded significantly. In the third quarter, the operating margin increased 7.2 percentage points to 18.2%, and its profit margin rose 4.7 percentage points to 9.5%.\n\nDespite this increase, MercadoLibre trades at levels not seen in over a decade. MELI Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs a result, I think MercadoLibre is a fantastic buy here, as its stock price looks undervalued compared to historical trends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Avoid at All Costs in the Volatile Tech Sector",
        "content": "Many investors gravitate toward the tech sector for innovative companies that can outperform the market. The internet, e-commerce, cloud computing, and artificial intelligence are some of the innovations that helped tech stocks march higher for several years.\n\nHowever, tech tailwinds don’t carry every stock. Former fan favorites can also lose their charm as they report decelerating revenue and earnings growth. Not every tech stock is worth buying, and you may want to steer clear of these investments.\n\nSnap (SNAP) An apple iPhone showing the snapchat application alongside other snapchat logos. SNAP stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) has all of the makings of an equity right before the fall. Shares have almost doubled since the end of September resulting in a 60% gain over the past year. However, the stock is more than 80% down from its all-time high, and things are likely to stay that way if they don’t get worse.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap has a $27 billion market cap and continues to burn through cash. The company reported a $368 million net loss in the third quarter of 2023. Sure, adjusted EBITDA shows a profit of $40 million, but the acronym is nicknamed “Earnings Before I Tricked the Dumb Auditor” for a reason.\n\nThat’s a big net loss from $1.19 billion in revenue, and profit margins haven’t been improving by much. It’s normal for companies in growth mode to report high net losses and offer investors hope about narrowing net losses and a convincing path to profitability. However, Snap simply can’t provide any of those promises to investors.\n\nRevenue only crawled up by 5% year-over-year. It’s an unacceptable growth rate given the company’s valuation and inability to make meaningful processes while narrowing its net losses. 5% year-over-year revenue growth is sadly a highlight given how badly the other quarters have been.\n\nThese low growth rates come at a time when Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have recovered. Many smaller adtech companies are pulling up better numbers while making profits and having lower valuations. It’s hard to feel optimistic about anything this stock has to offer.\n\nStory continues\n\nEtsy (ETSY) etsy logo on a grey wall\n\nSource: quietbits / Shutterstock.com\n\nEtsy’s (NASDAQ:ETSY) P/E ratio has been rightfully lowered to 28 in a turn of events 2021 bulls may have never predicted. While the valuation makes the stock look more enticing at first glance, several valid concerns exist.\n\nThe third quarter of 2023 highlighted a company that is struggling to grow. The company only reported 7% year-over-year revenue growth which is a far cry from the days the company could churn out 30% year-over-year revenue growth before the pandemic. During the pandemic, Etsy could achieve revenue growth exceeding 80% year-over-year.\n\nThe number that concerns me the most is the company’s consolidated gross merchandise sales (GMS). This figure hit $3.0 billion and was up by 1.2% year-over-year. GMS is Etsy’s ceiling. This growth rate impacts the company’s total revenue which extends to net income.\n\nSince revenue growth outpaced GMS growth, it means Etsy is charging more for its buyers and sellers to fill in the gap between 1.2% GMS growth and 7.0% revenue growth. Higher costs may entice buyers and sellers to use other platforms. It wouldn’t be enough to take out the company, but it may be enough to keep GMS growth in the low single digits or even result in a year-over-year decline. Even worse, GMS was flat on a currency-neutral basis.\n\nEtsy’s leadership cited macroeconomic conditions as a headwind to consolidated GMS. A lot of other companies reported good earnings in 2023. That suggests there’s more to Etsy’s slowing sales than macroeconomic conditions.\n\nIf Etsy’s GMS continues to remain flat, then it should trade closer to eBay’s (NASDAQ:EBAY) P/E ratio. Etsy shares would have to drop by more than 50% from current levels to reach eBay’s P/E ratio. Etsy’s GMS growth is the company’s most important metric to follow at this time.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s easier to go after Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) after the company warned investors about a slowdown in 2024. The bad news resulted in shares falling by 12% in a single day. That brings the one-year gain to 14%, but long-term investors must still be happy with their five-year gain of 778%.\n\nHowever, investors may want to heed caution, especially if they take a deeper look at the recent quarter. Q4 2023 painted a gloomy picture that features 3% year-over-year revenue growth which isn’t what you want to see from a growth stock. Chinese EV companies seem to be eating Tesla’s lunch and challenging its dominance in China.\n\nBullish investors will point out that Tesla is more than just a car company. However, its other two revenue segments don’t make up a large enough percentage of total revenue to make meaningful impacts.\n\nThe “energy generation and storage revenue” segment grew by 10% year-over-year and represents less than 7% of the company’s total revenue. The “services and other revenue” segment increased by 27% year-over-year but barely made up 10% of the company’s total revenue.\n\nTesla has other revenue streams that go beyond selling cars, but automotive revenues still make up 85.7% of the company’s Q4 2023 revenue. The “non-car” segments make up a small percentage of revenue and are experiencing growth deceleration.\n\nTesla shares are trading at a premium based on the idea of it being a tech company. Only 14.3% of Tesla’s total revenue can be considered tech. Some investors may wait out the storm and see what happens, but better opportunities are available.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Facebook turns 20: Highs and lows from two decades of the social media giant",
        "content": "Facebook is marking its 20th anniversary, having risen from a network for students at a single university to one of the biggest internet platforms in the world today.\n\nHere is a look back at some of the key moments from the last 20 years of the social network.\n\n– The launch\n\nFacebook first launched on February 4, 2004 as a social network known as TheFacebook, initially aimed at students at Harvard College, before gradually expanding to other universities across the US.\n\nIn 2005, “The” was dropped from the name, paving the way for facebook.com -and by September 2006, the site was opened up to anyone aged 13 or over.\n\n– Stolen idea accusations\n\nFacebook founder Mark Zuckerberg found himself accused of stealing the idea of fellow Harvard students Cameron Winklevoss, Tyler Winklevoss, and Divya Narendra – who claimed that Mr Zuckerberg was meant to help them build a social network called HarvardConnection.\n\nA lawsuit was filed against Mr Zuckerberg, resulting in a settlement in 2008, which was dramatised in the movie The Social Network, starring Jesse Eisenberg. The stars of The Social Network (Ian West/PA)\n\n– Facebook goes public\n\nIn May 2012, Facebook went public, marking one of the largest initial public offerings (IPOs) in US history.\n\nThe company announced 421,233,615 shares priced at 38 dollars per share, though the first day of trading experienced some technical issues that prevented some orders from going through.\n\n– Instagram buyout\n\nFacebook successfully purchased rival social network Instagram in April 2012 for one billion dollars, bolstering the social network’s presence.\n\nInstagram has been kept largely independent, though parts of it have been integrated with Facebook, such as the ability to share photos on Facebook too, as well as Stories.\n\n– WhatsApp acquisition\n\nFacebook continued its acquisition spree in 2014, buying out messaging app WhatsApp for 19 billion dollars.\n\nLike Instagram, the app has remained separate, with some parts able to link up to the main Facebook social network.\n\nStory continues\n\n– Oculus VR\n\nFacebook made yet another deal in 2014, taking over virtual reality startup Oculus VR, for two billion dollars, as the company looked to expand its tech footprint beyond social media. Julie Refsdal, 20, tries out the Oculus Rift (Frantzesco Kangaris/PA)\n\n– Mood influencing study\n\nOne of Facebook’s earlier controversies came in 2014, when it emerged that a mood influence study was carried out on the News Feed.\n\nThe posts that appeared on the home page of 689,000 users were filtered, though Facebook said the experiment was to understand how people respond to different types of content, whether it is positive or negative in tone.\n\n– Hitting one billion users\n\nIn August 2015, Facebook announced that it had hit a new milestone, with one billion users accessing the service in a single day.\n\n– Moving beyond Likes\n\nFacebook added new reactions to accompany its famous Like button in 2016, with emotions showing love, laughter, wow, sadness and anger.\n\n– Cambridge Analytica\n\nThe Cambridge Analytica scandal was one of the biggest controversies to hit Facebook, when an investigation claimed that the data analysis firm was passing personal data from Facebook apps without the consent of individuals.\n\nIt is believed that the company harvested data of up to 87 million users in 2014, resulting in fines which included a £500,000 penalty issued by the UK’s data protection watchdog, the Information Commissioner’s Office (ICO), to Facebook.\n\n– Data breach of almost 30 million accounts\n\nIn September 2018, Facebook revealed that nearly 50 million accounts were compromised by a security breach – though the number was later decreased to 30 million.\n\nAt the time, Facebook vice president Guy Rosen said attackers “exploited a vulnerability in Facebook’s code that impacted ‘View As’, a feature that lets people see what their own profile looks like to someone else”. Meta’s headquarters in Dublin (Brian Lawless/PA)\n\n– Fake news\n\nLike many online platforms, Facebook has been hit with fake news issues.\n\nThe social network has been criticised for its handling of the spread of misinformation, with bad actors targeting Facebook largely to distribute political messages, particularly around crucial elections.\n\nIn response, Facebook has carried out a number of initiatives to combat fake news. Earlier this year, it launched a UK arm to its international fact-checking effort, using Full Fact, a fact-checking charity founded in 2010, to review stories, images and videos which have been flagged by users and rate them based on their accuracy.\n\n– Growing pressure from rival platforms\n\nFacebook has also faced intense pressure from within the social media industry, as new players emerged and tried to compete with the platform for the attention of users.\n\nThe most notable and ongoing rival in that sense has been TikTok, which has gained users, particularly among the younger generation and challenged Facebook’s status as an online news source for some.\n\nIn early 2022, as Facebook reported a drop in its number of daily active users for the first time in its history, Mr Zuckerberg publicly acknowledged the competition from the likes of TikTok and admitted Facebook was in a battle for people’s attention.\n\nMeta has been making a strong fist of that fight too, introducing a shortform video feature, called Reels, similar to TikTok to another of its apps, Instagram, in an effort to take on TikTok at their own game.\n\n– Metaverse gamble\n\nIn October 2021, Mr Zuckerberg announced the biggest reshuffle in the company’s history as created and rebranded its parent company as Meta and declared it was no longer focused on social media, but building the metaverse.\n\nThe Facebook founder pledged to invest billions of dollars into the project, which aimed to make Meta the industry leader in what Mr Zuckerberg said he believed would be the next version of the internet.\n\nMore than two years on, there is little sign yet of the metaverse becoming the mainstream internet for the general public.\n\nAnd with strong economic headwinds for tech firms in 2022 and 2023, post-pandemic, the company was forced to make two rounds of substantial job cuts.\n\nFor now, the metaverse gamble from Mr Zuckerberg is yet to pay off. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg appears before the Senate Judiciary Committee’s hearing (Jose Luis Magana/AP)\n\n– Job cuts\n\nIn the space of four months between the end of 2022 and March 2023, Meta announced two rounds of major job cuts.\n\nThe first saw 11,000 roles go from its 87,000-strong global workforce, with another 10,000 job cuts announced just 16 weeks later – although it was not along in the tech sector in cutting back jobs.\n\nThe cuts coincided with the company’s profits taking a hit due to a range of factors, including a slump in the online advertising market, wider global economic woes and increased competition from rivals such as TikTok.\n\nThe massive investment in building the metaverse was also highlighted as placing additional pressure on the company’s finances at a difficult time for the firm.\n\n– Increased scrutiny from regulators\n\nThe rise of Facebook and other social media apps has led to increased attention and scrutiny from regulators around the world.\n\nThe fast pace of the sector has seen Facebook and other platforms at the centre of debates around user privacy, data collection and broader online safety as more people spend more time online.\n\nAs scrutiny has increased during Facebook’s two decades in existence, the site has had to react and evolve with it – introducing vast content moderation teams, fact-checking and safety centres to combat misinformation and other harmful content, new rules around advertising, and digital wellbeing tools to allow users to limit their screen time.\n\nNow major internet regulation is coming into force in the EU and UK, with Facebook and others potentially facing billions of dollars in fines, services being blocked and even criminal liability for managers if they are found to be in breach of online safety rules.\n\nThe need for effective moderation of Facebook’s online empire has never been more vital or high-pressured, and its response to legislation such as the Online Safety Act will dictate the company’s success for years to come.\n\n– Returning financial strength\n\nDespite its issues in recent years, Facebook and Meta have had a resurgent start to 2024, with the firm reporting some of its strongest financial results for the final three months of 2023.\n\nCompared to the same period in 2022, revenue rose 25% and net income more than tripled, as user growth returned, advertising sales recovered and the cost-cutting from the substantial job cuts took effect.",

        "title": "Facebook at 20: Scandal, looming regulation and a future built around AI",
        "content": "Facebook remains one of the most influential pieces of technology in the world, an expert has said, despite recent scandals, pressure from rivals and other issues it faces as it marks its 20th anniversary.\n\nFounded by a group including chief executive Mark Zuckerberg in a Harvard dormitory in 2004, it has grown to become one of the largest technology companies in the world as Meta – the parent firm of Facebook and its sibling apps Messenger, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nOver its 20-year existence, Facebook has helped usher in the era of social media as a communication space, content creation outlet and news source, but also been at the heart of major scandals, including the Cambridge Analytica data breach, as well as increased concerns about the impact of the internet, and specifically social media, on health and wellbeing, the mental health of younger users, and on the very foundations of democracy.\n\nDespite this, Facebook has proven itself robust – only last week reporting its best financial results in recent memory with revenue rising 25%.\n\nEven that good news came as the company and Zuckerberg was in the spotlight for the site’s negative impact – a bruising appearance for the billionaire before the US Congress saw him face, and apologise to, families of children who died after being affected by online harms while Facebook was labelled a product “that’s killing people” by one senator, and tech platforms were accused of failing to protect young people.\n\nAmid the scandals, social media expert Drew Benvie says it can be easy to forget how transformative Facebook has been for the modern world.\n\n“Mark Zuckerberg, with his hunger for success, fame, transformation and democratisation of everything, really did usher in a totally new era of information and entertainment,” he told the PA news agency.\n\n“We shouldn’t forget just how influential Facebook is now, through its parent company Meta and its sister companies – Instagram, WhatsApp and others that it absorbed along the way.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Over three billion monthly users are on one of Meta’s platforms – that’s two-thirds of the internet-connected world – and whether it’s messaging, scrolling stories, local community groups, elections, shopping, entertainment or keeping in touch, it’s absolutely changed the world.”\n\nDespite the apparent threats to the platform from regulators and indeed rival platforms, Mr Benvie believes the social network is not going anywhere any time soon.\n\n“I think we’ve got another 20 years ahead of us. I think what Zuckerberg has done and what he plans to do, largely down to investments in messaging, entertainment, and then the newest move, which is building AI that will power the future of Meta, Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\n“I think there’s a lot of life in the old dog yet,” he said, noting that how the company responds to the changing regulatory landscape around will shape its future.\n\n“The regulation that is coming, I think that’s going to be a big part of Facebook’s future too, because nobody wants to be made to feel unhappy, ill or for harm to be caused because of the ease and the speed at which information travels on social media.\n\n“For that, social networks have a lot to answer for and I think there’s a lot of responsibility that’s going to be laid on their shoulders in the future as well, largely on the biggest apps, such as Facebook and its family of apps.\n\n“The rough direction of travel is that the social networks are clamping down (on harmful content) as much as they can.”\n\nHe added that artificial intelligence (AI) will be another key aspect of the platform’s future – an area Meta has already begun investing in and last year announced its first chatbots built using its own Llarma large language model.\n\nMr Benvie said it will not be this application of AI, but how Meta uses it more broadly that could define its next two decades.\n\n“Increasingly that (moderation) is the job of technology to do and not human moderators, so that’s where AI, I think, will play a big part in Meta’s future,” he said. Social media experts said AI will play a big part in Facebook’s future (Dominic Lipinski/PA)\n\n“In the future, AI will help detect content that maybe shouldn’t be there and it will help remove it quicker, and it will do other fantastic things for social media. It will give users tools and technologies they’ve not had before.\n\n“I think AI will do a lot for keeping people safer online and it will also improve people’s experiences of social media too, if done in the right way. So, I think that is something to look forward to.\n\n“AI is such a huge space to watch and it isn’t just a social media-related topic either, it’s in all lines of work, so Meta could expand way beyond social media if it gets the AI right, so it’s definitely one to watch.”\n\nHowever, one area of innovation Mr Benvie said has so far been “a bit of a mistake” has been the firm’s investment in the metaverse.\n\nThe social media expert said he believed the company had been “just too quick to innovate” and would have been better off waiting for interest in the technology to grow more.\n\nZuckerberg pledged billions of dollars and rebranded the company in order to launch his metaverse project, a 3D mixed reality space he said he believes is the future of the internet, but as yet does not exist as any one, tangible space or platform.\n\nDespite his very hands-on approach around the metaverse, Mr Benvie said he could see Zuckerberg following the example of other high-profile tech founders and stepping back from day-to-day management at some point.\n\n“Maybe we’ll see Mark Zuckerberg take a bit of a step back, a bit like we’ve seen from founders of other innovative technologies in the social media space – I’m thinking Larry Page and Sergey Brin from Google, Bill Gates at Microsoft – they still have an influence – Mark Zuckerberg would probably still have a heavy influence, but it’ll reach a point where we see his other interests take over,” he said.\n\nWhether it is Zuckerberg at the helm or not however, Mr Benvie said Facebook and Meta’s handling of looming regulation – including the UK’s Online Safety Act – would be pivotal to its performance over the coming years.\n\n“All social networks are looking for ways to make their platforms as sticky as possible – they want people to stay online for longer,” he said.\n\n“That comes at a cost and unfortunately we’ve seen problems ranging from mental health issues to real harm to all sorts of negative activities that social networks have facilitated. They’re working hard to to stop that but they can absolutely work harder.\n\n“No single organisation is to blame, and everybody is working on making it better, especially for young people, who are growing up in a world different to Mark Zuckerberg or to the regulators as well, where it’s just normal to be on a screen as often as you can be, and that brings with it health risks and it brings opportunities too.\n\n“I think balancing those things out is going to be key for the future of Facebook, Meta and wider social media as well.”",

        "title": "The 3 Best Virtual Reality Stocks to Invest In for Big Gains in 2024",
        "content": "If you’re a believer in the continued rise of technology – and who isn’t these days? – then you need to at least consider the potential top performers among virtual reality stocks 2024. Yes, VR headsets seem to be the exclusive domain of the video gaming community. But it’s so much more than that.\n\nFirst, let’s establish the framework. According to Grand View Research, the global VR market size reached a valuation of $59.96 billion in 2022. Further, the segment should expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 27.5% from 2023 to 2030. At the forecast’s culmination point, the industry should generate revenue of $435.6 billion. That’s called a massive total addressable market for virtual reality stocks 2024.\n\nSecond, as the end-to-end market intelligence firm pointed out, VR platforms feature myriad uses. “For instance, virtual reality allows engineers to test a vehicle’s design and construction at an early stage before beginning costly production in the automobile industry.” As well, it can provide more effective on-the-job training for various industries in a safe and controlled environment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith that, below are compelling ideas for virtual reality stocks 2024 to consider.\n\nHP (HPQ) Image of the HP logo on a mesh computer case\n\nSource: Tomasz Wozniak / Shutterstock.com\n\nGiven so much attention toward innovations such as generative artificial intelligence and other ultra-relevant technologies, HP (NYSE:HPQ) has fallen by the wayside. Still, if you’re interested in an off-the-beaten path idea for virtual reality stocks 2024, HPQ should be on your radar. Specifically, the company developed several VR products, including an immersive and hyper-realistic platform called the HP Reverb G2.\n\nPer its website, the headset is appropriate for both gaming and business functions. However, it’s probably safe to say that it will likely find most use in the entertainment sector. But that’s not a bad gig at all. According to Grand View Research, the global VR in gaming market size reached a valuation of $20.73 billion in 2022.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurther, analysts project that the segment could expand at a CAGR of 22.7% from 2023 to 2030. At the forecast’s culmination point, the industry might print revenue of $109.59 billion. Additionally, analysts rate HPQ a consensus moderate buy with a $31.45 price target, with a high-side estimate of $40.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile previously synonymous with social media through its Facebook network, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has evolved into a diverse tech juggernaut. More recently, the company has pivoted to the metaverse, a virtual ecosystem where people can interact with a computer-generated environment. Naturally, VR headsets and related equipment would be helpful in this endeavor and Meta doesn’t disappoint.\n\nPrimarily, the company ranks among the top virtual reality stocks 2024 through its Meta Quest series of headsets. Further, it offers innovations via its next-generation smart glasses, a partnership it inked with sunglass manufacturer Ray-Ban. This should be a particularly intriguing catalyst for META stock. Experts project that the global smart glasses market may expand at a CAGR of 27.1% from 2023 to 2030.\n\nAt the forecast culmination point, sector revenue should land at $8.19 billion. As for the core VR segment, Meta owns a 50.2% market share, making it the undisputed leader. Unsurprisingly, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $426.11 price target, projecting 8% upside. Additionally, the high-side target hits $470, implying 19% growth.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) The Microsoft logo outside a building representing MSFT stock.\n\nSource: Asif Islam / Shutterstock.com\n\nA tech monster, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) represents an indelible component of the broader ecosystem. For example, when conducting academic studies or professional services, people use personal computers. And when it comes to that department, the world’s operating systems mostly run on Microsoft Windows. In fact, Windows holds a 73% market share, an area of dominance that probably won’t be challenged anytime soon.\n\nOf course, as with any tech leader, it’s not satisfied dominating just its own neighborhood. Over the past few years, Microsoft has developed a wide range of VR products. In particular, its HoloLens 2 offers incredible relevancies for the academic realm along with myriad professional industries. With VR, both students and workers in training can enhance their knowledge and skill sets without real-world consequences.\n\nSuch a protocol should help accelerate learning and productivity. Indeed, the global AR/VR in training protocols should see a CAGR of 41.2% from 2022 to 2031, ultimately reaching a valuation of $142.1 billion. Finally, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $469.45 average price target, implying over 16% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg’s combat sports prompt Meta to warn investors of ‘adverse impact’ if he were to ‘become unavailable for any reason’",
        "content": "Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg had a mixed week. His net worth soared by $28 billion thanks to the Facebook parent reporting a stellar quarter on Thursday, but he also faced intense pressure from lawmakers over his company’s child safety policies, at one point apologizing directly to the families of teen victims of online sexual abuse.\n\nLess noticed was a warning to investors deep in the financial report for 2023 that Meta released this week. In a section entitled “Risks Related to Our Business Operations and Financial Results,” the company noted that its CEO engages “in various high-risk activities, such as combat sports, extreme sports, and recreational aviation, which carry the risk of serious injury and death.”\n\nIt added, “If Mr. Zuckerberg were to become unavailable for any reason, there could be a material adverse impact on our operations.”\n\nZuckerberg responded to coverage of the warning with a post on Meta’s Threads reading, “High risk = high reward.”\n\nA danger to Zuckerberg and Meta investors?\n\nHis obsession with physical combat hadn’t gone unnoticed. It appeared for a while last year that he would have a cage fight with Tesla CEO Elon Musk, but in August Zuckerberg wrote on Threads: “If Elon ever gets serious about a real date and official event, he knows how to reach me. Otherwise, time to move on. I’m going to focus on competing with people who take the sport seriously.”\n\nFortune flagged the investor risk that month in a piece entitled: \"Meta spends $14 million on Mark Zuckerberg’s security, and Tesla is ‘highly dependent’ on Elon Musk—but no one can actually stop them from maiming each other in a cage.\"\n\nA few months ago, Zuckerberg tore his ACL while sparring. In an Instagram post that garnered over 43,000 comments and showed him in a hospital bed, he wrote: “I was training for a competitive MMA fight early next year, but now that's delayed a bit. Still looking forward to doing it after I recover.”\n\nThat raised questions over whether investors should be warned about the risk posed by his fighting. Most CEOs, of course, don’t regularly engage in dangerous activities like Zuckerberg, so the issue doesn’t come up much.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It’s a question of materiality,” Bryan Westhoff, an attorney at Polsinelli, told Bloomberg. “Is it material to a reasonable investor to know what the executives are doing? Is there danger and uniqueness to it? MMA is something that most of us don’t do.\"\n\nMeta, as shown in its annual report this week, decided to go ahead with a warning.\n\nIn another Instagram post in October, Zuckerberg showed followers his scratched-up face after a fight, writing: “Sparring got a little out of hand. May need to update my avatar.”\n\nDiscussing jiu-jitsu on the Lex Fridman Podcast seven months ago, he said of the sport, “You only get into a bad situation if you're not willing to tap once you've already lost.” He noted, “I’m a pretty competitive person,” adding about a recent match, “I didn’t want to lose.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nAfter recommending investors to go easy on mega-cap tech stocks and take some profits on them during the start of 2024, Jim Cramer is back to praising the strengths and resilience of these companies after major technology stocks part of the Magnificent Seven group started posting earnings. Cramer recently said in a program on CNBC that we have reached a strange \"confluence of events\" that makes it hard to \"value anything.\" Cramer praised strong earnings reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Cramer advised investors not to worry about high valuations of these companies and said it does not make sense to sell these stocks just because these companies are \"big.\" Cramer said these major technology companies have not \"fooled\" their way to such high valuations and there was nowhere else to go for these stocks \"but up.\"\n\nCramer's Thoughts on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nJim Cramer's message to market skeptics who believe tech stocks are headed for a crash is this: \"enough already!\"\n\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) generated about $330 billion in collective revenue and about $58.5 billion in collective profits in the recently reported quarter. Cramer said it would not make sense to compare these companies with those that collapsed during the dot com bubble\n\nOn a side note, Cramer shrugged off China fears and recommended investors to \"own\" Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares and not trade it.\n\nCramer Says Tesla Does Not Deserve to Be in the Magnificent Seven Group\n\nCramer yet again criticized the market's fears around concentration of the broader stock market gains in a handful of companies also known as the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer said it does not make sense to worry about market gains of major companies and compare them to smaller companies. Cramer, however, was clear about Tesla as he believes the company no longer deserves to be in the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said Tesla's exit from the Mag. Seven group of stocks was made easier by the judge who recently rejected Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this bullish outlook on tech stocks, there are some companies Jim Cramer is bearish on. In this article we decided to talk about those stocks. Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 12 stocks he's bearish on. For each stock we talked about the reason Jim Cramer gave for his bearish stance. We ranked these stocks based on ascending order of the number of hedge fund investors. Why? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12. Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 7\n\nJim Cramer, when asked about Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) in a recent program, said he does not know \"what mortgages they have\" and therefore cannot recommend the stock.\n\n\"And I suggest you do not own it.\"\n\nOver the past one year Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) shares have declined by 41%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, seven hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR). The most notable hedge fund stakeholder of Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) during this period was Sander Gerber's Hudson Bay Capital Management which owns a $4.3 million stake in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR).\n\n11. Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 17\n\nJim said \"I don’t trust it\" when he was asked about Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) during his program on CNBC. Cramer said he just \"checked in\" with Larry Williams \"again\" and Williams said Bitcoin has not bottomed yet and you should \"stay away.\"\n\nLast month, Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT) said it produced 619 bitcoins in December 2023, down 9% on a year-over-year basis.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 17 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Riot Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:RIOT)\n\n10. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nA few days ago a caller told Jim Cramer during a program on CNBC that \"AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) has got me in a hole.\" Cramer commented:\n\n\"You are not doing well at all.\"\n\nCramer said that we \"don’t want AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC)\" because the company is not \"doing well.\" Cramer said we want to own stocks that \"go higher.\"\n\n\"Let's understand that consumers are not going to the movies like they used to.\"\n\nCramer also pitched Netflix as a stock to buy instead of AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC).\n\n9. US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nJim Cramer's reply was a resounding \"No\" when he was asked about US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA) during his program a few days ago.\n\nCramer said that you can't own this stock in this state (New Jersey).\n\nThe stock has declined by about 12% over the past one year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA). The most notable stakeholder of US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA) during this period was DE Shaw which owns a $9 million stake in US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA).\n\n8. Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nEducation technology company Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on.\n\n“I think it’s an exploratory situation, but I cannot press the buy button,\" Cramer said of Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 25 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Chegg Inc (NYSE:CHGG).\n\nCramer is bearish on Chegg but he's recommending investors to buy and hold Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\n7. Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nJim Cramer is highly bearish on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG). In a latest program, while talking about a few renewable energy stocks, Cramer said:\n\n\"Plug Power? ….Grenade! Fire in the hole!\"\n\nIn December 2023 Cramer had categorically said that he was pulling the plug on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 26 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).\n\n6. Solaredge Technologies Inc (NASDAQ:SEDG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 27\n\nSolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) ranks sixth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer is bearish on. Cramer said \"no\" when he was asked about the Israel-based solar technology company.\n\nCramer said the stock is too volatile as it \"bounces four points and then it goes down again.\"\n\nCramer said this stock is too hard to own.\n\nOut of the 910 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 27 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG).\n\nUnlike Solaredge, Jim Cramer is bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META).\n\nDuring its Q3 earnings call in November 2023, Solaredge management talked about guidance and business updates:\n\n\"We expect our annual non-GAAP tax rate for the entire 2023 to be within 22% to 24%. GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $61.2 million compared to a GAAP net income of $119.5 million in the previous quarter and GAAP net income of $24.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net loss was $31 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $157.4 million in the previous quarter, and a non-GAAP net income of $54.1 million in the same quarter last year. GAAP net diluted loss per share was $1.08 for the third quarter compared to a GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $2.03 in the previous quarter, and a GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.43 for the same quarter last year. Non-GAAP net diluted loss per share was $0.55 compared to a non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $2.62 in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.91 in the same quarter last year.\n\nAs mentioned by Zvi, we expect that the stabilized solar revenue levels after the inventory correction has run its course will be approximately $600 million to $700 million quarterly. Under this scenario, corporate non-GAAP gross margins are targeted to be 30% to 32%, including approximately 500 basis points of benefits from IRA manufacturing tax credit and operating profit margins are targeted to be at 11% to 14% after implementing cost reduction activities. I reiterate that this scenario is based on no improvement in demand from our third quarter sell through levels and assumes no incremental revenues or margin from new products. Turning now to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.5 billion.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClearBridge Select Strategy made the following comment about SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Solar energy technology companies SolarEdge Technologies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SEDG) and Shoals, meanwhile, saw headwinds from destocking in the U.S. and Europe. U.S. demand could slow further due to new net metering rules that reduce the value to consumers from sending excess residential solar energy back to the grid. SolarEdge, which makes inverters for solar systems as well as residential and commercial battery systems, is also facing rising battery competition in the U.S. from Tesla.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer Recommended Selling These 12 Stocks Jim Cramer Says Recession Is Not Coming and Recommends These 11 Stocks Jim Cramer Stock Portfolio: 12 Recent Additions\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Tech: Is Meta truly the 'Patek Philippe of the internet'?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) shares move higher after both tech players posted positive earnings results on Thursday. Bernstein Internet Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the biggest Big Tech drivers for earnings season thus far, particularly Meta's outlook.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, shares of Meta and Amazon are extending gains today, hitting new highs in the session as investors cheer on their latest quarterly results. The strength in the fourth quarter driven largely by a rebound in digital ad sales. Amazon saw a 27% jump year on year, while Meta more than tripled overall sales from the same period last year with a big chunk of that coming through from ads.\n\nJoining us now is Mark Shmulik, Bernstein internet research analyst. Mark, you know so much of this is about setting expectations. Certainly, investors liked what they saw yesterday after the bell. How do you sort of put these names that we've seen this week side by side to see why these particular names are being rewarded in such a big way today?\n\nMARK SHMULIK: Yeah. Look, you've certainly seen divergence this quarter starting with Meta well at the top. Amazon certainly up quite a bit. Google was down by a similar amount that Amazon was up and of course, some of the others.\n\nAnd I think the biggest reason for that is going into this year after the big year the Magnificent Seven have had last year, there wasn't a lot of like really great conviction about really good ideas of what do you own in internet and tech. And I think those companies that put up the numbers where it mattered most and kind of calmed the biggest fears or worries about specific names performed the best. Meta, the biggest question heading in to 2024 was do you really want to own Meta into a decelerating revenue growth environment? Can we really trust them to keep their costs in check? And then they put out a monster guidance to suggest that the question we should be asking is, how long can they keep this up?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd with Amazon there was certainly a lot of excitement and a lot of optimism that 2024 was going to be the year they're going to finally deliver that operating income inflection, you know, we've long held out hope for and that's exactly what they did. They put out a very, very strong beat on operating income for the fourth quarter. Their comments suggested that that operating income growth is durable you know and it's showing up in the guidance for Q1. And this is exactly what investors want to see right now.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, you called Meta, especially for that quarter, the Patek Philippe of internet. Now, that's a pretty big statement to make given especially when you think about the price and the significance of Patek Philippe and their watches. Talk about what you're looking at there that sets Meta apart and what is going to keep them having that edge, as you mentioned. If they're going to be on top, what's going to keep them there?\n\nMARK SHMULIK: Yes, as a watch aficionado still not wearing any watches. But you know, I think what stood out why I called it the Patek Philippe is really a couple of reasons, right? The famous Patek kind of slogan is you never really own one, you just hang on to it for a generation, you know. And the biggest complaint about longer-term investors with Facebook and now Meta has been there's always this view that there's an expiration date to social media.\n\nAnd I think the more important thing I took away from this earnings was not the revenue beat and kind of guidance for 2024. That's great. You do need a strong core. But what they really showed is the longevity of this business, this vision you know that Mark has that we've all questioned at some points in the past.\n\nThe adjacencies are there. Threads usage is up, you know. Reels usage is up. WhatsApp is growing in the United States.\n\nWe've got north of 3 billion users. And Facebook Blue is still growing in the US. This isn't going anywhere. And longer term, all the investments in AI and the Metaverse, whether you believe in it or not, there's a pathway that this company is going to find a way to be around forever. And so just like Patek, my comment here is you can own Meta's stock and you can hand it down to your kids.",

        "title": "Billionaire Investor David Tepper Has 58% of His Portfolio Invested in These 7 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "David Tepper's Carolina Panthers didn't make the NFL playoffs this year. However, Tepper has other things to make him feel better.\n\nFor example, his net worth currently stands at a whopping $20.6 billion. He's also viewed by many as the greatest hedge fund manager of the last four decades.\n\nTech stocks have been key to Tepper's success in the past, and that isn't likely to change going forward. The multibillionaire currently has nearly 58% of his Appaloosa Management hedge fund invested in just seven artificial intelligence (AI) stocks.\n\nTepper's favorite AI stocks\n\nBelow are the top seven AI stocks in Tepper's Appaloosa portfolio, as of the hedge fund's latest 13F-HR filing on Nov. 14, 2023:\n\nStock Shares Owned Percent of Portfolio Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) 1.95 million 11.56% Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) 1.64 million 10.19% Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) 3.75 million 9.41% Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) 1.02 million 8.80% Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) 2.75 million 7.16% Alibaba Group Holding(NYSE: BABA) 3.6 million 6.16% Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) 2.27 million 4.62% Total 57.9%\n\nData source: Appaloosa 13F-HR filing.\n\nFive of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks -- Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, and Alphabet -- rank as Tepper's largest holdings. The only members of the group that he doesn't own are Apple and Tesla.\n\nWhy these seven AI stocks?\n\nWe know one thing for sure: Tepper didn't buy these stocks just because of the recent generative AI buzz. For example, he's owned Meta stock since 2014 (back when it was still known as Facebook). His Appaloosa hedge fund initiated a position in Alphabet the following year.\n\nPerhaps the simplest reason why Tepper is invested so heavily in these seven stocks is that he likes their growth prospects. AI certainly plays a key role in the future growth for all of the companies.\n\nMeta is charting a different course than the others by open sourcing much of its AI efforts. CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes that this approach will pay off over the long run. He noted in the company's third-quarter earnings conference call that open sourcing \"increases adoption and creates a standard around the industry.\" Zuckerberg thinks that Meta ultimately will benefit from this.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Alibaba all operate cloud platforms. They will experience significant growth as companies shift their IT spending to the cloud, in large part to build AI apps.\n\nNvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) are the AI equivalents of the picks-and-shovels merchants during the gold rush days. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) are currently the gold standard for powering AI apps, and AMD is fighting for market share in the AI chip space, as well. Meta and Microsoft announced in December that they plan to use AMD's newest AI chips, signaling that there's a big opportunity for alternatives to Nvidia.\n\nAre Tepper's top AI stocks good picks for other investors?\n\nWall Street is only enthusiastic about one of Tepper's top AI stocks over the next 12 months: The average price target for Alibaba reflects an upside potential of more than 60%. Analysts don't expect much from the other stocks -- at least over the near term.\n\nI think, though, that all seven of these AI stocks could be big winners for long-term investors. Alibaba is the most attractively valued of the group. However, it also could be more volatile due to the sluggish growth of the Chinese economy.\n\nAI won't be the only growth driver for these stocks. Meta and Alphabet could enjoy solid growth in advertising revenue from their online platforms. Microsoft is a huge player in multiple markets, including productivity software and gaming.\n\nAmazon and Alibaba are e-commerce giants. Nvidia and AMD market their chips for purposes not related to AI.\n\nI predict, however, that AI will be the biggest tailwind for all of these stocks and help increase Tepper's net worth to a lot more than $20.6 billion within a few years. I suspect that investors who aren't multibillionaires could make plenty of money with Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, Nvidia, Alphabet, Alibaba, and AMD, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Meta Platforms wasn't one of them.

        "content": "US-based social network giant Meta Platforms has seen its China-related revenue grow steadily due to strong traction from mainland-based advertisers, as Chinese brands vie for consumers in foreign markets.\n\nIn 2023, China accounted for 10 per cent of Meta's total revenue of US$134.9 billion, up from 6 per cent in the previous two years, according to Meta's financial results published on Friday.\n\n\"The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets,\" said Susan Li, Meta's chief financial officer, during an earnings call with analysts. She added that China sales contributed 5 percentage points to its total revenue growth last year.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

In a move aimed at securing access to the mainland Chinese market, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg met with the then propaganda chief Liu Yunsan in Beijing in 2016. That was followed by a visit in 2017 where he met students from China's prestigious Tsinghua University. Neither effort was successful in getting the app approved in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg delivers a speech at the Meta Connect event in Menlo Park, California, September 27, 2023.

The company said Facebook's monthly users stood at 3.07 billion, 20 years after the platform was founded by Zuckerberg in a Harvard dorm.\n\nIn late 2021, Facebook changed its parent company name to Meta Platforms to reflect Zuckerberg's yet to be proven vision of a virtual world, referred to as the \"metaverse\", as the next major computing platform.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Big Tech Earnings Recap: The Numbers and What CEOs Are Saying About 2024",
        "content": "Big Tech companies closed 2023 with a blowout quarter. Getty Images/Observer\n\nThis week, five of the stock market’s “Magnificent Seven”—Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)—reported financial results for the last quarter of 2023. Big Tech companies closed a year full of bold headlines: Alphabet’s YouTube reached 100 million subscribers; Microsoft launched a suite of A.I. products and finalized its acquisition of gaming behemoth Activision Blizzard; Apple debuted the iPhone 15 and released its Vision Pro VR headset (It’s available in stores today (Feb. 2)); Meta began paying its first ever cash dividend; and Amazon further expanded its e-commerce offerings and upped its game in video streaming.\n\nHere is a recap of Big Tech’s overall blowout Q4 and what their CEOs said on earnings calls.\n\nAlphabet\n\nQuarterly revenue: $86.3 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago Net income: $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share Advertising revenue: $65.52 billion\n\nGoogle (GOOGL)’s ad revenue for the December quarter included $48 billion from Google Search and approximately $9.2 billion from YouTube. On a call with analysts on Jan. 30, CEO Sundar Pichai touted the rapid growth of YouTube, calling it a “key driver of our subscription revenue.”\n\nThe tech giant also reported the first time that YouTube had more than 100 million paid subscribers at the end of 2023. The video platform plowed in as much revenue as Google’s cloud business, which also saw strong growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nQuarterly revenue: $62 billion, up 18 percent from a year ago Net income: $21.9 billion, or $2.93 per share Cloud revenue: $33 billion, up 24 percent from a year ago\n\nMicrosoft drew headlines throughout 2023 for its many initiatives, from deepened collaboration with OpenAI to legal progress in its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nOn the earnings call on Jan. 30, CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the company’s transition from experimenting with A.I. to applying the technology at scale, with A.I. capabilities being integrated across Microsoft’s product offerings, from Microsoft Copilot to Azure AI to GitHub Copilot, the popular A.I. developer tool.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’re using this A.I. inflection point to redefine our role in business applications,” Nadella told analysts.\n\nApple\n\nQuarterly revenue: $119.6 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago Net income: $33.9 billion, or $2.18 per share iPhone revenue: $69.7 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago\n\niPhones continued to dominate Apple’s revenue makeup, accounting for roughly 60 percent of its Q4 sales. The Mac segment generated $7.8 billion in revenue, returning to growth, while iPad revenue fell 25 percent from the previous year to $7 billion. The sharp decline was in part due to Apple’s lack of new iPad models in 2023.\n\nApple’s revenue in the “Wearables, Home, and Accessories” business fell 11 percent year-over-year to $12 billion. This decline was offset by a 11 percent growth in the “Services” unit, which includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles. The unit reported $23.1 billion in revenue in the December quarter, a record high.\n\nApple reported earnings a day before its Vision Pro headset arrived in stores in the U.S. On yesterday’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook called the Vision Pro “the most advanced personal electronics device ever. We can’t wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.”\n\nAmazon\n\nQuarterly revenue: $169.9 billion, up 14 percent from a year ago Net income: $10.6 billion, or $1.00 per share e-Commerce revenue: $70.54 billion, up 8 percent from a year ago AWS revenue: $24.2 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago\n\nAmazon saw record user acitivites during last quarter’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events, where customers purchased over 1 billion items on Amazon globally. In the U.S., over 500 million items were ordered from independent sellers, attracting millions of new Prime memberships. Throughout 2023, Amazon provided its fastest-ever global delivery to Prime members, delivering over 7 billion units the same or the next day.\n\n“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023,” CEO Andy Jassy said on the earnings call yesterday.\n\nAmazon plans to increase capital expenditures in 2024, particularly in expanding its A.I. efforts. The company just launched Rufus, an A.I.-powered shopping assistant. In addition, its recent move to display ads on Prime Video aims to leverage Amazon’s massive audience for advertising expansion. In the fourth quarter, Amazon generated $14.7 billion in ad revenue, up 26.7 percent from a year ago.\n\nMeta\n\nQuarterly revenue: $40.1 billion, up 25 percent from a year ago Net income: $14 billion, or $5.33 per share (up 300 percent from a year ago)\n\nMeta tripled profits in the December quarter, in part thanks to aggressive cost-cutting in the previous months. The tech giant also announced its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share during the earnings call yesterday.\n\nMeta’s family of social media apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, had 3.19 billion daily active users at the end of 2023. Threads, Meta’s answer to Elon Musk’s X, had 130 million monthly active users at the end of last year. CFO Susan Li said on the earnings call Meta would no longer report Facebook-specific numbers, suggesting a shift away from its legacy social media platforms. Altogether, revenue from the total family of apps came at $39 billion during the quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nLooking into 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised significant investments in A.I. for foundational research and product development, expecting capital expenditures to be between $30 billion and $37 billion this year. “Moving forward, a major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced A.I. products and services,” Zuckerberg said on yesterday’s earnings call.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning A Guide to 'Anatomy of a Fall': Plot, Characters, Awards Chances and More 'Kingsman' Director Matthew Vaughn Assembles Cast for New Spy Thriller Rare Photo of the Elon Musk's $50,000 Tiny Home Shared By Biographer\n\nRead the original story Big Tech Earnings Recap: The Numbers and What CEOs Are Saying About 2024 and others by Shreyas Sinha at Observer.",

        "content": "Investors walked away from the busy investment week with a lot of news to digest including Meta Platforms META announcing its first-ever dividend after comfortably surpassing Q4 top and bottom-line expectations on Thursday.\n\nAlthough the Fed shrugged off the plausibility of rate cuts in March this week and didn’t blow the cap off a potential broader rally; Meta’s stock soared in today’s trading session.\n\nQ4 Showdown & Price Performance\n\nMeta’s Q4 report capped off a week highlighted by big tech with Magnificent Seven peers Apple AAPL and Amazon AMZN also reporting their quarterly results yesterday evening as well. All were able to surpass their quarterly expectations but it was Meta who stole the show.\n\nAccompanying its strong results, Meta declared its first cash dividend of $0.50 per share payable on March 26, 2024 to stockholders on record by the close of markets on February 22. Meta intends to pay its dividend quarterly going forward subject to market conditions and approval by its board of directors.\n\nThis fueled Meta’s stock in Friday’s trading session spiking over +20% with Amazon shares up +8% and Apple shares virtually flat after pairing an early morning dip. Notably, Meta’s stock has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Momentum and has soared +38% over the last month. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta’s stock has rallied over +150% in the last year and has continued to rally when the company beats earnings expectations which is now at five consecutive quarters as defined by the green arrows in the EPS surprise chart below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFinancial Results\n\nDiving into Meta’s Q4 financial results, earnings of $5.33 per share topped the Zacks Consensus by 10% and soared 77% from $3.00 a share in the prior-year quarter. Quarterly sales of $40.11 billion climbed 25% year over year and came in 3% better than expected. It’s also noteworthy that Meta has now posted an average earnings surprise of 19.71% in its last four quarterly reports.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta currently has an “A” Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth and rounded-out fiscal 2023 with annual earnings increasing 51% to $14.87 per share versus $9.83 a share in 2022. Total sales increased 15% to $134.9 billion compared to $116.6 billion in 2022.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg stated Meta made a lot of progress in their vision for advancing artificial intelligence and the metaverse. The company expects its growth to be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware in FY24 along with its new data center architecture. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta Platforms stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) primarily attributed to the trend of positive annual earnings estimate revisions for FY24 over the last 30 days. This looks likely to continue after the company’s Q4 earnings beat and the initiation of a quarterly dividend does make a stronger argument for investors buying Meta’s stock at the moment.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

The positive economic data coupled with strong big tech earnings propelled gains, with the S&P 500 (^GSPC) index outperforming.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) surged over 20% alone after its earnings beat, helping lift tech stocks more broadly. Other tech giants like Nvidia (NVDA) and Amazon (AMZN) also rallied, fueling bullish sentiment in markets.\n\nYahoo Finance's Jared Blikre breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJARED BLIKRE: Let's take a look at a recap of the markets after a jam packed week of earnings and economic data. And let's look at the indices today. We see the Russell 2000 in negative territory.\n\nBut for the week, guess what? It's still down about 8/10 of a percent. But kind of the flip here for tech as we see the NASDAQ composite up about 1%.\n\nAnd by the way, you're going to notice we took some deep dives on Wednesday. That was the FOMC announcement. So that is in the rear view mirror with all those jobs numbers today that beat expectations.\n\nHere's the S&P 500 up about 1.38%. And the Dow which is a laggard today is actually one of the highest, if not, at 1.43%. And let's take a look at how this breaks down in sector action.\n\nAnd this is really impressive the way we see. And this is only today. Communication services up 4%.\n\nFor the week, we actually have it in second place up 2.7%. So it had to claw back some losses today. In the pole position as consumer discretionary, that's an Amazon story. Tesla also in there. But it's been detracting recently.\n\nThen we have staples in third place health care and industrials. All of those outperforming. Before I move on, I want to take a look at the bond market because it has been a really roller coaster week.\n\nThis is a two-month chart. And last week, we closed right here just above 4.0%. We had some deep dives into negative territory.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd then we climbed back above 4% today. All of this is speaking to bond market volatility. And here's ISP bit of MOVE index. This is like the VIX for bonds.\n\nThis is on the rise. And sometimes this spills over into equities as well. So not really affecting things today apparently. But we will be on the move. We'll be on the lookout for that next week.\n\nNow, let's take a look at the NASDAQ 100 for the week. And I think this really paints a pretty good picture of the week in earnings. Apple down 3%, Alphabet down 6%. But Meta, this is pretty much all today, Meta up 20%, NVIDIA up 8%, and so is Amazon as well.\n\nAnd taking a look at our leaders board where we have a bunch of different parts of the market. Guess what? Cannabis took the lead today flying high up 7.8%.\n\nAnd then we have New York Fang also contributing Bitcoin in there, gambling, homebuilders. So pretty interesting swath here. What took it on the chin, regional banks down 7% in China. China internet stocks down 5.6%.\n\n-Thanks, Jared.",

        "content": "(Adds closing U.S. market prices, adds graphics)\n\n*\n\nUnexpected strong U.S. jobs data sinks rate cut hopes\n\n*\n\nTraders pare rate cut bets after unemployment report\n\n*\n\nAmazon, Meta also lift equity market sentiment\n\n*\n\nShanghai Composite logs worst week in 5 years\n\n*\n\nCrude prices post weekly losses of 7%\n\nBy Herbert Lash\n\nNEW YORK Feb 2 (Reuters) - Treasury yields jumped, the dollar surged and world equities rallied on Friday after a blowout U.S. jobs report scuttled any lingering expectations of a near-term cut in interest rates and highlighted a strong economy.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said, almost double the 180,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield shot above 4% and the dollar gained against all major currencies as employers added far more jobs than expected and average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.\n\nThe data came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pushed back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut, with Chair Jerome Powell warning inflation was \"still too high.\"\n\n\"The market has been horribly wrong about the near-term trajectory of Fed policy and this is another instance where that's the case,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab in New York.\n\n\"The market's been correct in assessing that the inflationary backdrop is going to help set the conditions for the Fed to cut,\" he said. \"But it's probably ultimately the labor market that's going to push them into cutting and then will determine the pace and the size of cuts themselves.\"\n\nEmployment growth had been decelerating, especially into the fourth quarter of last year, but the jobs report showed job creation accelerating, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.\n\n\"When you go through all the specific details, there were really very few if any pockets of weakness. It was just a very, very strong report and that by itself would suggest that a recession certainly isn't imminent,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe closed up 0.64% while on Wall Street, the tech-laden Nasdaq and benchmark S&P 500 climbed 1.74% and 1.07% respectively, as investors cheered robust quarterly results from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com.\n\nGains by the Dow Industrials were a bit more subdued, rising 0.35%, but low unemployment and a strong economy suggest corporate earnings can increase.\n\nMeta surged 20.3% to hit a record high after issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.\n\nU.S. regional bank stocks recovered slightly from a brutal sell-off sparked by concerns that New York Community Bancorp's dismal earnings signaled broader problems for the sector.\n\nNYCB shares were up 5.0% following a nearly 45% plunge over the last two sessions after the lender slashed its dividend and posted a surprise loss on commercial real estate loans.\n\nIn Japan, Aozora Bank slumped to a three-year low after it took a huge loan-loss provision against U.S. office loans.\n\nAfter the jobs report, money markets projected the Fed would lower its target rate, currently in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, by 123.8 basis points by year-end, down from 140.3 bps just before the data was released.\n\nFutures pared bets for a rate cut in March to 20.5% from 36.5% just before the report, and slashed the likelihood of a 25 or 50 bps cut in May to 61.8% from 91.6%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"I'll trade a stronger economy with less rate cuts than a weaker economy with more rate cuts,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Wealth in Atlanta.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, surged 17.6 basis points to 4.370% and the 10-year's yield rose 16.5 basis points to 4.028%. The two-year's rise was on track to post the biggest one-day gain since May 2023, and the 10-year since July 2023.\n\nInvestors brushed off a big Chinese market selloff caused by a lack of hoped-for government stimulus.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI300 hit a five-year low, with the Shanghai Composite 1.5% lower on the day and down 6.2% for the week, its largest weekly loss since October 2018.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, jumped to a seven-week high as it rose 0.83%, while the euro was down 0.74% to $1.0792. The yen weakened 1.24% to 148.29 per dollar.\n\nOil prices fell by about 2% after the U.S. jobs data reduced the odds of imminent rate cuts, which could dampen crude demand if restrictive monetary policy curbs the economy.\n\nU.S. crude futures settled down $1.54 at $72.28 a barrel, while Brent fell $1.37 to settle at $77.33. Both benchmarks posted losses of more than 7% for the week.\n\nGold prices slipped as the dollar jumped, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers, and higher yields reduced the appeal of non-interest bearing gold.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.8% lower at $2053.70 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Chibuike Oguh, Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranashinghe and Stella Qiu.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nWith Friday's rally, the company added nearly $200 billion to its market cap, a stock market record, according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.\n\nMeta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Meta Connect event at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 27, 2023. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

        "content": "(Adds comment in paragraphs 7-8, 17, updates prices at 3 p.m. ET (2000 GMT)\n\n*\n\nUnexpected strong U.S. jobs data sinks rate cut hopes\n\n*\n\nAmazon, Meta keep equity market sentiment buoyant\n\n*\n\nShanghai Composite logs worst week in 5 years\n\n*\n\nCrude prices post weekly losses of 7%\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON Feb 2 (Reuters) - Treasury yields jumped, the dollar surged and world equities rallied on Friday after a blowout U.S. jobs report scuttled any lingering expectations of a near-term cut in interest rates and highlighted a strong economy.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said, almost double the 180,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield shot above 4% and the dollar gained against all major currencies as employers added far more jobs than expected and average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.\n\nThe data came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pushed back against market expectations for an imminent rate cut, with Chair Jerome Powell warning inflation was \"still too high.\"\n\n\"The market has been horribly wrong about the near-term trajectory of Fed policy and this is another instance where that's the case,\" said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab in New York.\n\n\"The market's been correct in assessing that the inflationary backdrop is going to help set the conditions for the Fed to cut,\" he said. \"But it's probably ultimately the labor market that's going to push them into cutting and then will determine the pace and the size of cuts themselves.\"\n\nEmployment growth had been decelerating, especially into the fourth quarter of last year, but the jobs report showed job creation accelerating, said Joseph LaVorgna, chief U.S. economist at SMBC Nikko Securities America.\n\n\"When you go through all the specific details, there were really very few if any pockets of weakness. It was just a very, very strong report and that by itself would suggest that a recession certainly isn't imminent,\" he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe advanced 0.74% while on Wall Street, the tech-laden Nasdaq and benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.86% and 1.30% respectively, as investors cheered robust quarterly results from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com.\n\nGains by the Dow Industrials were a bit more subdued, rising 0.61%, but low unemployment and a strong economy suggest corporate earnings can increase.\n\nMeta surged 20.8% to hit a record high after issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.\n\nU.S. regional bank stocks recovered slightly from a brutal sell-off sparked by concerns that New York Community Bancorp's dismal earnings signaled broader problems for the sector.\n\nNYCB shares were up 5.0% following a nearly 45% plunge over the last two sessions after the lender slashed its dividend and posted a surprise loss on commercial real estate loans.\n\nIn Japan, Aozora Bank slumped to a three-year low after it took a huge loan-loss provision against U.S. office loans.\n\nAfter the jobs report, money markets projected the Fed would lower its target rate, currently in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, by 123.3 basis points by year-end, down from 140.3 bps just before the data was released.\n\nFutures pared bets for a rate cut in March to 20.5% from 36.5% just before the report, and slashed the likelihood of a 25 or 50 bps cut in May to 61.4% from 91.6%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\n\"I'll trade a stronger economy with less rate cuts than a weaker economy with more rate cuts,\" said Keith Lerner, chief market strategist at Truist Wealth in Atlanta.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, surged 17.8 basis points to 4.372% and the 10-year's yield rose 17 basis points to 4.033%. The 10-year's rise was on track to post the biggest one-day gain since September 2022, and the two-year since May 2023.\n\nRISKS\n\nInvestors brushed off a big Chinese market selloff caused by a lack of hoped-for government stimulus.\n\nThe blue-chip CSI300 hit a five-year low, with the Shanghai Composite 1.5% lower on the day and down 6.2% for the week, its largest weekly loss since October 2018.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, jumped to a seven-week high as it rose 0.84%, while the euro was down 0.74% to $1.0792. The yen weakened 1.26% to 148.31 per dollar,\n\nOil prices dipped about 2% setting up both benchmarks for a weekly loss given China's faltering economy and persistent geopolitical tensions.\n\nOil prices fell by about 2% after the U.S. jobs data reduced the odds of imminent rate cuts, which could dampen crude demand if restrictive monetary policy curbs the economy.\n\nU.S. crude futures settled down $1.54 at $72.28 a barrel, while Brent fell $1.37 to settle at $77.33. Both benchmarks posted losses of more than 7% for the week.\n\nGold prices slipped as the dollar jumped, making bullion more expensive for overseas buyers, and higher yields reduced the appeal of non-interest bearing gold.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.8% lower at $2053.70 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranashinghe and Stella Qiu.

        "content": "Several major companies, including five of the Magnificent Seven — Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), Apple (AAPL), Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT) – reported quarterly earnings this week. Yahoo Finance spoke to executives, experts, and analysts across the industry to break down everything investors need to know, including the winners and losers from this week's results.\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer broke down the big earnings week ahead and what to expect from these mega-cap tech companies. Schafer said, \"Really, you're only missing Nvidia in terms of massive tech companies to report this week. And really I think the story here is understanding how big this is going to be for the overall market.\"\n\nGM (00:00:14)\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) reported better-than-expected fourth-quarter results. General Motors CFO Paul Jacobson discussed the results, EV adoption, and the company's growth plans.\n\nJacobson said, \"It was another year of overcoming a lot of challenges. As we think about 2024, it really is a year of execution. For us, we've got the roadmap. We talked about 200,000 to 300,000 EVs being produced this year.\"\n\nAlphabet (00:00:36)\n\nAlphabet reported better-than-expected revenue and profit, but ad revenue came in weaker than analyst estimates of $65.94 billion. Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies.\n\nMortonson said, \"People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way.\"\n\nMicrosoft (00:00:52)\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants.\n\nStory continues\n\nBracelin said, \"Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one.\"\n\nStarbucks (00:01:10)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company.\n\nRuggeri said, \"We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program.\"\n\nBoeing (00:01:29)\n\nBoeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing.\n\nSpingarn said, \"The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk (00:01:47)\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company’s results and what it has in store in the coming months.\n\nKnudsen said, \"We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context.\"\n\nQualcomm (00:02:08)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment.\n\nPalkhiwala said, \"When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth.\"\n\nMeta (00:02:21)\n\nMeta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI.\n\nKessler said, \"Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta.\"\n\nAmazon (00:02:36)\n\nAmazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties.\n\nDevitt said, \"At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting.\"\n\nApple (00:02:50)\n\nApple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments.\n\nRao said, \"The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.\"",

Fed Chair Jerome Powell on Wednesday pushed back against the notion of a March rate cut.\n\nFinancial markets are pricing in a 20.5% likelihood of a 25 basis point rate cut at the Fed's March meeting, down from 69.6% a month ago, according to CME's FedWatch tool.\n\n\"Looking ahead to the next few days, investors are laser focused on upcoming earnings and economic reports to identify more consistency in the data to gauge the extent and timing of Fed rate cuts,\" Bassuk said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFourth-quarter earnings season barrels along, with 230 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 80% have come in above Wall Street expectations, according to LSEG.\n\nOn aggregate, analysts now see year-on-year S&P 500 earnings growth of 7.8% for the October-to-December period, a significant improvement over the 4.7% estimate as of Jan. 1.\n\nMeta Platforms jumped 21.7% to a record high, powering a 3.7% surge in the S&P 500 communication services sector , after issuing its first dividend days ahead of the 20th anniversary of its Facebook unit. Meta's revenue and profit beat estimates on robust advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.\n\nAmazon.com jumped 8.2% following a fourth-quarter revenue beat as new generative artificial intelligence features in cloud and ecommerce businesses spurred robust growth during the year-end holidays.\n\nRegional bank shares stabilized after two straight days of sharp sell-offs sparked by disappointing earnings from New York Community Bancorp. The bank's shares rebounded on Friday, rising 5.7%, while the KBW Regional Banking index advanced 0.2%.\n\nAt 2:16 p.m. the Dow rose 189.23 points, or 0.49%, to 38,709.07, the S&P 500 gained 60.25 points, or 1.23%, at 4,966.44 and the Nasdaq Composite climbed 281.91 points, or 1.84%, to 15,643.61.\n\nCigna rose 5.3% after the health insurance provider hiked its annual profit forecast.\n\nMicrochip Technology dropped 2.1% in the wake of the chipmaker's disappointing sales forecast.\n\nFootwear maker Skechers U.S.A also provided a downbeat forecast, sending its shares down 10.1%.\n\nOil supermajor Chevron Corp gained 2.7% after beating analyst estimates.\n\nDeclining issues outnumbered advancers by a 2-to-1 ratio on the NYSE.\n\nThere were 322 new highs and 90 new lows on the NYSE.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Culp; additional reporting by Ankika Biswas, Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru and Richard Chang)",

        "content": "In the dynamic investment space, the allure of discovering hidden, affordable stocks with the potential for explosive growth is undeniable. Amidst the familiar giants, a trio of stocks, each trading under $15, are plotting their ascent to market prominence. These companies, though residing in disparate sectors—automobile, technology and finance—share a common trait. This is the potential for transformative growth by 2025.\n\nPicture this: a Chinese electric vehicle company, the first one, not merely keeping pace but leading in market share in the world’s largest automotive market. Dive into the tech domain, and with its unassuming stock price, the second one emerges as a powerhouse, leveraging advertising tech and a browser with skyrocketing user numbers. Meanwhile, in the finance sector, the third orchestrates a symphony of value generation through strategic customer base expansion and financial prudence.\n\nRead more to unravel the intriguing fundamentals that make these stocks seemingly modest in price, becoming game-changers in the investment space.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNio (NIO) Nio Chinese automobile manufacturer logo displayed on mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio’s (NYSE:NIO) focus on enhancing the user experience and service offerings through expansive network growth is a key growth driver. Regarding the sales and service network, Nio has established a strong presence with 468 new houses, new spaces and pop-up stores in 152 cities, 314 service centers and 62 delivery centers in 217 cities. This extensive network enhances accessibility and support for Nio users across different regions.\n\nThe charging and swapping network has expanded significantly, with 2,226 power swap stations, over 9,400 power chargers and over 11,000 destination chargers worldwide. This network infrastructure ensures convenient charging options for users, addressing a crucial aspect of electric vehicle ownership. Hence, this may lead to an improved top line for Nio over the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nFundamentally, Nio’s battery-swapping system is a well-proven technology. This has offered users over 32 million convenient, efficient and safe battery swaps. By opening up the Nio Power Cloud and Power Swap Network to the entire industry, Nio is capitalizing on the broader adoption of battery swap technology.\n\nFinancially, in Q3 2023, Nio delivered a solid performance. The company delivered 55,432 premium smart electric vehicles, representing a solid 75.4% year-over-year boost. The growth was based on several factors, including the complete product line-up on the NT2 platform, improvements in self-capacity and capability and the continuous expansion of the sales, service and power networks.\n\nFinally, a key fundamental factor in Nio’s market strength is its lead in China’s electric vehicle segment, which ranked first, with a market share exceeding 45%. The average construction price of Nio’s electric vehicles in this segment was over RMB300K, demonstrating the company’s ability to capture the premium market.\n\nOpera (OPRA) A phone displaying the Opera (OPRA) app\n\nSource: bangoland / Shutterstock.com\n\nOpera’s (NASDAQ:OPRA) advertising technology and Ads reach support its forward performance. In detail, Opera Ads, with a volume of 3.8 million (Q3 2023) ad requests at peak times, positions Opera as an edgy player in terms of audience reach. Similarly, advertising revenue accounts for 39% of total revenue. This suggests the vitality of Opera’s advertising technology in its top-line growth formation. Also, the substantial volume of ad requests suggests the platform’s attractiveness to advertisers.\n\nFundamentally, in an era of digital advertising, it is crucial for revenue diversification, even for tech giants like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta (NASDAQ:META). Opera’s lead indicates its capability to capitalize on this trend by offering effective advertising solutions.\n\nOn the other hand, Opera GX Browser Growth and Monetization also support Opera’s value growth. The GX browser’s user base grew by 10% sequentially, reaching 26 million monthly active users. Similarly, average revenue per user (ARPU) for the GX browser increased by 16% sequentially and 23% year-over-year, making Opera GX Browser the best-monetized product.\n\nFurthermore, the growth of the GX browser’s user base suggests that Opera successfully attracts and retains users for this specific product. The double-digit growth in ARPU for the GX browser, both sequentially and year-over-year, highlights the effectiveness of Opera’s monetization strategies for this particular browser.\n\nRegarding liquidity, Opera generated operating cash flows of $16.2 million, with free cash flow from operations at $13.4 million. Here, the recurring annual dividend yield of 6% on repurchased American Depositary Shares highlights Opera’s focus on boosting shareholder value. Finally, dividend payments are a vital factor in investment returns. Hence, Opera’s focus on maintaining a dividend yield of this magnitude boosts confidence in its growth prospects.\n\nNu (NU) Nubank mobile app on white cell phone and credit card on black surface. NU stock.\n\nSource: Lais Monteiro / Shutterstock\n\nTo begin with, Nu’s (NYSE:NU) focus on a value-generating strategy is outlined in three guiding principles: expanding the customer base, increasing average revenue per active customer (ARPAC) through effective cross-selling and upselling, and achieving growth while maintaining low operating costs.\n\nDuring Q3 2023, Nu’s customer base expanded by 27% year-on-year to hit 89.1 million customers. The monthly ARPAC reached a new milestone of $10, with the more mature cohorts achieving a monthly ARPAC of $26. The growth trend in ARPAC and the customer base expansion contributed to a 53% year-over-year revenue increase, reaching $2.1 billion. Also, Nu’s low cost to serve can be observed in the cost per active customer of $0.90, reaching an all-time low-efficiency ratio of 35%.\n\nFundamentally, this efficiency positions Nu as one of the most efficient companies in Latin America. Also, these solid financial metrics, especially low operating costs, may drive prolonged value while maintaining profitability.\n\nOn the other hand, Nu maintains a considerably larger capital base compared to peers, with $2.3 billion in excess capital. This excess cash allows strategic allocations to operating subsidiaries for continued growth. The company achieved an adjusted net income of $356 million in Q3. Hence, this reflects an adjusted annualized return on equity of 25%.\n\nFinally, Nu’s credit portfolio has seen rapid growth in credit cards and personal loans, reaching a milestone of $15.4 billion, marking 48% year-over-year growth. Despite the growth, Nu maintained effective risk management, outperforming competitors on delinquency rates. Therefore, this reflects resilience against macroeconomic conditions, breeding explosive value growth potency.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Why Is Snowflake (SNOW) Stock Soaring Today\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of data warehouse-as-a-service Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) jumped 9.4% in the afternoon session as the Nasdaq and S&P 500 surged after solid earnings from tech giants, including Meta (NASDAQ:META), which soared more than 20% (MAU/DAU growth, guidance beat, and dividend initiation), and Amazon (solid revenue beat). In addition, yields surged, with the 2-year Treasury yield rising to 4.38%, while the 10-year Treasury yield broke past the 4% mark as fresh labor market data exceeded expectations. The Bureau of Labour reported non-farm payrolls for January 2024, which revealed that the US economy added 353,000 jobs (versus expectations for +185,000 jobs). The strong jobs report points to a resilient economy despite worries about the lag effects of rate hikes potentially slowing down business activities. The strong market data could cause the Fed to delay cutting rates in 2024, with market participants expecting the first rate cut to be announced in the first half of the year.\n\nAs a reminder, the driver of a stock's value is the sum of its future cash flows discounted back to today. With lower interest rates, investors can apply higher valuations to their stocks. No wonder so many in the investment community are optimistic about 2024. We at StockStory remain cautious, as following the crowd can lead to adverse outcomes. During times like this, it's best to own high-quality, cash-flowing companies that can weather the ups and downs of the market.\n\nIs now the time to buy Snowflake? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nSnowflake's shares are very volatile and over the last year have had 28 moves greater than 5%. In context of that, today's move is indicating the market considers this news meaningful but not something that would fundamentally change its perception of the business.\n\nThe previous big move we wrote about was 2 days ago, when the stock dropped 5.4% as major stock indices fell, with the Nasdaq index recording the steepest decline compared to the S&P 500 and Dow after mixed earnings results from tech giants, including Alphabet (weak ad revenue), Microsoft (disappointing guidance), and AMD (weak guidance). These results likely tempered the optimism that had been building since the late 2023 rally as the new earnings season kicked off. Moreover, market participants eagerly awaited the outcome of the Fed's first policy meeting of the year, scheduled for January 31, 2024, with the consensus expectation for rates to remain unchanged in the range of 5.25% to 5.5%.\n\nSnowflake is up 15.7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Snowflake's shares at the IPO in September 2020 would now be looking at an investment worth $861.58.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "content": "Meta (META) Stock Trades Up, Here Is Why\n\nWhat Happened:\n\nShares of social network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) jumped 21.9% in the afternoon session after the company reported fourth-quarter results with revenue, operating income, and EPS, all exceeding analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast, while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders, as of February 22, 2024, are set to receive $0.50 per share per quarter. Overall, this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders.\n\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Access our full analysis report here, it's free.\n\nWhat is the market telling us:\n\nMeta's shares are somewhat volatile and over the last year have had 3 moves greater than 5%. But moves this big are very rare even for Meta and that is indicating to us that this news had a significant impact on the market's perception of the business.\n\nThe biggest move we wrote about over the last year was 9 months ago, when the stock gained 12% on the news that the company reported impressive first-quarter results that surpassed analysts' daily active users (DAU), revenue, operating profit, earnings per share (EPS), and free cash flow expectations. Sales climbed in the first three months of the year, snapping a cycle of three straight quarters of revenue drops. Revenue guidance for the next quarter also topped the consensus estimates. Additionally, Meta reduced the outlook for full-year expenses, which showed a focus on cost efficiency that the market applauded.\n\nMeta is up 38.7% since the beginning of the year. Investors who bought $1,000 worth of Meta's shares 5 years ago would now be looking at an investment worth $2,838.\n\nDo you want to know what moves the stocks you care about?

        "content": "The term “meme investing” shot into public consciousness in January 2021 when high volumes of retail investors orchestrated a short squeeze on GameStop (NYSE:GME) stock to cause a sharp rally of over 1,500% in a matter of days.\n\nForming the backdrop to the exceptional circumstances of GameStop was a cryptocurrency rally that ultimately saw Bitcoin (BTC-USD) reach an all-time high value of $69,000. That crypto rally played a key role in igniting the interest of individuals keen to embrace the world of investing without having to conduct deep market research or wait longer for a substantial return on investment (ROI).\n\nAlthough we recently saw Roundhill’s MEME ETF shut down due to flagging investor interest, it’s important to acknowledge that recent economic headwinds have forced investors to look away from riskier stocks. Despite this, there have been many cases of meme stock opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s also important to note that the r/WallStreetBets Reddit page still has some 15 million members and ranks in the top 1% of most active groups on the platform. This, coupled with the arrival of a Bitcoin ETF and a long-awaited Bitcoin halving event on the way, suggests we may soon see market conditions that closely replicate the GameStop and AMC (NYSE:AMC) rallies of 2021.\n\nOf course, the biggest performers in future meme stock rallies will be the stocks that inspire investor enthusiasm alongside institutional derision without already being recognized as fully-fledged meme stocks. With this in mind, I believe the three stocks below have the potential to see GameStop’s levels of gains in the right market conditions.\n\nVirgin Galactic (SPCE) A photo of a man smiling into a camera on a plane.\n\nThe beauty of Virgin Galactic (NYSE:SPCE) is that it displays excellent meme stock credentials. Having become the first special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) deal set up by Chamath Palihapitiya, a former executive at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), SPCE became the first space tourism stock to go public.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to this, the concept of space tourism is more likely to resonate with retail investors as an exciting uncharted industry that’s unfamiliar territory for institutions with intentions to short the stock.\n\nFurthermore, the stock already experienced a boost from meme investors as the firm began flying its first commercial passengers into space in June 2023. With commercial space tourism seats costing passengers $450,000, Virgin Galactic’s unique industry position could see more meme investors picking up the stock as packages finally begin to bring in much sought-after revenue for the company.\n\nFisker (FSR) People checking out the Fisker Ocean at the Grand Opening of The Fisker (FSR) Showroom at The Grove.\n\nSource: Josiah True / Shutterstock.com\n\nA newer member of the meme stock circuit is Fisker (NYSE:FSR), an electric vehicle (EV) stock that a passionate community of sustainability-focused retail investors could buoy.\n\nFisker, according to Tom Bruni, social investment platform Stocktwits’ lead writer, “has arguably become a ‘meme stock.’ …However, like other ‘meme stocks,’ the company has since been unable to produce the business results it so confidently forecasted.”\n\nWhile Fisker has struggled for performance in recent years, the automotive firm recently announced an agreement with an institutional investor set to free up higher volumes of cash to cover operating costs. The news puts the stock on track to make its first gain in 2024 and could make its sub-$500 million market capitalization attractive for meme investors.\n\n“I am pleased that we were able to reach an agreement with one of our investors that will provide increased flexibility and better position us to execute on potential strategic business deals,” said the company’s chief executive, Henrik Fisker.\n\nSpirit Airlines (SAVE) A yellow, Spirit Airlines (SAVE) branded airplane flying in the air\n\nSource: Markus Mainka / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpirit Airlines (NYSE:SAVE) has become the world’s newest meme stock following a failed $3.8 billion acquisition launched by JetBlue (NASDAQ:JBLU). In a market rollercoaster set to rumble on, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) blocked the merger, citing antitrust concerns.\n\nAlthough the bungled acquisition attempt saw Spirit shed around 50% of its market value, the stock found a vocal supporter in Barstool Sports founder and owner Dave Portnoy.\n\nCalling Spirit Airlines “the people’s airline,” Portnoy has helped to generate significant positive sentiment towards the stock, citing how the company has often avoided the PR disasters of other budget airlines in recent years.\n\nThe rally saw Spirit double in value at its peak and if this positive market sentiment captures the imagination of retail investors, we could see Spirit’s relatively modest market capitalization of under $1 billion offer attractive levels of potential for meme investors seeking to hold the troubled stock.\n\nWhether external factors like a prospective cryptocurrency bull market provide more retail investors with the confidence and liquidity to once again embrace meme stocks like 2021 remains to be seen. However, it’s certainly worth tracking these strong meme prospects that hold plenty of potential to pop in the year ahead.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "It requires some risk to get a meaningful reward in the stock market. Some investors accumulate promising stocks and build their portfolios around them for the chance of outperforming the market.\n\nWhile it’s hard to time entries and exits, an approach grounded in fundamental analysis puts time on your side. You don’t have to worry about how the stock price moves in one month or one year. Buying long-term stocks and holding onto them for several years can generate exceptional returns.\n\nInvestors looking for top investment stocks may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nWhen most investors think of social media stocks, they immediately gravitate toward Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). While the company proved many bears like myself wrong in 2023, I will be setting my sights on another social media stock that hasn’t received as much attention.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) feels like an under-the-radar stock due to falling by roughly 80% from peak to trough from 2021 to 2022. However, the stock has staged a 34% rally over the past year. The stock also has an average price target of $44/share on TipRanks, implying a 17% upside.\n\nAd revenue acceleration and profitability are two key drivers for the company. Pinterest reported 11% year-over-year (YoY) revenue growth in the third quarter and increased its monthly active users by 8% YoY. Over 482 million people now use Pinterest at least once per month.\n\nBill Ready, CEO of Pinterest offered some exciting remarks in the press release:\n\n“As we lean into Pinterest’s unique differentiators as a visual search, discovery, and shopping platform, we’re finding our best product market fit in years. Our users are engaging deeply and we’re delivering better results for advertisers through improved measurement and innovation across the full funnel.”\n\nThings seem to be looking up for Pinterest, and the stock price may go along for the ride.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) three energy drinks contrasted against a white background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCelsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH) is a sports beverage company exhibiting tremendous growth over the years. The stock has gained over 3,700% over the past five years as the company plots out an international expansion.\n\nThe firm is still expanding at a fast pace in North America. Sales increased by 107% YoY in the region during the third quarter of 2023. That is almost the same growth rate as the North American growth rate in Q3 2022. North American revenue increased by 112% YoY during that period.\n\nLooking at North American and overall revenue numbers, we can deduce international revenue. In Q3 2022, the company generated $8.7 million in revenue outside North America. In 2023, the company reported $14 million in revenue outside of North America. That’s a 61% YoY growth rate in international revenue.\n\nCelsius Holdings is in the early innings of penetrating international markets. The growth rate is already high, but it can get much higher in future quarters as brand adoption grows. Meanwhile, high growth rates in North America have proven to be sticky.\n\nWatsco (WSO) Watsco (WSO) logo on the website homepage.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nWatsco (NYSE:WSO) has amassed a $15.4 billion market cap by distributing air conditioning, heating and refrigeration equipment. Shares are up by 30% over the past year and have gained 168% over the past five years. WSO stock trades at a 25 P/E ratio, and has a 2.50% dividend yield.\n\nWatsco has a superb dividend history and hiked its quarterly dividend per share from $2.20 to $2.45 in 2023. That represents an 11.4% YoY increase. The corporation actually jumped the gun and increased its dividend after three quarters instead of four quarters.\n\nThe company has maintained $2.45/share for five consecutive quarters, which means another hike is likely to come in the next quarter. Watsco has paid dividends for 50 consecutive years.\n\nWatsco is staying strong with a record-breaking third quarter. The firm reached record levels for sales, operating income, net income and earnings per share. Despite a busy 2022, Watsco delivered 4% YoY sales growth and an 8% increase in net income.\n\nA total of 70% of Watsco’s sales came from its HVAC equipment segment, while 26% of sales came from the other HVAC products segment. Commercial refrigeration products are attributed to the remaining 4% of total sales.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in CELH.

        "content": "Donald Trump’s ascent in the real estate world was marked by strategic acquisitions and development of luxury hotels, his approach to real estate offers a blueprint for success in the sector. For investors seeking to emulate Trump’s success, two real estate investment trusts (REITs) stand out as prime opportunities, especially in light of Trump’s potential return to the ticket. These REITs are strategically positioned to benefit from the dynamics that Trump’s comeback could bring to the real estate market, offering a unique chance for investors to align their portfolios with the proven strategies of a real estate mogul.\n\nVornado Realty Trust\n\nVornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO), with its significant holdings in Manhattan, offers a compelling entry point into New York’s commercial real estate sector. The company’s portfolio, comprising high-value office buildings and retail spaces, positions it as a key player in one of the world’s most competitive real estate markets.\n\nAmong its prestigious tenants, Vornado counts tech giants such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and leading financial firms like J.P. Morgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). These high-profile tenants not only bring financial stability to Vornado’s portfolio but also enhance its prestige in the commercial real estate sector. The presence of such significant players in Vornado’s properties signals the trust’s ability to meet the demands of top-tier businesses, making it an attractive option for investors seeking exposure to Manhattan’s lucrative real estate market.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Dara Khosrowshahi-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Commercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class. A platform backed by industry giant Marcus & Millichap is changing that, allowing individuals to invest in commercial real estate with as little as $5,000.\n\nStory continues\n\nStag Industrial\n\nStag Industrial (NYSE:STAG), with its dividend yield of 4.0%, focuses on the industrial and logistics sector, a segment that has seen tremendous growth driven by the rise of e-commerce. While STAG operates across the United States, its presence in Florida is noteworthy due to the state’s increasing demand for logistics and distribution centers driven by the growth of e-commerce.\n\nSTAG’s portfolio includes warehouses and distribution centers leased to key players in the e-commerce and logistics space, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and FedEx (NYSE:FDX). These tenants underscore STAG’s strategic alignment with the e-commerce boom and its role in supporting the supply chains that are critical to the success of online retail. The presence of such significant e-commerce and logistics companies within STAG’s portfolio not only provides a stable revenue base but also positions the REIT to benefit from the continued growth of online shopping, making it a compelling choice for investors interested in the industrial real estate market.\n\nVornado Realty Trust and Stag Industrial stand out for their strategic property investments and impressive list of tenants, much like the approach Donald Trump took in building his real estate empire. Vornado’s partnerships with tech and financial powerhouses in Manhattan, along with Stag Industrial’s connections with leading e-commerce and logistics companies in Florida, highlight their knack for tapping into current market trends and forging strong tenant relationships. This strategy, focusing on premium locations and high-profile tenants, mirrors Trump’s own method of seizing top real estate opportunities,\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "content": "(Adds dateline, byline, comment in paragraphs 5-6, updates prices at 10:45 a.m ET (15:45 GMT)\n\n*\n\nUnexpectedly strong U.S. labor report puts rate outlook on hold\n\n*\n\nAmazon, Meta keep market sentiment buoyant\n\n*\n\nShanghai Composite logs worst week in 5 yrs\n\nBy Herbert Lash and Dhara Ranasinghe\n\nNEW YORK/LONDON Feb 2 (Reuters) - Treasury yields jumped, the dollar surged and global equities edged higher on Friday after a blowout U.S. jobs report scuttled any lingering hopes for a near-term cut in interest rates and underscored a strong economy that can ward off a recession.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased by 353,000 jobs in January, the Labor Department's Bureau of Labor Statistics said, almost double the 180,000 forecast by economists polled by Reuters.\n\nThe benchmark 10-year Treasury note yield shot above 4% and the dollar gained against all major currencies as employers added far more jobs than expected and average hourly earnings increased 0.6% after rising 0.4% in December.\n\nThe data came after the Federal Reserve on Wednesday pushed back against expectations for an imminent rate cut, with Chair Jerome Powell warning inflation was \"still too high.\"\n\nThe jobs report showed the market had gotten too far ahead of when it expected the Fed to cut rates, said Kevin Gordon, senior investment strategist at Charles Schwab in New York.\n\n\"In the short term there's going to be a little bit of a digestion phase because the market had been expecting the Fed to cut sooner,\" Gordon said. \"But in the medium term, it could still be a good thing because generally a resilient labor market, strong economy is good for stock prices.\"\n\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe advanced 0.32% while on Wall Street, the tech-laden Nasdaq and benchmark S&P 500 rose 1.09% and 0.60% respectively as investors cheered robust quarterly results from Meta Platforms and Amazon.com.\n\nBut the Dow Industrials eased slid 0.12%.\n\nMeta surged 20.7% to hit a record high after issuing its first dividend days ahead of Facebook's 20th anniversary, along with a revenue and profit beat on advertising sales in the holiday shopping period.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Things will be better than people expect and the rate cuts that are expected are going to come later, or not at all,\" said Christopher Rossbach, chief investment officer at asset manager J.Stern & Co.\n\n\"We're looking at strong (corporate) results and a solid underlying economy.\"\n\nAfter the jobs report money markets projected the Fed would lower its target rate, currently in a range of 5.25%-5.5%, by 123.3 basis points by year-end, down from 140.3 bps just before the data was released.\n\nFutures pared bets for a rate cut in March to 20.5% from 36.5% just before the report, and slashed the likelihood of a 25 or 50 bps cut in May to 62.9% from 91.6%, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nThe two-year Treasury yield, which reflects interest rate expectations, surged 19.1 basis points to 4.385% and the yield on 10-year notes rose 17.8 basis points to 4.041%.\n\nGlobal shares have risen for 12 of the last 13 sessions as markets conjure up a so-called Goldilocks scenario of easier monetary policy alongside robust economic growth, which some investors warn is unrealistic.\n\n\"The (stock) market is on happy pills,\" said Noel O'Halloran, chief investment officer of KBI Global Investors.\n\n\"Investors think we are going to have rate cuts, inflation dropping, a miraculous soft landing that doesn't do any damage to earnings, and areas of the market like technology are priced on the belief the stocks can grow miraculously to the sky.\"\n\nRISKS\n\nInvestors brushed off a big Chinese market selloff caused by a lack of hoped-for government stimulus, as well as stress in U.S. regional banks and commercial property.\n\nChina shares fell to new five-year lows and posted their worst weekly drop in five years, with the Shanghai Composite 1.5% lower on the day and down 6.2% for the week, its largest such loss since October 2018. The blue-chip CSI300 hit a five-year low.\n\nAlmost a year after the failure of California's Silicon Valley Bank heightened concern about the balance sheet health of smaller U.S. lenders, New York Community Bancorp this week reported increased stress in its commercial real estate portfolio.\n\nIn Tokyo, shares in Aozora Bank slumped for a second straight session to bring its weekly loss to 33%, after provisioning for U.S. office loan losses.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, rose 0.79%, while the euro was down 0.69% to $1.0797. The yen weakened 1.24% to 148.27 per dollar,\n\nOil prices dipped about 2% setting up both benchmarks for a weekly loss given China's faltering economy and persistent geopolitical tensions.\n\nU.S. crude fell 2.13% to $72.25 per barrel and Brent was at $77.25, down 1.84% on the day.\n\nSpot gold dropped 1.0% to $2,034.88 an ounce.\n\n(Reporting by Herbert Lash, additional reporting by Chuck Mikolajczak, Naomi Rovnick, Dhara Ranashinghe and Stella Qiu.

He is now worth $169.5 billion, the richest he’s ever been, and surpassed Bill Gates to move into the fourth spot on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index.\n\nIt’s a big comeback for Zuckerberg’s wealth, which fell below $35 billion in late 2022 as tech stocks collapsed in the face of inflation and interest rate hikes, only to come soaring back in 2023.\n\nThe upbeat results will benefit Zuckerberg in other ways, too: He stands to receive a payout of about $700 million a year from the social media giant’s first-ever dividend for investors.\n\nMeta announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents a share for Class A and B common stock beginning in March. With Zuckerberg holding about 350 million shares, he would take home about $175 million in each quarterly payment before taxes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nRead More: Meta’s $200 Billion Surge Is Biggest in Stock-Market History\n\nMeta’s move to pay a dividend sends a signal about the company’s view of its growth potential. Often, faster-growing tech companies eschew dividends in favor of using earnings to develop new products or make expensive acquisitions. While Meta is spending big on artificial intelligence initiatives, its acquisition prospects are dwindling in the face of regulatory opposition.\n\nRead More: Meta Plans $50 Billion Buyback in Bid to Win Over Investors\n\nAfter Meta fired about 21,000 people and narrowed its priorities, the stock almost tripled in 2023. The new dividend and an additional $50 billion in share buybacks may win more patience from investors with Zuckerberg’s long-term bets on artificial intelligence and the metaverse.\n\nStory continues\n\nZuckerberg took home $27.1 million in total compensation in 2022, including private security costs and a base salary of $1, according to filings.

At this time, I would like to welcome everyone to the Meta Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. [Operator Instructions]. Ken Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\nKen Dorell: Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. Before we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. And now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nMark Zuckerberg: All right. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse. And last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think that being a leaner company is helping us execute better and faster, and we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate. Now moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with. I also think that everyone will want a new category of computing devices that let you frictionlessly interact with AIs that can see what you see and hear what you hear, like smart glasses.\n\nAnd one thing that became clear to me in the last year is that this next generation of services requires building full general intelligence. Previously, I thought that because many of the tools were social-, commerce- or maybe media-oriented that it might be possible to deliver these products by solving only a subset of AI's challenges. But now it's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision. We've been working on general intelligence research and FAIR for more than a decade. But now general intelligence will be the theme of our product work as well. Meta has a long history of building new technologies into our services, and we have a clear long-term playbook for becoming leaders.\n\nAnd there are a few key aspects of this that I want to take some time to go through today. The first is world-class compute infrastructure. I recently shared that, by the end of this year, we'll have about 350,000 H100s, and including other GPUs, that will be around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute. We're well positioned now because of the lessons that we learned from Reels. We initially underbuilt our GPU clusters for Reels. And when we were going through that, I decided that we should build enough capacity to support both Reels and another Reels-sized AI service that we expected to emerge so we wouldn't be in that situation again. And at the time, the decision was somewhat controversial, and we faced a lot of questions about CapEx spending, but I'm really glad that we did this.\n\nNow going forward, we think that training and operating future models will be even more compute-intensive. We don't have a clear expectation for exactly how much this will be yet, but the trend has been that state-of-the-art large language models have been trained on roughly 10x the amount of compute each year. And our training clusters are only part of our overall infrastructure, and the rest, obviously, isn't growing as quickly. But overall, we're playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area. In order to build the most advanced clusters, we're also designing novel data centers and designing our own custom silicons specialized for our workloads. The second part of our playbook is open-source software infrastructure.\n\nOur long-standing strategy has been to build an open-source general infrastructure while keeping our specific product implementations proprietary. In the case of AI, the general infrastructure includes our Llama models, including Llama 3, which is training now, and it's looking great so far, as well as industry standard tools like PyTorch that we've developed. And this approach to open source has unlocked a lot of innovation across the industry, and it's something that we believe in deeply. And I know that some people have questions about how we benefit from open sourcing, the results of our research and large amounts of compute. So I thought it might be useful to lay out the strategic benefits here. The short version is that open sourcing improves our models.\n\nAnd because there's still significant work to turn our models into products because there will be other open-source models available anyway, we find that there are mostly advantages to being the open-source leader, and it doesn't remove differentiation for our products much anyway. And more specifically, there are several strategic benefits. First, open-source software is typically safer and more secure as well as more compute-efficient to operate due to all the ongoing feedback, scrutiny and development from the community. Now this is a big deal because safety is one of the most important issues in AI. Efficiency improvements and lowering the compute costs also benefit everyone, including us. Second, open-source software often becomes an industry standard.\n\nAnd when companies standardize on building with our stack, that then becomes easier to integrate new innovations into our products. That's subtle, but the ability to learn and improve quickly is a huge advantage. And being an industry standard enables that. Third, open source is hugely popular with developers and researchers. And we know that people want to work on open systems that will be widely adopted. So this helps us recruit the best people at Meta, which is a very big deal for leading in any new technology area. And again, we typically have unique data and build unique product integrations anyway, so providing infrastructure like Llama as open source doesn't reduce our main advantage. This is why our long-standing strategy has been to open source general infrastructure and why I expect it to continue to be the right approach for us going forward.\n\nThe next part of our playbook is just taking a long-term approach towards the development. While we're working on today's products and models, we're also working on the research that we need to advance for Llama 5, 6 and 7 in the coming years and beyond to develop full general intelligence. It's important to have a portfolio of multiyear investments in research projects, but it's also important to have clear launch vehicles like future Llama models that help focus our work. We've worked on general intelligence in our lab, FAIR, for more than a decade, as I mentioned, and we produced a lot of valuable work. But having clear product targets for delivering general intelligence really focuses this work and helps us build the leading research program.\n\nNow the next key part of our playbook is learning from unique data and feedback loops in our products. When people think about data, they typically think about the corpus that you might use to train a model upfront. And on Facebook and Instagram, there are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set. And people share large numbers of public text posts and comments across our services as well. But even more important in the upfront training corpus is the ability to establish the right feedback loops with hundreds of millions of people interacting with AI services across our products. And this feedback is a big part of how we've improved our AI systems so quickly with Reels and Ads, especially over the last couple of years when we had to re-architect it around new rules.\n\nNow that brings me to the last part of our playbook for building leading services, which is our culture of rapid learning and experimentation across our apps. When we decide that a new technology, like AI-recommended Reels, is going to be an important part of the future, we're not shy about having multiple teams experimenting with different versions across our apps until we get it right. And then we learn what works and we roll it out to everyone. And there used to be this meme that we'd probably launch Stories on our Settings page at some point. And look, I think it's kind of funny because it gets to a core part of our approach. We start by learning and tuning our products until they perform the way we want, and then we roll them out very broadly.\n\nAnd sometimes, occasionally, products will blow up before we're ready for them to, like Threads, although I'll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak. So that one is, I think, on track to be a major success. But normally, we learn and we iterate methodically. And we started doing that with our AI services in the fall launching Meta AI, our assistant; AI Studio, which the precursor to Creator AIs; our Alpha with Business AIs; and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. And we've been tuning each of these, and we're getting closer to rolling them out more widely. So you should expect that in the coming months. From there, we'll focus on rolling out services until they reach hundreds of millions or billions of people.\n\nAnd usually, only when we reach that kind of scale do we start focusing on what monetization will look like. And although in this case, the way the business AIs will help business messaging grow and WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram is pretty clear. But that's our basic approach, and I'm really excited about pointing our company at developing so many of these awesome things. Now we have 2 major parts of our long-term vision, and in addition to AI, the other part is the metaverse. We've invested heavily in both AI and the metaverse for a long time, and we will continue to do so. These days, there are a lot of questions more about AI that I get, and that field is moving very quickly. But I still expect that this next generation of AR, VR and MR computing platforms to deliver a realistic sense of presence that will be the foundation for the future of social experiences and almost every other category of experiences as well.\n\nReality Labs crossed $1 billion in revenue in Q4 for the first time with Quest having a strong holiday season. Quest 3 is off to a strong start, and I expect it to continue to be the most popular mixed reality device. With Quest 3 and Quest 2 both performing well, we saw that the Quest app was actually the most downloaded app in the App Store on Christmas Day. I want to give a shout-out to Asgard's Wrath2, which was developed by one of our in-house studios and received IGN's 10 out of 10 masterpiece rating, making it one of the best-rated games out there, not just in VR, but of any game on any platform ever. So it's a really good sign that we're able to deliver that quality of work at Meta. Horizon is growing quickly, too. It is now on Top 10 Most Used Apps on Quest, and we have an exciting road map ahead.\n\nThis is another example of applying the long-term playbook that I discussed earlier with AI but in another area. We take the time to build up the core technology and tune the experience. And then when it's ready, we're good at growing things. Now our focus for this year is going to be on growing the mobile version of Horizon as well as the VR One. Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses are also off to a very strong start, both in sales and engagement. Our partner, EssilorLuxottica is already planning on making more than we both expected due to high demand. Engagement and retention are also significantly higher than the first version of the glasses. The experience is just a lot better with Meta AI in there as well as there's a higher resolution camera, better audio and more.\n\nAnd we also have an exciting road map of software improvements ahead, starting with rolling out multimodal AI and then some other really exciting new AI features later in the year. I said this before, but I think that people are going to want new categories of devices that seamlessly engage with AIs frequently throughout the AI without having to take out your phone and press a button and point it at what you want to see. And I think that smart glasses are going to be a compelling form factor for this, and it's a good example of how our AI and metaverse visions are connected. In addition to AI in the metaverse, we're continuing to improve our Apps and Ads businesses as well. Reels and our discovery engine remain a priority and major driver of engagement, and Messaging continues to be our focus for building the next revenue pillar of our business before our longer-term work reaches scale. A team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nBut since I went a bit longer in the other areas today, I'm just going to mention a few highlights here. Reels continues to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook. People re-share Reels 3.5 billion times every day. Reels is now contributing to our net revenue across our apps. The biggest opportunity going forward is unifying our recommendation systems across Reels and other types of video that will help people discover the best content across our systems no matter what format it's in. WhatsApp is also doing very well. And the most exciting new trend here is that it is succeeding more broadly in the United States, where there's a real appetite for a private, secure and cross-platform messaging app that everyone can use. And given the strategic importance of the U.S. and its outsized importance for revenue, this is just a huge opportunity.\n\nThreads is also growing steadily with more than 130 million monthly actives. And I'm optimistic that we can keep the pace of improvements in growth going and show that a friendly, discussion-oriented app can be as widely used as the most popular social apps. All right. That's what I wanted to cover today. Our communities are growing, and our business is back on track. Once again, a big thank you to all of our employees, partners, shareholders and everyone in our community for sticking with us and for making 2023 such a success. I'm looking forward to another exciting year ahead. And now here's Susan.\n\nSusan Li: Thanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $40.1 billion, up 25% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $23.7 billion, down 8% compared to last year. In terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 8%, 0driven mainly by lower restructuring costs that were partially offset by higher infrastructure-related costs. R&D increased 8% driven primarily by higher head count-related costs from Family of Apps and Reality Labs as well as higher non-head count-related Reality Labs operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. Marketing and sales decreased 29% due mainly to lower marketing spend and restructuring costs.\n\nG&A decreased 26% due mainly to lower restructuring expenses. We ended the fourth quarter with over 67,300 employees, down 22% from a year ago while up 2% from Q3 as our hiring efforts have resumed. Fourth quarter operating income was $16.4 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17%. Net income was $14 billion or $5.33 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.9 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $11.5 billion, which reflects a $1.6 billion payment of income taxes deferred from prior quarters of 2023. We ended the year with $65.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A stock, bringing our total share repurchases for the full year to $20 billion. We had $30.9 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of December 31. And today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. Moving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. In Q4, we saw continued community growth across the Family of Apps as well as Facebook, specifically. We're sharing today that as previewed when we first introduced our family metrics, we are transitioning away from reporting Facebook-specific metrics. As part of this transition, we will no longer report Facebook daily and monthly active users or family monthly active people.\n\nIn Q1, we will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level while continuing to report family daily active people. For full year 2023, Family of Apps total revenue was $133 billion and ad revenue was $131.9 billion, each up 16% year-over-year. The largest contributors to year-over-year ad revenue growth were the online commerce, CPG, entertainment and media and gaming verticals. The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets. In 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth. Turning back to Q4 results.\n\nQ4 total Family of Apps revenue was $39 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.7 billion, up 24% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming. On a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 33% and 32%, respectively, followed by Asia Pacific at 23% and North America at 19%. Foreign currency was a tailwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. In Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 21%, and the average price per ad increased 2%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World.\n\nPricing growth was driven by advertiser demand and currency tailwinds, which were partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing services and regions. Family of Apps other revenue was $334 million in Q4, up 82%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $18 billion, representing approximately 76% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were down 13% due to lower restructuring expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21 billion, representing a 54% operating margin. Within our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 47%, driven by Quest 3 sales during the holiday season.\n\nReality Labs expenses were $5.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year due primarily to higher head count-related expenses and non-head count-related R&D spend. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.6 billion. Turning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. We're seeing sustained growth in Reels and Video overall as daily watch time across all video types grew over 25% year-over-year in Q4, driven by ongoing ranking improvements. In-feed recommendations of posts from accounts you're not connected to also continue to drive incremental engagement as we increasingly personalize recommendations, and we expect to deliver further improvements this year.\n\nOn Instagram, we're making strong progress increasing the freshness of recommended content. And a big focus for Facebook this year will be unifying our video experiences and ranking across the app, which should create a more seamless user experience and deliver increasingly relevant video recommendations. On WhatsApp, community growth remains strong, and we're seeing good traction with our Channels product, which has quickly scaled to over 500 million monthly active users since we rolled it out globally in September. We are also making good progress in areas that have the potential to grow people's engagement with our products in the longer term, such as Threads and generative AI. On Threads, we're coming into 2024 with strong product momentum and remain focused on introducing additional valuable features and further scaling the community this year.\n\nWith generative AI, we fully rolled out our Meta AI assistant and other AI chat experiences in the U.S. at the end of the year and began testing more than 20 GenAI features across our Family of Apps. Our big areas of focus in 2024 will be working towards the launch of Llama 3, expanding the usefulness of our Meta AI assistant and progressing on our AI Studio road map to make it easier for anyone to create an AI. For the experiences in our apps, we'll follow our typical approach of making them great before we lean into growth and eventually monetization. But this continues to be an exciting area that has the potential to transform how people engage on our services in the years ahead. Now to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency.\n\nThere are 2 parts to this work. The first part is growing the level of ad inventory within organic engagement. Our approach to optimizing ad levels in our apps has become increasingly sophisticated over the years as we've developed a better understanding of the optimal place, time and person to show an ad, which has enabled us to adopt a more dynamic approach to serving apps. We expect to continue that work going forward, while services with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities. The other part to increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. To do this, we're focused on 3 areas. The first is AI. We continue to leverage AI across our ad systems and product suite.\n\nWe're delivering continued performance gains from ranking improvements as we adopt larger and more advanced models, and this will remain an ongoing area of investment in 2024. We're also building out our Advantage+ portfolio of solutions to help advertisers leverage AI to automate their advertising campaigns. Advertisers can choose to automate part of the campaign creation setup process, such as who to show their ad to with Advantage+ audience, or they can automate their campaign completely using Advantage+ shopping, which continues to see strong growth. We're also now exploring ways to apply this end-to-end automation to new objectives. On the ads creative side, we completed the global rollout of 2 of our generative AI features in Q4, Text Variations and Image Expansion, and plan to broaden availability of our background generation feature later in Q1.\n\nInitial adoption of these features has been strong, and tests are showing promising early performance gains. This will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024. The second area of our work is helping businesses connect their marketing data and measure results. Here, we're continuing to invest in conversions API to make it easier for advertisers to not only adopt but maximize its impact. The last area is investing in new and engaging on-platform ad experiences. Business messaging remains a priority here. Click-to-message ads continue to grow, and we're seeing advertisers increasingly use these ads to drive down funnel conversions. Paid messaging is growing quickly, and we are focused on broadening adoption in 2024 by making it easier for businesses to buy marketing messages and more easily adopt our Flows product to develop richer in-Thread experiences for consumers.\n\nWe're also progressing with our early testing on WhatsApp and Messenger of AIs for businesses that can provide conversational support in chat. We'll take our time to get these experiences right, but we think this will be a compelling opportunity that we're well positioned to deliver on. Outside of business messaging, we're making strong progress with our shops' ads products, which crossed a $2 billion annual run rate in Q4. Next, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We are in the fortunate position of being able to invest in many organic opportunities to improve the performance of our core business in the near term while also making 2 significant longer-time horizon investments in AI and Reality Labs. AI is a growing area of investment for us in 2024 as we hire to support our road map.\n\nWe are also investing more in our AI infrastructure capacity this year. And given many of our ambitious forward-looking plans will rely on having sufficient compute capacity, we expect this to be an area we invest more aggressively in over the coming years. Reality Labs is the other long-term initiative we continue to invest heavily in as we progress on our efforts to develop the next computing platform. Aside from organic investments, returning capital to shareholders remains important to us. We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time. We've historically done so through share repurchases. And while we expect to maintain an active share repurchase program, we are modestly evolving our approach going forward by returning a portion of capital through a regular dividend subject to quarterly Board approval.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the FTC is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful, it would have an adverse impact on our business. Turning now to the revenue outlook. We expect first quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. Turning now to the expense outlook.\n\nWe expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94 billion to $99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024. First, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.\n\nFinally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR/VR and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. Turning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30 billion to $37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our AI capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development.\n\nWhile we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year. On to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, this was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities and improved advertising performance for businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our priorities in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs. With that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nSee also 40 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth and 24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) reported positive earnings results on Thursday, both beating Wall Street expectations with trends like AI pushing growth across their respective business segments. Meta will be even paying out its first dividend, amounting to $0.50 per share.\n\nRBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst Brad Erickson joins Yahoo Finance Live to talk on the two tech giant's pivot to AI — noting comments from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg — and their standings in the tech enviroment coming out of earnings season.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: Amazon and Meta snapping big tech's earnings losing streak here. The companies both reporting huge profits and strong outlooks, sending their stocks soaring in pre-market trading.\n\nJoining us now, we've got Brad Erickson, RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst. Brad, great to speak with you here this morning. As you think about, ultimately, what this quarter has meant, and perhaps we take a fine second here and look at Meta first.\n\nLet's start things off there because that is one area that if investors were looking at this company after a year of efficiency, it seems like they're now turning the dial in the opposite direction here.\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Yeah, absolutely. And nice to see you both. Thanks for having me. So last night was a quarter-- the way we framed it was we may look back in a few years. And remember this print as a transformational moment.\n\nYou're right. The ad business is firing on all cylinders. It looks like actually overall digital ad demand is probably doing better than expected in Q1. So not necessarily just a Meta thing. I think the bigger thing, though, that came out last night was Mark continues to-- Mark Zuckerberg continues to expand on their AI strategy and not-- interestingly, for us, it wasn't just around how AI will affect the ad business. He's expanding the scope of that.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I think the thing we're talking about in our comments post report this morning is that it almost feels like they're signaling an entry into the cloud business or some other type of service or capability beyond the core ad business, as we know it today.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Brad, let's talk about one of the big announcements from this report. And that's the dividend. Talk to us just about the significance of this. And when it comes to investor expectations, shareholder expectations, what this also just tells us about Meta's financial stability at this point?\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Yeah. Of course. Gosh, what a difference a year or two makes, right? I thought one of the things that investors really probably liked a lot on the conference call was Mark-- he was very-- he almost condemned himself for having not appreciated how well the company could run, even as you became more efficient.\n\nAnd now, you add on the dividend, which is really just-- it's an olive branch, right? It's not a very big dividend at this point. But it's definitely a reflection of hey, this company is growing and profitable for the future. And there's a lot of confidence there. And so there's, obviously, multiple angles of capital return now, which is really encouraging.\n\nBRAD SMITH: So from that perspective, and from that angle then for investors out there that don't own Meta, that hear about this dividend now, does that make it, not only more attractive, but does it make it a buy?\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Yeah. We think this thing go a lot higher. We've been-- last year in 2023, it was absolutely our top pick in mega cap and reiterated we're bullish on it in '24 as evidence.\n\nThe dividend certainly expands kind of the addressable shareholder base that could go out or would go out. And by Meta, I think from here, though, to beyond just that the dividend as the driver, I think back to my comments on potentially some type of an entry into the cloud market, that represents unprecedented multiple expansion opportunity.\n\nWe know the earnings growth is going to be super strong for this company. But, historically, the multiples can been held back because emergence of things like TikTok highlighted that maybe the competitive moat wasn't like perfect on this business longer term.\n\nYou start to talk about getting into other huge markets like cloud. That's multiple expansion potential on a whole other level from our perspective.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Brad, the other big name that you cover here is Amazon. A strong report here from the company after the bell yesterday. We're looking at gains ahead of the open at least in the futures market up just about 6%. What was your top takeaway from this report? And do you think it helps alleviate some of the fears that have been out there just in terms of where Amazon stands in this AI race with one of their big announcements?\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Yeah. Totally. I think in Amazon's case, very good report. Also, stock up, like you said. Very different report, though, from Meta. In some ways, a lot more linear straightforward. And what I mean by that is investors really want two things out of this company. And we got both of them last night or the beginnings of them.\n\nOne, they need to continue to see the operating income results and outlook go higher. They did. That happened. And two, investors looking for better confidence that AWS can-- the cloud business can re-accelerate. And I think we came away from last night-- investors came away last night feeling better about those two things.\n\nSo the thesis, while it's understood, our view going forward is that as investors continue to see Amazon doing the blocking and tackling around those two things I mentioned, the stock can continue to work. And I think we're pretty convicted on that.\n\nAmazon was our favorite idea entering the year. And, certainly, remains so.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And so with that in mind, profitability, that's been one through line that we've been continuing to try and track across all of these companies over the earnings season.\n\nNorth America, particularly, here, as they were talking through the different regions here, they mentioned operating margins at some of their recent low levels in Q1 of 2022. But now, seven consecutive quarters of improvement, cumulative improvement of 800 basis points. They're talking about over those 7/4 here.\n\nSo how does that change, perhaps, the margin profile that investors should expect coming from Amazon going forward?\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Yeah. It's ramping margins, earnings, and free cash flow on a scale that people have been wanting out of this company for 20 years since going public, frankly.\n\nSo that's why it's so important. Just to give you a sense of the numbers, they just did $37 billion in operating income in 2023. We have them forecast to do $100 billion of operating income in 2026.\n\nAnd when you're doing six, seven, maybe, $800 billion of revenue over the next few years, a hundred or 200 or 300 basis points of margin expansion is, obviously, tens of billions of dollars of that operating income.\n\nSo yeah. Pretty historic expansion in the earnings and free cash flow here.\n\nBRAD SMITH: Brad, always a pleasure getting some of your analysis here talking both Meta and Amazon for us this morning after both companies reported earnings yesterday evening. Brad Erickson--\n\nBRAD ERICKSON: Thanks a lot. Good to see you.\n\nBRAD SMITH: --RBC Capital Markets Internet Analyst. Great to see you too.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nWith Friday's rally, the company was on pace to add more than $200 billion to its market cap, which would be a stock market record, according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.\n\nMeta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human.

(JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

(SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMeta stock is now more than 16% higher in premarket trade following a bumper earnings report.\n\nOver the last four quarters Mark Zuckerberg's behemoth has beat EPS by some margin. In September, it was 82.4% higher than expected. December saw a beat of more than 7%.\n\nFourth quarter earnings were $40.1bn, beating the predicted $39.18bn and up 25% year-over-year.\n\nThe bottom line is that the pivot to artificial intelligence (AI) products has been one of the winning factors. AI remains one of Meta's main investment areas in 2024, with the company increasing its capex by $2bn in this area.\n\nThe company also announced it will pay a 50 cent-per-share dividend to investors for the first time, and has authorised a $50bn share buyback programme. This will net CEO Zuckerberg around $700m.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead, Yahoo Finance US reported on Thursday night.\n\nNet sales came in at nearly $170bn versus expectations of $166.2bn. That's 14% higher than the almost $150bn the company generated during the same period in the prior year. The outlook for the current quarter also surpassed forecasts, with the company estimating an upper range of $143.5bn.\n\n“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said CEO Andy Jassy in the earnings release.\n\nAmazon's muscular earnings report and subsequent investor response followed more critical receptions to some of its Big Tech siblings, which also largely beat estimates.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple revenues beat forecasts for Q1, coming in at $119.6bn, led by the iPhone which saw revenue of $69.7bn.\n\nApple's results were, however, marred last quarter by regional revenue from China, Greater China revenue came in well short of forecasts at $20.8bn, indicating that the squeeze on sales is starting to have an effect.\n\nApple management seems concerned that's going to continue, as this quarter is expected to be similar to last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere in the business, iPad revenues hit $7bn, Mac revenues were at $7.8bn, and wearables hit $12bn, falling slightly short of forecasts. Services were also short of forecast at $23.1bn.\n\nRead more: Best UK mortgage deals of the week\n\n\"The next few months are likely to be challenging for Apple having to deal with regulatory issues in Europe over its App Store, while its Watch has been the subject of issues with respect to its blood oxygen feature,\" said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.\n\n\"The launch of the Vision Pro at $3,500 is unlikely to shift the dial when it comes to sales given how costly it is. Apple is launching some new iPads which may prompt an uptick in sales in this area over the next quarter, but the iPhone remains its key revenue earner so the slowdown in China will be a concern, however the Indian market could offer a way out on this front.\"\n\nStock is down around 2.8% in premarket trade.\n\nPeloton (PTON)\n\nShares of Peloton Interactive fell more than 20% by the end of the day on Thursday, dropping to a record low as the fitness company reported mixed second-quarter results and its third-quarter revenue guidance of $700m to $725m fell short of expectations.\n\nIt also warned on missing future goals for positive free cash flow, as some of its initiatives underperform.\n\nWatch: Amazon beats forecasts with help from AI</p><p>On Thursday, it said sales rose 14% to $170 billion - almost $4 billion better than expected. </p><p>Profits also exceeded Wall Street expectations. </p><p>Investors cheered the numbers, sending Amazon shares up as much as 8% in after-hours trade. </p><p>Its e-commerce unit saw gains after building fulfilment centers closer to customers, enabling cheaper, faster deliveries. </p><p>But investors were more focused on future revenue streams, including from artificial intelligence. </p><p>Cloud unit Amazon Web Services is incorporating the tech into more and more products, and starting to see the benefits. </p><p>On a call with analysts, chief executive Andy Jassy said AI would drive tens of billions of dollars in sales over the next few years. </p><p>The company is pouring money into chatbot-maker Anthropic as part of those efforts. </p><p>That’s to match rival Microsoft, which is putting $10 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. </p><p>Investors are also expecting big gains from advertising revenue. </p><p>Amazon recently launched ads in its Prime Video streaming service, with customers having the option to pay more for an ad-free service. </p><p>Not all of the company’s ideas work out, however. </p><p>This week it dropped a bid to buy iRobot - maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner - amid opposition from European regulators. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7CweKRes1kwORH3kl8XG2w--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/0234a81a06cccc67b07f02f8dceaa314\",\"duration\":\"PT1M37S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/3299af0d-39db-34a5-b2b2-a535c9334873.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-beats-forecasts-help-ai-092759570.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"3299af0d-39db-34a5-b2b2-a535c9334873\"}",

        "content": "Earns-Meta\n\nToday’s headlines\n\nRobert McLister: 10 mortgage trends I’m watching closely this year Meta, Amazon shares surge Indigo receives privatization offer from Gerald Schwartz Brookfield names Ranjan CEO of $140-billion private equity arm Bank of Canada governor says interest rates not to blame for housing crisis\n\nTop story\n\nMeta, Amazon shares surge by $279 billion after cutbacks boost profit\n\nCutbacks at Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. paid off in a big way, with both companies reporting better-than-expected earnings that sent stock prices soaring by a combined US$279 billion in premarket trading.\n\nEarnings got a boost from tens of thousands of job cuts since 2022 and strong sales that beat analysts’ estimates during the holiday season. Meta, which reduced headcount by 22 per cent in 2023, unveiled plans for a US$50-billion stock buyback, and announced its first quarterly dividend on Feb. 1, a sign to investors that it has money to spare and a reason for them to stick around.\n\nAmazon posted its best online sales growth since early in the pandemic, helped by quicker shipping times. The company — which initiated its biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts beginning in 2022 that affected about 35,000 people last year — has said more positions will be eliminated in its Prime Video, studios and Twitch livestreaming businesses.\n\n“This new found cost discipline is paying off for investors as these companies were able to prune less productive businesses while still being able to invest some of those savings in the faster growing parts of their business,” said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson & Co. “At the same time, these companies have been able to accelerate revenue growth, thus significantly increasing margins.”\n\nThe results sent Meta’s shares up as much as 17 per cent in premarket trading before New York exchanges opened. Amazon’s stock rose as much as seven per cent.\n\nBloomberg\n\nRead the full story here.\n\n7:30 a.m.\n\nStock markets before the opening bell Financial Post\n\nStock futures are climbing this morning after robust earnings from tech giants last night. Meta Platforms Inc. soared 17 per cent in premarket trading and Amazon.com Inc. rallied 7.1 per cent after the tech behemoths smashed quarterly profit expectations.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Inc. slipped after its earnings showed weakness in China.\n\nLater this morning, investors will be watching the monthly United States jobs report for confirmation of further cooling in the labour market that might encourage policy easing by the U.S. Federal Reserve.\n\n“Any move closer to four per cent could see markets changing bets on when Fed cuts could begin,” economists at Rand Merchant Bank in Johannesburg said in a note to clients.\n\nInvestors will continue to closely track developments around U.S. regional banks, as an index for the sector heads for its worst week since the fallout from the banking crisis last May. New York Community Bancorp has plunged 45 per cent since shocking investors Wednesday by reducing its dividend, posting a quarterly loss and ramping up loan-loss provisions for exposure to commercial real estate.\n\nCanada’s TSX closed up almost 100 points yesterday, despite weakness in energy stocks.\n\n— Bloomberg and The Canadian Press\n\nWhat to watch today\n\nAmericans get an update on their job market today. Economists forecast U.S. employers added 185,000 jobs in January. More earnings from oil majors are out today, with Imperial Oil Ltd., Exxon Mobil Corp. and Chevron Corp. all on deck.\n\nNeed a refresher on yesterday’s top headlines?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Layoffs are being mentioned on US earnings calls at the highest rate since the pandemic — and as Meta Platforms Inc. shows, such cost cutting can pay off for investors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Apple China Slowdown Sparks Fears That Prized Market Is at Risk\n\nEfforts by the Facebook parent to slash costs and refocus its business upended the lives of thousands of workers, but has since helped propel its stock 340% from a 2022 low.\n\nWith an economic soft landing being the base case for many, positioning by firms to protect margins — particularly in the technology sector — is being welcomed by investors.\n\nMentions of job cuts and synonyms per earnings calls this season have jumped to the highest levels since the second quarter of 2020, according to a Bloomberg transcript analysis of S&P 1500 Composite Index firms.\n\nFor the technology industry in particular, “more recent cuts come out of a position of strength,” said Wolf von Rotberg, equity strategist at Bank J. Safra Sarasin. “Confidence in the sector appears high that growth can persist even with a smaller workforce,” he said.\n\nMeta, Amazon Surge by $279 Billion After Cuts Boost Profit\n\nThe prospect of a cooling job market would bolster investor hopes that the Federal Reserve may ease borrowing costs sooner rather than later. US nonfarm payrolls data due Friday are expected to show a slowdown in new jobs added to the economy.\n\n“If you look at it from the point of view of strictly defending margins, these job cut announcements are usually well taken by markets with the stocks typically going up,” said Roland Kaloyan, strategist at Societe Generale. If the cuts stay at a moderate level, it would also encourage “the Fed to turn more dovish,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSalesforce Inc., Amazon.com Inc., and Alphabet Inc.’s Google are among companies reducing costs this year, while Microsoft Corp. is letting 1,900 people go across its video-game divisions following its acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nElsewhere, Spotify Technology SA, and United Parcel Service Inc. have announced staff reductions. In the banking sector Citigroup Inc. is among firms reducing roles, while Deutsche Bank AG plans to cut 3,500 jobs over the coming years as it seeks to lift profitability and return more money to shareholders.\n\n“This narrative of labor and staff shortages, that’s really behind us now,” said Bastien Drut, head of strategy and research at CPR AM, a unit of Amundi.\n\nTo be sure, not all cost-cutting strategies yield the kind of payoff being enjoyed by Meta and Amazon. While layoffs by retailer Wayfair Inc. and eBay Inc. were greeted positively by investors who recognised efforts to preserve margins in a tougher economic environment, office supply firm Xerox Holdings Corp. or Transformers toymaker Hasbro Inc., saw less success in such moves shoring up stock prices.\n\nSome companies also have less fat to lose following significant cuts last year, while higher valuations limit room for upside. US equities hit fresh records last month in a surge at odds with a slowdown in job openings.\n\nStock gains could also be vulnerable if an economic deterioration leads to greater weakening in the jobs market. “When these announcements add up, that can also be the sign that the cycle is tilting towards a recession,” Societe Generale’s Kaloyan said.\n\nTech industry tracker Layoffs.fyi estimates more than 30,000 employees have been let go this year so far. Still, that is a far cry from the nearly 90,000 laid off in January 2023.\n\nFor Saxo Bank’s Peter Garnry, last year’s cuts mean that “technology companies delivered both rising growth rates and expanding profit margins — the nirvana for shareholders.”\n\n--With assistance from Julien Ponthus, Subrat Patnaik and Allegra Catelli.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

The company's first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro kicks off a new era of computing for Apple. But a hefty price tag coupled with the fact that the AR/VR space is still an unproven market mean that Apple is fighting an uphill battle out of the gate. Here are three things you need to know about the Vision Pro.\n\nNumber one, the price tag. The Vision Pro starts at $3,499. That's far more expensive than rival Meta's priciest headset, the Meta Quest Pro, which costs $999. That price will likely prove to be too rich for even Apple's most ardent fans, especially given the AR and VR industry's relatively niche position in the consumer tech space.\n\nApple is advertising the Vision Pro as a spatial computer rather than a simple headset.

I used Apple's Vision Pro headset immediately after the company debuted it at WWDC in June 2023 and again, just ahead of its launch. And everything you've heard about it being a mind-blowing experience is spot on. The incredibly high-resolution micro OLED display is world's sharper than any other headset I've used, making images and videos appear crisp and colorful and ensuring you can easily read text.\n\nThe interface is wildly easy to navigate, thanks to eye-and-hand tracking cameras.

        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with the company offering a strong outlook for the current quarter and announcing new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\n\nIn the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nShares of Meta soared, gaining as much as 17% in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payrolls costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges including severance and facilities consolidation totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317 down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

        "title": "Meta’s paying dividends for the first time ever and it’s meant a $700 million pay rise for Mark Zuckerberg",
        "content": "The year 2024 is off to a good start for Mark Zuckerberg, and the rest of it looks like it will be just as sweet courtesy of a dividend payout of $700 million across the next four quarters.\n\nOn Meta's earning call this week, chief financial officer Susan Li confirmed a regular dividend would now be paid out to shareholders each quarter subject to board approval and market conditions.\n\nLi explained Meta was keen to return capital to shareholders while maintaining investment in the company, which it has typically achieved via share buybacks. However as well as announcing buybacks—to the tune of $20 billion for full year of 2023—Li added the company wanted to \"modestly evolve\" its return to shareholders.\n\nFor CEO Zuckerberg, who holds some 350 million shares in the Big Tech giant according to Bloomberg, a 50-cent-per Class A and B stock dividend means a payout in the region of $175 million per quarter from March onwards.\n\nSome simple math spits out an eye-watering figure, with Zuckerberg set to rake in $700 million across the year should the dividend level stay at 50 cents.\n\nHowever the good news for Zuckerberg's fortunes don't stop there. The father-of-three, estimated by Bloomberg's Billionaires Index to be worth $142 billion, is also getting further boosts courtesy of the company's strong share price.\n\nIn the past year alone Meta's share price has rocketed more than 100% to sit close to $400 at the time of writing.\n\nAnd Wall Street could be set to boost it further, as analysts were buoyed by the group's earnings call on Feb. 1. Zuckerberg kicked off the call by feeding back on the results of his \"year of efficiency\", which included layoffs and hiring freezes.\n\nZuckerberg told analysts on the call that Meta had achieved the level of efficiency it had aimed for—the business's headcount is down 22% compared to a year ago, now at just over 67,000—adding: \"Being a leaner company is helping us execute better and faster, and we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nAI ... AI ... AI ...\n\nBut everyone's new favorite buzzword also had the desired effect on share price. The phrase \"AI\" was used more than 80 times by Meta staffers on the call—a move that has proved something of a sure-fire way to pique the interests of investors.\n\nMicrosoft co-founder Bill Gates, for example, saw his wealth spike by $2 billion last spring after Microsoft mentioned artificial intelligence more than 50 times on its earnings call.\n\nCourtesy of the positive picture Zuckerberg and his team had for analysts—and the clear show of focus on the emerging technology—Meta's share price shot up in the hours following the announcement, boosting it by 14% in this year to date.\n\nOutside of AI excitement, Meta posted a 25% increase in revenue compared to the same period the previous year, up to $40.11 billion compared to $32.1 billion for Q4 2022. This resulted in a 16% full-year increase from the prior 12 months, up to $134.9 billion from $116.6 billion.\n\nDespite the rise of rival social media apps like TikTok, daily active users across Meta platforms like Facebook, Instagram and Threads were up 8% year-on-year, with ad impressions up 28%.\n\nA further boon for investors is the authorization of yet more share buybacks—potentially upping the price of the stocks further—with the company announcing a further $50 billion repurchase authorization.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to Fortune's request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

(Operator Instructions) This call will be recorded. Thank you very much. \r\nKen Dorell, Meta's Director of Investor Relations, you may begin.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\n\nThank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Meta Platform's Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining me today to discuss our results are Mark Zuckerberg, CEO; and Susan Li, CFO. \r\nBefore we get started, I would like to take this opportunity to remind you that our remarks today will include forward-looking statements. Actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements. Factors that could cause these results to differ materially are set forth in today's earnings press release and in our quarterly report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC. Any forward-looking statements that we make on this call are based on assumptions as of today, and we undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events. \r\nDuring this call, we will present both GAAP and certain non-GAAP financial measures. A reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures is included in today's earnings press release. The earnings press release and an accompanying investor presentation are available on our website at investor.fb.com. \r\nAnd now I'd like to turn the call over to Mark.\n\nStory continues\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nAll right. Hi, everyone. Thanks for joining us. This was a good quarter, and it wrapped up an important year for our community and our company. We estimate that there are more than 3.1 billion people who use at least one of our apps each day. 2023 was our year of efficiency, which focused on making Meta a stronger technology company and improving our business to give us the stability to deliver our ambitious long-term vision for AI and the metaverse. \r\nAnd last year, not only did we achieve our efficiency goals, but we returned to strong revenue growth, saw strong engagement across our apps; shipped a number of exciting new products like Threads, Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses and mixed reality in Quest 3; and of course, established a world-class AI effort that's going to be the foundation for many of our future products. I think that being a leaner company is helping us execute better and faster, and we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate. \r\nNow moving forward, a major goal, we'll be building the most popular and most advanced AI products and services. And if we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with. \r\nI also think that everyone will want a new category of computing devices that let you frictionlessly interact with AIs that can see what you see and hear what you hear, like smart glasses. And one thing that became clear to me in the last year is that this next generation of services requires building full general intelligence. Previously, I thought that because many of the tools were social-, commerce- or maybe media-oriented that it might be possible to deliver these products by solving only a subset of AI's challenges. \r\nBut now it's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan, code, remember and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision. We've been working on general intelligence research and FAIR for more than a decade. But now general intelligence will be the theme of our product work as well. Meta has a long history of building new technologies into our services, and we have a clear long-term playbook for becoming leaders. \r\nAnd there are a few key aspects of this that I want to take some time to go through today. The first is world-class compute infrastructure. I recently shared that, by the end of this year, we'll have about 350,000 H100s, and including other GPUs, that will be around 600,000 H100 equivalents of compute. We're well positioned now because of the lessons that we learned from Reels. We initially underbuilt our GPU clusters for Reels. And when we were going through that, I decided that we should build enough capacity to support both Reels and another Reels-sized AI service that we expected to emerge so we wouldn't be in that situation again. \r\nAnd at the time, the decision was somewhat controversial, and we faced a lot of questions about CapEx spending, but I'm really glad that we did this. Now going forward, we think that training and operating future models will be even more compute-intensive. We don't have a clear expectation for exactly how much this will be yet, but the trend has been that state-of-the-art large language models have been trained on roughly 10x the amount of compute each year. \r\nAnd our training clusters are only part of our overall infrastructure, and the rest, obviously, isn't growing as quickly. But overall, we're playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area. In order to build the most advanced clusters, we're also designing novel data centers and designing our own custom silicons specialized for our workloads. \r\nThe second part of our playbook is open-source software infrastructure. Our long-standing strategy has been to build an open-source general infrastructure while keeping our specific product implementations proprietary. In the case of AI, the general infrastructure includes our Llama models, including Llama 3, which is training now, and it's looking great so far, as well as industry standard tools like PyTorch that we've developed. \r\nAnd this approach to open source has unlocked a lot of innovation across the industry, and it's something that we believe in deeply. And I know that some people have questions about how we benefit from open sourcing, the results of our research and large amounts of compute. So I thought it might be useful to lay out the strategic benefits here. \r\nThe short version is that open sourcing improves our models. And because there's still significant work to turn our models into products because there will be other open-source models available anyway, we find that there are mostly advantages to being the open-source leader, and it doesn't remove differentiation for our products much anyway. And more specifically, there are several strategic benefits. \r\nFirst, open-source software is typically safer and more secure as well as more compute-efficient to operate due to all the ongoing feedback, scrutiny and development from the community. Now this is a big deal because safety is one of the most important issues in AI. Efficiency improvements and lowering the compute costs also benefit everyone, including us. \r\nSecond, open-source software often becomes an industry standard. And when companies standardize on building with our stack, that then becomes easier to integrate new innovations into our products. That's subtle, but the ability to learn and improve quickly is a huge advantage. And being an industry standard enables that. \r\nThird, open source is hugely popular with developers and researchers. And we know that people want to work on open systems that will be widely adopted. So this helps us recruit the best people at Meta, which is a very big deal for leading in any new technology area. And again, we typically have unique data and build unique product integrations anyway, so providing infrastructure like Llama as open source doesn't reduce our main advantage. This is why our long-standing strategy has been to open source general infrastructure and why I expect it to continue to be the right approach for us going forward. \r\nThe next part of our playbook is just taking a long-term approach towards the development. While we're working on today's products and models, we're also working on the research that we need to advance for Llama 5, 6 and 7 in the coming years and beyond to develop full general intelligence. It's important to have a portfolio of multiyear investments in research projects, but it's also important to have clear launch vehicles like future Llama models that help focus our work. \r\nWe've worked on general intelligence in our lab, FAIR, for more than a decade, as I mentioned, and we produced a lot of valuable work. But having clear product targets for delivering general intelligence really focuses this work and helps us build the leading research program. \r\nNow the next key part of our playbook is learning from unique data and feedback loops in our products. When people think about data, they typically think about the corpus that you might use to train a model upfront. And on Facebook and Instagram, there are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set. And people share large numbers of public text posts and comments across our services as well. \r\nBut even more important in the upfront training corpus is the ability to establish the right feedback loops with hundreds of millions of people interacting with AI services across our products. And this feedback is a big part of how we've improved our AI systems so quickly with Reels and Ads, especially over the last couple of years when we had to re-architect it around new rules. \r\nNow that brings me to the last part of our playbook for building leading services, which is our culture of rapid learning and experimentation across our apps. When we decide that a new technology, like AI-recommended Reels, is going to be an important part of the future, we're not shy about having multiple teams experimenting with different versions across our apps until we get it right. And then we learn what works and we roll it out to everyone. \r\nAnd there used to be this meme that we'd probably launch Stories on our Settings page at some point. And look, I think it's kind of funny because it gets to a core part of our approach. We start by learning and tuning our products until they perform the way we want, and then we roll them out very broadly. \r\nAnd sometimes, occasionally, products will blow up before we're ready for them to, like Threads, although I'll note that Threads now has more people actively using it today than it did during its initial launch peak. So that one is, I think, on track to be a major success. \r\nBut normally, we learn and we iterate methodically. And we started doing that with our AI services in the fall launching Meta AI, our assistant; AI Studio, which the precursor to Creator AIs; our Alpha with Business AIs; and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses. And we've been tuning each of these, and we're getting closer to rolling them out more widely. So you should expect that in the coming months. \r\nFrom there, we'll focus on rolling out services until they reach hundreds of millions or billions of people. And usually, only when we reach that kind of scale do we start focusing on what monetization will look like. And although in this case, the way the business AIs will help business messaging grow and WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram is pretty clear. But that's our basic approach, and I'm really excited about pointing our company at developing so many of these awesome things. \r\nNow we have 2 major parts of our long-term vision, and in addition to AI, the other part is the metaverse. We've invested heavily in both AI and the metaverse for a long time, and we will continue to do so. These days, there are a lot of questions more about AI that I get, and that field is moving very quickly. But I still expect that this next generation of AR, VR and MR computing platforms to deliver a realistic sense of presence that will be the foundation for the future of social experiences and almost every other category of experiences as well. \r\nReality Labs crossed $1 billion in revenue in Q4 for the first time with Quest having a strong holiday season. Quest 3 is off to a strong start, and I expect it to continue to be the most popular mixed reality device. With Quest 3 and Quest 2 both performing well, we saw that the Quest app was actually the most downloaded app in the App Store on Christmas Day. I want to give a shout-out to Asgard's Wrath2, which was developed by one of our in-house studios and received IGN's 10 out of 10 masterpiece rating, making it one of the best-rated games out there, not just in VR, but of any game on any platform ever. \r\nSo it's a really good sign that we're able to deliver that quality of work at Meta. Horizon is growing quickly, too. It is now on Top 10 Most Used Apps on Quest, and we have an exciting road map ahead. This is another example of applying the long-term playbook that I discussed earlier with AI but in another area. We take the time to build up the core technology and tune the experience. And then when it's ready, we're good at growing things. Now our focus for this year is going to be on growing the mobile version of Horizon as well as the VR One. \r\nRay-Ban Meta smart glasses are also off to a very strong start, both in sales and engagement. Our partner, EssilorLuxottica is already planning on making more than we both expected due to high demand. Engagement and retention are also significantly higher than the first version of the glasses. The experience is just a lot better with Meta AI in there as well as there's a higher resolution camera, better audio and more. And we also have an exciting road map of software improvements ahead, starting with rolling out multimodal AI and then some other really exciting new AI features later in the year. \r\nI said this before, but I think that people are going to want new categories of devices that seamlessly engage with AIs frequently throughout the AI without having to take out your phone and press a button and point it at what you want to see. And I think that smart glasses are going to be a compelling form factor for this, and it's a good example of how our AI and metaverse visions are connected. \r\nIn addition to AI in the metaverse, we're continuing to improve our Apps and Ads businesses as well. Reels and our discovery engine remain a priority and major driver of engagement, and Messaging continues to be our focus for building the next revenue pillar of our business before our longer-term work reaches scale. But since I went a bit longer in the other areas today, I'm just going to mention a few highlights here. \r\nReels continues to do very well across both Instagram and Facebook. People re-share Reels 3.5 billion times every day. Reels is now contributing to our net revenue across our apps. The biggest opportunity going forward is unifying our recommendation systems across Reels and other types of video that will help people discover the best content across our systems no matter what format it's in. \r\nWhatsApp is also doing very well. And the most exciting new trend here is that it is succeeding more broadly in the United States, where there's a real appetite for a private, secure and cross-platform messaging app that everyone can use. And given the strategic importance of the U.S. and its outsized importance for revenue, this is just a huge opportunity. \r\nThreads is also growing steadily with more than 130 million monthly actives. And I'm optimistic that we can keep the pace of improvements in growth going and show that a friendly, discussion-oriented app can be as widely used as the most popular social apps. \r\nAll right. That's what I wanted to cover today. Our communities are growing, and our business is back on track. Once again, a big thank you to all of our employees, partners, shareholders and everyone in our community for sticking with us and for making 2023 such a success. I'm looking forward to another exciting year ahead. \r\nAnd now here's Susan.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThanks, Mark, and good afternoon, everyone. Let's begin with our consolidated results. All comparisons are on a year-over-year basis, unless otherwise noted. Q4 total revenue was $40.1 billion, up 25% or 22% on a constant currency basis. Q4 total expenses were $23.7 billion, down 8% compared to last year. \r\nIn terms of the specific line items, cost of revenue decreased 8%, 0driven mainly by lower restructuring costs that were partially offset by higher infrastructure-related costs. R&D increased 8% driven primarily by higher head count-related costs from Family of Apps and Reality Labs as well as higher non-head count-related Reality Labs operating expenses, which were partially offset by lower restructuring costs. \r\nMarketing and sales decreased 29% due mainly to lower marketing spend and restructuring costs. G&A decreased 26% due mainly to lower restructuring expenses. We ended the fourth quarter with over 67,300 employees, down 22% from a year ago while up 2% from Q3 as our hiring efforts have resumed. Fourth quarter operating income was $16.4 billion, representing a 41% operating margin. Our tax rate for the quarter was 17%. \r\nNet income was $14 billion or $5.33 per share. Capital expenditures, including principal payments on finance leases, were $7.9 billion, driven by investments in servers, data centers and network infrastructure. Free cash flow was $11.5 billion, which reflects a $1.6 billion payment of income taxes deferred from prior quarters of 2023. We ended the year with $65.4 billion in cash and marketable securities and $18.4 billion in debt. \r\nIn the fourth quarter, we repurchased $6.3 billion of our Class A stock, bringing our total share repurchases for the full year to $20 billion. We had $30.9 billion remaining on our prior authorization as of December 31. And today, we announced a $50 billion increase in our stock repurchase authorization. \r\nMoving now to our segment results. I'll begin with our Family of Apps segment. In Q4, we saw continued community growth across the Family of Apps as well as Facebook, specifically. We're sharing today that as previewed when we first introduced our family metrics, we are transitioning away from reporting Facebook-specific metrics. \r\nAs part of this transition, we will no longer report Facebook daily and monthly active users or family monthly active people. In Q1, we will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level while continuing to report family daily active people. \r\nFor full year 2023, Family of Apps total revenue was $133 billion and ad revenue was $131.9 billion, each up 16% year-over-year. The largest contributors to year-over-year ad revenue growth were the online commerce, CPG, entertainment and media and gaming verticals. The online commerce and gaming verticals benefited from strong demand by advertisers in China reaching people in other markets. In 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of our overall revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth. \r\nTurning back to Q4 results. Q4 total Family of Apps revenue was $39 billion, up 24% year-over-year. Q4 Family of Apps ad revenue was $38.7 billion, up 24% or 21% on a constant currency basis. Within ad revenue, the online commerce vertical was the largest contributor to year-over-year growth, followed by CPG and gaming. \r\nOn a user geography basis, ad revenue growth was strongest in Europe and Rest of World at 33% and 32%, respectively, followed by Asia Pacific at 23% and North America at 19%. Foreign currency was a tailwind to advertising revenue growth in all international regions. \r\nIn Q4, the total number of ad impressions served across our services increased 21%, and the average price per ad increased 2%. Impression growth was mainly driven by Asia Pacific and Rest of World. Pricing growth was driven by advertiser demand and currency tailwinds, which were partially offset by strong impression growth, particularly from lower-monetizing services and regions. \r\nFamily of Apps other revenue was $334 million in Q4, up 82%, driven by business messaging revenue growth from our WhatsApp Business platform. We continue to direct the majority of our investments toward the development and operation of our Family of Apps. In Q4, Family of Apps expenses were $18 billion, representing approximately 76% of our overall expenses. Family of Apps expenses were down 13% due to lower restructuring expenses. Family of Apps operating income was $21 billion, representing a 54% operating margin. \r\nWithin our Reality Labs segment, Q4 revenue was $1.1 billion, up 47%, driven by Quest 3 sales during the holiday season. Reality Labs expenses were $5.7 billion, up 14% year-over-year due primarily to higher head count-related expenses and non-head count-related R&D spend. Reality Labs operating loss was $4.6 billion. \r\nTurning now to the business outlook. There are 2 primary factors that drive our revenue performance: our ability to deliver engaging experiences for our community and our effectiveness at monetizing that engagement over time. On the first, we remain pleased with engagement trends and have strong momentum across our product priorities. We're seeing sustained growth in Reels and Video overall as daily watch time across all video types grew over 25% year-over-year in Q4, driven by ongoing ranking improvements. \r\nIn-feed recommendations of posts from accounts you're not connected to also continue to drive incremental engagement as we increasingly personalize recommendations, and we expect to deliver further improvements this year. On Instagram, we're making strong progress increasing the freshness of recommended content. And a big focus for Facebook this year will be unifying our video experiences and ranking across the app, which should create a more seamless user experience and deliver increasingly relevant video recommendations. \r\nOn WhatsApp, community growth remains strong, and we're seeing good traction with our Channels product, which has quickly scaled to over 500 million monthly active users since we rolled it out globally in September. We are also making good progress in areas that have the potential to grow people's engagement with our products in the longer term, such as Threads and generative AI. \r\nOn Threads, we're coming into 2024 with strong product momentum and remain focused on introducing additional valuable features and further scaling the community this year. With generative AI, we fully rolled out our Meta AI assistant and other AI chat experiences in the U.S. at the end of the year and began testing more than 20 GenAI features across our Family of Apps. \r\nOur big areas of focus in 2024 will be working towards the launch of Llama 3, expanding the usefulness of our Meta AI assistant and progressing on our AI Studio road map to make it easier for anyone to create an AI. For the experiences in our apps, we'll follow our typical approach of making them great before we lean into growth and eventually monetization. But this continues to be an exciting area that has the potential to transform how people engage on our services in the years ahead. \r\nNow to the second driver of our revenue performance, increasing monetization efficiency. There are 2 parts to this work. The first part is growing the level of ad inventory within organic engagement. Our approach to optimizing ad levels in our apps has become increasingly sophisticated over the years as we've developed a better understanding of the optimal place, time and person to show an ad, which has enabled us to adopt a more dynamic approach to serving apps. We expect to continue that work going forward, while services with relatively lower levels of monetization like video and messaging will serve as additional growth opportunities. \r\nThe other part to increasing monetization efficiency is improving marketing performance. To do this, we're focused on 3 areas. The first is AI. We continue to leverage AI across our ad systems and product suite. We're delivering continued performance gains from ranking improvements as we adopt larger and more advanced models, and this will remain an ongoing area of investment in 2024. \r\nWe're also building out our Advantage+ portfolio of solutions to help advertisers leverage AI to automate their advertising campaigns. Advertisers can choose to automate part of the campaign creation setup process, such as who to show their ad to with Advantage+ audience, or they can automate their campaign completely using Advantage+ shopping, which continues to see strong growth. We're also now exploring ways to apply this end-to-end automation to new objectives. \r\nOn the ads creative side, we completed the global rollout of 2 of our generative AI features in Q4, Text Variations and Image Expansion, and plan to broaden availability of our background generation feature later in Q1. Initial adoption of these features has been strong, and tests are showing promising early performance gains. This will remain a big area of focus for us in 2024. \r\nThe second area of our work is helping businesses connect their marketing data and measure results. Here, we're continuing to invest in conversions API to make it easier for advertisers to not only adopt but maximize its impact. The last area is investing in new and engaging on-platform ad experiences. \r\nBusiness messaging remains a priority here. Click-to-message ads continue to grow, and we're seeing advertisers increasingly use these ads to drive down funnel conversions. Paid messaging is growing quickly, and we are focused on broadening adoption in 2024 by making it easier for businesses to buy marketing messages and more easily adopt our Flows product to develop richer in-Thread experiences for consumers. \r\nWe're also progressing with our early testing on WhatsApp and Messenger of AIs for businesses that can provide conversational support in chat. We'll take our time to get these experiences right, but we think this will be a compelling opportunity that we're well positioned to deliver on. Outside of business messaging, we're making strong progress with our shops' ads products, which crossed a $2 billion annual run rate in Q4. \r\nNext, I would like to discuss our approach to capital allocation. We are in the fortunate position of being able to invest in many organic opportunities to improve the performance of our core business in the near term while also making 2 significant longer-time horizon investments in AI and Reality Labs. \r\nAI is a growing area of investment for us in 2024 as we hire to support our road map. We are also investing more in our AI infrastructure capacity this year. And given many of our ambitious forward-looking plans will rely on having sufficient compute capacity, we expect this to be an area we invest more aggressively in over the coming years. Reality Labs is the other long-term initiative we continue to invest heavily in as we progress on our efforts to develop the next computing platform. \r\nAside from organic investments, returning capital to shareholders remains important to us. We believe our strong financial position and performance will enable us to invest in the business while also continuing to return capital to investors over time. We've historically done so through share repurchases. And while we expect to maintain an active share repurchase program, we are modestly evolving our approach going forward by returning a portion of capital through a regular dividend subject to quarterly Board approval. \r\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the FTC is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful, it would have an adverse impact on our business. \r\nTurning now to the revenue outlook. We expect first quarter 2024 total revenue to be in the range of $34.5 billion to $37 billion. Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth based on current exchange rates. \r\nTurning now to the expense outlook. We expect full year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94 billion to $99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024. \r\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint. \r\nSecond, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles. Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in AR/VR and our investments to further scale our ecosystem. \r\nTurning now to the CapEx outlook. We anticipate our full year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30 billion to $37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. \r\nOur updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our AI capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year. \r\nOn to tax. Absent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens. In closing, this was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities and improved advertising performance for businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our priorities in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs. \r\nWith that, Krista, let's open up the call for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) And your first question comes from the line of Brian Nowak from Morgan Stanley.\n\nBrian Thomas Nowak\n\nI have 2. I appreciate, Mark, the color about sort of the learnings and the data feedback loop. Let me ask you one about sort of the advertising business and all of the new machine learning and new GenAI ad tools that you built and rolled out the last year or so. Can you just talk about some of the largest areas of improvement your advertisers say is really driving this inflection of advertising? And what are the areas where you still get the most feedback on for further areas of improvement in the ad business that we should think about?\r\nAnd then, Susan, maybe, one, the first quarter guide, specifically on the acceleration implied. Anything on -- more color on which surfaces or ad units or regions are sort of giving you confidence in that type of acceleration at this point in the quarter?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThank you, Brian. I can take both of those. On your first question, what is driving strength in the Ads business, we certainly believe that we've been continuing to drive ad performance improvements and year-over-year conversion growth remains strong. And we see this reflected in the feedback that we hear from advertisers also.\r\nThere are really 3 areas of our work here that we're very focused on and have been and will continue to be in 2024. First, just creating engaging on-platform ad experiences. We see that with formats like click-to-message ads, where we continue to see good momentum. Shops ads, we talked about the $2 billion annual run rate in Q4 after we just opened availability to all U.S. advertisers in Q2. Lead generation ads, another example. So we're really focused on creating engaging on-platform ad experiences.\r\nSecond, we're really making it easier for advertisers to connect with their marketing data. We're continuing to invest in features like conversions API, like AEM and making these features easier to adopt, enhancing reporting and other performance. And we've seen, again, that those are -- we get very positive feedback on advertisers who use those tools.\r\nAnd then finally, continuing to really use AI in important ways across our ads platform. For a long time, we have invested in building larger and more advanced models that have resulted in more Accurate predictions of relevant ads for people and improved performance for advertisers.\r\nAnd then, of course, we're investing a lot in AI-powered tools and products. So we're really scaling our Advantage+ suites across all of the different offerings there, which really helped to automate the ads creation process for different types of advertisers. And we're getting very strong feedback on all of those different features, advantage+ Shopping, obviously, being the first, but Advantage+ Catalog, Advantage+ Creative, Advantage+ Audiences, et cetera. So we feel like these are all really important parts of what has continued to grow improvements in our Ads business and will continue to going forward.\r\nOn your second question, which is about the Q1 year-over-year -- sorry, the Q1 revenue guide. This really just reflects a lot of the trends we saw in Q4, which is strong, broad-based advertising demand across verticals, particularly within online commerce and gaming. I'll also note that we get the benefit from having February 29 in this quarter. And again, just the improvements that we continue to accrue to the business from all of our investments in improving ad performance over time.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Eric Sheridan from Goldman Sachs.\n\nEric James Sheridan\n\nMaybe 2 questions, if I can. Mark, coming out of a year like you had with the year of efficiency, what do you see as the key messages you want to share with investors about what you learned during the year of efficiency and how it might inform running an organization with the scale of ambition and just your organizational scale that Meta has on a long-term basis? That would be number one.\r\nAnd then Susan, I went back and looked, I don't think you've ever raised the high end of your CapEx guidance before, unless I'm mistaken. But with a wide range like that in CapEx, what should we be monitoring for what would push you towards either the lower end or the higher end of that CapEx guidance as you move through 2024?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nI'll take the first one. So the themes for the year of efficiency were to make us a stronger technology company by becoming leaner and more balanced towards our engineering work and more streamlined and to improve our financial performance, primarily with the goal of providing stability so we can invest in these long-term, ambitious visions around AI and metaverse over what we see as the coming decade or more as these things play out.\r\nAnd I think a lot of people looked at what we were doing as if it might have been some kind of short-term thing, which that's never really our focus. But the part about making the company leaner, I think, is the more important part to take forward, right? Because obviously, we're in a place now where the business is performing well. And I think the obvious question would be, okay, well, given that, should we just -- should we invest a lot more in things?\r\nAnd the biggest thing that's holding me back from doing that is that at this point, I feel like I've really come around to thinking that we operate better as a leaner company. So even though it's always -- there's always questions about like adding a few people here or there to do something. And I guess I just have more of an appreciation about how all of that adds up and in the near term, maybe makes you go a little bit faster. But over the long term, the discipline to kind of hold things to a more streamlined level actually improves the overall company performance. So I'm really focused on that.\r\nIn 2024, we do have a big recruiting backlog from last year because part of the layoffs that we did included teams basically swapping out certain talent profiles for others. And we still need to hire some of the other talent profiles that we swapped people out for, and that will be ongoing through this year. But in terms of new head count that we added to the plan, it's relatively minimal compared to what we would have done historically. \r\nAnd I sort of expect that for the next period of time going forward, Even beyond 2024. My operating assumption is that we will also try to keep it relatively minimal because I think that -- until we reach a point where we're just really underwater on our ability to execute, I kind of want to keep things lean because I think that's the right thing for us to do culturally. So that's kind of the best window into how I'm thinking about this.\r\nThe other piece that, I guess, somewhat dovetails into what Susan is going to talk to you next is that a big part of why I wanted to improve our profitability is to give ourselves the ability to go through what is a somewhat unpredictable and volatile period over the next 5 or 10 years. There are different risk factors that are geopolitical or regulatory or different things, but also the technology landscape is somewhat unknown. And we want the ability to be able to surge investment on things like building out larger training clusters or just making different investments where that's necessary.\r\nAnd in order to make sure that we have the flexibility to do that, we want to make sure that we keep our cost structure to a point where we sort of have some extra space built in. So those are really the 2 points. That was the theme that I laid out at the beginning of the year of efficiency last year: make us a stronger technology company and give us the flexibility and stability to execute the long-term goals. And those remain, I think, the big focuses going forward on that.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nAnd I can take the second question, Eric. So we're really continuing to evolve our AI road maps and ambitions and our understanding of the capacity demands that we might have as we train next generations of foundation models and to support all of the associated product development going forward. So the increase in the top end of the range really reflects that evolving understanding of how much demand we may need. And we're also continuing to keep a close eye on supply availability.\r\nWhere we land in that range is a function of both the supply and demand factors I mentioned. And this continues to be a pretty dynamic planning process for us. And there are also certainly other factors that drive uncertainty. How quickly can we execute on the new data center architecture? How the supply chain turns out to unfold over the course of the year? But our expectation is, generally, that we will need to invest more to support our AI work in the years ahead, and we're seeing some of that reflected in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Mark Shmulik from AllianceBernstein.\n\nMark Elliott Shmulik\n\nMark, you mentioned at the top of the call this vision, kind of everyone having a Meta AI assistant to kind of get things done. Previously, when we were talking about the metaverse from a time horizon perspective, we were looking at a decade to kind of get there. But given kind of the pace of innovation around AI that you've seen, has that time line changed? And like do you think we'll get there quicker?\r\nAnd then second question for Susan. Just quickly on shop ad. I appreciate the color. Obviously, we've had the Amazon partnership news intra-quarter. We know Meta has made a few attempts that are getting kind of more integrated into shopping over the last few years. Can you hear some of the learnings and, I guess, what's different this time around?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nSure. I can take the first one. I do think that AI is going to make all of the products and services that we use and make better. So it's hard to know exactly how that will play out. But for the work in Reality Labs, specifically, there's a bunch of areas. Like if you take smart glasses, before, we thought that we would have to build like full displays and holograms and deliver the sense of presence before that became a mainstream product. \r\nAnd now it seems quite possible that smart glasses that have AI assistance built in will be the killer app, and that the holograms and sense of presence will come later as a -- maybe on the same time horizon we were talking about before but could end up being just as important as we expected. But there could be a big market here even before that. So I think we'll figure that out over the next few years. But yes, I mean, overall, I think the 2 go together pretty hand-in-hand. I would have predicted that a lot of the parts of Reality Labs -- I guess the sequence in technology is sometimes surprising. \r\nWe always kind of expected that as part of building glasses or any of these platforms that having an AI assistant would be a foundational part of it. But the fact that that's -- that there have just been big strides in that over the last year or 2 is just -- is a big opportunity for these products sooner. So I think it's still unknown exactly how that will play out, but I think we'll know more over the next few years. It's very exciting, though.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nAnd Mark, I can take the second question. So first of all, online commerce continues to be one of our strongest verticals overall. And a lot of the work that we do to improve ads performance generally really helps do things like grow conversions year-over-year, improves the performance of direct response ads. We've invested a lot in the Advantage+ set of tools, tools like Advantage+ Shopping. So I would say that our offerings for e-commerce advertisers overall are very strong, and we continue to invest in making them better and more performant.\r\nOn Shops ads, specifically, this is an area where we are really, I would say, focusing on introducing improvements that continue to make it easier for businesses to onboard 2 shops. So for example, eligible Shopify businesses can now onboard to Shops on Facebook and Instagram very seamlessly. And we're making it easier for advertisers to turn their existing ads into Shops ads. And we'll continue to focus on deepening integrations with partners and leveraging AI to make Shops ads even more performant.\r\nYou mentioned the Amazon ads pilot, and that's a place where we're partnering with Amazon to make Buy with Prime, to create a more seamless shopping experience on Facebook and Instagram so that it's easier for people to purchase directly from an Amazon ad. This is really early, and we're testing this experience with them. But it's another avenue for us to explore how can we make these shopping experience easier for folks on our platform.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Justin Post from Bank of America.\n\nJustin Post\n\nI was wondering if you could help us think about the messaging run rate for revenues and maybe the long-term opportunity and how you think about that going forward on a multiyear basis. And then secondly, the guidance for Q1 suggests stable growth at the midpoint despite comps getting tougher. So I'm wondering if you could help us at all think about -- the comps get increasingly tougher as we go through the year, how you're thinking about those comps and how you could grow in the second half.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nThanks, Justin. I can take both of those. So on your first question about messaging monetization, right now, the 2 primary avenues that we have there are click-to-messaging ads and paid messaging, which we are investing a lot in both to facilitate the full cycle of customer engagement. We saw that revenue growth from click-to-message ads remained strong in Q4. We see broadening advertiser adoption. And there, I would say that our focus in terms of where we're investing is really around enhanced optimization and reporting. So we're really trying to drive down funnel performance, enabling businesses to optimize for purchase. \r\nAnd we've seen strong growth in purchase optimization revenue on click-to-Messenger ads since we've rolled that out. And we're planning to bring purchase optimization to click-to-WhatsApp campaigns this year.\r\nAnd across the click-to-messaging ads, we're introducing more robust reporting to help advertisers kind of understand how people are engaging with them via click-to-messaging ads and what is the value of that engagement. And then, of course, in the longer term, this is a place where we're excited about the opportunities for increased automation to really help businesses scale their ability to have conversations with their consumers.\r\nOn the paid messaging side, this is much earlier, of course, but we're seeing good momentum, driven by particularly strong growth from marketing messages. And we've also seen good results from our updated pricing model that we introduced in June. And here, we're really focused on making paid messaging easier to buy. So we're now testing the ability for businesses to send paid messaging directly on Meta Ads Manager.\r\nAnd then, again, similar to click-to-messaging, we are investing in ways to make it easier to get more done within the app. So here, we launched Flows globally in October, which enables businesses to offer richer user experiences within WhatsApp, things like selecting a seat on a flight or booking an appointment. We're seeing good early traction, and we're focused on just introducing more ways to help businesses easily create flows, and we'll plan on introducing more capabilities here. So there's a lot, I would say, going on in the portfolio of messaging monetization work that we're doing.\r\nNow your second question was around the 2024 outlook. And we obviously have not shared any guidance beyond Q1. But our revenue for the full year is going to be influenced by a number of factors, including macro conditions that are certainly harder to predict the further out you go. And over the course of 2024, as you said, we'll also be lapping periods of increasingly strong demand. So we don't provide guidance beyond Q1. There's certainly a range of outcomes, and we'll have a better read on how we will compare to future quarters as we progress through the year.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Doug Anmuth from JPMorgan.\n\nDouglas Till Anmuth\n\nOne for Mark, one for Susan. Mark, I believe you'd shifted FAIR out of Reality Labs into the Family of Apps. Can you just talk about some of the benefits there of moving that group as you pursue general intelligence? And then Susan, can you just walk us through your thought process on adding a dividend to your capital returns at this stage beyond the share repurchases?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nI can talk to the first one. Yes, the whole reason why we moved FAIR is basically to be closer to the GenAI group. They're both research groups. The GenAI group basically builds our Llama launch vehicles and products, but also conducts a fair amount of research, too, especially things that are going to be coming into the upcoming versions of Llama. FAIR is focused on more foundational work and longer-term work. So it's, I'd say, more things that might be a couple of years out to 10-plus years out. And as we -- I guess, here's one way to think about it. \r\nA lot of last year and the work that we're doing with Llama 3 is basically making sure that we can scale our efforts to really produce state-of-the-art models. But once we get past that, there's a lot more kind of different research that I think we're going to be doing that's going to take our foundation models in potentially different directions than other players in the industry are going to go in because we're focused on specific vision for what we're building.\r\nSo it's really important as we think about what's going to be in Llama 5 or 6 or 7 and what cognitive abilities we want in there and what modalities we want to build into future multimodal versions of the models. We need to be doing that work in advance and to research those things. And it helps to -- and even though FAIR and GenAI will continue to be 2 kind of separate groups on different time horizons. \r\nI think to have some level of alignment between -- on the vision of what we're building between the 2 of them, so that way, the FAIR team can have in mind, hey, if we research this, then maybe it can intercept Llama 6 or something. Then that, I think, is just going to be more helpful for increasing the ambition and focus of all of the work that we do.\r\nIt's one of the reasons that I talked about. We did open-ended research on AI for a while. But having a clear product target with these AI agents, I think, is really going to help focus the work and give us a feedback loop that's going to increase the productivity and output that we get dramatically.\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nDoug, on your second question about why now in terms of initiating a dividend, returning capital to shareholders remains an important priority for us. And we believe introducing a dividend really just serves as a nice complement to the existing share repurchase program. The dividend doesn't change how much we will be -- or it doesn't change the way we determine the total amount of capital we return. And we expect that share repurchases will continue to be the primary way that we return capital to shareholders. But introducing a dividend just gives us a more balanced capital return program and some added flexibility in how we return capital in the future.\n\nOperator\n\nYour next question comes from the line of Ron Josey from Citi.\n\nRonald Victor Josey\n\nMark, I hope your knee is getting better. I wanted to ask you about Apple opening up its App Store in Europe and maybe what role that might play for Meta in further building out the App Store app install ads and things along those lines. And Susan, as a follow-up to maybe a prior question, you mentioned the potential around business messaging and the team -- what the team is doing around really testing with WhatsApp and Messenger. Just talk just how you might see this unfold maybe with AI Studio and maybe timing would be helpful.\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nI don't think that the Apple thing is going to have any difference for us because I think that the way that they've implemented it, I would be very surprised if any developer chose to go into the alternative App Stores that they have. They've made it so onerous, and I think so at odds with the intent of what the EU regulation was that I think it's just going to be very difficult for anyone, including ourselves, to really seriously entertain what they're doing there.\r\nSusan, did you want to add anything?\n\nSusan J. S. Li\n\nNo. I was going to take the second question, I think, which was around the rollout of some of the GenAI features from a monetization perspective. And we're -- first of all, I would say that we don't expect our GenAI products to be a meaningful 2024 driver of revenue. But we certainly expect that they will have the potential to be meaningful contributors over time.\r\nRight now, the most near-term monetization opportunity is with our ad creative tools. We've talked about some of the places that we've been rolling those features out broadly with Text Variations and Image Expansion now globally available. And we're seeing those tools receive adoption and provide real value for advertisers even at this early stage. And we're going to keep investing in making those more useful and performant, which then leads to more advertiser adoption, and that can be sort of a virtuous feedback loop.\r\nOver a longer time frame, the GenAI features that we're bringing to business messaging, which I think was where your question originated, we think really represents a compelling opportunity. We're testing AI chats on a very small scale today with a few businesses, but it will take time to continue making those AIs increasingly useful. We're hearing good feedback from the businesses testing them, and we expect to make progress this year as we expand our tests further.\r\nI'd say one other thing is just on the consumer side, again, we think GenAI can make it easier for people to produce compelling content across all of our apps, including our messaging apps. And our AI assistant certainly provides also added utilities. So in all of these areas, I would say, we're following our typical playbook of testing and tuning the experiences until they're very good, and then we'll invest in growth and eventually explore monetization.\n\nOperator\n\nYour last question comes from the line of Ross Sandler from Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nMark, just curious what you're seeing with Meta AI at this stage. You talked about rapid iteration of that, given your large audience. So yes, I guess, what's going on, thus far? Which of the apps in the Family of Apps have seen engagement increase from Meta AI? And do you think that there could be increased commercial activity as either your AI agent or some of the other ones out there get more usage within your apps?\n\nMark Elliot Zuckerberg\n\nYes. I think having a good assistant is going to be one of the real values that this generation of AI creates as well as giving every creator an opportunity to have an assistant or agent that people can engage with and every business and agent and also allowing people to create a bunch of quirky and fun things as well. But yes, I think Meta AI is going to be very important across the product.\r\nIt currently is available in some countries in WhatsApp, Messenger and Instagram. It's at the phase where we're not really pushing it super proactively. We've sort of made it available, and as people use it, we're learning from how -- what are the basic ways that people want to engage with it. We're currently in the tuning phase on this. I mean, we started rolling this out, I think, it was in November or so, maybe October. \r\nAnd I would expect that, over the course of this year, we are going to start rolling this out much more prominently across our apps. And that was sort of what I was saying in my opening remarks about the analogy to Stories, where we ran a bunch of experiments, put it out there, got feedback and then eventually did a lot of integrations, even to the point where people were making jokes about us putting Stories in settings, which, for the record, never happened, but I found funny.\r\nSo I think that we're going to be on that journey this year. We're basically in the learning and tuning phase now. I'm happy with how that's going. We're currently working on and planning the next set of integrations and places where this is going to be available to people across the products, and I'm really looking forward to that. And I think that's going to be one of the big themes for '24 for us.\n\nKenneth J. Dorell\n\nGreat. Thank you for joining us today. We appreciate your time, and we look forward to speaking with you again soon.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes today's conference call. Thank you for your participation, and you may now disconnect.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe years of cost efficiency being enough are over and investors showered by gains from Big Tech are looking for more.\n\nPrimed by towering expectations of an AI-fueled transformation and narratives of relentless growth, the market is applying the same cutthroat logic of more with less.\n\nBut instead of executives touting their efficiency to eke through tough quarters, it’s shareholders applying the pressure for perfection.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were on the receiving end of the squeeze this week. The pair surpassed analyst expectations but investors fixated on the perceived weak points, collectively pining for outstanding results to justify holding expensive stocks.\n\nBut the areas that appeared softer — ad revenue and cloud growth — only seemed squishy when investors applied a harsh rubric to the trillion-dollar giants. It's not enough for results to flirt with forecasted figures, or beat them. Only a smashing success can fully satiate Big Tech shareholders.\n\nMeta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) delivered the goods on Thursday, offering strong outlooks for the months ahead, and in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's case, introducing a sweetener: a new dividend. Investors rejoiced.\n\nThe forking paths of Big Tech's siblings this week highlight the unforgiving judgment of investors accustomed to abundance. Doing merely great isn't going to cut it.\n\nAs analyst Dan Ives said, following what he saw as a successful Microsoft report, the quarter \"should be printed out and hung in the Louvre.\" A view of the scene after activists hurled soup at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. This is also how investors reacted to Microsoft's quarter. (Clement Lanot/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut investors figuratively opted to skip the exhibit, highlighting the mismatch between inflated desire and what booming enterprises can deliver.\n\nInvestors expressed other financial qualms among otherwise thriving businesses. The grand pitch that executives are selling about AI’s transformative power apparently also comes with some fine print in the form of heavy up-front investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet reported capital expenditures that ballooned 45% for the quarter, exceeding $11 billion. Microsoft too recorded a 55% increase in capex. The boosted spending in Alphabet’s case was tied mostly to servers and data centers, the company said, as it prepares for the long-term growth potential of global AI applications.\n\nAnd there’s more where that came from. CFO Ruth Porat said that investment in capex will be noticeably larger in 2024. The tech, just like popular excitement, can be a challenge to prop up.\n\nEven purchasing the fuel to drive the dream of AI dominance can count against you.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(Guy Bell)\n\nEuropean markets were higher in early trade on Friday, with mood buoyed by surging tech stocks in the US. The rises also follow a cluster of central bank interest rate decisions earlier in the week, where both the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England opted to keep rates on hold.\n\nThe FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.3% in early trade with European indexes such as the Dax (^GDAXI) and CAC (^FCHI) also buoyed on Friday following a raft of tech earnings in the US. The pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) opened 0.4% higher. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) is among tech giants that reported quarterly results on Thursday. Its stock is up more than 15% in premarket trade after it announced its first dividend. The company outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1bn in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share.\n\nFollow along for live updates:\n\nLive3 updates\n\nFri, 2 February 2024 at 3:31 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nUS stocks on Thursday\n\nWith earnings season in full sing, US indexes were reaping the benefits of the optimistic tone. The S&P 500 (^GSPC) and Nasdaq (^IXIC) closed 1.3% higher, and the Dow (^DJI) was up 1%.\n\nThe Dow's ascent represented a fresh high, erasing losses from a day earlier when markets were jittery about the prospect of prolonged high rates following remarks from the Fed.\n\nOn Thursday Meta, Amazon and Apple reported results, following other megacap stocks such as Microsoft earlier in the week (more on those earnings later).\n\nToday, markets are looking to the jobs report as a measure of the overall health of the economy. Fri, 2 February 2024 at 3:23 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nOvernight in Asia\n\nStocks were broadly down in Asia overnight with Chinese stocks weighed down by the prospect of further legislation from the US targeting Chinese biotech firms. WuXi Biologics and WuXi Apptec fell around 20% as the story played out.\n\nOver in Hong Kong the Hang Seng (^HSI) finished 0.3% lower, while the SSE Composite (000001.SS) was 1.5% lower by the end of the day.\n\nThe Nikkei (^N225) remained on the up, closing out the day 0.4% higher, buoyed by late tech earnings in the US. Fri, 2 February 2024 at 3:11 am GMT-5\n\nLucy Harley-McKeown\n\nGood morning from London!\n\nGood morning, Lucy Harley-McKeown here, rounding the week off with a final live blog after a big week of central bank decisions and tech earnings.

        "title": "Perion Stock (NASDAQ:PERI): This AdTech Company Thrived While Others Struggled",
        "content": "Advertising stocks have been recovering. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock has soared over the past year, with big rebounds in revenue and earnings growth. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) rebounded nicely, too. Still, both firms lost market share in 2022 and had multiple quarters that featured net income declines. META also reported revenue declines in 2022. However, one AdTech company, Perion (NASDAQ:PERI), thrived while others struggled back in 2022. The company is still growing now, which has prompted me to take a bullish stance on this stock.\n\nThis “stock to watch” even achieved double-digit revenue growth in 2023 while getting close to a 20% net profit margin.\n\nHigh Growth, Low Valuation, and Zero Debt\n\nPerion is a small-cap stock that offers a rare combination of growth, value, and fiscal strength. The company closed out the third quarter with a 17% year-over-year revenue increase. Perion operates in several high-growth advertising segments, such as connected TV and digital out-of-home advertising. Both segments are projected to achieve double-digit compounded growth rates over several years.\n\nA sluggish 2023 stock performance has resulted in a compelling 9.5x forward P/E ratio and a 0.43 PEG ratio. The valuation gets even better when considering enterprise value instead of market cap. While Perion has a $1.38 billion market cap, the company only has an enterprise value of around $850 million.\n\nThere’s only one way for a company’s enterprise value to be less than its market cap. A corporation must have a cash position that is greater than its total debt. Perion has a 0% debt-to-equity ratio. The firm closed out the quarter with $197.8 million in cash and cash equivalents, along with $253.9 million in short-term bank deposits.\n\nPerion is sitting on a lot of cash that it can use to acquire more advertising companies. The company recently acquired Hivestack for $100 million to improve its digital out-of-home advertising. Hivestack has many corporate clients who will now be introduced to Perion’s multi-channel advertising solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis won’t be the last acquisition. Perion CEO Tal Jacobson mentioned in a press release that the company will continue to pursue additional acquisitions.\n\nWhy Perion Slumped in 2023\n\nThe growth rates, valuation, and lack of debt make Perion look compelling, but investors didn’t agree in 2023. The stock is down by 13% over the past year. Investors can appreciate the long-term potential of this stock by zooming out to the 795% gain over the past five years.\n\nPerion’s slump wasn’t driven by financials or an excessive valuation. There are only two reasons I can think of that explain why Perion wasn’t a winner in 2023. The first reason is that Perion is based in Israel. Many corporations based in Israel saw their stock prices plunge at the start of the conflict. Perion’s stock price fell by almost 20% in October when the conflict started.\n\nThe second reason is the unfounded fear of Perion and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) breaking up. The partnership allows Perion to generate revenue through Bing’s search engine. The contract is set to expire this year.\n\nSpruce Point Capital Management sounded the alarm of Perion’s “extreme dependency” on the contract. However, Perion has diversified into multiple revenue streams.\n\nIf the companies don’t come to an agreement, it’s definitely a setback for Perion. Microsoft makes up roughly 45% of Perion’s total revenue. However, it’s not a knockout blow by any means, especially with the low valuation. The stock is priced as if an agreement with Microsoft has already fallen through.\n\nFurthermore, Perion and Microsoft have a good relationship that dates back to 2010. The company has agreed on new contracts multiple times while extending the length of each contract. The agreement in 2020 stretched for four years. The two companies had previously reached a three-year agreement in 2017.\n\nPerion was named Microsoft Advertising’s 2021 Supply Partner of the Year, which indicates the relationship is still strong. A new agreement in 2024 and calming tensions in the Middle East can send Perion stock skyrocketing.\n\nIs PERI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nPerion doesn’t receive as much coverage because it’s an under-the-radar stock. Among the four analysts who rated the stock, three of them rated it a Buy, while one analyst rated it a Hold, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating.\n\nPerion received a $45 price target from Oppenheimer in October 2023. That is the highest price target so far. The average PERI stock price target of $36.75 implies upside of 25.2% from the current price.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Perion Stock\n\nPerion has the financials, growth verticals, and valuation to generate meaningful returns for long-term investors. Despite gaining market share while other advertising companies pulled back, Perion still trades at a 10x forward P/E ratio. Plus, the company continued to demonstrate robust financial performance, even though its stock price stayed flat.\n\nThe stock’s greatest weakness is its obscurity. However, investors are likely to bid up the price of this stock as it continues to report strong earnings growth. It’s baffling to see the stock down over the past year, but the underperformance offers an opportunity to buy shares before they potentially take off.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Investing.com — Here is your Pro Recap of the earnings reports you may have missed this week: Meta Platforms, Apple, Alphabet, and UPS.\n\nMeta Platforms stock jumps on beat-and-raise, ProPicks soars on the news\n\nShares of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) experienced a surge of over 16% in pre-market today after the company released strong Q4 earnings, declared its first-ever quarterly dividend, and announced a new share buyback plan.\n\nThe tech giant reported Q4 EPS of $5.33, significantly outperforming the anticipated $4.96 by analysts. Its revenue saw a 25% increase year-over-year, reaching $40.11 billion and exceeding the consensus of $39.02B.\n\nLooking ahead to Q1/24, Meta Platforms anticipates revenue between $34.5B and $37B, which is above the consensus estimate of $33.83B.\n\nThe company also declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50, with a scheduled payment date of March 26, offering an annual dividend yield of 0.5%.

Shares of Apple dropped over 2% in pre-market today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant reported earnings of $2.18 per share with a revenue of $119.58B, outperforming analyst forecasts, which expected an EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $118.06B. Despite these strong overall results, revenue from greater China experienced a 13% decline to $20.82B, contributing to the underperformance in iPhone sales amid a tough competitive backdrop. iPhone revenue, which makes up about half of total revenue, rose to $69.70B from $65.78B a year earlier but missed estimates of $67.82B.\n\nAlphabet shares plunge amid higher AI spending forecast\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), experienced a 7% drop in its stock price on Wednesday after announcing its Q4 results and revealing that capital expenditures in 2024 will significantly increase compared to the previous year.\n\nThis increase in spending is part of the company's strategic initiative to enhance its AI capabilities, aiming to improve performance across its crucial advertising and cloud services units.\n\nDespite facing weaker-than-expected advertising growth in Q4, Alphabet's strong cloud business performance contributed to the company's revenue and profit surpassing Wall Street's forecasts.\n\nFor Q4, Alphabet reported an EPS of $1.64, above the analyst prediction of $1.59. The company's revenue for the quarter was $86.31B, exceeding the consensus estimate of $85.23B.\n\nUPS falls 8% on weak outlook\n\nShares of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) tumbled over 8% on Tuesday following the announcement of its Q4 results, which were mixed, and its guidance fell short of expectations.\n\nThe logistics giant reported an adjusted EPS of $2.47 for the quarter, matching the consensus among analysts. However, its quarterly revenue of $24.92B represented a 7.8% decrease year-over-year and was below the anticipated $25.41B.\n\nLooking forward to 2024, UPS projected its full-year revenue to range between $92.0B and $94.5B, aiming for a consolidated adjusted operating margin of about 10.0% to 10.6%. This projection is below the analysts' expectations, who had forecasted full-year sales to reach $95.6B.\n\nFurthermore, UPS management announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as part of a strategy to achieve $1B in cost reductions.\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship Beat the S&P 500, which outperformed the market by a lofty 747% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here for up to 50% off as part of our year-end sale and never miss a bull market again!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThis week in earnings: Meta jumps 16% following blockbuster results, UPS sinks\n\nKnight-Swift raises quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share\n\nHomes.com secures 43rd in SISTRIX IndexWatch 2023",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures largely climbed higher Friday, boosted by generally positive corporate earnings ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly jobs report.\n\nBy 06:10 ET (11:10 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was largely unchanged, while S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 165 points, or 1%.\n\nThe main U.S. averages closed higher Wednesday, rebounding from the post-Federal Reserve meeting losses as a generally positive earnings season helped the mood turn more optimistic.\n\nThe blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 370 points, or 1%, higher, while both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 1.3%.\n\nMeta Platforms pays first-ever dividend\n\nHelping the stock market gains continue Friday was generally positive earnings from the mega-cap tech sector after the close of the previous session.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock surged in premarket trading after profit at the Facebook parent tripled from a year earlier, resulting in the tech giant paying a dividend for the first time as well as an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also gained after the online retailing giant swung back to a full-year profit of more than $30 billion, announcing $170 billion in quarterly sales.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) provided the blip to the positivity, as although the iPhone maker’s fiscal first-quarter results beat expectations, sales of its key product disappointed following weakness in China amid rising competition.\n\n\"Apple’s worrying China sales figures indicate demand for its high-end iPhones is slowing more than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei,\" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said Thursday.\n\nThe earnings season continues Friday, with results due from the likes of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nStory continues\n\nNonfarm payrolls loom large\n\nThe widely-watched monthly jobs report is due later in the session, and will provide investors - and Fed officials - with another data point from the labor market to help guide the path of interest rates going forward.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to have added 187,000 new jobs in January, slowing from 216,000 the prior month, with the jobless rate ticking up to 3.8% from 3.7%.\n\nThis would come after a surprise jump in jobless claims and a weak private payrolls report earlier in the week.\n\nA downside miss in payrolls could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, potentially bringing a March rate cut back into play.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on the idea of rate cuts as early as March in his accompanying press conference.\n\nCrude on track for hefty weekly loss\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were still on course for hefty weekly losses following unsubstantiated reports that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was being discussed.\n\nBy 06:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $74.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.5% to $79.09 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, kept its oil output policy unchanged on Thursday, likely ensuring supply remained tight in the first quarter of the year.\n\nHowever, both contracts were on course for weekly losses of around 5%, as an end to the war between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas would lessen the tensions in the Middle East, easing concerns about supply disruptions through this key oil-rich region.\n\n(Oliver Gray contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures gain after tech titans report; nonfarm payrolls loom\n\nComfort Systems USA expands with Utah acquisition\n\nLipocine transitions TLANDO commercialization to Verity Pharma",

        "content": "A look at the day ahead in European and global markets from Tom Westbrook\n\nMeta paid a dividend and Amazon's $170 billion in quarterly sales beat expectations. Cue cheering that added a combined $280 billion in market value to the two companies' shares.\n\nNasdaq 100 futures were up 1% in Asia to provide a positive end to a rough week.\n\nThe numbers are worth walking through. Profit at Facebook parent Meta tripled from a year earlier, with revenue up one-quarter to top $40 billion.\n\nAmazon, meanwhile, swung back to a full-year profit of more than $30 billion with handy contributions from advertising sales and its high-margin servers business.\n\nSam Rines at research firm CORBU in Texas says the duo are beneficiaries of corporate spending across the U.S. to boost product volume.\n\n\"Some will find volume, many will not,\" he said in a note. \"The advertisers will find revenues.\"\n\nThe solid reports had the two companies outshining the other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Microsoft, Tesla, Apple and Alphabet, which were punished by investors following their earnings announcements, and Nvidia, which reports later in February.\n\nThe Seven account for nearly 29% of the S&P 500 and their outperformance - collectively they were responsible for 62% of the index's total return last year - is starting to generate some discomfort.\n\nAmazon and Nvidia are particularly expensive, with price-to-earnings ratios in the eighties, as investors seem willing to bet that profit growth will eventually justify the valuations.\n\nAt an outlook briefing in Singapore this week, VP Bank's group chief investment officer Felix Brill pointed out, only half joking, that just three of the Magnificent Seven gunslingers survived in the John Sturges western.\n\nBeyond the tech earnings, the market mood is jittery. Shares in Japan's Aozora Bank tumbled for a second session after a surprise loss provision against U.S. office loans. That follows heavy selling of U.S. regional banks after a similar warning by New York Community Bancorp.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank earnings - Caixabank, Deutsche, Danske and UniCredit - headline the European day ahead of U.S. labour data.\n\nTraders have been pushing back bets on the beginning of U.S. rate cuts this year, but will soon need to see signs of softness in the labour market to justify their current pricing of more than 140 basis points of cuts by year's end.\n\nKey developments that could influence markets on Friday:\n\nEconomics: French industrial production, U.S. payrolls\n\nEarnings: Caixabank, Deutsche Bank, Danske Bank, UniCredit, Chevron, ExxonMobil\n\n(By Tom Westbrook; Editing by Edmund Klamann)",

Futures mixed ahead of payrolls release\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely higher Friday ahead of key employment data, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index set to outperform after strong results from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the previous close.\n\nBy 05:05 ET (10:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures climbed 25 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 165 points, or 1%.\n\nThe three main indices all closed around 1% higher on Thursday, rebounding after the post-Federal Reserve losses, helped by better-than-expected earnings largely across the board.\n\nInvestors will have a key economic release to digest Friday, the monthly jobs report [see above], while quarterly earnings continue to emerge, from the likes of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta and Amazon shine, while Apple disappointed\n\nThree of the mega-cap growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reported after Thursday’s market close, with differing impacts.\n\nThe shares of Meta Platforms and Amazon soared in after hours trade, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value after the tech giants impressed investors with their quarterly results, while Apple's value shrank by $70 billion after its results.\n\nMeta delivered a 25% jump in revenue for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales, and the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nAmazon impressed as cloud growth met expectations while growth in online spending surged during the critical holiday shopping season.\n\nBy contrast, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, indicating that its signature product is losing ground in the key Chinese market.\n\n4. Nvidia value soared in January\n\nThe optimism surrounding the impact of artificial intelligence on corporate bottom lines was illustrated by the demand for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock this month.\n\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker saw its market value expand by a record $296.52 billion in January to around $1.52 trillion, surpassing the $248.23 billion in gains seen in May 2023.\n\nNvidia currently has a dominant position in the market for advanced AI chips, and plans to begin mass production later this year of an AI chip designed for its Chinese customers in order to comply with tightened U.S. export rules.\n\n5. Oil heading for hefty weekly loss\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were still on course for hefty weekly losses following unsubstantiated reports that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was being discussed.\n\nBy 05:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $74.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.7% to $79.23 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, kept its oil output policy unchanged on Thursday, likely ensuring supply remained tight in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe group will next meet in March to decide whether or not to extend the voluntary oil production cuts in place for the first quarter.\n\nHowever, both contracts were on course for weekly losses of around 5%, as an end to the war between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas would lessen the tensions in the Middle East, easing concerns about supply disruptions through this key oil-rich region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayrolls, mega-cap tech earnings, Nvidia - what's moving markets\n\nGlobal equity funds draw inflows amid economic optimism and easing inflation\n\nShort on cash, El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin dream",

        "content": "As I ponder the top stock picks for 2024, I’m debating the criteria for selecting the companies on my list.\n\nThere are many ways to analyze a stock’s potential, but ultimately, whether they perform or not is in the hands of the investing gods. We cannot control how quickly a stock rises or falls, even when we’ve done plenty of due diligence and homework.\n\nSometimes, even the best analysis misses the mark. Having written about stocks for over a decade, I’ve learned that you can’t always correct. And more importantly, there will be when you look downright silly. That’s life.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo simplify the process, I’ll select my three top stock picks for 2024, with one from the top 10 holdings of a growth ETF, one from a value ETF, and a third from a blend of the two.\n\nHere are my three market mavericks for 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne only needs to look at the Bloomberg Billionaires Index to know that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has fully recovered from the malaise it faced from investors through most of 2022.\n\nMeta is one of the top 10 holdings of the iShares Russell 1000 Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:IWF). It tracks the performance of the Russell 1000 Growth Index, a collection of 443 large- and mid-cap stocks with growth characteristics.\n\nMeta’s Q4 quarterly revenue was 40.1 billion dollars, up 25 percent year over year, and its yearly total revenue reached 134.9 billion dollars.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG) has gotten off to a good start in 2024. Its shares are up 5.61%, 348 basis points higher than the S&P 500. PG is the ninth-largest holding of the iShares S&P 500 Value ETF (NYSEARCA:IVE).\n\nIt tracks the performance of the S&P 500 Value Index. It uses three value characteristics to evaluate potential constituents for the index: book value to price ratio, earnings to price ratio, and sales to price ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Jan. 23, the consumer goods company, whose brands include Pampers, Tide, Bounty, Tampax, and Gillette, reported its Q2 2024 earnings. Its sales were $21.44 billion, $40 million shy of analyst estimates, while its earnings per share were $1.84, 14 cents higher than the consensus estimate.\n\nIn 2024, it expects adjusted EPS of $6.41, 8.6% higher than in 2022. Its earnings in 2022 rose just 2%, so despite slower volumes, higher prices keep the profits growing.\n\nAs part of the quarter, it reported a $1.3 billion impairment charge for Gillette. It expects up to $2.5 billion over the next two fiscal years as it restructures its business in several markets.\n\nIts enterprise value of $397.2 billion is 17.60x its EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization). That’s lower than at almost any time since 2018.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) top down photo of a man in a red kayak on a pristine water way with greenery to the left\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Virrage Images\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is one of the top 10 holdings for the Invesco S&P MidCap Quality ETF (NYSEARCA:XMHQ), which tracks the performance of the S&P MidCap 400 Quality Index, a collection of quality stocks from the S&P MidCap 400.\n\nQuality refers to those names with a high return on equity, a low accruals ratio (stocks with high cash earnings), and a low financial leverage ratio (debt is a small part of book value).\n\nThe maker of Ugg and Hoka shoes has a trailing 12-month return on equity of 37.00%, considerably higher than its five-year average of 29.67%. Decker’s financial leverage ratio is a low 14% based on $251.1 million in total debt and $1.80 billion in book value. The company’s Sloan ratio, defined as net income less operating cash flow divided by total assets, is -6.03%. A negative Sloan ratio is preferred.\n\nIts stock is off to another fast start in 2024, up nearly 12%. In 2023, it gained more than 67%. It’s up 431% over the past five years, more than 5x the S&P 500.\n\nLast July, I selected DECK stock as one of three footwear stocks instead of Nike (NYSE:NKE). It’s up 40% compared to a 6% decline for the Swoosh. It’s up 16% so far in 2024. As long as Hoka keeps growing, I don’t see this reversing anytime soon.\n\nIt’s one of my favorite top stock picks for 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Meta Platforms Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. spent 2023 cutting costs and re-focusing their businesses. It was a strategy that upended the lives of displaced tech workers in Seattle and Silicon Valley, but appears to have paid off handsomely for investors who are likely to continue reaping benefits.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again Lewis Hamilton to Join Ferrari F1 Team in 2025, Leaving Mercedes\n\nBoth companies reported better-than-expected earnings on Thursday, sending their stock prices soaring and validating the belt-tightening strategies that defined the tech industry’s past 16 months.\n\nMeta, which cut headcount by 22% in 2023, unveiled plans for a $50 billion stock buyback, and even announced its first ever quarterly dividend — a sign to investors that it has money to spare and a reason for them to stick around. Amazon investors asked about any plans to return capital to shareholders and executives were noncommittal. Amazon initiated its biggest-ever round of corporate job cuts beginning in 2022 that affected about 35,000 people last year. Already in 2024, the company has said more positions will be eliminated in its Prime Video, studios and Twitch livestreaming businesses\n\nInvestors were happy to see tech companies — often prone to splurge on moonshot projects with no foreseeable payout — narrow their investments on profitable business lines, said Gil Luria, managing director at D.A. Davidson & Co.\n\n“This new found cost discipline is paying off for investors as these companies were able to prune less productive businesses while still being able to invest some of those savings in the faster growing parts of their business,” he said. “At the same time, these companies have been able to accelerate revenue growth, thus significantly increasing margins.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBoth companies also reported holiday quarter revenue growth in their central businesses — digital advertising for Meta and e-commerce sales for Amazon — that surpassed estimates. The results sent Meta’s shares up 15% in extended trading while Amazon’s stock rose more than 7%.\n\nMeta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg acknowledged that the strong business results raise questions about whether Meta should start investing heavily again.\n\n“The biggest thing that’s holding me back from doing that is that at this point I feel like I’ve really come around to thinking that we operate better as a leaner company,” he said Thursday. “There are always these questions about adding a few people here or there to do something, and I guess I just have more of an appreciation about how all of that adds up.”\n\nFor years, Meta and Amazon reinvested profits back into the companies, fueling hiring sprees and expanding into new technologies and business lines. The strategy was increasingly apparent in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, when both companies spent aggressively. Meta’s headcount increased 30% in 2020, and another 23% in 2021, while pivoting the entire company toward a massive investment in augmented and virtual reality technology dubbed the metaverse. Amazon, for its part, doubled the size of its logistics network to meet pandemic demand and increased its workforce almost 30% in 2022 before it cooled on hiring and building new facilities.\n\nThe question now becomes whether leaner, more focused versions of Meta and Amazon can continue to strive for the bold and ambitious tech advancements that have made them household names.\n\nIn Meta’s case, that includes spending aggressively on artificial intelligence advancements, both in generative AI but also on the background technologies to help feed it social media products and power its ad targeting. Zuckerberg is also still committed to VR and AR headsets, and the company’s Reality Labs division building these kinds of technologies still lost $16 billion in 2023.\n\nZuckerberg said he plans to keep headcount growth “relatively minimal” for 2024 and beyond despite the lofty ambitions. “Until we reach a point where we are just really under water on our ability to execute, I kind of want to keep things lean because I think that’s the right thing for us to do culturally.”\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy said Amazon reduced the cost to serve a customer’s order by 45 cents per unit in 2023, its first decrease on that metric in five years, and he vowed to continue to look for ways to bring those costs even lower.\n\nChief Financial Officer Brian Olsavsky said the company would be cautious about new investments. “Where we can find efficiencies and do more with less, we’re going to do that as well,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg explained how Meta will crush Google and Microsoft at AI—and Meta warned it could cost more than $30 billion a year",
        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg laid out Meta's gameplan for \"playing to win\" against Alphabet and Microsoft in the high-stakes AI arms race. Meta's secret weapon: its walled garden of data.\n\n\"There are hundreds of billions of publicly shared images and tens of billions of public videos, which we estimate is greater than the common crawl data set,” Zuckerberg said on Meta’s earnings call on Thursday. It was a not-so-subtle jab at competitors Google, Microsoft and OpenAI, which are training their AI models on the public web data crawled by their search engines every day.\n\nBeyond the generative AI technology that Meta already offers in its battle against the other Big Tech powers (including Apple, which teased on its earnings call Thursday that it would launch a generative AI product later this year), Zuckerberg is aiming for “general intelligence,” the still unproven concept of a general purpose AI that can handle most tasks better than humans.\n\n“We’ll be building the most popular and advanced AI products and services. If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done,” Zuckerberg said, even as his management team hinted at the hefty price tag of carrying out the project. Meta’s capital expenditures could increase by as much as $9 billion this year, totalling between $30 billion to $37 billion, compared to $28.1 billion in 2023.\n\nAnd the company suggested this could be the new normal, noting that “we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.”\n\nIt’s probably no coincidence that Meta announced its first ever cash dividend to investors on Thursday. The new, 50-cent quarterly dividend, along with strong results in Meta’s core advertising business, ignited Meta’s stock, which shot up 14.5% in after hours trading.\n\nZuckerberg initially unveiled his vision for artificial general intelligence last month in an Instagram Reels video. On Thursday, he expanded on the plan, describing it as not just a far-off science project, but an effort that will incorporate AGI into Meta products like Facebook, Instagram, and Whatsapp.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It's clear that we're going to need our models to be able to reason, plan code, remember, and many other cognitive abilities in order to provide the best versions of the services that we envision,” he said. “We’re playing to win here, and I expect us to continue investing aggressively in this area.”\n\nTo realize his vision of Meta as the AI leader, Zuckerberg has yet to expand on how exactly Meta user activity will be used as training data for Meta’s AI, and how the company will navigate the potential issues around user privacy.\n\nAnd it remains to be seen whether Zuckerberg’s confidence in the value of Meta’s training data compared to the vast corpus of web data used by Google is as big of an advantage as he believes. Google has the data treasure trove of YouTube, Google Office and its search engine. Still, Google AI is close-sourced so can only move as fast as engineering talent, whereas Zuckerberg pointed to his company’s open source Llama model as another key advantage.\n\nEarnings aside, this has been a big week for Meta’s head honcho. Yesterday Zuckerberg was skewered during a U.S. Senate hearing where he, most notably, stood up and apologized to families whose children died from harms inflicted by social media. (Though he did not agree to compensate the families for the harms they suffered at Senator Hawley’s request.)\n\nWhile the apology may have been wrenching for Zuckerberg, his net worth rose by $1.6 billion (per Forbes) on Thursday with Meta’s stock performance.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

The 2023 Q4 cycle looks to be another critical period, particularly as investors look to find further clues about what lies ahead in 2024 overall.\n\nOne company in particular, Meta Platforms META, saw its shares melt higher post-earnings, with investors swarming. On the contrary, Apple AAPL shares faced selling pressure. Let’s take a closer look at the releases.\n\nMeta Q4\n\nMeta has consistently posted robust earnings results lately, regularly exceeding our expectations and enjoying buying pressure following the releases. Concerning the report in focus, the technology titan generated $40.1 billion in sales, improving by a sizable 25% from the year-ago period.\n\nTop line results reflect a considerable acceleration, with the 25% jump penciling in the highest year-over-year growth rate in eight quarters.\n\nUndoubtedly to the likes of investors, Q4 costs and expenses fell 8% compared to the same period last year, and the company purchased over $6 billion in shares throughout the period. META’s improved operations have clearly led to significant benefits, with quarterly EPS of $5.33 well above the year-ago mark and easily surpassing the $4.83 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate. Impressively, the company’s operating margin came in at 41%, crushing the year-ago figure of 20%.\n\nThe company’s platform also continues to expand, with Facebook daily and monthly active users growing by 6% and 3%, respectively. And its advertising business remains sound, with ad impressions delivered across its family of apps improving 21% year-over-year.\n\nMETA has consistently posted better-than-expected advertising revenue. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd to top off the robust results, the company unveiled its first-ever dividend, which is payable on March 26th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22nd. Mark Zuckerberg on the results - ‘We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.’\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Q1\n\nConcerning headline figures, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. Apple shares didn’t experience the same positivity as META, facing selling pressure post-earnings. It’s worth noting that the results snapped a four-quarter long streak of negative year-over-year revenue growth rates.\n\nNonetheless, there was much to like in the report, with Services revenue of $23.1 billion reflecting a record and jumping 11.3% from the same period last year. iPhone revenues also showed growth, with $69.7 billion in quarterly revenue 6% higher year-over-year and exceeding our consensus expectations by a modest 1.5%.\n\nInterestingly enough, iPhone results snapped a back-to-back streak of negative surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Apple continued to flex its cash-generating abilities, posting nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow. Margin expansion was also prevalent, moving higher from 42.9% to 45.6%.\n\nThe negative reaction among shares could likely be attributed to worries stemming from demand in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is always an exciting time. Beloved market titans Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META revealed their results after the close today. META shares soared on news of a dividend and improved profitability, whereas AAPL shares faced pressure following worries about demand in China.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of overall Q4 expectations, I invite you to view our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg stands to receive a payout of about $700 million a year from the social media giant’s first-ever dividend for investors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again Lewis Hamilton to Join Ferrari F1 Team in 2025, Leaving Mercedes\n\nMeta announced a quarterly cash dividend of 50 cents a share for Class A and B common stock beginning in March. With Zuckerberg holding about 350 million shares, he would take home about $175 million in each quarterly payment before taxes, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nMeta’s move to pay a dividend sends a signal about the company’s view of its growth potential. Often, faster-growing tech companies eschew dividends in favor of using earnings to develop new products or make expensive acquisitions. While Meta is spending big on artificial intelligence initiatives, its acquisition prospects are dwindling in the face of regulatory opposition.\n\nAfter Meta fired about 21,000 people and narrowed its priorities, the stock almost tripled in 2023. The new dividend and an additional $50 billion in share buybacks may win more patience from investors with Zuckerberg’s long-term bets on artificial intelligence and the metaverse.\n\nZuckerberg took home $27.1 million in total compensation in 2022, including private security costs and a base salary of $1, according to filings. Meta hasn’t yet reported executive compensation for last year.\n\nA spokesperson for the company declined to comment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms and Amazon.com added a combined $280 billion in stock market value late on Thursday after the Big Tech duo reported quarterly results that impressed investors, while Apple's value shrank by $70 billion after its results.\n\nMeta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nWhile dividends are associated with mature, slow-growth companies, Meta delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales.\n\nAmazon's stock jumped 8% after the company beat December-quarter revenue expectations on strong growth in online spending during the critical holiday shopping season. That put the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's market capitalization at $1.78 trillion.\n\nApple's quarterly results beat analysts' expectations, but its sales in China missed estimates and its stock dipped 3.3%. Apple faces tough competition in China, which has worried Wall Street in recent months.\n\nInvestor optimism about generative AI drove rallies in the U.S. stock market's most valuable companies last year, with many hitting all-time highs in recent sessions.\n\nMicrosoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights.\n\nAsked on an investor call about generative AI, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"We've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\"\n\nMicrosoft's lead over Apple in stock market value will probably grow over the next five years thanks to its early advantage in AI, 13 analysts consulted last week by Reuters unanimously agreed.\n\n\"For Apple to be able to accelerate growth, we would need either a material contribution from new products like the Vision Pro or a generative AI driven cycle to come through the iPhone 16,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said following its results.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple starts U.S. sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday.\n\nIn its report after the bell, Meta said its 2024 capital expenditures would reach between $30 billion and $37 billion, a $2 billion increase over its previous plan, driven by investments in servers, some of which will be used for AI.\n\nChipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices both climbed about almost 2% in extended trade, while server maker Super Micro Computer added 2%.\n\nThe extended-trade surge in Meta's market capitalization was equivalent to more than five times the entire $26 billion value of smaller social media rival Snap Inc.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. announced plans to buy back an additional $50 billion in shares and issue its first-ever quarterly dividend as Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg works to convince investors that his costly bets on the metaverse and artificial intelligence will pay off.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Lewis Hamilton to Join Ferrari F1 Team in 2025, Leaving Mercedes Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again\n\nThe social media giant also reported strong fourth-quarter results, posting a 25% gain in sales and profits that tripled, while also projecting revenue growth for the current period that surpassed projections.\n\nThe shares jumped more than 14% in extended trading. The stock had gained 12% this year through Thursday’s close after nearly tripling last year.\n\n“We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,” Zuckerberg said in a statement. “We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.”\n\nRevenue is expected to be as much as $37 billion in the three months ending in March, Meta said. Analysts were looking for $33.6 billion, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg. In the fourth quarter, revenue was $40.1 billion, beating the average analyst estimate of $39 billion. Net income surged to $14 billion, or $5.33 a share, also better than expected.\n\nMeta executives had cautioned in October that “global economic uncertainties” could weigh on revenue at the end of last year, typically the most lucrative quarter, even as the company laid out an expensive spending plan for 2024. But the social media company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, fared better than Alphabet Inc. The Google parent, which, like Meta, gets the bulk of its revenue from digital advertising and is also investing heavily on AI, reported softness in its core search advertising business earlier this week, sending its stock tumbling.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In the digital advertising sphere, Meta’s outlook is increasingly optimistic,” said Mayuranki De, research analyst at Global X. “Despite diversifying into areas like virtual-reality headsets, digital advertising remains its revenue cornerstone.”\n\nChief Financial Officer Susan Li said the strong increase in revenue in the fourth quarter was due to high spending by China-based advertisers and AI-recommended video content. Daily watch time across the company’s apps increased 25% from a year earlier.\n\nIn 2023, revenue from China-based advertisers represented 10% of Meta’s total revenue and contributed 5 percentage points to total worldwide revenue growth, Li said on a call with analysts.\n\nIn recent years, Meta has been working to balance huge outlays on technologies like artificial intelligence and virtual reality, while still trying to ensure that its core digital advertising business is still growing. After seeing business shrink for the first time in 2022, Zuckerberg made efforts to turn the company around, dubbing 2023 the “year of efficiency” and cutting thousands of jobs.\n\n“The fruits of their cost cutting measures are starting really to shine through earnings,” analysts at Vital Knowledge wrote in a note.\n\nZuckerberg struggled to get investors on board the last time he laid out a long-term, expensive new vision — for the metaverse — going so far as to change the company’s name from Facebook to Meta. Now, as the company spends handily on VR and AI, the company is sweetening the bet for shareholders with a quarterly dividend of 50 cents a share and a huge share repurchase program. The last time Meta authorized a buyback of this size was in October 2021 when it was still posting surprising growth in the number of people actively using its network of social media apps.\n\nNow that Meta plans to pay a dividend, the only holdouts among peers valued at more than $1 trillion are Amazon.com Inc. and Alphabet Inc. Apple Inc. has paid dividends on and off since 1987, and Microsoft Corp. started doling out dividends in 2003.\n\nMeta’s move sends a signal about the company’s view of its potential. While it indicates management are bullish about growth prospects, it also hints at limits on what the company can do with its cash pile. Typically, faster growing tech companies eschew dividends in favor of using earnings to develop new products or make big acquisitions. While Meta is spending big on artificial intelligence initiatives, its acquisition prospects are dwindling in the face of regulatory opposition.\n\nMeta has been investing in AI technology at record levels, including expanding its core advertising business through improvements in ad targeting and AI-recommended content, and the infrastructure it needs to run it. At the same time, it hasn’t abandoned efforts to build the virtual reality metaverse.\n\nFor this year, Meta plans to spend $94 billion to $99 billion, covering higher infrastructure-related costs, hiring selectively in higher-cost technical roles and development in augmented and virtual reality. Last quarter, the company said it planned to push some spending on items like new headcount and infrastructure into 2024.\n\nZuckerberg said he’s developed an appreciation for operating a leaner company, and is reluctant to jump back into significant hiring. He said he’d like to keep new hires “relatively minimal” to stay lean.\n\nThe company also said it expects operating losses to “increase meaningfully” at Reality Labs, the division that makes smart glasses and headsets, as it continues to invest in product development. On the bright side, the unit crossed $1 billion in quarterly revenue for the first time.\n\nMeta’s results follow reports from other Big Tech rivals, including Microsoft Corp., which failed to convince Wall Street that the all-consuming and expensive focus on AI is starting to pay off yet.\n\nMeta’s approach to the AI race has been different than its peers, however. For the most part, it’s unveiling research or large language models — the technology that underpins AI chatbots — for free to be used by developers. Meta thinks this open strategy will help improve the technology faster.\n\nFor all of Meta’s excitement about AI, investors focus on the number of people who use its apps has faded. Now with almost 4 billion people across Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp that use the platform each month, the San Francisco-based company said it will no longer report that metric in earnings, or daily and monthly user numbers for its flagship Facebook app.\n\nBeginning this quarter, the company will instead begin reporting year-over-year changes in ad impressions and the average price per ad at the regional level, while continuing to report only daily active users across its family of apps.\n\nReels – the vertical videos on Instagram and Facebook that are served up to users by an algorithm – are being re-shared 3.5 billion times a day, Zuckerberg said, and ads for that format are now contributing to net revenue across both apps. Continuing to improve those videos, the ads served there and the algorithm that personalizes them for users, will continue to “remain a priority,” he said\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n\n(Updates to add user numbers, comments from CFO, CEO)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "content": "Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg speaking yesterday during a US Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety - Susan Walsh/AP\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s Meta will pay up to $50bn to shareholders after it posted record revenues, sending profits soaring by 200pc.\n\nRevenues at the social media giant behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp hit more than $40bn for the three months to December. Its shares surged more than 13pc in after hours trading on Thursday night.\n\nQuarterly profits climbed threefold to $14bn as Meta’s advertising sales staged a marked recovery after it implemented sweeping layoffs last year in a drastic effort to cut costs. Meta’s workforce shrunk by a total of 22pc, equivalent to more than 19,000 staff.\n\nMr Zuckerberg also announced the social network giant, which turns 20 this month, would pay its first-ever dividend as a public company of 50 cents per share - worth a total of $1.25bn. Meta said it would begin regular dividend payouts for the first time and would also buy back an additional $50bn from shareholders.\n\nThe strong results came just days after Mr Zuckerberg was accused by US senators of putting profits before users’ safety.\n\nEmails from within Meta published ahead of a Senate hearing this week showed how Mr Zuckerberg rejected pleas from Sir Nick Clegg, the company’s head of global affairs, to hire dozens of staff to help protect children on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMr Zuckerberg told investors on Thursday: “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow.\n\n“We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.”\n\nMeta revealed close to half the world’s population has signed up to join the social media empire, with nearly 4bn people now using at least one of its apps on a regular basis.\n\nWhile politicians have threatened a crackdown on social media apps, Meta’s shares have climbed to record highs so far in 2024, up 14pc. Meta is now worth more than $1 trillion.\n\nSeparately last night, Apple revealed its first rise in sales in more than a year as demand for its latest iPhones reversed a rare losing streak.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant revealed that revenues rose by 2pc in the final three months of last year to $119.6bn while profits rose by 13pc to $34bn.\n\nThe increase reverses four consecutive quarters of falling revenues, which had been Apple’s longest losing streak since the launch of the iPod two decades ago.\n\nIt comes despite declining sales in China, where the company has faced growing questions over its business.\n\nShares in the company dropped slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which counts for the majority of Apple’s revenue, grew by 6pc. Its services business, which includes its App Store and software such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, grew by 11pc. Sales of the iPad fell while those of Mac computers rose slightly. Sales of accessories such as AirPods and the Apple Watch also declined.\n\nChief executive Tim Cook said 2.2bn Apple products were now in use around the world\n\nThe figures come as Apple prepares to release its Vision Pro headset, the most significant new product released in Mr Cook’s 13 years in charge of the company, which goes on sale on Friday in the US.\n\nAmazon recorded its highest profit for two years amid a jump in trading over the Christmas period.\n\nThe company said sales rose by 14pc to $170bn in the fourth quarter of the year, in part due to growing sales outside the US.\n\nProfits rose from $300m a year ago to $10.6bn. This was its strongest profit since the end of 2021, when rising Covid cases meant most consumers resorted to internet shopping.\n\nThe growth in sales puts Amazon within touching distance of overtaking Walmart as the world’s biggest retail company by revenues.\n\nShares rose by 6pc in after-hours trading.\n\nThe results for the Silicon Valley giants came as job cuts continued to hit the industry. Video call app Zoom cut around 150 jobs, roughly 2pc of its workforce, while security app Okta laid off 400 staff.",

Dividend Announcement: Board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share, payable on March 26, 2024.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with META.\n\nOn February 1, 2024, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) released its 8-K filing, revealing a significant uptick in its financial performance for both the fourth quarter and the full year ended December 31, 2023. The company, known for its expansive social network ecosystem that includes Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp, and other services, has reported a substantial increase in revenue and net income, reflecting the company's focus on operational efficiency and growth in its advertising business.\n\nFinancial Performance Overview\n\nMeta's fourth-quarter revenue rose to $40.11 billion, a 25% increase compared to the same period in 2022. This growth was mirrored in the company's full-year revenue, which climbed 16% to $134.90 billion. The impressive revenue figures were bolstered by a 21% year-over-year increase in ad impressions delivered across the Family of Apps and a 2% increase in the average price per ad for Q4.\n\nNet income for the fourth quarter skyrocketed by 201% to $14.02 billion, while the full-year net income saw a 69% increase to $39.10 billion. Diluted EPS for the quarter was $5.33, up 203%, and $14.87 for the full year, up 73%. These figures reflect Meta's successful cost management strategies, including an 8% decrease in total costs and expenses for the quarter.\n\nStory continues Meta Platforms Inc (META) Reports Soaring Profits and Revenue Growth in Q4 and Full Year 2023\n\nOperational Highlights and Challenges\n\nOperational efficiency was a key theme in Meta's latest earnings report. The company's headcount decreased by 22% year-over-year, and it completed several restructuring initiatives, including data center and employee layoffs, as well as facilities consolidation. These measures contributed to the reduction in costs and expenses and were reflected in the company's improved operating margin, which stood at 41% for Q4 and 35% for the full year.\n\nDespite these achievements, Meta is not without its challenges. The company's CFO outlook commentary highlighted expectations of increased operating losses for Reality Labs, driven by product development efforts in augmented and virtual reality. Additionally, Meta is facing regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S., which could significantly impact its business operations and financial results.\n\nBalance Sheet and Cash Flow Statements\n\nMeta's balance sheet remains robust, with cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities totaling $65.40 billion as of December 31, 2023. The company's long-term debt stood at $18.39 billion. Free cash flow for the fourth quarter was reported at $11.50 billion, and $43.01 billion for the full year, indicating strong liquidity and financial health.\n\nThe company also announced a significant return of capital to shareholders through share repurchases and the initiation of a quarterly dividend. Meta repurchased $6.32 billion of its Class A common stock in the fourth quarter and $20.03 billion for the full year. Furthermore, the board declared a cash dividend of $0.50 per share, marking the company's commitment to delivering shareholder value.\n\nLooking Forward\n\nAs Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) navigates the evolving digital landscape, its focus on AI and the metaverse, along with its operational discipline, positions the company for continued growth. However, investors and stakeholders will be closely monitoring how the company addresses its challenges, particularly in the regulatory space, and how it capitalizes on its opportunities in the coming year.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of Meta's financial performance and future outlook, investors are encouraged to review the full 8-K filing and stay tuned to GuruFocus.com for the latest financial news and expert insights.\n\nExplore the complete 8-K earnings release (here) from Meta Platforms Inc for further details.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. tripled its profit and posted sharply higher revenue in the final quarter of 2023, boosted by a rebound in digital advertising as well cost cutting and layoffs in what CEO Mark Zuckerberg called the “year of efficiency.”\n\n\"The company can talk all it wants to about AI and the metaverse, but it’s still a social media company that gets nearly all its revenue from advertising, and advertisers still clearly love Meta,” said longtime tech analyst Debra Aho Williamson.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company said Thursday that it earned $14 billion, or $5.33 per share, in the October-December period. That's up from $4.65 billion, or $1.76 per share, a year earlier.\n\nRevenue grew 25% to $40.11 billion from $32.17 billion.\n\nAnalysts, on average, were expecting earnings of $4.82 per share on revenue $39.1 billion, according to FactSet Research.\n\n“This was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities, and improved advertising performance for the businesses who rely on our services,” Meta said in a statement.\n\nMeta also grew the user base on its apps, with monthly active users on its family of apps — Facebook, Instagram, Messenger and WhatsApp — reaching 3.98 billion as of the end of the year, up 6% from 2022.\n\nFacebook had 3.07 billion monthly active users as of Dec. 31, an increase of 3% year-over year. The company does not break out the user base of its other platforms.\n\nThe blowout results come a day after Zuckerberg testified before the Senate along with other social media CEOs about the dangers their platforms pose to children.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta is forecasting revenue of of $34.5 billion to $37 billion, above Wall Street's expectations. Analysts are projecting revenue of $33.9 billion for the first quarter.\n\nThe company said it had 67,317 employees as of December 31, 2023, a decrease of 22% year-over-year after it laid off thousands to cut expenses.\n\nMeta also initiated a quarterly dividend to its shareholders. It said it will pay 50 cents per share on March 26 to shareholders of record as of Feb. 22. It said it plans to pay a quarterly dividend going forward.\n\nMeta's shares jumped $45.37, or 11.5%, to $440.15 in after-hours trading. The stock had closed at $394.78, up 1.2%.",

        "title": "Amazon stock pops as earnings beat",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations Thursday and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead.\n\nThe stock climbed 4% higher in extended trading.\n\nNet sales came in at nearly $170 billion versus expectations of $166.2 billion. That's higher than the almost $150 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. The outlook for the current quarter also surpassed forecasts, with the company estimating an upper range of $143.5 billion.\n\nHere are some of Amazon’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue: $169.9 billion vs. $166.2 billion expected ($149.2 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.00 vs $0.78 expected ($0.03 in Q4 2022) Amazon Web Services: $24.20 billion vs $24.22 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nOn Thursday the company unveiled a new shopping assistant dubbed Rufus, trained on Amazon’s product catalog and broader information from the web. The generative AI-powered tool can answer customer questions and recommend products on the Amazon mobile app. Amazon said a small subset of customers will initially be able to use the chatbot and then will widen its release to more users in the US.\n\nAmazon's results arrive just weeks after the company eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios and announced a major reduction in staff at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, laying off more than 500 people. Staff cuts across tech highlight the sector's painful climb down from an era of rapid expansion, as companies are still resizing and retreating from ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nAmazon sees the potential for AI development to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to provide vital infrastructure.\n\nStory continues The price of Amazon stock is shown on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2017, in New York. Amazon reports their earnings on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn September, the company launched its AI service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself.\n\nThat same month Amazon also said it would invest up to $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic as the biggest players in tech scramble for positioning in what they see as the coming age of the technology.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the biggest player in the cloud industry, claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Meta (NASDAQ:META) Q4 Sales Beat Estimates, Stock Soars\n\nSocial network operator Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) reported Q4 FY2023 results topping analysts' expectations , with revenue up 24.7% year on year to $40.11 billion. Guidance for next quarter's revenue was also optimistic at $35.75 billion at the midpoint, 5.5% above analysts' estimates. It made a GAAP profit of $5.33 per share, improving from its profit of $3.14 per share in the same quarter last year.\n\nIs now the time to buy Meta? Find out by accessing our full research report, it's free.\n\nMeta (META) Q4 FY2023 Highlights:\n\nRevenue: $40.11 billion vs analyst estimates of $39.17 billion (2.4% beat) EPS: $5.33 vs analyst estimates of $4.94 (7.9% beat) Revenue Guidance for Q1 2024 is $35.75 billion at the midpoint, above analyst estimates of $33.87 billion Free Cash Flow of $11.51 billion, down 17.3% from the previous quarter Gross Margin (GAAP): 80.8%, up from 78.6% in the same quarter last year Family Monthly Active People: 3.98 billion, up 240 million year on year Market Capitalization: $1.00 trillion\n\n\"We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow,\" said Mark Zuckerberg, Meta founder and CEO.\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Facebook Reality Labs.\n\nSocial Networking\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nSales Growth\n\nMeta's revenue growth over the last three years has been solid, averaging 18.1% annually. This quarter, Meta beat analysts' estimates and reported decent 24.7% year-on-year revenue growth.\n\nStory continues Meta Total Revenue\n\nGuidance for the next quarter indicates Meta is expecting revenue to grow 24.8% year on year to $35.75 billion, improving on the 2.6% year-on-year increase it recorded in the same quarter last year.\n\nIt’s not often you find a high-quality company at a significant discount to its historical P/E multiple, but that’s exactly what we found. Click here for your FREE report on this attractive Network Effect stock at a very silly price.\n\nUsage Growth\n\nAs a social network, Meta generates revenue growth by increasing its user base and charging advertisers more for the ads each user is shown.\n\nOver the last two years, Meta's monthly active users, a key performance metric for the company, grew 5.2% annually to 3.98 billion. This growth lags behind the hottest consumer internet apps. Meta Family Monthly Active People\n\nIn Q4, Meta added 240 million monthly active users, translating into 6.4% year-on-year growth.\n\nRevenue Per User\n\nAverage revenue per user (ARPU) is a critical metric to track for consumer internet businesses like Meta because it measures how much the company earns from the ads shown to its users. ARPU can also be a proxy for how valuable advertisers find Meta's audience and its ad-targeting capabilities. Meta ARPU\n\nMeta's ARPU growth has been subpar over the last two years, averaging 1.9%. The company's ability to increase prices while maintaining its monthly active users, however, shows the value of its platform. This quarter, ARPU grew 17.2% year on year to $10.08 per user.\n\nKey Takeaways from Meta's Q4 Results\n\nWe were impressed by Meta's revenue, operating income, and EPS growth this quarter, which all blew past analysts' estimates. These beats were driven by better-than-expected daily and monthly active users along with a 21% year-on-year increase in ad impressions. Meta also saw a 2% tailwind in advertising pricing. Commentary across the sector suggests the advertising market is likely to rebound in 2024, partly explaining why Meta had a strong quarter.\n\nLooking ahead, Meta's Q1 2024 revenue guidance topped Wall Street's forecast while its anticipated full-year 2024 capital expenditures came in slightly higher. The company expects this capex growth to come from investments in servers, including AI and non-AI hardware (you're welcome, Nvidia), and data centers as it ramps up construction for its new data center architecture. These investments will be key for its open-source large language model, Llama, to successfully compete against OpenAI's closed-source ChatGPT.\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of the quarter was the announcement of a quarterly dividend - the first in the company's history. Stockholders as of February 22, 2024 are set to receive $0.50 per share per quarter.\n\nOverall, we think this was a really good quarter that should please shareholders. The stock is up 8.3% after reporting and currently trades at $427.75 per share.\n\nSo should you invest in Meta right now? When making that decision, it's important to consider its valuation, business qualities, as well as what has happened in the latest quarter. We cover that in our actionable full research report which you can read here, it's free.\n\nOne way to find opportunities in the market is to watch for generational shifts in the economy. Almost every company is slowly finding itself becoming a technology company and facing cybersecurity risks and as a result, the demand for cloud-native cybersecurity is skyrocketing. This company is leading a massive technological shift in the industry and with revenue growth of 50% year on year and best-in-class SaaS metrics it should definitely be on your radar.",

Our guidance assumes foreign currency is neutral to year-over-year total revenue growth, based on current exchange rates.\n\nWe expect full-year 2024 total expenses to be in the range of $94-99 billion, unchanged from our prior outlook. We continue to expect a few factors to be drivers of total expense growth in 2024:\n\nFirst, we expect higher infrastructure-related costs this year. Given our increased capital investments in recent years, we expect depreciation expenses in 2024 to increase by a larger amount than in 2023. We also expect to incur higher operating costs from running a larger infrastructure footprint.  Second, we anticipate growth in payroll expenses as we work down our current hiring underrun and add incremental talent to support priority areas in 2024, which we expect will further shift our workforce composition toward higher-cost technical roles.  Finally, for Reality Labs, we expect operating losses to increase meaningfully year-over-year due to our ongoing product development efforts in augmented reality/virtual reality and our investments to further scale our ecosystem.\n\nWe anticipate our full-year 2024 capital expenditures will be in the range of $30-37 billion, a $2 billion increase of the high end of our prior range. We expect growth will be driven by investments in servers, including both AI and non-AI hardware, and data centers as we ramp up construction on sites with our previously announced new data center architecture. Our updated outlook reflects our evolving understanding of our artificial intelligence (AI) capacity demands as we anticipate what we may need for the next generations of foundational research and product development. While we are not providing guidance for years beyond 2024, we expect our ambitious long-term AI research and product development efforts will require growing infrastructure investments beyond this year.\n\nAbsent any changes to U.S. tax law, we expect our full-year 2024 tax rate to be in the mid-teens.\n\nIn addition, we continue to monitor the active regulatory landscape, including the increasing legal and regulatory headwinds in the EU and the U.S. that could significantly impact our business and our financial results. Of note, the Federal Trade Commission is seeking to substantially modify our existing consent order and impose additional restrictions on our ability to operate. We are contesting this matter, but if we are unsuccessful it would have an adverse impact on our business.\n\nThis was a pivotal year for our company. We increased our operating discipline, delivered strong execution across our product priorities, and improved advertising performance for the businesses who rely on our services. We will look to build on our progress in each of those areas in 2024 while advancing our ambitious, longer-term efforts in AI and Reality Labs.\n\nWebcast and Conference Call Information\n\nMeta will host a conference call to discuss the results at 1:30 p.m. PT / 4:30 p.m. ET today.

These forward-looking statements are only predictions and may differ materially from actual results due to a variety of factors including: the impact of macroeconomic conditions on our business and financial results, including as a result of geopolitical events; our ability to retain or increase users and engagement levels; our reliance on advertising revenue; our dependency on data signals and mobile operating systems, networks, and standards that we do not control; changes to the content or application of third-party policies that impact our advertising practices; risks associated with new products and changes to existing products as well as other new business initiatives, including our metaverse efforts; our emphasis on community growth and engagement and the user experience over short-term financial results; maintaining and enhancing our brand and reputation; our ongoing privacy, safety, security, and content review efforts; competition; risks associated with government actions that could restrict access to our products or impair our ability to sell advertising in certain countries; litigation and government inquiries; privacy, legislative, and regulatory concerns or developments; risks associated with acquisitions; security breaches; our ability to manage our scale and geographically-dispersed operations; and market conditions or other factors affecting the payment of dividends. These and other potential risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ from the results predicted are more fully detailed under the caption \"Risk Factors\" in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q filed with the SEC on October 26, 2023, which is available on our Investor Relations website at investor.fb.com and on the SEC website at www.sec.gov. Additional information will also be set forth in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2023. In addition, please note that the date of this press release is February 1, 2024, and any forward-looking statements contained herein are based on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable as of this date. We undertake no obligation to update these statements as a result of new information or future events.\n\nFor a discussion of limitations in the measurement of certain of our community metrics, see the section entitled \"Limitations of Key Metrics and Other Data\" in our most recent quarterly or annual report filed with the SEC.\n\nNon-GAAP Financial Measures\n\nTo supplement our condensed consolidated financial statements, which are prepared and presented in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), we use the following non-GAAP financial measures: revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, advertising revenue excluding foreign exchange effect, and free cash flow. The presentation of these financial measures is not intended to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for, or superior to, financial information prepared and presented in accordance with GAAP. Investors are cautioned that there are material limitations associated with the use of non-GAAP financial measures as an analytical tool. In addition, these measures may be different from non-GAAP financial measures used by other companies, limiting their usefulness for comparison purposes. We compensate for these limitations by providing specific information regarding the GAAP amounts excluded from these non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nWe believe these non-GAAP financial measures provide investors with useful supplemental information about the financial performance of our business, enable comparison of financial results between periods where certain items may vary independent of business performance, and allow for greater transparency with respect to key metrics used by management in operating our business.\n\nWe exclude the following items from our non-GAAP financial measures:\n\nForeign exchange effect on revenue. We translated revenue for the three months and full year ended December 31, 2023 using the prior year's monthly exchange rates for our settlement or billing currencies other than the U.S. dollar, which we believe is a useful metric that facilitates comparison to our historical performance.\n\nPurchases of property and equipment; Principal payments on finance leases. We subtract both purchases of property and equipment, net of proceeds and principal payments on finance leases in our calculation of free cash flow because we believe that these two items collectively represent the amount of property and equipment we need to procure to support our business, regardless of whether we procure such property or equipment with a finance lease. We believe that this methodology can provide useful supplemental information to help investors better understand underlying trends in our business. Free cash flow is not intended to represent our residual cash flow available for discretionary expenditures.\n\nFor more information on our non-GAAP financial measures and a reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures, please see the \"Reconciliation of GAAP to Non-GAAP Results\" table in this press release.\n\nMETA PLATFORMS, INC.\n\nCONDENSED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME\n\n(In millions,

        "title": "Unlike Alphabet That Seems Locked In The AI Battle, Microsoft Shined With Its Quarterly Results",
        "content": "On Tuesday, Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) reported their quarterly results. While Alphabet disappointed Wall Street as its holiday-season advertising sales were short of expectations, Microsoft topped analyst estimates. On Wednesday, Microsoft also became the second-ever company worth $3 trillion, joining Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) with its value topping that of France’s GDP.\n\n2024’s Fiscal Second Quarter\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Microsoft reported revenue rose roughly 17.5% YoY to $62 billion, topping analyst expectations of $61 billion. Net income grew 33% YoY to $21.9 billion, or $2.93 per diluted share, also topping Visible Alpha’s estimates of $20.6 billion or $2.77 per diluted share. Azure drove the overall cloud revenue up 20%, with personal computing revenue recording a 19% increase, while the productivity and business processes revenue grew 13%. Although Google also topped estimates with its Google Cloud revenue of $9.2 billion, Microsoft Azure grew faster at 30%, leaving behind Google Cloud whose growth reaccelerated from the previous quarter, but 25.7% was still a slower growth rate compared to last year's comparable quarter when growth amounted to 32%.\n\nAzure Is The Star Of The AI And Cloud Front\n\nMicrosoft proudly touted that Azure AI has 53,000 customers, a third of whom are new to the service as they came on board last year. Microsoft attributed this success to its service offering top performance for AI training, inference and a diverse selection of AI accelerators that include both in in-house chip, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nBy the words of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing it across every layer of its activities and offerings. Microsoft took an early leadership in the AI race with its ongoing partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI as well as developing its own AI tools and hardware. Nadella also mentioned the company’s AI tools are being used by corporation giants such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 7% year-to-date, while last year, they recorded more than a 40% increase due to the company’s prospects on the AI front. Together with Apple, Nvidia, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), these Magnificent 7 companies almost single-handedly pushed markets to new highs since 2024 kicked off. Together, the market cap of these seven stocks exceeds any country’s entire stock market except for the United States. As of last week, Nvidia and Microsoft alone made about 75% of the S&P 500’s gain this year. In a note that was published on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley believes that Microsoft’s play for AI “getting even stronger and therefore predicts more growth is ahead for the tech titan.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

What does this shift suggest about the landscape of the market?\n\nSynovus Trust Senior Portfolio Manager Daniel Morgan joins Yahoo Finance Live to discuss changes in investor sentiments toward Magnificent Seven.\n\nMorgan states that many investors are keeping a close eye on “AI-related tools,” to gauge its effectiveness and longevity: “We’re just looking for more evidence that AI is coming to fruition and it's actually pouring down to the bottom line, in terms of profit.” Morgan believes that tech stocks are “priced to perfection,” but signs of profit, specifically from AI is key, noting “there isn’t a lot of room for error.”\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Eyek Ntekim",

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms (META) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Growth stocks are attractive to many investors, as above-average financial growth helps these stocks easily grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nThat's because, these stocks usually carry above-average risk and volatility. In fact, betting on a stock for which the growth story is actually over or nearing its end could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, it's pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nHere are three of the most important factors that make the stock of this social media company a great growth pick right now.\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Meta Platforms is 15.6%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 23.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 19.6%.\n\nImpressive Asset Utilization Ratio\n\nGrowth investors often overlook asset utilization ratio, also known as sales-to-total-assets (S/TA) ratio, but it is an important feature of a real growth stock. This metric shows how efficiently a firm is utilizing its assets to generate sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nRight now, Meta Platforms has an S/TA ratio of 0.64, which means that the company gets $0.64 in sales for each dollar in assets. Comparing this to the industry average of 0.55, it can be said that the company is more efficient.\n\nIn addition to efficiency in generating sales, sales growth plays an important role. And Meta Platforms is well positioned from a sales growth perspective too. The company's sales are expected to grow 13.7% this year versus the industry average of 7.9%.\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Meta Platforms. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.5% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nMeta Platforms has not only earned a Growth Score of A based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #2 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination positions Meta Platforms well for outperformance, so growth investors may want to bet on it.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The Magnificent 7 Stocks have led the market higher for several years. The stocks within this cohort have delivered reliable returns over the long run. Many of the corporations in this group continue to grow and expand their market share.\n\nHowever, as corporations grow larger, they have fewer unexplored opportunities. Large corporations often face the challenge of decelerating revenue growth on the path to becoming mature companies.\n\nSmaller stocks have a chance to outperform the previous leaders. Smaller corporations can achieve higher revenue and earnings growth rates and have large addressable markets waiting to be explored.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors should look beyond the Magnificent 7 for compelling stock picks, and these growth stocks have great potential.\n\nSupermicro (SMCI) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen. The user's finger is about to press buy. Stock charts are in the background of the image. Momentum Stocks. S&P 600 Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Chompoo Suriyo / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) captivated investors in 2023 and Supermicro (NASDAQ:SMCI) looks ready to do the same this year. Elevated guidance implies the company will more than double its revenue year-over-year.\n\nThe higher guidance resembles how Nvidia significantly bumped its guidance and generated substantial demand for its artificial intelligence solutions. The stock is up by over 60% year-to-date and has outperformed Nvidia with its 1-year and 5-year stock gains.\n\nSupermicro offers critical server and storage solutions that can handle the workload of artificial intelligence tools. Big tech companies seeking to invest in artificial intelligence will need companies like Supermicro for their AI tools.\n\nEven GAAP diluted earnings per share experienced a significant upgrade in the new guidance. Prior guidance came in at an EPS between $3.75 and $4.24 while the new guidance calls for $4.90 to $5.05 in earnings per share. This significant upgrade came less than two weeks before Supermicro’s earnings date. Significant acceleration may become a norm for Supermicro in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another beneficiary of artificial intelligence. It’s a common trend investors will find among Magnificent 7 Stocks and the “up and coming” Magnificent 7 Stocks.\n\nBroadcom isn’t exactly up and coming. The tech giant already has a large presence in semiconductors and software. The firm produces an AI chip that is rapidly getting adopted and can potentially reach a $1 trillion market cap within a few years.\n\nBroadcom offers investors a 27-forward P/E ratio and a 1.70% dividend yield. Continued growth in artificial intelligence can help the company reach new heights and reward long-term investors.\n\nBroadcom revenue only inched up by 5% year-over-year in the third quarter of fiscal 2023. Net income increased by 5% year-over-year. Broadcom is repurchasing shares to elevate the stock price and reward long-term investors. The company’s net profit margins sit near 40%.\n\nThe stock has certainly performed like a Magnificent 7 Stocks over the years. Shares are up by 105% over the past year and have gained 361% over the past five years.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has also performed like a Magnificent 7 Stock for long-term investors. Shares are up by 113% over the past year and have gained 380% over the past five years. The company has profit margins that hover near 40% and a 36-forward P/E ratio.\n\nArista Networks is a cloud networking company that primarily works with corporations. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) are the company’s two largest customers. Arista Networks has a total of 8,000+ cloud customers worldwide. The company helps businesses increase their productivity, agileness, automation, and security.\n\nThe third quarter of 2023 was another successful showing for the tech company. Revenue increased by 28.3% year-over-year while GAAP net income increased by 54.0% year-over-year.\n\nThe press release features some comments from CEO Jayshree Ullal who stated that customer momentum “remained strong in both enterprise and cloud/AI sectors.”\n\nCloud computing and artificial intelligence seem to be the driving forces behind most of the Magnificent 7 Stocks. Arista Networks also has those tailwinds and is likely to reward long-term shareholders in the years ahead.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) is another leading cloud computing stock that has over 8,100 customers. The company now has a 99% renewal rate among its customers which is an improvement from last quarter’s 98% renewal rate.\n\nServiceNow’s customers have deep pockets and a strong need for the company’s software. The cloud giant has roughly 85% of all Fortune 500 corporations as its customers and has 11 product lines generating over $250 million in annual revenue.\n\nThe firm makes most of its revenue from subscriptions. ServiceNow reported $2.365 billion in subscription revenue in the fourth quarter which is a 25.5% year-over-year improvement in constant currency. The company closed out 2023 with $8.68 billion in annual recurring subscription revenue. The company achieved the same growth rate across the entire year — 25.5% — as it did in the 4th quarter.\n\nJust like Arista Networks, ServiceNow is also benefitting from artificial intelligence. ServiceNow CEO Bill McDermott shared this remark in the press release: “Generative AI is injecting new fuel into our already high‑performing engine. This is a breakthrough moment.”\n\nArtificial intelligence feels like a multi-year mega trend that still has plenty of room to run. ServiceNow is positioned to benefit from the AI boom.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) isn’t deeply intertwined with artificial intelligence like most of the stocks on this list. However, the fintech company earns a spot on this list due to its consistent returns over the years. Shares have gained more than 20% over the past year and have almost doubled over the past five years.\n\nVisa recently opened up fiscal 2024 with 9% year-over-year revenue growth and 17% year-over-year GAAP net income growth. The company has steadily grown over time and has maintained net profit margins above 50%.\n\nThose high margins give Visa plenty of flexibility to raise its dividend and initiate share buybacks. Visa more than doubled its dividend payout from 2019 to 2023 and continues to hike the dividend payments by over 10% each year.\n\nPeople will continue to use their credit cards in a slowing economy which gives Visa a healthy combination of growth and stability.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) is an e-commerce and fintech juggernaut based in Argentina. The firm has done its part in keeping up with the Magnificent 7 Stocks. MELI shares are up by 46% over the past year and have gained 377% over the past five years.\n\nMercadoLibre continues to deliver exceptional revenue and earnings growth. The company reported 39.8% year-over-year revenue growth in the third quarter of 2023. Net income jumped by 178.3% year-over-year.\n\nMercadoLibre has over 120 million daily active users which is up by 36.4% year-over-year. The firm does most of its business in Latin America, a region experiencing higher growth than most of North America and Europe.\n\nMany analysts are encouraging investors to load up on the stock. MELI has a “Strong Buy” rating on TipRanks based on the price targets from 12 analysts. The highest price target is $2,020 which implies a 16% upside. The average price target of $1,815.50 implies a 4.50% upside.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a rapidly growing cybersecurity giant that has amassed a $70 billion market cap. An 181% run-up over the past year has attracted many investors who believe shares can march higher.\n\nThe only weakness with this stock is its 81-forward P/E ratio. This stock is more volatile than most equities and can get dragged down during a correction. However, investors who buy and hold CRWD with a 5-year or a 10-year horizon have less to worry about.\n\nCrowdstrike delivered strong financials in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. Annual recurring revenue grew by 35% year-over-year to reach $3.15 billion. Revenue for the quarter reached $786.0 billion and was also up by 35% year-over-year.\n\nCrowdstrike also achieved record profitability with $26.7 million in net income. It represents a 148.5% year-over-year increase. Crowdstrike is currently sitting on $3.17 billion in cash which can help with making new acquisitions in the future.\n\nCybersecurity is a fundamental component of the digital web. Many hackers are trying to steal sensitive data and use ransomware to make demands. More businesses will turn to cybersecurity solutions like Crowdstrike to defend themselves.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in SMCI, AVGO, ANET, and NOW.

        "title": "Meta to report Q4 earnings as generative AI takes center stage",
        "content": "Fresh off of testifying before the Senate that his social media empire doesn’t hurt kids, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will now face shareholders as his company reports its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% as of Thursday morning. In January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark. We’re only a month into 2024, but so far Meta’s stock has outperformed the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nBut if Meta is going to keep up its hot streak, it’s going to need to deliver on continued ad sales growth, which should keep the spotlight off of its continued investment in the metaverse and its Reality Labs business.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are expecting Meta to post adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. That would mark a significant increase from the $32.2 billion in revenue the company generated in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnticipated advertising revenue is set to come in at $37.8 billion, up from $31.3 billion in Q4 2022. The number of Facebook daily active users is expected to top 2.07 billion, an increase from 2 billion last year. Family of apps daily active users should touch 3.11 billion, a sizable jump from the 2.96 billion the company reported in Q4 2022.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs, however, will continue to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, is expected to report operating losses of $4.1 billion. That, however, is down from the $4.3 billion the company lost on its endeavor last year.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nBut Meta’s Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in investors’ minds to the company’s increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company’s long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it’s capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIn his post, Zuckerberg also said Meta is building out its AI capabilities by spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThe company is already using generative AI features for advertisers to help them build out ads, and its Meta AI chatbot is available through its various apps.\n\nNow the company needs to tell Wall Street whether those investments are beginning to pay off.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Big Tech may have issues 'hitting some numbers,' strategist says",
        "content": "As some Big Tech companies prepare to release earnings on Thursday, Victoria Fernandez of Crossmark Global Investments weighs in on growth prospects. She believes \"there's going to be some difficulty, I think, in hitting some numbers that continue to make the stocks move higher,\" given lofty expectations.\n\nFernandez explains that stocks like the tech giants have already priced in anticipated gains from areas like AI monetization. This helps explain disappointing results from names like Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) recently. Of the tech titans, she sees Apple (AAPL) as most worrisome for investors, since it has been \"down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while,\" and faces a \"tricky\" path to meet forecasts.\n\nGiven high valuations, Fernandez notes she has been \"trimming\" tech holdings, advising investors not to \"go all in\" on those stocks. However, she singles out Microsoft as a top tech pick thanks to strengths in AI, cash flow, and balance sheet.\n\nWatch the video above to hear what Fernandez has to say about investing in Amazon.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: When you think about what we would need to see from these companies that are reporting later on today, what would be the overall tone, the tenor, or even the catalyst perhaps that the markets are able to latch on to?\n\nVICTORIA FERNANDEZ: I think it's going to be quite difficult, Brad, because as we've seen, they have had a huge run up. And I think it's part of the problem we saw with both Alphabet and Microsoft. You've had such large gains. People have already priced in that perfection of having the monetization of AI, which is something people have been waiting on.\n\nAnd then we're getting information on CapEx spending going to be much higher than what a lot of people anticipated. Margins maybe not being as high as some people wanted. So there's going to be some difficulty, I think, in hitting some numbers that continue to make the stocks move higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nObviously, Apple is probably the one that people are concerned about the most. It has been down versus the rest of that Magnificent Seven for a while, except for Tesla. And that one's been down too. But I think it'll be a little bit tricky for them to meet expectations.\n\nSEANA SMITH: So if they don't meet expectations, and we do see some pressure on these big names, how should investors be viewing that? Is that a buying opportunity?\n\nVICTORIA FERNANDEZ: Well, we've seen the NASDAQ pull back pretty significantly this week because of the earnings that we had. We don't think you want to go all in. We've actually been trimming a lot of these Magnificent Seven names, as they have been making highs, going in and trimming some of those positions.\n\nRight now, Microsoft is the only one we're actually above weight versus our benchmark. We're below weight on all the others. So if you don't have a neutral holding in there, could you go in on some of these and add? You could. But I think you need to be a little bit more diversified.\n\nThose names have been driving the market. And when you look at earnings, they're expected to be 80% year-over-year earnings growth in next quarter, as well. That's going to be a really hard level to beat. So I would be cautious.\n\nSEANA SMITH: What's the bullish thesis? Why do you think Microsoft is the best pick, it sounds like, of the seven right now?\n\nVICTORIA FERNANDEZ: I think when you look at balance sheets and you look at expectations, you look at where they stand with AI compared to some of the others, obviously, NVIDIA is run away with that. But Microsoft is so strong in that element and being able to monetize that is going to be key.\n\nTheir balance sheet is strong. Their free cash flow is good. So I think from that perspective, we always want to look at balance sheets, when we look at the companies we invest in. That's why Microsoft is probably one of our favorites.\n\nBRAD SMITH: And then when you think about the earnings Bellwether that we've continued to hear time and time again. Amazon. Both on the consumer side, but also on the big business to business purchasing side there.\n\nHow can this company perhaps give the markets a jolt for the rest of that can last the rest of the earnings season, perhaps.\n\nVICTORIA FERNANDEZ: Amazon, specifically, is that. Yeah so Amazon because they have so many different business elements. They're able to pull from different areas that maybe some of the other companies can't. And we've seen them do that in the past.\n\nObviously, AWS is going to be huge. We're going to see how that pulls in. Now, Azure had some issues in those earnings. The non-AI component of Azure was lower than what people thought. So we might see that coming in from Amazon as well.\n\nBut guys, we have had a strong consumer. So those will probably pull in from the retail side, and really be able to give it a boost there. So I think Amazon will do OK. But they've also come out and talked about layoffs.\n\nLayoffs are huge right now. We're seeing about 13% of the S&P 1500 companies that have reported talk about layoffs or announced layoffs already. That's more than double what you typically see in a bull market. So we need to be cautious on that.",

Tensions were high as senators entered a back-and-forth with the chief executives, grilling them over inaction to implement safety guidelines to protect younger users.\n\nSenator Richard Blumenthal (D-CT) and Senator Marsha Blackburn (R-TN), authors of the Kids Online Safety Act of 2023, join Yahoo Finance to discuss the key takeaways from the hearings and the importance of passing their bill.\n\nSenator Blumenthal affirms why his legislation is needed: \"They're making money because more eyeballs, more addictive content mean more advertising and more dollars to them. I think more than ever, I feel we need the Kids Online Safety Act to make sure that these tech executives are held accountable. And I will tell you, that as much as Mark Zuckerberg may have felt good about apologizing, or seeming to apologize, actions speak louder than words. And the actions of these tech companies is essentially to ignore the harm that they're doing and fail to act responsibly.\"\n\nSenator Blackburn comments on the bipartisan sentiments held toward social media platforms: \"One of the things Senator Blumenthal and I have talked about regularly as we have worked on this specific legislation and others of us who have worked on privacy, online privacy, we have talked about how you have the army of lawyers and lobbyists that fight us on putting in place regulation.

        "content": "The next slew of Big Tech earnings includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META), all scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. After several tech giants fell short of advertising revenue expectations, what should investors expect from these next big three?\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley highlights what investors will be paying the closest attention to, including Apple's iPhone demand in China, Amazon's AWS segment, and Meta's AI strategy.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the pressure is on for the three Magnificent Seven companies set to report their latest quarterly results after the bell this afternoon. Investors will be scrutinizing every word from leaders at Amazon, Apple, and Meta after the first three Mag Seven members, Tesla, Microsoft, and Alphabet failed to impress investors. We have our very own tech reporter Dan Howley with us.\n\nDan, we should say expectations are sky high. We've learned that from the other companies that have reported so far. What should investors be watching this afternoon?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Akiko, expectations are sky high. I mean Microsoft had a great report and you saw shares fall off. And then as far as Google, Alphabet goes they missed on ad sales and you saw what happened. They were getting hammered as a result of that.\n\nBut as far as Apple, Amazon, and Meta, let's go over some of the big numbers that people are going to be watching. Revenue and earnings per share, $2.11 on $117.9 billion for Apple. That's the big number.\n\nBut the number that most people are going to be watching is iPhone revenue. That's expected to come in at $68.6 billion. That would be up from the $65.7 billion they reported in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnd that's important because we've been getting reports from different analysts saying that overall in China, iPhone 15 sales are sluggish. And there's a number of reasons for that-- a resurgent Huawei, which is offering high-end phones at a cheaper price that can rival Apple, as well as the slower economic outlook in China itself. So there's a lot of kind of rumblings there. There's also some issues with the Mac and iPad line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as Meta goes, we're looking at earnings per share of $5.05 on revenue of $39 billion. The big number there that we're looking at is advertising revenue. That's expected to be $37.8 billion in the quarter up from $31.3 billion.\n\nAdvertising has really rebounded from Meta over the past few quarters. They seem to have figured out how to get around Apple's app transparency tracking or app tracking transparency. That really put a dent in their advertising, as well as the interest rate issues that we had seen where advertisers had pulled back.\n\nAnd then as far as Amazon goes, we're looking at just an EPS of $1.4 on revenue of $166 billion. And of course, the big item we're going to be looking at here is AWS, Amazon Web Services, with expected revenue of $24.2 billion. The generative AI, general AI conversation that we're seeing really does feed into cloud services like AWS.\n\nIf you look at what Microsoft had announced during its earnings, its Azure and general cloud services got a jump from AI. They said the intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure, had a 6% revenue bump from AI. That was up from 3% in the prior quarter. So you're seeing AI take hold for them. We'll have to see now if generative AI and the spending that Amazon has done on its own chips, inferencing things along those lines, start to pay off for AWS.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Dan, it's interesting because these are three very different companies. Obviously, Meta based in social media then expanded into devices. Apple, you think devices, software. And then you have Amazon, a bit of consumer, a bit of everything. How fair is it to stack them up against each other?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I think there's competing services across the mall. Advertising is a big piece of each of those three companies. You might not think of it with Apple, but they generate a lot of advertising revenue. Meta, they're chiefly advertising.\n\nAnd Amazon's advertising is huge now. It's a mega part of what they have to offer. And then there's other pieces where they compete with each other. Obviously, Meta and Apple are now going head to head starting tomorrow with the launch of the Vision Pro headset.\n\nFor Meta, that could be a good thing while Apple is getting all the fanfare because of the headset. It's interesting. It's a new Apple product that's generally going to generate a lot of buzz. It's $3,500, $3,499.\n\nA lot of people aren't going be able to afford that. And some analysts are expecting perhaps a knock on effect on Meta's headsets, the Quest 3, which is significantly cheaper, but offers an AR/VR experience like Apple's. It's not as good. The technology isn't nearly what Apple has to offer, but people can get a general sense of what AR and VR has to offer.\n\nI think the key thing for both of these companies when it comes to these devices is keeping people hooked. We've seen that Meta has had a problem with that, with some executives saying that people six months out don't necessarily stick around. And so for Apple, that's going to be a big deal. And then for Meta, if they do get that knock on effect, that's going to be a big deal.\n\nAnd obviously, generative AI is playing a part across the entire industry, Amazon being a big part. Meta is looking to get general artificial intelligence out, that's what Mark Zuckerberg said spending billions of dollars on NVIDIA AI chips. And Apple is reportedly expected to get into the generative AI game for consumers in the next version of iOS.\n\nSo they're working on that in the background. There's been reports of that for some time now. So they really do compete across a number of industries. It just feels like they're so different because of what the companies really are when you look at them as a monolith.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: No, you raise a fair point there. I appreciate that breakdown, our very own Dan Howley.",

        "title": "Amazon earnings preview: Expect updates on Prime Video ads and the future of AI",
        "content": "Amazon is scheduled to post quarterly earnings after the bell on Thursday, joining two fellow trillion-dollar giants and rounding out a week defined by high expectations and disappointment over tech results. Amazon's turn at Big Tech’s wave of reports will likely offer updates on AI development and its lucrative cloud business.\n\nInvestors will be looking for details about the growth of Amazon Web Services, in addition to insight into the company’s burgeoning ads operations. Earlier this week Amazon’s streaming service, Prime Video, began playing ads alongside movies and shows as the default option for users, who can pay extra for an ad-free version. Analysts have noted the significant potential for ad growth given the massive scale of Amazon’s built-in audience.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Amazon's most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue: $166.2 billion expected ($149.2 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $0.78 expected ($0.03 in Q4 2022) Amazon Web Services: $24.2 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q4 2022) Advertising: $14.2 billion expected ($11.6 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nOverall, Amazon stock achieved muscular gains last year, climbing more than 80%. And just last week the stock hit 52-week highs. But the momentum has slowed since then as investors recalibrate on tech. Amazon will report alongside Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) to wrap up Big Tech's quarterly reports.\n\nAmazon's showing arrives just weeks after the company eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios and announced a major reduction in staff at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, laying off more than 500 people. Staff cuts across tech highlight the sector's painful climb down from an era of rapid expansion, as companies are still resizing and retreating from ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nAmazon sees the potential for AI development to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to provide vital infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn September, the company launched its AI service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself. The price of Amazon stock is shown on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2017, in New York. Amazon reports their earnings on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat same month Amazon also said it would invest up to $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic as the biggest players in tech scramble for positioning in what they see as the coming age of the technology.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the biggest player in the cloud industry, claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nHow Wall Street will judge the performance of Amazon's cloud business depends in part on how it stacks up against Microsoft, its closest competitor, which reported cloud revenue earlier this week that beat estimates. But investors in recent days have applied a harsh rubric to tech earnings. Alphabet, another cloud and AI rival, exceeded expectations for its cloud segment. Investors, however, soured on the stock after the report, following lower-than-anticipated ad revenue.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for more detail on Amazon's vision for advertising. The company has roughly 96 million US Prime households, while a subset of that figure actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. \"We strongly believe that Amazon’s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks,\" analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Meta to deploy in-house custom chips this year to power AI drive",
        "content": "By Katie Paul, Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney\n\n(Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta Platforms plans to deploy into its data centers this year a new version of a custom chip aimed at supporting its artificial intelligence (AI) push, according to an internal company document seen by Reuters on Thursday.\n\nThe chip, a second generation of an in-house silicon line Meta announced last year, could help to reduce Meta's dependence on the Nvidia chips that dominate the market and control the spiraling costs associated with running AI workloads as it races to launch AI products.\n\nThe world's biggest social media company has been scrambling to boost its computing capacity for the power-hungry generative AI products it is pushing into apps Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and hardware devices like its Ray-Ban smartglasses, spending billions of dollars to amass arsenals of specialized chips and reconfigure data centers to accommodate them.\n\nAt the scale at which Meta operates, a successful deployment of its own chip could potentially shave off hundreds of millions of dollars in annual energy costs and billions in chip purchasing costs, according to Dylan Patel, founder of the silicon research group SemiAnalysis.\n\nThe chips, infrastructure and energy required to run AI applications has become a giant sinkhole of investment for tech companies, to some degree offsetting gains made in the rush of excitement around the technology.\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the plan to put the updated chip into production in 2024, saying it would work in coordination with the hundreds of thousands of off-the-shelf graphics processing units (GPUs) - the go-to chips for AI - the company was buying.\n\n\"We see our internally developed accelerators to be highly complementary to commercially available GPUs in delivering the optimal mix of performance and efficiency on Meta-specific workloads,\" the spokesperson said in a statement.\n\nMeta CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month said the company planned to have by the end of the year roughly 350,000 flagship \"H100\" processors from Nvidia, which produces the most sought-after GPUs used for AI. Combined with other suppliers, Meta would accumulate the equivalent compute capacity of 600,000 H100s in total, he said.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe deployment of its own chip as part of that plan is a positive turn for Meta's in-house AI silicon project, after a decision by executives in 2022 to pull the plug on the chip's first iteration.\n\nThe company instead opted to buy billions of dollars worth of Nvidia's GPUs, which have a near monopoly on an AI process called training that involves feeding enormous data sets into models to teach them how to perform tasks.\n\nThe new chip, referred to internally as \"Artemis,\" like its predecessor can perform only a process known as inference in which the models are called on to use their algorithms to make ranking judgments and generate responses to user prompts.\n\nReuters last year reported that Meta is also working on a more ambitious chip that, like GPUs, would be capable of performing both training and inference.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based company shared details about the first generation of its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA) program last year. The announcement portrayed that version of the chip as a learning opportunity.\n\nDespite those early stumbles, an inference chip could be considerably more efficient at crunching Meta's recommendation models than the energy thirsty Nvidia processors, according to Patel.\n\n\"There is a lot of money and power being spent that could be saved,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Katie Paul in New York and Stephen Nellis and Max A.

Several factors suggest that the semiconductor industry is poised to skyrocket in 2024.\n\nThe first tranche of funding from the CHIPS Act was released at the end of 2023. The strong government subsidization of chips is one such factor. Of course, 2023 was a seminal year for AI, deeply tied to semiconductors. Continued monetization of generative AI, in particular, will play a strong role.\n\nFurther, it’s reasonable to anticipate that we are early in a super cycle benefiting the semiconductor industry overall.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAppealing Chip Stocks: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nIt would have been best to own Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock before mid-January. That’s true because the company forecast 2024 revenue growth as high as 25% on Jan. 18. Those who owned shares then saw an immediate bump of roughly 10%.\n\nHowever, investors should still consider Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. One reason to believe so is that the company is still expected to contract in the fourth quarter. That forecast will continue to cause trepidation around investing in the company’s shares.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing expects revenue growth to occur in each quarter following Q4. In short, investors are highly optimistic about the strong 2024 guidance but likely remain cautious. That means investors will have an opportunity to choose between Q4 earnings and Q1 earnings.\n\nDuring that period, there will be ample opportunity for share prices to rise as the company provides more information regarding projected revenue growth. Given how integral TSM is to the semiconductor industry, it’s a bet worth making.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) NVIDIA company logo on smartphone against background of red stock chart. Business crisis, collapse of trading and investment, bankruptcy, falling value concept. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Sergio Photone / Shutterstock.com\n\nEvery investor knows that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been the biggest winner in the emergence of AI. Every investor also struggles with the idea that NVDA stock is currently overpriced. Those cautious investors continue to assume that a downturn is bound to ensue. The simple logic is that what goes up must come down.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Nvidia continues to prove more conservative investors wrong. 2024 was supposed to start off with a correction to Nvidia’s price. It hasn’t happened. Share prices began 2024 below $500 and have since eclipsed $600.\n\nPart of that continued optimism directly results from TSMC’s bullish outlook. It’s also due to Nvidia’s dominant position. Nvidia has massive leverage overall. That is reflected in demand and high prices for its h100 chip throughout 2023. The company will release its H200 chips this year. Expect firms to scramble to secure their supply of those chips as well.\n\nNvidia’s management knows that to be the case. Demand is solid. Further, Nvidia has monetized AI like no other firm has. That is the most substantial reason investors dismiss the notion that it is overpriced.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is the other most salient chip stock.\n\nMultiple factors continue to suggest that Advanced Micro Devices will continue to grow.\n\nFor one, the market is highly receptive to its competitive offering. The company is positioned to be Nvidia’s strongest challenger over the coming years. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), the two biggest buyers of Nvidia’s chips, signaled they would switch to AMD.\n\nThat news has catalyzed Advanced Micro Devices’ stock to new highs. Many investors have felt that they missed the boat on the opportunity. That isn’t the case. Multiple Wall Street houses recently Increased their target prices for AMD.\n\nAMD CEO Lisa SU projects AI data center chip spending to reach $400 billion by 2027. Even if AI data center spending only reaches 200 billion, that would equate to a 25% annual increase. That has led some on Wall Street to project a rapid adoption scenario that promises to quadruple AMD’s price over that period. It is also why I think it is one of the most appealing chip stocks.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) remains a strong AI stock investment for more conservative investors. QCOM shares offer a dividend – an indication of stability – last reduced in 2003.\n\nQualcomm is approaching the artificial intelligence opportunity differently than many of the more prominent players. Generative AI has been the dominant factor in the emergence of AI overall. Data center opportunities are not far behind.\n\nQualcomm sees a lot of its opportunity in AI coming from a slightly different space: Automotive use cases. That’s where CEO Cristiano Aman said he sees opportunities when he spoke at the Davos World Economic Forum recently. In particular, electric vehicles. EVs require roughly 3,000 chips per vehicle, whereas on average, internal combustion engine vehicles use half that.\n\nQualcomm is clearly making a run at establishing a strong position in that sector. Though the electric vehicle industry is going through growing pains, it continues to grow. The opportunity is not going to die. Qualcomm is positioning itself to take advantage of the proliferation of chips in those vehicles. Its overall stability and growth opportunities create a robust investment opportunity.\n\nMicron Technology (MU) Why 5G – Not Memory Pricing – is Key Driver for Micron Stock\n\nSource: Charles Knowles / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicron Technology (NASDAQ:MU) had a tough year in 2023. The memory chip stock was subject to a downturn in demand for memory chips that hurt the sector overall.\n\nThe memory chip sector itself is known to be highly volatile. Analysts note that though the sub-sector is prone to rapid deterioration, the opposite is also true. Wedbush analyst Matt Bryson said as much while noting that he believes the memory sector is in the early stages of a rebound.\n\nThat opinion substantiates projections from Samsung and SK Hynix – the world’s two largest memory makers – that demand weakness bottomed out in late 2023.\n\nCyclicality characterizes the semiconductor industry. The artificial intelligence super cycle may just be getting started despite how impressive 2023 was. Now, it appears that the memory chip subsector is also entering an upward cycle.\n\nMicron Technology is one of the better-known choices in that sub-sector. It is also one of the most appealing chip stocks, in my view.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nThe recent performance of ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) stock is very telling of its continued investment opportunity. A Barron’s article characterized ASML’s recent blowout earnings as a sign of better times ahead. Revenues grew by a full 30% in 2023, and 4th quarter earnings were even stronger than anticipated.\n\nRevenues at ASML reached €7.24 billion, besting expectations of €6.68 billion in sales for the quarter.\n\nEarnings, too, were better than anticipated.\n\nExpectations from ASML management are not as optimistic as those in Barron’s headline. CEO Peter Wennick expects 2024 to be similar to 2023 and offers a conservative outlook. He believes 2025 will be a particularly strong year for the company, marked by significant growth.\n\nIt’s an interesting comment because ASML has been volatile price-wise over the last 12 months. It is also the only firm capable of doing what it does. No other firms can match its technological prowess or produce the complex lithography machines ASML uses in chip manufacturing. The fact that Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing recently gave such strong guidance for 2024 suggests that lithography machine sales could indeed jump substantially before 2025.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) Is another picks-and-shovels stock In the chip industry. Like ASML, Applied Materials plays an essential role in chip Manufacturing. It provides the equipment required in the chip manufacturing process.\n\nOne of the primary reasons to believe that demand will be strong in 2024 relates to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing’s recent comments. A 25% increase in TSMC sales should spur equipment sales overall.\n\nAs my colleague Terel Miles recently noted, Applied Materials had a very strong year in 2023. Share prices increased dramatically as the company bested multiple metrics during the year. The company further cemented its position as one of the leading suppliers to the chip industry, which is positioned to grow. Applied Materials didn’t see its top line grow much during 2023, but it did increase efficiency with earnings growth that outpaced sales growth by a factor of three. AMAT shares remain a solid choice.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech’s struggle to meet lofty investor expectations this earnings season has taken air out of a record-breaking stock run. Pressure is now on Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to come through on Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty Deutsche Bank Plans To Cut 3,500 Jobs And Lift Payouts House Passes $78 Billion Business, Child Tax Break Bill Donald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier Musk’s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World’s Biggest Fortune\n\nThe sector has led the S&P 500 lower this week after results from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were met with selling by traders. Investors had bid up the stocks to records on bets that artificial intelligence efforts are set to provide a big lift to profits and sales.\n\n“The market seems to want more and more from these companies,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist of LPL Financial LLC. “The market knows it has gone too far too fast and is saying ‘unless you astound us, we’re going to bring you down a number of notches.’”\n\nBig Tech stocks powered the S&P 500’s rally into record territory in January, but if this week is to set the tone for the month ahead, signs are pointing to uncertainty. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index suffered its biggest drop in three months on Wednesday after earnings disappointed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a March interest rate cut. Futures pointed to a rebound Thursday, however.\n\nRead more: Microsoft, Alphabet and AMD Struggle to Meet AI Expectations\n\nApple’s results are top of mind for investors. The Cupertino, California-based company’s shares have reflected concerns over sluggish iPhone sales and its slow-moving approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to report about $118 billion in revenue for its first fiscal quarter, 1% higher than the same period a year ago. If the company meets the estimate, it would mark its first revenue expansion after four-consecutive quarters of declining sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nA narrow return to growth would come despite global challenges for Apple, which include Chinese restrictions on foreign technology and antitrust scrutiny in Europe. While the firm earned its reputation as one of the Magnificent Seven of 2023, jumping nearly 50% and hitting a record as recently as December, the stock has struggled this year.\n\nAt Amazon, the focus will be on its Amazon Web Services business, as well as expectations for its advertising segment after rolling out ads on the Prime Video service in the US.\n\nAWS sales are expected to expand 12% to $24 billion of Amazon’s projected $166 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit is expected to nearly quadruple.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta Platforms is expected to deliver revenue of $39 billion in the fourth quarter, a 21% jump from the previous period. Of the three, the stock has posted the biggest gain in 2024, up 10%.\n\nThe company could begin to show some payoff from its AI investments, Bank of America analysts led by Justin Post wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nThe long game\n\nOf course, even though tech stocks face a difficult setup in the coming weeks, it doesn’t necessarily signal that the sector’s market-leading rally is destined to end in the near future.\n\nThat’s because the top technology firms are still seen as safe bets for investors looking to protect their portfolios against a potential economic downturn or further geopolitical uncertainty - they have strong balance sheets and are expected to continue to grow earnings.\n\n“They are the destination in nearly any scenario,” because of the different macro backdrops they’ve navigated, said Krosby.\n\nAnd a pullback in Big Tech after all-time highs isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, especially if coupled with buying in smaller companies, showing a broadening of 2023’s rally. It could also provide bulls with opportunities to add to their positions.\n\n“These are still the stocks that you want to be in and it’s giving investors an opportunity to buy the dip,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp. climbed 24% in January, its biggest monthly jump since May, in a clear indication that the chip giant is continuing to benefit from the artificial intelligence frenzy that gripped Wall Street over the past year. The rally dwarfed the 1.9% gain the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index made in the same period.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIn an unscripted scene during tense testimony Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tempers expectations that the central bank will soon begin to slash interest rates, as he seeks further evidence that inflation in the U.S. is continuing to cool. The Fed also holds borrowing costs at 23-year highs after its latest policy meeting, but ditches prior language flagging the potential of additional hikes. U.S. stocks slip after the gathering, while investors gear up for a fresh batch of earnings from tech giants, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n1. Fed's Powell tempers hopes for imminent rate cuts\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has poured yet another bucket of cold water on recent hopes that the central bank would soon start to cut interest rates.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Powell noted that a reduction as soon as March were not his \"base case\" despite growing signs of cooling inflation. Instead, Powell and other Fed officials said they want to gain \"greater confidence\" that price growth is indeed easing before they consider slashing borrowing costs.\n\nThe official statement from the Fed also said risks from full employment and low inflation were \"moving into better balance,\" while any mention of \"additional policy firming\" was removed completely. The language was translated by many to mean that the world's most influential central bank had finally called time on an aggressive tightening cycle that bumped rates up to more than two-decade highs.\n\nHowever, analysts at ING flagged that the Fed recognizes its credibility was damaged after it asserted that \"inflation is transitory\" in 2021 only to reverse course with significant rate increases over the next two years. \"The last thing the Fed wants to do is get it wrong again at a key turning point, loosen too soon, too quickly and reignite inflation pressures,\" the ING analysts said.\n\nMarkets have subsequently dialed down prior bets for an early spring cut of 25 basis points, with the CME Group's closely-monitored Fed Watch Tool now showing a 35% possibility of such a scenario. In late December, when traders were buoyed by surprisingly dovish Fed commentary following its previous meeting, that chance stood at 73%.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures edge higher post Fed decision\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed into the green on Thursday, as traders digested Powell's comments and looked ahead to a slate of megacap earnings (see below).\n\nBy 05:03 ET (10:03 GMT), the Dow futures contract had inched up by 47 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had gained 16 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 95 points or 0.6%.\n\nThe main averages ended the prior session lower, as sentiment was dented by the diminishing expectations for a March interest rate cut and Powell's cautious statements. The benchmark S&P 500 shed 1.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped by 2.2%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.8%.\n\nWeighing on equities was a slide in shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both of the rival tech giants warned of rising costs needed to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, offsetting what were otherwise solid quarterly returns.\n\n3. Tech giants to report\n\nMega-cap tech stocks Amazon, Apple and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms all set to unveil their latest quarterly figures after the closing bell on Thursday.\n\nThe health of Amazon's AWS cloud computing division will likely be in focus, while analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's iPhone sales and the advertising revenue Meta has generated with its Reels short-form video offering. The AI arms race could also be a major focus for analysts, as they attempt to gauge how much each firm expects to spend on developing the nascent technology.\n\nAlong with Microsoft and Alphabet, these companies make up five of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks which have largely driven a rally in equity markets this year.\n\nElsewhere, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported a fiscal second-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, although investors were concerned that the San Diego-based AI chipmaker is losing crucial market share in China. Shares were lower in premarket U.S. trading after they seesawed in after-hours dealmaking.\n\n4. Musk says Tesla to hold investor vote on Texas incorporation\n\nElon Musk has said that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will hold a shareholder vote on shifting its corporate registration to the U.S. state of Texas, after a judge in Delaware invalidated his massive $56 billion compensation package.\n\nJudge Kathaleen McCormick voided the pay package on Tuesday, arguing that it was an \"unfathomable sum\" that was ultimately unfair to investors and negotiated by a directors of board who appeared to be overawed by a \"Superstar CEO.\"\n\nMusk wrote on his X social media platform shortly after the ruling: \"Never incorporate your company in [...] Delaware.\" He later held a poll on X asking users if Tesla should incorporate in Texas, and more than 87% of over 1.1 million respondents were in favor of the shift.\n\nCiting the poll, Musk said on X that the electric carmaking giant Tesla will \"move immediately\" to put the decision to investors. Tesla already has a significant interest in Texas: the company switched its corporate headquarters from California to the southern U.S. state in 2021.\n\n5. Crude higher with OPEC+ meeting in focus\n\nCrude prices inched up on Thursday, as traders awaited the latest meeting of the OPEC+ oil group.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $76.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by 0.7% to $81.12 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, is set to hold a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee later in the day -- its first major gathering of 2024.\n\nThe meeting is not expected to result in any changes to production, particularly after the difficulties the group had in agreeing output cuts late in 2023.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell's rate comments, tech giants to report - what's moving markets\n\nBank of England says rates 'under review' as inflation to dip below 2%\n\nAmer Sports set to return to public markets after discounted US IPO",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg's long apology tour: A brief history",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — When Mark Zuckerberg turned at a Senate hearing to address the parents of children exploited, bullied or driven to self harm via social media, it felt like a time-worn convention had sprung back to life.\n\n“I'm sorry for everything you've been through,” the Meta CEO said Wednesday. “No one should go through what you and your families have suffered.” Then he returned to corporate mode, noting Meta's continued investments in “industry-wide” efforts to protect children.\n\nZuckerberg has accumulated a long history of public apologies, often issued in the wake of crisis or when Facebook users rose up against unannounced — and frequently unappreciated — changes in its service. It's a history that stands in sharp contrast to most of his peers in technology, who generally prefer not to speak publicly outside of carefully stage-managed product presentations. But it's also true that Facebook has simply had a lot to apologize for.\n\nWhether or not the public always buys his apologies, there's little doubt that Zuckerberg finds it important to make them himself. Here's a quick, and by no means comprehensive, compendium of some notable Zuckerberg apologies and the circumstances that brought them on.\n\nBLINDED BY BEACON\n\nFacebook's first big privacy blow-up entailed a service called Beacon, which the platform launched in 2007. Intended to usher in a new age of “social” advertising, Beacon tracked user purchases and activities on other sites and then published them on friends' newsfeeds without requesting permission. After a huge backlash — well, it was huge at the time — Zuckerberg wrote in a blog post partially transcribed by TechCrunch that “we’ve made a lot of mistakes building this feature, but we’ve made even more with how we’ve handled them.” Beacon didn't last much longer.\n\nMOCKING FACEBOOK'S EARLY USERS\n\nIn one of the earliest stories of Facebook's founding, a 19-year-old Mark Zuckerberg mocked the roughly 4,000 students who'd joined his nascent service, bragging to friends in text messages about the vast amount of personal information he'd collected thanks to the misplaced trust of his users. Zuckerberg called them “dumb” and punctuated the word with profanity. When Silicon Alley Insider, a predecessor to Business Insider, published those messages in 2010, Zuckerberg apologized during an interview for a New Yorker article, saying he “absolutely” regretted those remarks.\n\nStory continues\n\nBURYING A FEDERAL SETTLEMENT\n\nOn Nov. 9, 2011, the Federal Trade Commission subjected Facebook to stricter privacy oversight after finding that the company arbitrarily made private information public without notice, failed to limit data sharing with apps when users activated restrictive settings, shared personal information with advertisers after saying it wouldn't, and more.\n\nThe same day, Zuckerberg posted a 1,418 word essay grandly titled “ Our Commitment to the Facebook Community ” that didn't mention the FTC action until a third of the way in and described blunders like Beacon as “a bunch of mistakes.\"\n\nVR TOUR OF A DISASTER ZONE\n\nZuckerberg's fascination with virtual reality long predated his decision to rename the company Facebook as Meta Platforms. On Oct. 9, 2017, he and a Facebook employee starred in a live VR tour of Puerto Rico in the immediate aftermath of Hurricane Maria. The pair beamed themselves into prerecorded 3-D footage of the damage and recovery efforts; Zuckerberg described the you-are-there feeling as “one of the really magical things about virtual reality,\" especially given, as he said, that “it's a really tough place to get to now.”\n\nHe later expounded on Facebook's own recovery efforts, but the dissonant video drew so many complaints that Zuckerberg posted a brief apology in the video chat, explaining that his attempt to showcase Facebook's efforts at disaster recovery weren't very clear and apologizing to anyone who was offended.\n\nCAMBRIDGE ANALYTICA\n\nIn 2018, news broke that Facebook had allowed apps to scrape large amounts of data from user accounts and those of their friends without oversight. While hundreds of apps were involved, attention soon focused on one that captured data from 87 million Facebook users and forwarded it to a U.K. political data-mining firm called Cambridge Analytica that had ties to then-President Trump's political strategist Steve Bannon. That data was reportedly used to target voters during the 2016 U.S. presidential campaign that resulted in Trump's election.\n\nZuckerberg first apologized for the scandal on CNN, saying that Facebook has a “responsibility” to protect its users’ data, and that if it fails, “we don’t deserve to have the opportunity to serve people.” He gave a version of that apology later that year in testimony before Congress, saying that “we didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility” while also failures in cracking down on fake news and hate speech, poor data privacy controls and not adequately addressing foreign interference in the 2016 elections on Facebook.",

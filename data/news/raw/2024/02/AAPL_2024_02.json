        "title": "Apple’s generative AI plans are suddenly a lot more important to its future",
        "content": "The Apple (AAPL) car is dead. And with no big, splashy products to look forward to, Wall Street is pinning its hopes for the tech giant’s immediate future on, what else, generative AI.\n\nIn his initial report on Apple’s decision to shutter its automotive efforts, Bloomberg’s Mark Gurman said a number of the 2,000 employees previously assigned to the project will move over to the company’s artificial intelligence division where they’ll work on getting Apple’s generative AI chops up to snuff.\n\nThe news helped briefly buoy shares of Apple Tuesday, sending them to an intraday high of $183.92 before closing out the day at $182.63. Shares of Apple were trading at $180.33 midday Thursday.\n\nApple is the second-wealthiest company in the world by market valuation, behind only Microsoft (MSFT), with a market cap of $2.77 trillion. But the iPhone maker is also contending with a choppy smartphone market that has investors wondering where the company’s next leg of growth will come from.\n\nAnd, short of a fully redesigned iPhone, it looks like generative AI is the only new product that could help goose device and services sales. Apple CEO Tim Cook gestures at Apple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., June 5, 2023. (Loren Elliott/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBut Apple, as is its M.O., has been tight-lipped about its generative AI efforts. CEO Tim Cook hasn’t offered any insights into the kind of capabilities the company is exploring via the technology or if they’ll come to market this year.\n\nDuring Apple’s latest earnings call, Cook said he is excited to show off what the company has been working on and that it will debut its efforts this year. He later said generative AI is a huge opportunity for Apple. During the company’s annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday, the CEO said Apple is investing significantly in AI and will break new ground in generative AI later this year.\n\nThat means we’ll likely learn more about Apple’s generative AI plans during its upcoming WWDC conference, which typically takes place in June. And the pressure is on for those announcements to be more than a few new photo editing tools or kitschy features that let you change the tone of your text messages to sound like Shakespeare.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We believe Apple is set to launch a host of new Gen AI software features at WWDC in early June, which we see as a key event helping to catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle,” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring wrote in a note following the Bloomberg report.\n\nIn his own note, Wedbush’s Dan Ives said he believes “Apple will incorporate generative AI into iPhone 16 and this will mark the start of a new frontier of growth for the golden installed base of Cupertino.” What’s more, he said the addition of the former vehicle engineers and developers could accelerate Apple’s AI initiatives over the next 12 to 18 months. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe generative AI craze has driven shares of Apple’s rivals ever higher, including Microsoft, which eclipsed Apple as the most valuable publicly traded company thanks to its investments in ChatGPT developer OpenAI. Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and others have similarly jumped on the generative AI bandwagon with their own announcements and product launches.\n\nBut diving into the deep end of generative AI is a double-edged sword. Sure, those companies get the fanfare and excitement that comes along with a new generative AI-powered service, but when those services falter, tech firms are left holding the bag. Just look at Google, which pulled its Gemini AI image generator after the software produced images of ethnically diverse Nazis.\n\nThat adds additional pressure to Apple to not only hit the market with a bang but also ensure what it rolls out is as bulletproof as possible. We’ll find out if the company has the goods when WWDC kicks off in June.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Posted Record-Breaking Quarters",
        "content": "Earnings season continues to wind down, with the bulk of notable companies already delivering quarterly results. The cycle has primarily been positive, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong performance that has uplifted the overall earnings picture.\n\nAnd throughout the period, there have been several companies delivering results that reflected quarterly records, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the performance of each over the last year, with the S&P 500 blended in as a benchmark. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nApple\n\nMarket-favorite Apple posted quarterly sales of nearly $120 billion and record EPS of $2.18, exceeding our consensus expectations by 1.7% and 4.3%, respectively. Sales grew 2% year-over-year, whereas EPS showed 16% growth.\n\nStill, EPS wasn’t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% from the same period last year. Services revenue has become a nice growth driver for Apple overall, helping to decrease its reliance on the iPhone.\n\nIt’s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate, snapping a streak of recent surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares couldn’t hold positivity post-earnings, with AAPL shares down nearly 7% YTD and underperforming the S&P 500 by a notable margin. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA\n\nNVIDIA’s quarterly release stole the market spotlight, undoubtedly the most highly-awaited release of the period following an unbelievable growth story stemming from the emergence of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company generated record Q4 revenue of $22.1 billion and posted EPS of $5.16, reflecting remarkable growth rates of 409% and 485%, respectively. Both items exceeded our consensus earnings and revenue expectations, representing beats of 13% and 8%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s top line trajectory is visibly bullish, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Data Center results were the real highlight of the release, which include sales of its AI chips. NVIDIA’s Data Center raked in a record $18.4 billion throughout the period, up an astonishing 410% on a year-over-year stack and reflecting the unrelenting demand the company has been enjoying.\n\nThe reported figure blew away our consensus estimate by nearly $1.5 billion, continuing a recent streak of Data Center positivity. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnalysts have been revising their earnings expectations higher for the company over the last year, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nCelsius Holdings\n\nCelsius just delivered its latest batch of quarterly results, with Q4 revenue of $347 million 95% higher than the year-ago period and reflecting a record. Quarterly earnings totaled $0.17 per share, above our consensus estimate and well above the $0.01 per share mark in the same period last year.\n\nShares have soared following the print, up a sizable 170% just over the last year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nResults were driven by strength across both International and North American markets, with sales of each growing 97% and 68% year-over-year, respectively. The company continues to win over new customers, also seeing an uptick in consumption occasions.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is slowly grinding to a halt, as the majority of notable companies have already delivered quarterly results. The Q4 cycle turned out to be positive, underpinned by the Technology sector’s strong growth.\n\nAnd throughout the period, several companies, including Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA, and Celsius Holdings CELH, have posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Don’t Panic! 7 Smart Stocks to Buy if the Markets Take a Tumble.",
        "content": "While the equities sector roars higher, it’s never a bad idea to consider stocks to buy for a down market. No, I’m not prognosticating an imminent calamity. Rather, I just think it’s smart to think ahead.\n\nEssentially, stocks to buy for a down market is Wall Street’s equivalent of an emergency kit. You do have one of those, don’t you? Because if you don’t, you should get one. Sure, it might seem like a waste of time and money, especially if an emergency doesn’t materialize. But that’s the thing – unexpected calamities have a way of being, you know, unexpected.\n\nSimilarly, I don’t think you’re going to get uber-rich with these stocks to buy for a down market. However, should the red ink start flying, you’re going to sleep easier buying these giants on the dip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nA pharmaceutical giant, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is now a more streamlined operation, having spun off its consumer health products division. While I have some reservations about the move, in the long run, it may unlock value for stakeholders prior to the spinoff. Looking ahead, though, J&J itself should benefit from rising permanent demand.\n\nAccording to Acumen Research and Consulting, the global pharmaceutical market reached a valuation of $1.5 trillion in 2022. Analysts anticipate that the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.4% from 2023 to 2032. At the forecast’s culmination point, the industry should be worth $2.8 trillion.\n\nAnother factor benefiting JNJ as one of the stocks to buy for a down market is the value proposition. Even without a downcycle, shares trade at a modest trailing-year earnings multiple of 13.29X. If the red ink starts flying, JNJ should be more attractive.\n\nAnalysts view the company as a consensus moderate buy with a $177.67 price target, implying 10% upside potential.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) KO stock PEP stock: a can of Coca-cola and a can of Pepsi on either side of a glass of brown soda and sitting on top of a pile of ice\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nA soft-drink giant, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) makes for an ideal play for stocks to buy for a down market because of everyday relevance. Recently, a few major enterprises have demanded an ultimatum regarding work from home: either come back to the office or kiss your job goodbye. With this sharp pivot from the pandemic days, demand for caffeinated products should rise.\n\nAt the same time, consumers have struggled with years of high inflation and spiked borrowing costs. People are still opening their wallets but many sectors have indicated concerns about waning capabilities. So, demand for expensive coffeeshops might fade. Cynically, the trade-down effect should benefit KO stock. The underlying product is cheap (and necessary), thus offering a superior alternative.\n\nTo be sure, KO isn’t exactly a sterling deal on paper. Nevertheless, it offers a forward dividend yield of 3.21%, combined with a payout increase going on 63 years. If you’re looking for stocks to buy for a down market, it doesn’t get much more trustworthy than Coca-Cola.\n\nTarget (TGT) tgt stock\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nOrdinarily, I might go with another big-box retailer other than Target (NYSE:TGT) for stocks to buy for a down market. Yeah, I’m talking about Walmart (NYSE:WMT). If the smelly stuff hits the proverbial fan, Walmart seems more capable of withstanding a wider economic hit. Based on the latest consumer demographic data, Walmart shoppers tend to align with realistic income brackets.\n\nOn the other hand, Target tends to align with consumers within higher income levels. Nevertheless, they both provide one-stop shopping experiences that allow them to stay relevant in the age of e-commerce. Further, what I appreciate about TGT stock specifically is that it’s more “technically” undervalued than WMT. The former security is up about 6% on a year-to-date basis while the latter gained over 12%.\n\nAlso, I can’t overlook the better value proposition in terms of passive income. Right now, Target offers a forward dividend yield of 2.91%. On the other hand, WMT is comparatively miserly with a yield of 1.39%. Analysts rate Target a consensus strong buy, which seems reasonable.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nA similar investment to Target and Walmart, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) should also be on your radar for stocks to buy for a down market. Fundamentally, I appreciate COST stock for its viable consumer demographics. The main takeaway is that shoppers tend to be younger and more upwardly mobile. In other words, Costco’s demo indicates that it starts at a high point and is only rising.\n\nFrom an investment standpoint – especially in a segment that overlaps with the broader discretionary retail space – I don’t think you can ask for much better. Now, here’s the thing with COST stock: I wouldn’t buy it at this juncture. Rather, if the market gives you a sizable dip because of some disastrous economic event, Costco is a name to pick up on the cheap.\n\nSome ideas you simply don’t trust when the red stains emerge. That’s because their questionable business models become even more suspect under sever economic duress. But Costco? The retailer has weathered multiple storms. Further, it enjoys natural insulation because of its educated, higher-wage-earning members.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nWhen it comes to stocks to buy for a down market, IBM (NYSE:IBM) is an “OG” stock. That’s slang for “original gangster” or “gangsta” if you’re really cool. Basically, Big Blue is an authentic, old-school technology investment. While everybody’s been going gaga over enterprises like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for facilitating artificial intelligence, IBM has been doing AI since most of you were born.\n\nAfter years of languishing in the shadows, it appears that the legacy tech juggernaut is finally receiving some dues. It’s not enough. However, I’m sure long-embattled stakeholders will take a 15% pop to start 2024. Also, in the past 52 weeks, IBM stock gained almost 45%.\n\nIf you peruse IBM-related stories on InvestorPlace, I’ve been pounding my fist on the table for a reason. While other companies may be playing cute games with digital intelligence, IBM has been forwarding real solutions. So, I trust that if heaven forbid a severe downturn impacts the market, I can trust Big Blue on any dips.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother major tech giant with a long history, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the contemporary beneficiaries of the AI boon. Since the start of January, MSFT stock gained just under 10% of market value. In the past 52 weeks, it shot up almost 66%. With everyone still head over heels regarding digital intelligence, Microsoft may continue to rise.\n\nHowever, if the market suffers some indigestion, MSFT would easily rank among the stocks to buy for a down market. It’s not just about the AI investments, which has proven fruitful. However, the utility of generative AI is questionable at this moment. What’s not questionable? Microsoft’s dominance in most other areas of productive technologies.\n\nFor example, the business world might implode without Microsoft’s suite of office products. Programs like Word and Excel – though they do have their quirks and issues – remain indispensable. Further, the company dominates the PC operating system market environment.\n\nIf you want to draw some cute pictures, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) might be a better bet. For everything else, there’s Microsoft. It’s a strong buy for a reason.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo be 100% clear, if you’re looking for a discounted opportunity, buying tech and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) right now is a tricky proposition. Just at a glance, you’re talking about a security that’s traded at a near-60X trailing-year earnings multiple. Not only that, the forward earnings multiple isn’t that much better at 41X. Still, if the red ink starts flying, AMZN should be on your watch list.\n\nIt’s real simple: the company has reached a knowledge-saturation point where it’s likely impossible to put the genie back in the bottle. With Amazon users enjoying the everyday convenience of product and food delivery, less incentive exists to shop in person. More than that, the company’s controversial role as the vacuum cleaner of small businesses everywhere has succeeded in one critical element: fostering effective economies of scale.\n\nThat might help to explain why even in an ecosystem impacted by stubbornly high inflation and interest rates, e-commerce as a percentage of total retail sales continues to rise since the second quarter of 2022.\n\nIt doesn’t make sense until you realize the (evil) genius behind Amazon. Clearly, it’s one of the stocks to buy for a down market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The technology world is constantly evolving, and investors are always looking discover the best revolutionary tech stocks of the moment. However, this requires a discerning eye to avoid pitfalls that lead to losing big money.\n\nMore often than not, investors should not just consider the upside risk of stocks but also the potential downside risk. While established companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) continue to innovate, there are other notable companies at the forefront of groundbreaking technologies. This includes areas such as artificial intelligence (AI), telecommunications, streaming and renewable energy.\n\nWhen investors have the ability to distinguish from the hype, they have the opportunity to get very rich in the next technological revolution.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNow, here are 3 revolutionary tech stocks that are set to skyrocket in 2024!\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) takes the cake as one of the top revolutionary tech stocks to buy in 2024. The semiconductor giant is set to make a mark in the generative AI space, and their core business is showing promising signs of a turnaround.\n\nQualcomm had itself a tough 2023 fiscal year, with revenue declining 19% YOY. Net income and EPS declined 44%, respectively. The company was still overcoming the semiconductor shortage in the back half of 2022, as well as the double digit declines in the handset market. Furthermore, there was a general weakness in IoT spending, heavily influenced by slower demand in the industrial market.\n\nHowever, their latest quarterly results are pointing to a recovery, and Qualcomm continues to make strategic investments into generative AI. In Q1 FY24, revenue increased 5% to $9.9 billion. EPS increased by 24% as they continue to build momentum for their Snapdragon platforms. Furthermore, the company plans to release a CPU AI chip (Snapdragon X Elite) this year expected to run generative AI models 2X faster than its competitors. With the handset segment posting 16% YoY growth in the quarter, this could be a positive sign of a swift recovery underway.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best in class tech stocks for 2024. Their new ad membership plan and cost-cutting measures in 2023 are laying the groundwork for accelerated growth. Furthermore, price increases have further demonstrated their pricing power capabilities, as they aim to increase streaming services market share.\n\nThe past 12 months have been transformative for Netflix, and a number of catalysts signal upside ahead. Netflix new ad-plan membership has been a game changer, and shareholders have yet to see the long-term revenue growth opportunities. The new ad-plan membership is growing 70% quarter over quarter, boosting Netflix’s FCF from operations.\n\nIn FY23, Netflix’s revenue grew 12% YoY, and operating margin expanded 300 basis points from FY22. However, what got Wall Street excited was the company’s FCF hitting a record $6.9 billion. Restructuring efforts, which also included cracking down on password sharing, has been extremely instrumental to the company’s goal of driving long-term shareholder value. Netflix’s pricing power has been a huge strategic advantage for the company, making them ripe for new highs in 2024.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is an American company in the world of computer networking and cloud computing.

        "content": "A salute and a cigarette: Elon Musk reacts to report that Apple's 10-year EV project is dead without selling a single car — 3 top electric vehicle stocks that could charge ahead now\n\nThe automotive industry is notoriously challenging, so much so that even a behemoth with a market capitalization in the trillions of dollars has reportedly opted to abandon its ambitions in the sector.\n\nApple is shutting down its electric vehicle (EV) project, according to Bloomberg, citing sources familiar with the decision. It would mark the conclusion of a decade-long endeavor.\n\nDon't miss\n\nCommercial real estate has beaten the stock market for 25 years — but only the super rich could buy in. Here's how even ordinary investors can become the landlord of Walmart, Whole Foods or Kroger Inflation is still white-hot — use these 3 'real assets' to protect your wealth today, no matter what the US Fed does or says Anything can happen in 2024. Try these 5 easy money hacks to help you make and save thousands of dollars in the new year (they will only take seconds)\n\nThe news caught the eye of Tesla CEO Elon Musk, who reacted on X (formerly known as Twitter) with a saluting emoji followed by a cigarette emoji.\n\nIn a subsequent post, Musk remarked: “The natural state of a car company is dead.”\n\nThe abrupt end to Apple’s EV project could spell good news for the existing players in the market. Here’s a look at two EV companies that Wall Street finds particularly attractive — plus a Warren Buffett EV investment that’s beating Tesla in one key metric.\n\nTesla\n\nWhen people think of EV stocks, Tesla is usually the first one to come to mind.\n\nIn 2023, the company achieved a significant milestone by delivering 1,808,581 EVs, which represents a 38% increase from 2022.\n\nIn the U.S., Tesla’s dominance in the EV market is particularly evident. Data from Kelly Blue Book indicates that 55% of the EVs purchased by Americans in 2023 were Tesla products, highlighting the brand's strong foothold and consumer preference in the domestic market.\n\nHowever, as one of the market's most dynamic mega-cap names, Tesla's shares have experienced considerable volatility. They doubled in value in 2023 but have seen a decline of 18% so far in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives sees a revival on the horizon. The analyst has placed a price target of $315 on Tesla, implying a potential upside north of 50%.\n\nRead more: Rich young Americans have lost confidence in the stock market — and are betting on these 3 assets instead. Get in now for strong long-term tailwinds\n\nFord\n\nGiven that Ford's best seller is the F-Series of pickup trucks, the company isn’t considered a pure-play EV stock.\n\nBut the automaker has made significant strides in electrifying its lineup.\n\nIn November 2019, Ford unveiled the Mustang Mach-E, a five-door electric compact SUV. This model hit the market in December 2020 and clinched the 2021 North American SUV of the Year Award. Moreover, Ford launched the all-electric F-150 Lightning pickup in April 2022, marking another significant step in its EV journey.\n\nIn its latest earnings report, Ford highlighted: “Sales volumes of the F-150 Lightning pickup and Mustang Mach-E SUV both were up year-over-year and respectively the top-selling electric pickup and No. 3 most popular EV of any type in the U.S. for 2023.”\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas has estimated a price target of $16 on Ford — around 30% above where the stock sits today.\n\nBYD\n\nChinese EV manufacturer BYD has been a part of investing legend Warren Buffett's portfolio for more than a decade.\n\nIn 2008, Berkshire Hathaway acquired 225 million shares of BYD for $232 million, a move that proved to be highly lucrative. By the end of 2020, as stated in Berkshire’s shareholder letter, their stake was valued at approximately $5.9 billion.\n\nAlthough Buffett later began reducing his stake in BYD, an October 2023 stock exchange filing reported on by Reuters revealed that Berkshire still held a sizable 7.98% stake in the company.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, BYD’s EV sales reached 526,409 vehicles, overtaking Tesla's deliveries of 484,507 EVs, according to Reuters, and displacing it as the top EV manufacturer globally. The Chinese company's success has been attributed to various factors, including its broad lineup with inexpensive models, price cuts, its battery-manufacturing capability, and the Chinese government's support of the country's EV sector.\n\nBYD's shares are not listed in the U.S., but they are traded over-the-counter, so American investors who want to buy the stock would need to choose a broker that supports trading them.\n\nWhat to read next\n\nHere's how you can invest in rental properties without the responsibility of being a landlord 'The biggest crash in history': Robert Kiyosaki warns that millions of 401(k)s and IRAs will be 'toast' — here's what he likes for protection 'It's not taxed at all': Warren Buffett shares the 'best investment' you can make when battling inflation\n\nThis article provides information only and should not be construed as advice.

        "content": "Watching the electric vehicle (EV) market is like experiencing a slow-motion car wreck. Amid a dramatic slowdown in sales, companies are throwing in the towel. Mercedes-Benz (OTCMKTS:MBGAF) just scrapped its plans to go all-EV after 2030 while Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just killed its electric car project.\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) previously backed off its pledge to be all-electric by 2035. Instead, it will bring back hybrid vehicles and see how EV demand pans out before committing more resources. Similarly, Ford (NYSE:F) is delaying spending $12 billion on EVs and will also increase hybrid production.\n\nThere’s carnage everywhere as Nikola (NASDAQ:NKLA) is near bankruptcy while Polestar Holding (NASDAQ:PSNY) staved off the same fate with a last-minute $1 billion lifeline.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe green future is looking blood red for EVs. Unfortunately, they ran into the wall of reality. Most car buyers don’t want electric cars. They don’t trust them enough to give up their gas-powered vehicles. From batteries bursting into flames to being unable to charge their cars in bone-chilling temperatures, most car buyers prefer the reliability of existing vehicles.\n\nThat’s why there is only one EV stock to buy today and two that are must-sells now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 1: Lucid Group (LCID) Closeup of the Lucid logo seen at a Lucid showroom in Millbrae, California. LCID stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is one of those luxury EV makers swimming in red ink. It lost $2.8 billion last year or more than double the amount in 2022 as it sold fewer cars than the year before. The automaker may have just received a promise for $6 million from Michigan to site a non-production facility in the state but let the government throw tax dollars into that sinkhole. You don’t have to follow suit.\n\nThe EV stock can’t sell its cars. At $80,000 they are too expensive in a market that can’t move EVs at half the price. And the introduction of a cheaper model won’t help because it still costs more than the average new EV.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe electric car industry hoped that gaining price parity with gas-powered vehicles would be the tipping point for sales growth. The demand still hasn’t materialized. Kelley Blue Book says a new EV averages $55,353, down 11% year over year. The average cost of a new car overall was $47,401, a 3% decline from last year. Despite the convergence, the rate of growth for new EVs stalled out. Just 1.8% more EVs were sold in 2023 than the year before.\n\nAlthough Lucid just dropped the base price of the Air by $8,000 to just under $70,000 because of falling demand it’s still too expensive. And that’s the third time in seven months it cut pricing. The EV maker says it will only produce 9,000 vehicles this year but even that might be too many. LCID stock is one to sell now.\n\nEV Stock to Sell No. 2: Rivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother luxury EV company trying to go down market is Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN). It is the second EV stock you should sell. Don’t wait for the company to unveil its new lower-priced R2S SUV on Mar. 7 before selling. Get out now before more damage can be done.\n\nRivian’s earnings were one of two data points I said investors should use to determine how RIVN stock would go. The financials were worse than expected. While the unveiling of the R2S was the second point to ponder, it’s clear the automaker’s position is too dire for a new model to matter. Even Elon Musk says bankruptcy is a likely outcome for Rivian.\n\nDespite reporting higher than expected revenue and a narrower loss for the fourth quarter, Rivian’s outlook isn’t bright. It is firing 10% of its workforce and forecasts it will produce only 57,000 vehicles this year. That’s essentially flat compared to 2023 and far below the 80,000 expected.\n\nYet with EV sales growth tanking, that might be pie-in-the-sky thinking too. Rivian didn’t announce any new price cuts and the R2S will be priced between $40,000 and $60,000. If it is not near the low price point it could be disastrous. With RIVN stock down 52% already in 2024 now is the time to cut losses and sell the stock.\n\nThe Only EV Stock to Buy: Toyota Motors (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motors (NYSE:TM) has been one of the very few automakers showing any sort of common sense in the EV market. While the Japanese car company makes EVs, it didn’t dive head-first into the shallow end of the pool like other automakers. EVs account for less than 1% of all vehicle sales at Toyota or a little more than 100,000 vehicles. More prevalent were hybrids, which represent almost 31%, or 3.6 million of the auto stock’s total 11.2 million vehicles sold.\n\nToyota was skeptical of the headlong rush into all-electric cars and chose instead to focus on hybrids. It turns out the company was right. Car buyers are willing to look at alternative fuel vehicles so long as there is a backup plan in place. The hybrid vehicle gives buyers the assurance they won’t be stuck if the green solution fails. Toyota chose to invest across the full spectrum of energy options and its profits doubled last quarter.\n\nThe Japanese automaker is the leading EV stock to buy today. Arguably, it’s the only one. Even with TM stock up 30% year to date, it has such a clear lead over all its rivals in the hybrid space it is now the one to catch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's 10 New Stock Picks Before March 2024. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 5 New Stock Picks for March 2024.\n\nJim Cramer during his February 28 program on CNBC said that as we near the end of the earnings season he's been thinking about the effect of earnings reports on the markets and how these reports and their coverage in the news often cause average investors to make \"snap\" decisions what later turn out to be wrong decisions. Cramer said these reports have programmed us to think short term and ignore the long-term picture or \"nuance.\" Cramer said that the \"way we report on stocks\" is \"not working anymore.\"\n\nCramer is Upset About Earnings News Coverage\n\nCramer gave examples of Home Depot and Lowe's, which recently reported their quarters. Cramer said these two companies are excellent businesses and their quarters were strong but because of the \"beat and raise\" structure of earnings news stories many investors immediately started selling these two stocks after reading news headlines without waiting for conference calls to understand the big picture and future guidance.\n\nCramer said Home Depot shares jumped after the company's earnings call because the management said it feels good about inventories since they were lower than the previous levels at the end of 2023. Cramer said that's what investors wanted to hear and that's why one should not make decisions based on news stories and instead wait for conference calls and details from companies' management. Jim Cramer's New Stock Picks for March 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired on CNBC during the last week of February and picked 10 stocks Cramer recommended investors to buy. For each stock we have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Instead of companies like  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), which Cramer has been recommending for a long time, you will see some new names in the list of Cramer's stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\n10. Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer recently said in his Lightning Round program that his next Nvidia play stock would be Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY).\n\n\"I think Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) is my next one because that's a mention by Nvidia.\"\n\nJim Cramer was talking about SoundHound AI and why he likes the stock because of the Nvidia factor.\n\nDuring its earnings call in November 2023, Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) management talked about its partnership with Nvidia:\n\n\"So with that as a backdrop, I’d like to highlight some of the progress we’ve made within the quarter. In partnership with NVIDIA, we launched our generative AI service at the end of the quarter. The service is truly unique and addresses fundamental customer needs. Our model is trained solely with Getty Images Holdings Inc (NYSE:GETY) best-in-class content, addressing the legal risk that is pervasive in many other models that are trained with third-party intellectual property scraped from the web. We also believe this equates to higher quality outputs as a cake is only as good as its ingredients. With generative AI by Getty Images, users can be confident that the content they generate is safe to use in commercial settings and will not include any trademark brands, products, characters, or identifiable people. It also does not produce deep takes or emulate the style of specific orders, which we believe is valued by our editorial and creative customers respectively. We are rewarding our contributors with an ongoing share of each and every dollar we earn from the service. Last but certainly not least, the service and all of its outputs come with Getty Images uncapped indemnification. In terms of the economics, customers pay to generate versus download, which better aligns to our costs and recognize the value of ideation. Initial customer feedback and engagement with the service has been really positive and we have already introduced new features to the service such as being able to prompt in over 70 languages. And we’re engaged with a limited set of customers to custom-train models to their IP and brand needs.\"\n\nRead the full earnings call transcript here.\n\n9. SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 13\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). Cramer is bullish on SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) because of the Nvidia factor. Cramer said \"that's Nvidia play\" while talking about SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\nSoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) has gained about 204% year to date. The stock is roaring after Nvidia revealed a $3.7 million stake in the company while SoftBank bought 1.1 million shares of SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN). SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN) makes voice AI solutions for automotive, restaurants and hospitality industries.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 13 hedge funds had stakes in SoundHound AI Inc (NASDAQ:SOUN).\n\n8. Public Storage (NYSE:PSA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 28\n\nPublic Storage (NYSE:PSA) ranks eighth in our list of the stocks Jim Cramer recommended in his Lightning Round program on CNBC this week. Cramer said Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) stock is down \"on an opportunity.\" Cramer quoted Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) skeptics who say there is a lot of oversaturation in the market for self-storage companies. Cramer said in response to these naysayers:\n\n\"Give me a break. These guys are very smart operators. I want to buy the stock.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 28 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Public Storage (NYSE:PSA). The biggest stakeholder of the company during this period was Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group which owns a $221 million stake.\n\nIn addition to PSA, Cramer is also recommending  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Real Estate Fund stated the following regarding Public Storage (NYSE:PSA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the most recently reported quarter, business results for Public Storage (NYSE:PSA), a REIT that is the world’s largest owner, operator, and developer of self-storage facilities, were mildly disappointing as occupancy trends and rents moderated as a result of less housing-related movement and a more price-sensitive consumer. We decided to sell our position because we believe near-term rent and overall cash-flow growth may remain subdued. We are likely to revisit Public Storage in the future.”\n\n7. DigitalBridge Group Inc (NYSE:DBRG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nA caller recently asked Jim Cramer about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG), which he said was once a REIT but later transformed into a \"profitable global alternative asset manager.\" Jim Cramer said he remembers DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) from its REIT days and wanted the company to do exactly what it's doing today. Jim Cramer said DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) is a \"good stock\" and praised the caller for making the right call on the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG). The most notable stake in the company is owned by Charles Akre's Akre Capital Management which owns a $77 million stake in the company.\n\nAve Maria Focused Fund made the following comment about DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“DigitalBridge Group, Inc. (NYSE:DBRG) started its life with particularly complicated financials as the two data center businesses it owned directly obfuscated the economics of its asset management business. However, DigitalBridge plans to divest enough of their ownership in these two businesses that they will no longer be required to consolidate them in their reported financials. Consequently, its reported financials will be much simpler to analyze and reflect the profile of a pure-play alternative asset manager. DigitalBridge differentiates itself by focusing exclusively on digital infrastructure, an asset class that institutional allocators are severely under allocated to. DigitalBridge is actively fundraising for its third flagship investment fund. With an expected 11-year fund life, this fund could generate fees for the company and its investors for a long time.\n\nWe are confident that these three alternative investment managers will grow their respective businesses substantially over the next five years. This should provide ample growth in their stock prices and, consequently, the Fund’s positions in them.”\n\n6. Cloudflare Inc (NYSE:NET)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 44\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) during his \"Lightning Round\" program on CNBC. Cramer said Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) is one of his \"absolute favorite stocks.\" Jim Cramer said that there's \"such a fantastic narrative there.\"\n\n\"You must hold on to Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET).\"\n\nJim Cramer also recommended investors to buy more Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) if the stock takes a hit.\n\nIn addition to Cloudflare, Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Cloudflare, Inc. (NYSE:NET) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Most of our portfolio companies have seen stabilization and modest improvements in short-term business fundamentals as the year progressed. More importantly in our view, many have been able to drive significant improvement in long-term Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) such as share gains, meaningful expansion of their total addressable market, and improvement in unit economics. These KPIs are significantly more important in driving the intrinsic values of our businesses, which we believe have increased noticeably during 2023. In the meantime, disruptive changes that we expect will benefit many of our businesses have also continued to pick up steam.

        "content": "By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) - Major Chinese third-party retailers JD.com, TMall, and Pinduoduo are battling for customers by offering more steep discounts on Apple's iPhone 15 just five months after launch, as the U.S. tech company suffers slowing sales in China.\n\nThe latest round of discounting comes after online retailers in October offered similar substantial discounts. Third-party retailers are also offering discounts of as much as 10% on Apple's iPhone 14 Pro.\n\nApple occasionally allows partner vendors in China to offer discounts on its phones to spur demand. The iPhone 15 launch came at a time of slowing sales for Apple in China where it faces rising competitive pressure from domestic rivals like Huawei and Xiaomi.\n\nLast month, Apple offered discounts on iPhones on its official sites by up to 500 yuan in an unusual move.\n\nOn Thursday, the third-party retailers were offering discounts on all four models of the iPhone 15 series, including the iPhone 15, iPhone 15 Plus, iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max, Reuters checks showed, with some models on sale at up to 1,300 yuan ($180.68) less than the usual price.\n\nLocal media reported the price cuts and the three online retailers have branded the discounts as part of the upcoming International Women's Day campaign which falls on March 8th, but have not said how long the promotions will last.\n\nApple, JD.com, Alibaba which operates the Tmall platform, and PDD didn't immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe retailers have been engaged in a \"value for money\" battle as consumers tighten their belts in a slowing economy, with discounting a focus during some of the major shopping holidays and events.\n\nAccording to checks made by Reuters, Pinduoduo is offering the 128GB version of the iPhone 15 for 4,588 yuan on their website - 1,411 yuan less than Apple's retail price of 5,999 yuan.\n\nThe 256GB iPhone 15 Pro Max, which typically retails for 9,999 yuan in Apple's store, can be purchased for 8,899 yuan on JD.com's flagship e-commerce platform.\n\n($1 = 7.1951 Chinese yuan renminbi)\n\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh;Editing by Elaine Hardcastle)",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBERLIN (Reuters) - Germany wants Big Tech companies Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta Platforms and Microsoft to contribute towards the compliance costs of new European Union rules aimed at curbing their power, a senior German economy ministry official said on Thursday.\n\nSven Giegold, state secretary in charge of competition policy at Germany's economy ministry, said such a move would help EU antitrust regulators better enforce the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which the six companies have to comply with on March 7.\n\nThe landmark rules set out a list of requirements for the six companies, such as allowing rival services to inter-operate with their services, as well as letting business users promote their offer and conclude contracts with their customers outside their platforms.\n\nThe six companies are prohibited from unfairly ranking their own services and products above their rivals on their platforms or preventing users from un-installing any pre-installed software or app on their devices.\n\n\"The (European) Commission needs additional resources for enforcement,\" Giegold told a conference organised by the German antitrust agency.\n\n\"We propose for the DMA we should introduce the same fee financing as under the DSA (Digital Services Act),\" he said.\n\nUnder the DSA, which requires Big Tech to do more to police content on their platforms, 20 very large online platforms, including Meta, Google, Apple, TikTok, and also two very large online search engines, have to pay a supervisory fee amounting to 0.05% of their annual worldwide net income.\n\nThe DMA does not have such a supervisory fee.\n\nGiegold also said EU antitrust enforcers should focus more on key sectors with an international aspect to help European companies compete better globally.\n\n\"Next week we will be formally submitting a concrete German proposal that is for the EU level. We would like to see this proposal in the reforms of Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta,\" he said, referring to two former prime ministers of Italy tasked by the Commission to come up with ways to revive the EU's competitiveness.\n\nHe said key areas for EU businesses are raw materials, energy, transport, semiconductors and cloud computing.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Shares of Apple Inc. supplier AMS-Osram AG lost the most on record Thursday after the Swiss chipmaker said a customer canceled a key project that could force it to sell part of its Malaysian production site.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey Singapore’s Richest Banking Dynasty Grapples With Succession This Is Where New Migrants Are Going When They Reach the US Supreme Court Immunity Case Jeopardizes Trump Trial Pre-Election\n\nAMS-Osram is weighing the potential sale of the second phase of Kulim plant in Malaysia after the surprise decision by one of its biggest customers to cancel the project, according to Chief Executive Officer Aldo Kamper.\n\n“We will need to take decisions in the next days and weeks which will impact a lot of people,” he said Thursday on a conference call.\n\nVontobel analyst Mark Diethelm, who cut his rating on the stock, said the canceled project is related to the Apple Watch and was scheduled to start micro-LED production in 2026.\n\nAMS-Osram executives declined to identify the client. A spokesperson for Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe company had spent substantial investments in research and development and other capital expenditure on the Kulim chip fab, according to a note by JPMorgan analyst Sandeep Deshpande, who said the customer was likely Apple.\n\nAMS-Osram was expanding the plant to produce micro-LED displays, which has long been tipped to be the next major upgrade in display technology for consumer wearables, such as smartwatches.\n\nTheir development, however, has taken longer than expected. According to an August report by Taipei-based research firm TrendForce, the rollout of micro-LED on the Apple Watch was pushed back to 2026 from 2025.\n\nAMS-Osram has invested heavily in the micro-LED space. The company committed €800 million in 2022 to expand its manufacturing facility in Kulim. It had expected its first revenue from the technology in 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares tumbled as much as 45% in Zurich to 1.21 Swiss francs, the lowest since its 2009 initial public offering. Aixtron SE, which supplies chipmaking equipment to AMS-Osram, slumped as much as 22%, also weighed down by results that showed a worse-than-expected operating margin outlook and lacked any guidance on orders.\n\nAMS-Osram will incur an impairment charge of €600 million ($651 million) to €900 million in the current quarter as it reviews the value of assets linked to the project involving micro-LED technology, it said in a statement on Wednesday. It cut its guidance for medium-term sales growth to as much as 8% from 10%.\n\nThe firm’s business struggles were exacerbated by a downturn in the semiconductor industry and a slowdown in consumer device demand. The debt-laden firm has been in a turnaround process, with €2.25 billion raised in a refinancing plan completed in December. Both Kamper and Chief Financial Officer Rainer Irle assumed their roles less than a year ago.\n\n“With this project now canceled, we believe that the shares will take a major hit as long-term growth prospects will be much lower without the micro LED opportunity,” said Stifel analyst Juergen Wagner, referring to AMS-Osram.\n\nBond Drop\n\nAMS-Osram’s bonds also took a beating on the news, with a €625 million 10.5% bond maturing in March 2029 dropping 8 cents on the euro to a cash price of 102.6 cents, according to Bloomberg pricing source CBBT at 11:20 a.m. London.\n\nA zero-coupon convertible bond maturing in March 2025 also fell by 3 cents, to a cash price of 92.5 cents on the euro.\n\nThis convertible bond was issued in the low-rate era in 2018, when many technology-related firms were able to essentially get free debt in exchange for exposure to their stock. Since rates have risen, many of these bonds have tumbled as the underlying stocks have cratered.\n\nIn the case of AMS-Osram, these convertible bonds were designed to convert into shares at €50.1886 upon maturity in 2025. This is a nearly 3,000% premium to the current share price.\n\n--With assistance from Allegra Catelli and Alexey Anishchuk.\n\n(Updates with details throughout.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- India’s government has approved $15.2 billion worth of investments in semiconductor fabrication plants, including a Tata Group proposal to build the country’s first major chipmaking facility.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Apple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey Fed’s Preferred Inflation Metric Increases by Most in a Year Singapore’s Richest Banking Dynasty Grapples With Succession This Is Where New Migrants Are Going When They Reach the US\n\nPrime Minister Narendra Modi’s cabinet approved Tata’s plan to build an $11 billion site that can fabricate about 50,000 wafers per month, technology minister Ashwini Vaishnaw told reporters in New Delhi Thursday. The government also cleared Tata’s separate proposal for a $3 billion-plus chip assembly plant, and a packaging venture between Japan’s Renesas Electronics Corp. and the Murugappa Group’s CG Power and Industrial Solutions Ltd.\n\nWhile still merely blueprints, the approvals advance India’s semiconductor ambitions. Like a growing number of countries around the world, the Modi administration is keen to endorse and back the building of domestic chipmaking capacity, ensuring supply of the components needed for future technologies from AI to self-driving cars.\n\n“We will start construction of this plant within 100 days,” the minister said during the briefing, referring to Tata’s fab.\n\nIndia hopes to attract chip giants in much the same way incentives have encouraged Apple Inc. and its partners to make and sell iPhones in the country, a boost to its giant manufacturing sector. It’s offered to shoulder half the cost of any approved projects, up to an initial ceiling of $10 billion. The semiconductor fund has already helped US memory maker Micron Technology Inc. establish a $2.75 billion assembly facility in Gujarat.\n\nRead More: India Chip Strategy Makes Progress With $21 Billion in Proposals\n\nThe Tata conglomerate is expected to partner with Taiwan’s Powerchip Semiconductor Manufacturing Corp. for its project, though it has also held talks with United Microelectronics Corp. The new facility will produce so-called mature chips — using 40-nanometer or older technology — that are widely used in consumer electronics, automobiles, defense systems and aircrafts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe $150 billion Tata group has previously said it plans to begin construction of a chip fabrication plant in Dholera this year. At 50,000 wafers per month, the envisioned Tata site is a modest size compared with facilities of its kind around the world.\n\nRead More: Apple Supplier Foxconn Begins iPhone 15 Production in India\n\nThe moves are part of Tata’s nascent push to invest billions of dollars in high-tech businesses. It operates India’s biggest smartphone component plant, constructed at a cost of more than $700 million, in southern India. It also bought Apple supplier Wistron Corp.’s India factory last year and is seeking to build its own iPhone plant.\n\nSemiconductors have grown into a key geopolitical battleground, with the US, Japan and China investing heavily in developing domestic capabilities.\n\nModi’s push to turn India into a global manufacturing hub also includes luring more international chipmakers to the country — a bid to rely less on expensive imports and enhance a growing smartphone assembly industry.\n\n--With assistance from Rakesh Sharma, Siddhartha Singh and Santosh Kumar.\n\n(Updates with other green-lit projects from the second paragraph)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Chocolate Makers Try a New Recipe: Less Chocolate Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

It’s a steeper drop than the roughly $120 discount the company offered on its smartphone lineup around the same time last year, and there are similar reductions on JD.com Inc.’s online platform. Apple’s own store is selling the devices at original prices.\n\nThe latest iPhone generation has not matched the usual popularity of Apple’s flagship series in China. Since its launch in September, owing to a combination of economic difficulty across the country as well as the surprising resurgence of Huawei Technologies Co.’s smartphone business, the iPhone 15 family has lagged sales of its predecessors.\n\n“Apple is catching up with the ‘deflation’ trend in China, intending to boost the demand for iPhones,” IDC analyst Will Wong said. “Based on IDC’s preliminary January data, the pressure was mainly coming from other Android vendors as we saw Apple decline by around 10% year-on-year in the month while Huawei grew triple-digits over the same period.”\n\nThe latest discounts emerged after the Lunar New Year holiday, following rare price reductions on Apple’s website in January. A company representative did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple sales in China dropped 13% to $20.8 billion in the quarter ended December. That fell far short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts and was Apple’s weakest performance for that period in the Asian nation in years.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Apple is offering a short-term promotional price to third-party channels as an early promotion for International Women’s Day,” said Ivan Lam of Counterpoint Research. “We observed that iPhone sales in the Chinese market are becoming increasingly dependent on promotions.”\n\n--With assistance from Vlad Savov.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Elon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "One Tech Tip: Don't use rice for your device. Here's how to dry out your smartphone",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — You were walking next to a swimming pool when you slipped and dropped your phone into the water. Or it slipped out of your hand when you were next to a filled bathtub or toilet.\n\nHowever your smartphone got wet, you now need to dry it. But what do you do? There's lots of advice on the internet, some of it conflicting. Apple inserted itself into the debate recently when it put out an advisory that included a warning against using rice.\n\nHere are some things to keep in mind next time your phone has an unintended encounter with a liquid.\n\nWhat you should do\n\nDry off the exterior with a towel or clean cloth, even your shirtsleeve — anything that's absorbent. Take out the SIM card and holder. If possible, remove the back housing and battery to wipe them dry. Also, if possible, turn the phone off.\n\niPhones can't be disassembled so Apple recommends tapping it gently against your hand with the connector ports facing down so liquid can flow out.\n\nSamsung, which is the biggest maker of Android phones, recommends using a cotton bud to get moisture out of the earphone jack and charging port. In contrast, Apple says cotton buds shouldn't be inserted into iPhone openings.\n\nIf it's not water but another liquid — a drink, seawater or chlorinated pool water — Samsung advises soaking the phone in clean water for a few minutes then rinsing it to get rid of any impurities or salinity that could speed up corrosion of the circuitry inside.\n\nBoth companies say it's best to leave the phone out in a well ventilated area (perhaps with a fan) to dry it out. Google says leave the device to dry at room temperature.\n\nWhat you shouldn’t do\n\nDon’t use a hair dryer or compressed air on your phone. Don’t put it in a freezer - this might stop your device from short-circuiting but the problem will be back once you try to thaw it. And while this might seem obvious, don't put your device in a tumble dryer or on top of a radiator.\n\nDon't power it up or try to charge it with a cable — although wireless charging is OK if your phone has it and you really need to turn it on in an emergency.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo what about using rice to dry your device? You may have heard that putting a phone in a bowl of rice will help draw out moisture. It’s been a tip that’s been out there for years.\n\nApple, however, says that's a no-no. The company warned against it in an advisory published in early January. It drew little attention at the time, but then people noticed the line that said: “Don’t put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone.”\n\nIs there anything I can use besides rice?\n\nThe best option is silica gel, a drying agent that can absorb lots of moisture. Silica gel beads are typically found in packets that are included with products like beef jerky, seaweed sheets or sneakers to keep them dry. You can also buy them in bulk online. This works best if you put them in an airtight box with your phone.\n\nWhen do I know it's dry?\n\nIt's hard to tell but it's best to wait as long as possible — at least a few days. Samsung advises bringing your device into a service center for inspection even after it's been air-dried.\n\nAren't phones waterproof nowadays?\n\nMost phones nowadays are designed to be water-resistant, which means they can resist water entering critical areas for a certain amount of time. But beware, this isn't the same as being waterproof.\n\nApple says the iPhone 7 and and newer models are splash and water resistant. iPhone XS devices and up have the IP68 rating, which means they can be submerged for as long as 30 minutes and, depending on the model, as deep as 6 meters (20 feet). These models also pop up a warning if there's liquid detected in key ports, and warn against charging. Samsung says most of its Galaxy Android phones feature the same rating, though the maximum depth is about 5 meters (16 feet).\n\nGoogle's newer Pixel phones carry the same water resistance ratings, but Google warns that they aren't waterproof and the water resistance will diminish over time because of “normal wear and tear, device repair, disassembly or damage.\"",

        "title": "Xiaomi founder Lei Jun followed Apple into the EV market. He’s now ‘very shocked’ by the iPhone maker’s decision to pull out",
        "content": "Both Xiaomi and its founder, Lei Jun, are big fans of Apple. The Chinese smartphone maker embraces Apple-like designs in its products and advertising, leading some to dub the company \"the Apple of China.\" And Lei cites Steve Jobs as an inspiration, saying that the 1984 book Fire in the Valley put him on the path to launching his own company.\n\nAnd so it wasn't a big surprise when, in March 2021, Xiaomi announced it was entering the EV space, following Apple's 2014 decision to explore building a car. At the time, Xiaomi promised to spend $10 billion over 10 years to eventually offer \"quality smart electric vehicles.\"\n\nBut now Apple's car plans are reportedly dead, with the U.S. tech company shifting personnel to AI projects instead.\n\nThe man behind the \"Apple of China\" said he was \"shocked\" by Apple's decision, in a Wednesday post on Chinese social media platform Weibo. He continued that Xiaomi made a \"strategic choice\" to invest in EVs, and that the company remains committed to the project, despite the difficulty.\n\nIn December, Lei told state broadcaster CCTV that Xiaomi devoted 3,400 engineers and 10 billion Chinese renminbi ($1.4 billion) towards the company's first prototype vehicle. He noted that the overall investment was 10 times higher than what automakers generally devote to new models.\n\nXiaomi can break into the car market because EVs combine elements of both traditional automobiles and consumer electronics, Lei said at the time.\n\nThe smartphone maker unveiled its first EV, the SU7 electric sedan, in late December. The car made its first public appearance at the Mobile World Congress in Barcelona this week.\n\nDomestic deliveries could start as soon as the second quarter of the year, Xiaomi group president Weibing Lu told CNBC. The company hasn't revealed a price tag yet, but Lu said a formal release would come \"very soon.\" The company is targeting the premium market, which Lu described as a good starting point due to Xiaomi's experience selling smartphones to \"20 million premium users.\"\n\nChinese consumers adopted EVs at a rapid pace in recent years, helping companies like BYD and Li Auto generate record-high sales. But Xiaomi will be trying to enter the world's largest EV market right as the pace of growth starts to slow down, and as other EV makers get bogged down in fierce price wars to capture more market share.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

Shareholders also rejected measures about equal employment policies, civil liberties, racial and gender pay gaps, and human rights. They approved the board slate and the company’s executive compensation plan.\n\nThe AI proposal urged Apple to disclose the ethical guidelines that it follows in adopting the technology. Artificial intelligence raises “a number of social policy issues,” according to the measure’s supporting statement. That includes whether it may result in biased decisions against employees or violate the privacy of customers. The statement also warned about the threat of layoffs stemming from automation.\n\nThe AFL-CIO investment arm also is pressing other tech and media firms on the issue, including Walt Disney Co., Netflix Inc. and Warner Bros. Discovery Inc.\n\nIn a twist, the proposal was read by Apple retail store employee Michael Forsythe, who said he and his colleagues were concerned about the company’s expansion into artificial intelligence. Forsythe helped launch a unionization push at an Apple store in Oklahoma City.\n\nApple has been less open than tech peers about its plans for generative AI — the technology behind chatbots like ChatGPT — but it has promised to discuss its plans later this year. That presentation could come as soon as June, when the company holds its annual developers conference.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot\n\nBehind the scenes, Apple has been racing to weave generative AI into its software. Craig Federighi, senior vice president of software engineering, has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year’s operating system updates.\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook’s pay has been a flashpoint in recent years, when his annual compensation neared $100 million. But in 2023, it dropped 36% to $63.2 million — largely due to smaller stock awards. His salary remains $3 million. Cook’s target stock award for 2024 is $50 million, up from a target of $40 million.\n\nApple announced last month that two longtime directors wouldn’t be standing for reelection at the meeting because they reached an age threshold of 75: Al Gore, the former US vice president, and James Bell, an ex-Boeing Co. executive. Still, another director, Ronald Sugar, isn’t leaving despite turning 76 later this year. Cook opened the meeting by thanking Gore and Bell.\n\nApple said that Sugar is remaining “in consideration of the significant recent transitions in board composition and the value of retaining directors who have developed deep insights into the company during their tenure.”\n\nFormer Aerospace Corp. CEO Wanda Austin, meanwhile, is joining the board. She has long been a proponent of US space exploration efforts — an area that hasn’t been a major focus for Apple so far.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great Hollywood Is Banking on Dune: Part Two to Revive the Blockbuster Experience\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) reportedly will not go ahead with plans to build a car after spending billions of dollars and nearly a decade on it. But in the end some analysts say it’s likely a good thing for the tech juggernaut.\n\n“A successful and profitable company such as Apple has little to gain from building their own vehicle,” said Sam Fiorani of AutoForecast Solutions, a research firm specializing in the automotive manufacturing sector. \"The minefields currently being traversed by the likes of Rivian and Lucid should have informed executives at Apple just how difficult an endeavor this would have been.”\n\nIn recent months it seems Apple executives did come to this conclusion. According to Bloomberg,after pushing out deadlines and features set for the car recently, it became more obvious that building a car from the bottom up was going to be expensive. At the same time, the car would be entering a market already saturated with EV competition with the likes of Tesla, Rivian, and Lucid at the higher end — and one where demand was softening substantially. Even Big Three automakers like Ford and GM have warned about waning EV demand in their Q4 earnings statements. Apple next-gen CarPlay will extend beyond the central display, encompassing the instrument cluster and additional screens. (Apple) (Apple)\n\n“Since Apple farms out much of its product manufacturing to other firms, it was unlikely that any vehicle they developed would have been assembled in-house, however marketing such a vehicle would have required something more than Geniuses at the mall Apple Store,” Fiorani said, highlighting the challenges Apple faced in the market.\n\nAnd unlike other EV makers, Apple wouldn't be able to capitalize on its data, since it already gets so much of it through its ubiquitous iPhones.\n\n“New vehicle startups of the last two decades have focused their long-term energy on data, which is Apple’s core business today,” Fiorani said, referring to Rivian and Lucid. “The iPhone already gathers so much information on its owners that the cost to start a vehicle division couldn’t possibly pay off in enough additional data to offset the financial risk.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has before dabbled in product areas outside of its core and then dropped plans if they proved unlikely to be profitable. For years Apple was rumored to be making its own high-end flat screen TV for consumers. But as the market for LCD and LED TVs became less profitable, Apple withdrew those efforts and stuck to making external monitors.\n\nThe better play for Apple's foray into autos, as many analysts have noted, is sticking with software and helping legacy automakers create a better user experience for their customers. With Apple CarPlay software for vehicles, Apple could add value by focusing on Apple’s core competencies like design and user interaction and enjoy higher and more stable profit margins.\n\n“Today’s software-driven vehicles need engineers, like those at Apple, to create a system to gather, process, harness, and utilize data from drivers, passengers, and the vehicles themselves,” Fiorani added. “This is a bigger potential windfall than the actual development of a vehicle.”\n\nWall Street reaction from analysts at firms including Morgan Stanley, CFRA, and Wedbush Securities has been universally positive on Apple's cancellation of its car project, though they acknowledged that the costs incurred are not ideal. Nevertheless Apple’s pivot from a car to other endeavors like generative AI are welcome.\n\n“As Apple Car bears, we believe this report, if true, represents a positive step forward in 1) focusing on what matters, and 2) exhibiting cost discipline,” Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote in a note to investors on Wednesday morning. “We believe the engineering talent, CAPEX investments, and time spent on Project Titan are better repurposed into related technologies, such as Generative AI, which has a much higher probability of coming to market and strengthening Apple's competitive moat… Any new talent that can help further Apple's AI progress is a net positive, in our view.”\n\nPras Subramanian is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Adds comments on plans for AI from Cook in paragraphs 1-5)\n\nBy Stephen Nellis\n\nFeb 28 (Reuters) - Apple plans to disclose more about its plans to put generative artificial intelligence to use later this year, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said during the company's annual shareholder meeting on Wednesday. Cook said that the iPhone maker sees \"incredible breakthrough potential for generative AI, which is why we're currently investing significantly in this area. We believe that will unlock transformative opportunities for users when it comes to productivity, problem solving and more.\"\n\nApple has been slower in rolling out generative AI, which can generate human-like responses to written prompts, than rivals such as Microsoft and Alphabet's Google , which are weaving them into products.\n\nOn Wednesday, Cook argued that AI is already at work behind the scenes in Apple's products but said there would be more news on explicit AI features later this year. Bloomberg previously reported Apple plans to use AI to improve the ability to search through data stored on Apple devices.\n\n\"Every Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there's no better computer for AI on the market today,\" Cook said.\n\nApple shareholders on Wednesday rejected a measure asking the company to disclose more information about how it uses artificial intelligence in its business and its ethical guidelines for the technology.\n\nThe proposal, which was defeated at the company's annual shareholder meeting, was put forth by the pension trust of the AFL-CIO, the largest American labor union federation, which has also proposed AI measures at other technology companies.\n\nA similar proposal will be heard at Walt Disney's annual meeting in April.\n\nAt Apple, the AFL-CIO asked for a report on the company's use of AI \"in its business operations and disclose any ethical guidelines that the company has adopted regarding the company’s use of AI technology.\"\n\nIn its supporting statement in Apple's proxy materials, the AFL-CIO wrote that \"AI systems should not be trained on copyrighted works, or the voices, likenesses and performances of professional performers, without transparency, consent and compensation to creators and rights holders.\"\n\nApple opposed the measure, saying that disclosures could tip its hand on strategy as it competes against rivals in the fast-moving AI field.

        "content": "Apple products, including the new Vision Pro headset, have turned up in Russian stores despite the company's ban on exporting products to the country following the start of the Ukraine invasion.\n\nThe official Apple website in Russia remains offline, displaying only an animated Apple logo and a message in Russian saying, \"The Apple Store is currently closed,\" but business for Apple products continues to boom among third-party retailers.\n\nApple did not respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment, but an Apple spokesperson previously had said that the Apple Vision Pro is \"only available at Apple Retail stores in the U.S.\"\n\nThe device, launched in the U.S. on Feb. 2, has turned up in stores belonging to Russian consumer electronics chain M.Video-Eldorado, according to Reuters. The iPhone 14 and 15 also previously made their way to Russian markets despite Apple’s edict to end sales to the country.\n\nLARRY KUDLOW: IF THE BIDEN ADMIN HAD A BACKBONE, THEY WOULD INFLICT SOME SERIOUS FINANCIAL DAMAGE ON PUTIN\n\nMoscow deployed \"grey markets\" that utilized \"parallel imports\" that allowed retailers to import products without the trademark owner’s permission. The policy aimed to mitigate the impact of severe sanctions leveled against Russia following its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP A woman walks past a Re:Store boutique at a shopping mall in Moscow on March 13, 2023.\n\n\"This approach will guarantee the shipment of goods to our country…in spite of the unfriendly actions of foreign politicians,\" Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin said of the move at the time, adding that the Ministry of Industry and Trade would soon produce a list of accepted parallel imports.\n\nM.Video-Eldorado touted its ability to \"introduce Russians to the latest innovations in the world of gadgets,\" with customers able to personally test the products before buying them, indicating no short supply of the Vision Pro, which retails at $3,500 in the U.S. but at nearly double that cost in Russia.\n\nStory continues\n\nPUTIN'S NET WORTH ‘RIVALS ELON MUSK,’ BUT ‘COBWEB’ OF BANK ACCOUNTS, ASSETS HIDES HIS FULL VALUE, EXPERT SAYS\n\nSergey Romantsev, a Russian tech blogger, told CNBC that the process of getting the product around the sales ban was \"nothing complicated.\" People buy the product stateside and simply bring it with them on a trip to Russia via Turkey.\n\n\"Through New York, Istanbul, Moscow, we brought Vision very quickly,\" Romantsev wrote in an email exchange with the outlet.\n\n\"Officially, Apple does not sell anything in Russia. Russian companies buy equipment in other countries and bring it to their stores,\" he explained. \"This has led to a huge increase in prices, so Vision Pro in Moscow costs not $3,500 but $5,000.\"\n\nLAW PROFESSOR FEARS CYBERATTACKS WILL ‘INCREASE, CONTINUE’ IN WAKE OF PHARMACY, AT&T OUTAGES\n\nRomantsev insisted that Apple remains popular in Russia, and consumers remain willing to pay over the odds to get the newest products, making it difficult to obtain them even with the inflow of third-party vendor help.\n\nThe popularity led to Russia’s Federal Security Service (FSB) issuing a crackdown on government officials using iPhones over fears of American espionage, according to The Financial Times.\n\n\"Security officials in ministries — these are FSB employees who hold civilian positions such as deputy ministers — announced that iPhones were no longer considered safe and that alternatives should be sought,\" a person close to a government agency that banned Apple products told the Financial Times.\n\nThe personal use of Apple products is allowed, the outlet claimed – similar to bans in the U.S. on China’s Huawei products, also due to espionage concerns.\n\nOriginal article source:Apple products, including Vision Pro, still available in Russia despite company's export ban: report",

        "content": "Growth companies are a vital addition to any investment portfolio as they tend to experience above-average returns compared to the general stock market. The category of growth stocks is very appealing to investors because it provides the possibility of increased profits.\n\nInvestors should also be aware that certain growth stocks may be drastically overvalued due to the overblown interest of traders trying to raise the share price before it returns to earth. Others, like those mentioned below, have experienced significant share price appreciation but also have a solid financial foundation. Their strong balance sheet is the backbone of the company and helps to shield investors from the inevitable volatility that comes with investing.\n\nHere are some exciting options for investors wanting greater exposure to companies with significant upside potential and protection from the changing market.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota motor corporation logo on dealership building\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nToyota Motor (NYSE:TM) is an automobile manufacturer that produces a wide range of vehicles, such as trucks, sedans, SUVs, vans and luxury cars.\n\nThe Japanese carmaker reported earnings for the third quarter of fiscal year 2023, which stated that a profit doubled, with reported revenue growing by 23% year-over-year. It also slightly raised its sales forecast for fiscal year 2023. Its share price surged by nearly 8% following the earnings released because it beat analyst expectations.\n\nTM stock offers investors a dividend yield of approximately 1.9% on an annual basis, with a dividend amount of $2.00 per share distributed semi-annually. Following the large growth that Toyota is experiencing, there may be plans to raise it in the near term.\n\nOn a global level, Toyota is one of the largest vehicle manufacturing companies. Over this last year, its share price has risen by 75%, far exceeding that of its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) app open on a phone screen\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the largest streaming companies offering a wide range of content, including movies, TV shows and documentaries.\n\nThe streaming service reported earnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 on Jan. 23, stating that total revenue and subscriber growth increased by 13% year-over-year. The growth in subscribers was in line with what Netflix experienced during the pandemic; this can be attributed to Netflix’s initiative to stop password sharing, which was a massive success for the company.\n\nNetflix is a streaming giant. Its share price over this past year has risen by 88%. The customer base for Netflix is much greater than that of other streaming competitors such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple (NYSE:AAPL), giving them a massive advantage within the streaming landscape. Netflix also has robust fundamentals and an impressive entertainment lineup for 2024, making it a great choice for investors seeking strong upside potential.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) The entrance sign of Salesforce Tower, at the American cloud-based software company Salesforce's (CRM stock) Headquarters campus in San Francisco, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSalesforce (NYSE:CRM) is a customer relationship company that focuses on providing data analytics and forecasting to businesses in many different industries.\n\nThe generative artificial intelligence (AI) boom that has captured investors’ attention has benefited Salesforce cloud computing business. It recently released a new round of AI products, such as the Einstein Copilot, an AI assistant model, ahead of its earnings report today.\n\nIts share price has been on an upward trend ever since the beginning of 2022, and in that time has more than doubled. On Nov. 29, Salesforce released third-quarter earnings, which beat Wall Street’s estimates. Total revenue saw an increase of 11%, mainly fueled by subscriber growth. Net income surged by nearly sixfold year-over-year.\n\nInvestors are paying close attention to Salesforce to see if their new AI tools help add to its profit growth trend. Salesforce is a great growth pick primarily due to its large market share, especially in the generative AI space.\n\nAs of this writing, Noah Bolton held a LONG position in TM. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nNoah has about a year of freelance writing experience.

        "title": "13 Stocks That Will Double in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 stocks that will double in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the recent events in the stock market, go directly to the 5 Stocks That Will Double in 2024.\n\nLast year turned out to be wondrous for the US stock market as the S&P 500 gained over 25% compared to its 18% decline in the previous year. However, almost all of the gains were attributed to the Magnificent 7, which got a huge boost in investor sentiment due to the artificial intelligence (AI) trend. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was one of the stocks that doubled in 2023, while NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was able to gain nearly 240%. Because of last year's performance, analysts expect good things to happen in 2024 too.\n\nFor the Magnificent 7, analysts have mixed opinions, as some of them believe that the 2023 rally has made these stocks overvalued. The rest of them believe that the AI revolution is real and there is no stop in sight in the near future. Apart from the seven big tech stocks, Wall Street analysts also have faith in some other stocks such as NetEase, Inc. (NASDAQ:NTES), CyberArk Software Ltd. (NASDAQ:CYBR), and HubSpot, Inc. (NYSE:HUBS) and believe that AI is a huge growth catalyst for them.\n\nThe former hedge fund manager and host of CNBC’s Mad Money, Jim Cramer, holds the Magnificent 7 in high regard. However, he believes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) to be the weak link among the group and suggests Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) to be its replacement. Cramer also has mixed views about Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the short-term but still sees it in a favorable light for the long term due to iPhone sales and Apple Vision Pro.\n\nFor 2024, the technology sector still seems to be holding a celebrity status among analysts and financial media. Nevertheless, some other sectors that can get a huge boost due to the AI revolution include the healthcare and industrial sectors. The industrial sector can benefit from AI as it can help the industry in cost cutting, more effective performance tracking, and enhanced productivity due to AI automation.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, while the healthcare sector benefits significantly from AI, it is also a defensive sector that can weather any unforeseen events like we experienced over the last three years. Additionally, AI is quite an old tool in the healthcare industry. Intuitive Surgical, Inc. (NASDAQ:ISRG) has integrated AI and machine learning into the evolution of its surgical robotics for several years. Similarly, another healthcare company, Medtronic plc (NYSE:MDT) has been using AI for a while now and also has plans to boost further integration of the technology in its operations. Its chairman and CEO, Geoff Martha, said the following at the company’s latest earnings call:\n\n“...we've had a rapid cadence of new product approvals and we're continuing to differentially invest in our pipeline of highest growth opportunities. We're advancing innovative core technologies like robotics, AI and closed-loop systems. And with five AI products already FDA approved, we're leading the way in bringing the tech into MedTech. We also continue to make progress on our comprehensive transformation of the company. We're incorporating a performance driven culture that's based on execution, speed and playing to win.”\n\nLooking toward the future, it seems like the Fed will be able to steer the US economy into a soft landing rather than a recession, which is a good sign for US stocks. Keeping that in mind, some of the stocks that will double in 2024 include Wayfair Inc. (NYSE:W), Match Group, Inc. (NASDAQ:MTCH), and Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR).\n\nA graph plotting the trends and performance of stocks on the public equity markets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 27 stocks that have the potential to double in 2024, according to several financial media sources including The Motley Fool, Investor Place, The Globe and Mail, and Kiplinger along with several others. The content of all our sources was published before January 1, 2024. Next, we chose those companies that experienced a rise in hedge fund sentiment in the fourth quarter of 2023.

The company started off managing call centers but has since evolved into a high-tech business process outsourcer (BPO) that also designs and runs customer-facing websites and apps, integrates the data, and optimizes a client’s customer interactions. CX is a relatively new business, and Concentrix has been acquiring smaller competitors. In March, 2023 they bought WebHelp, a leading European CX player, for $4.8B in cash and stock.22 We believe the WebHelp acquisition will help consolidate an industry where Concentrix and Teleperformance are the largest players. The company was spun out from TD Synnex, another of the Fund’s core holdings, and we have always been impressed with the company’s innovation and growth. The market is currently worried about the potential of artificial intelligence to disrupt Concentrix’ core call center business and shares of all CX companies have underperformed.”\n\n8.

Here is what it said:\n\n“Our last addition during the quarter was to the leading freelance platform, Fiverr International Ltd. The company’s revenue growth rates remain negatively impacted by macro factors as it’s relatively easy for customers to hire fewer freelancers when they must cut budgets in the near term. However, we are encouraged by the company’s rapid progress on the profitability front (with guidance for EBITDA margins to be approximately 16% for 2023 compared to 7% in 2022), early signs of revenue growth acceleration, and its significant long-term opportunity as freelance work continues growing. These factors present a positively skewed risk/reward opportunity for long-term investors, especially with the shares trading at a 9% FCF yield. We have therefore decided to add to our position.”\n\n7. Perion Network Ltd. (NASDAQ:PERI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 23\n\nPerion Network Ltd.

        "content": "Big tech's strong performance versus the S&P 500 (^GSPC) is often attributed to the success of the Magnificent 7 stocks. But it's really about three names this time around.\n\nNvidia (NVDA), Meta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to start 2024. Nvidia has led the trio, surging nearly 60% compared to the benchmark index's 6% increase.\n\nThe three names have also topped the performance of their peers in the \"Magnificent 7.\" Microsoft (MSFT) has gained about 8% this year. Meanwhile, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) have lost value through about two months of trade in 2024.\n\nThe stock moves are largely earnings based. In the current earnings season,Nvidia once again blew out expectations. Meta announced plans for a $50 billion share repurchase program and the company's first ever dividend. Meanwhile, Amazon surprised to the upside with its revenue metrics.\n\nOver the last 30 days as Wall Street analysts digested the latest round of corporate results from all seven big tech players, Meta, Amazon, and Nvidia saw the largest increases in earnings projections for both the current year and next year, according to research from DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe,\n\nMeanwhile, Tesla and Microsoft negative earnings shifts were the only two of the group to see their earnings estimates move lower by more than the S&P 500 for next year.\n\nThe quarterly results of these companies are likely to shape the direction of the market at large. On Tuesday, Barclays head of US equity strategy Venu Krishna wrote that big tech earnings per share estimates for 2024 have \"improved considerably\" and moved up the floor for total S&P 500 earnings projection this year.\n\nConsequently, the firm moved up its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,300 from 4,800 in part because of big tech earnings expectations. Goldman Sachs recently struck a similar tone in it's call for the S&P 500 to end this year at 5,200.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"US Big Tech’s superior earnings estimate momentum versus the S&P 500 as a whole goes a long way in explaining why most of them have been able to continue to build on their [more than one] year run of outperformance,\" DataTrek co-founder Jessica Rabe wrote in a note to clients on Monday night. \"As much as rates have risen this year, most Big Tech names are in considerably better fundamental shape than the broader US equity market.\n\n\"As long as they keep delivering on earnings results in the same manner as last quarter, most of these stocks should keep outperforming and driving the S&P higher.\" FILE - A Nvidia office building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023.

        "content": "Jamf Holding Corp. (NASDAQ:JAMF) Q4 2023 Earnings Call Transcript February 27, 2024\n\nJamf Holding Corp. misses on earnings expectations. Reported EPS is $-0.13778 EPS, expectations were $0.12. Jamf Holding Corp. isn’t one of the 30 most popular stocks among hedge funds at the end of the third quarter (see the details here).\n\nOperator: Thank you for standing by, and welcome to the Jamf Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. After the speakers' presentation, there will be a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] As a reminder, today's program is being recorded. And now I'd like to introduce your host for today's program, Jennifer Gaumond, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nJennifer Gaumond: Good afternoon, and thank you for joining us on today's conference call to discuss Jamf's fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. With me on today's call are John Strosahl Chief Executive Officer; and Ian Goodkind, Chief Financial Officer. Before we begin, I'd like to remind you that shortly after the market closed today, we issued a press release announcing our fourth quarter and full year 2023 financial results. We also published a Q4 earnings presentation, investor presentation and Excel file containing quarterly financial statements to assist with modeling. You may access this information on the Investor Relations section of gan.com. Today's discussion may include forward-looking statements.\n\nPlease refer to our most recent SEC reports, including our most recent annual report on Form 10-K, where you will see a discussion of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these statements. I would also like to remind you that during the call, we will discuss some non-GAAP measures related to Jamf's performance. You can find the reconciliation of those measures to the nearest comparable GAAP measures in our earnings release. Additionally, to ensure we can address as many analyst questions as possible during the call, we ask that you please limit your questions to one initial question and one follow-up. Now I'd like to turn the call over to John.\n\nStory continues\n\nJohn Strosahl: Thanks, Jen. Jamf achieved strong results in Q4 to round out the year, exceeding expectations for the 15th consecutive quarter. Q4 year-over-year revenue growth was 16%, representing the first quarter of revenue growth acceleration since Q2 of 2021. This strong revenue growth led to our highest non-GAAP operating income quarter ever at $21.1 million, with a non-GAAP operating income margin of 14%. This represents a 700 basis points improvement from Q4 of 2022. Full year revenue growth was 17% and ARR grew 15% year-over-year in 2023 to $588.6 million. Full year non-GAAP operating income was $45.4 million, a 75% increase over 2022. This resulted in a full year non-GAAP operating income margin of 8%, a 300 basis points improvement over 2022.\n\nWe're especially proud of these strong results as the past six quarters have seen muted growth in the education and tech industries overall, along with slow PC growth. Q4 PC shipments declined nearly 3% with Mac shipments seeing a decline of 18%. We remain optimistic regarding the potential for a 2024 PC refresh cycle as predicted by IDC. However, our expectations for 2024 are not reliant on a significant uplift in device expansion. Longer term, we're still confident in our prediction that Apple technology will become the number one ecosystem in the enterprise due to continued user preference for Mac at work. We ended 2023 with 75,300 customers and 32.3 million devices on our platform. Of these customers, 41% run both Jamf management and a security product.\n\nThis represents a significant increase due to the transition of our Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. Jamf Fundamentals provides the most complete yet simple IT solution for small- to medium-sized businesses to manage and protect their Apple ecosystem. Other highlights include a continued demand for Jamf's Apple first security platform with 33% year-over-year growth in Security ARR to $134 million or 23% of Jamf's total ARR. Our strongest quarter ever for ARR added for Jamf business plan. Many of our largest sales had an upsell component, proving the value of our land and expand strategy. we continue to see positive trends across professional services, financial services and retail, which are three of the top five industries we serve, and we also saw a strong quarter in health care.\n\nOur results were driven by strong performance across our strategic focus areas of Mac leadership, management and security and Mac in Mobile. In Mac leadership, we're seeing continued growth in our customer base with customers like a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization. The Company has been a Jamf customer for nine years and after finding that their Mac platform required fewer support tickets and a lower total cost of ownership decided to take the next step and scale out their Mac Choice program with Jamf. The Company expects to use over 5,000 Mac's in the near future as a result of their upcoming refresh cycle. Moving to security. Last week, we released our Security 360 report that looks at real-world customer data, cutting-edge threat research and noteworthy industry events to provide an overview of the evolving threat landscape.\n\nAmong many striking data points, I wanted to highlight, we are now tracking 300 malware families on the Mac operating system, 21 of those families being found in 2023. It is true that Apple builds one of the most secure out-of-the-box platforms on the market, but hackers are agnostic as to the platforms they target. Jamf is the only platform that delivers an Apple First integrated management and security solution that meets the needs of the modern enterprise. Jamf enhances Apple's built-in security features by increasing visibility, prevention controls and remediation capabilities. We anticipate security to continue to become a larger part of our total ARR over time. Much of our success in security has been predicated on our ability to deliver both management and security on one platform.\n\nThe success of Jamf's bundled solution is a testament to this with ARR growth of bundled solutions outpacing most of Jamf's individual products. In Q4, over 44% of new customer pipeline generated was for security. Security products are also helping us to increase our win rates. When customers come to Jamf with security in mind, we win almost twice as often as we do when customers are looking at management alone. This was true in both Q3 and Q4, and we expect this trend to continue. We also see long-term management customers expanding with Jamf for security. In Q4, a European payments company added Jamf Protect to its 5,000 Mac's as part of a three-year agreement. Given the Company's exposure to PII and payment information, it has strict security and regulatory requirements.\n\nOur team was able to demonstrate how data flows through the product in order to meet their complex needs and deliver the powerful insights and analytics of Jamf Protect. In addition to demand for complete management and security platforms, customers are also reorganizing their infosec and IT departments so that they can manage and secure devices by technology ecosystem. This also allows end users to get the most from all of their devices while organizations can trust solutions built for the unique technology of their environment. Industry analysts, like Omdia are recognizing Jamf for its mobile-first management and security saying Omnia has seen Jamf become the primary UEM solution adopted by businesses that are well invested in the Apple ecosystem.\n\nJamf was also early to market with capabilities to securely manage shared iOS devices. Jamf's management capabilities for iOS and iPad iOS extend well beyond basic device management, including the ability to provision connectivity through eSIM and physical access tokens through key cards stored in digital wallets. This makes Jamf a strong choice for businesses looking to effectively manage and secure their Apple devices. A great example of Jamf's leadership in securely managing iOS devices is a Q4 win Learning Care Group. Learning Care Group is the second largest for-profit child care provider in North America and a leader in early education. It operates over 1,000 schools across 38 states. Learning Care Group will be migrating their 20,000 iOS devices across its locations to Jamf.\n\nWith Jamf, the Company is easily able to manage its entire fleet as well as keep all of the native apps that teachers and children use at school up to date. We continue to see many industries, especially nontraditional tech industries reach for Apple technology then to Jamf to make that tech work for their organization. As I stated earlier, we're seeing strong momentum in professional services, financial services, retail and health care. One example is Sharp Healthcare. Sharp Healthcare is the leading health provider in San Diego in a trailblazer in health care innovation. Their mission is to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine and the best place to receive care. One recent innovation is the deployment of more than 1,500 iPads to patient bedside, providing access to their medical records, patient education and entertainment.\n\nThese iPads are powered by Jamf's Healthcare Listener patented technology, which receives patient admit, discharge and transfer messages from the Epic Electronic Health Care System. The technology can automatically trigger management tasks such as remote wipe and full device reset between patients to automatically personalize the experience for each patient while ensuring personal identifiable information and protected health information are secure. Another example of a company reaching for Jamf to power its unique industry-specific workflows is the longest-running airline in India. This customer chose Jamf Pro over their existing management solution and two competitive solutions to manage 5,000 iPads with future plans to implement additional products to achieve trusted access. A modern software engineering team, huddled around their desks, discussing a software solution.\n\nJamf continues to lead the way with continued innovation across our business. One recent Apple innovation that we are particularly excited about is Vision Pro and its potential for the enterprise. Recently, Apple highlighted a number of enterprises that are deploying Vision Pro. This month, we announced we are the first to market with support for Apple Vision Pro, adding this powerful new endpoint to our Apple first security and access products, Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect. This means Jamf customers can now confidently explore new ways of working while maintaining security, performance and privacy. Additionally, with the introduction of MDM support, Provision OS 1.1 beta announced earlier this month by Apple. VisionPro will soon include the key foundations for deploying and leveraging an enterprise-grade device at scale.\n\nJamf will be working alongside Apple to support MDM in Vision Pro, and we are excited to continue to fill the gap between Apple's powerful technology and the security, identity and management needs of the enterprise. As we look ahead to 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy. We are committed to simplifying work by helping organizations succeed with Apple and by doing so at the pace of Apple. To do that, we need to ensure we have a healthy company in service to our stakeholders over the long term. Our business has evolved, both because of continued innovation in the space and because of the changing needs of our customers. Over the last few years, Jamf has been on a dedicated journey to align our workforce to meet the evolving needs of today's IT and security teams while remaining a sustainable and profitable business.\n\nOver the last year, we've seen reduced customer budgets and muted hiring and layoffs in the technology space, which in turn has elongated sales cycles and decreased customer purchases of new devices. This has put pressure on our land and expand strategy. And in Education, K-12 remains in a COVID overhang. These challenges in tech and K-12 will likely remain throughout 2024. On the flip side, we are seeing expansion in industries outside of these two, as I mentioned earlier. We are controlling what we can by transforming and adjusting our investments and resources consistent with our current growth rate. This involves a more rigorous approach than we've taken in the past. We will continue to invest in areas that further solidify Jamf's position as the leading platform for managing and securing Apple at work.\n\nWe remain committed to innovating at the pace of Apple and enhancing our platform to deliver the best solution for our customers today and in the future. We're prioritizing investments in areas where we're seeing tremendous growth and opportunity like security and AI while reducing spend in areas not providing as fast or as high returns. We've also embarked on a number of scalability and efficiency efforts, including realigning our organizational structure to match our investment areas, which resulted in a reduction in force we announced in January. These efforts span every area of our business and were subject to a rigorous process that involves each member of my management team. Ian will provide more detail on the scalability and efficiency efforts in a bit.\n\nAs a result, we are anticipating achieving nearly 700 basis points of non-GAAP operating income margin expansion in 2024 when compared to 2023. We believe this is the right course of action to align Jamf's current revenue growth profile and establish a foundation for success in the future. With that, I'll now turn it over to Ian to review our results and give more color around our 2024 outlook.\n\nIan Goodkind: Thanks, John. We ended Q4 with year-over-year revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of our revenue outlook by $1.6 million. This resulted in fiscal year-over-year revenue growth of 17%. Total ARR reached $588.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15%, exceeding expectations. For the first time since Q3 2022 we saw year-over-year new bookings growth, with Q4 representing one of our strongest quarters for commercial new bookings. This helped drive Q4 net new ARR of $22 million, resulting in Jamf's commercial ARR increasing to 74% of Jamf's total ARR and security ARR increasing to 23% of the total. These results benefited from the conversion of Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. We continue to believe that Jamf's commercial business and specifically security will be a key growth driver.\n\nSimilar to Q2 and Q3, the strategic core of Jamf's business SaaS recurring revenue remained strong in Q4. Less strategic revenue sources like license, services and on-premise revenues continued to experience year-over-year declines. Additionally, softness in Jamf's two largest industries, tech and K-12 education remained while Jamf's next three largest industries, professional services, financial services and wholesale and retail saw continued momentum. And in addition, Healthcare saw momentum too. Our net retention rate remained flat at 108% in Q4 when compared to Q3. The remainder of my remarks on margins, expense items and profitability will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP are found in our earnings release.\n\nQ4 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 82% and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate gross margins in the low 80% range and expect slight fluctuations each quarter. Non-GAAP operating income exceeded the high end of our Q4 outlook at $21.1 million or 14% margin due to increased revenues representing a 700 basis point improvement over Q4 2022. For full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, up 300 basis points increase over fiscal 2022 due to revenue outperformance and cost containment measures. Our trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin was 10% compared to 18% in the prior year. It's important to note that year-over-year decrease in unlevered free cash flow is not indicative of lost customers nor that customers are committing to shorter and lower dollar contracts with us.\n\nIn fact, customers are growing with GAP just not paying their full contract value upfront. Additionally, the trailing 12-month unlevered free cash flow margin of 10% in was slightly lower than expected, primarily related to a shift in customer payments during year-end. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 7% and resulting in a full year effective tax rate of negative 2.1% with both rates consistent with our expectations. As a reminder, for non-GAAP metrics, we use our domestic statutory rate for calculating tax impacts, which is currently 24%. Please note that we pay a negligible amount of cash taxes on a U.S. federal basis and paid an immaterial amount of cash taxes outside the U.S. Now turning to our outlook for 2024. As John discussed, we are aligning investments and resources to match Jamf's current revenue growth profile with a focus on key investment areas and scalability and efficiency initiatives.\n\nNow is the right time to take these measures to set Jamf up for profitable growth in the future and return Jamf to the rule of 40. Some of the scalability and efficiency initiatives include adjusting the sales organization for current and expected growth levels, enhancing the customer journey to make it easier to do business with us, enhancing channel relationships through stronger programs and automation, reducing reliance on steel sales. investing in process improvement and automation in sales and marketing and general administrative, leveraging leadership talent and create more efficient organizational structure and optimizing our global footprint, aligning to where our customers need us most. Most of these initiatives are in process with some same benefits in 2024 and others with benefits expected throughout the next few years.\n\nWith respect to revenue growth, given the subscription nature of our business, softness in device upsell in 2023 will impact our 2024 revenue growth rate. We expect continued pressure on device upsell through 2024. Based on these factors, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $148 million to $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%. Non-GAAP operating income of $19 million to $20 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 13% at the midpoint. For the full year 2024, total revenue of $614.5 million to $619.5 million, representing year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income of $89 million to $93 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 15% at the midpoint and a nearly 700 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2023.\n\nWhile we don't provide an outlook for ARR, we would expect to end fiscal year 2024 with ARR growth similar to full year revenue growth. With respect to unlevered free cash flows for full year 2024, we expect unlevered free cash flow margin to be similar to non-GAAP operating income margin. We also provide estimates for amortization, stock-based compensation and related payroll taxes and other metrics to assist with modeling in the earnings presentation as part of the webcast and also posted on our Investor Relations website. As we look beyond 2024, we remain committed to Jamf achieving the Rule of 40. Using our historical calculation method of revenue growth and unlevered free cash flow margin, we anticipate approaching the rule of 40 by the end of 2025.\n\nWe plan to exceed the rule of 40 in 2026. We look forward to sharing more regarding our plans through 2026 as part of our Investor Day on March 13, 2024, at NASDAQ in New York. If you would like to attend in person or virtually have yet to register, please reach out to investorevents@jamf.com. And now John and I will take your questions.

Longer term, we're still count in our prediction that Apple technology will become the number-one ecosystem in the enterprise due to continued user preference for Mac at work.\r\n We ended 2023 with 75,300 customers and 32.3 million devices on our platform. Of these customers, 41% run both Jamf management and security product. This represents a significant increase due to the transition of our Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. Jamf Fundamentals provides the most complete yet simple IT solution for small- to medium-sized businesses to manage and protect their Apple ecosystem.\r\n Other highlights include continued demand for Jamf's Apple-first security platform with 33% year-over-year growth in security ARR to $134 million or 23% of Jamf's total ARR, our strongest quarter ever for ARR added for Jamf business plan. Many of our largest sales had an upsell component, proving the value of our land-and-expand strategy.\r\n We continue to see positive trends across professional services, financial services, and retail, which are three of the top five industries we serve. And we also saw a strong quarter in healthcare.\r\n Our results were driven by strong performance across our strategic focus areas of Mac leadership, management and security, and Mac and mobile. In Mac leadership, we're seeing continued Mac growth in our customer base with customers like a leading fully integrated biopharmaceutical solutions organization.\r\n The company has been a Jamf customer for nine years. And after finding that their Mac platform required fewer support tickets and a lower total cost of ownership, decided to take the next step and scale out their Mac choice program with Jamf. The company expects to use over 5,000 Macs in the near future as a result of their upcoming refresh cycle.\r\n Moving to the security. Last week, we released our Security 360 report that looks at real-world customer data, cutting-edge threat research, and noteworthy industry events to provide an overview of the evolving threat landscape. Among many striking data points I wanted to highlight, we are now tracking 300 malware families on the Mac operating system. 21 of those families being found in 2023.\r\n It is true that Apple builds one of the most secure out-of-the-box platforms on the market basket. Hackers are agnostic as to the platforms they target. Jamf is the only platform that delivers an Apple-first integrated management and security solution that meets the needs of the modern enterprise.\r\n Jamf enhances Apple's built-in security features by increasing visibility, prevention, controls, and remediation capabilities. We anticipate security to continue to become a larger part of our total ARR over time.\r\n Much of our success in security has been predicated on our ability to deliver both management and security on one platform. The success of Jamf's bundled solution is a testament to this, with ARR growth of bundled solutions outpacing most of Jamf's individual products.\r\n In Q4, over 44% of new customer pipeline generated was for security. Security products are also helping us to increase our win rates. When customers come to Jamf with security in mind, we win almost twice as often as we do when customers are looking at management alone. This was true in both Q3 and Q4 and we expect this trend to continue.\r\n We also see long-term management customers expanding with Jamf with security. In Q4, a European payments company added Jamf Protect with 5,000 Macs as part of a three-year agreement. Given the company's exposure to PII and payment information, it has strict security and regulatory requirements. Our team was able to demonstrate how data flows through the product in order to meet their complex needs and deliver the powerful insights and analytics of Jamf Protect.\r\n In addition to demand for complete management and security platforms, customers are also reorganizing their [influence]-second IT departments so they can manage and secure devices by technology ecosystem. This also allows end users to get the most from all of their devices while organizations can trust solutions built for the unique technology of their environment.\r\n Industry analysts like Omnia are recognizing Jamf for its mobile-first management and security, saying Omnia has seen Jamf become the primary UEM solutions adopted by businesses that are well invested in the Apple ecosystem.\r\n Jamf was also early to market with capabilities to securely manage shared IOS devices. Jamf's management capabilities for IOS and iPad IOS extend well beyond basic device management, including the ability to provision connectivity through e-Sim and physical access tokens through key card stored in digital wallets.\r\n This makes Jamf a strong choice for businesses looking to effectively manage and secure their Apple devices. A great example of Jamf's leadership in securely managing IOS devices in the Q4 win, Learning Care Group. Learning Care Group is the second largest for-profit child care provider in North America and a leader in early education. It operates over 1,000 schools across 38 states.\r\n Learning Care Group will be migrating their 20,000 IOS devices across its locations to Jamf. With Jamf, the company is easily able to manage its entire fleet as well as keep all of the native apps that teachers and children use at school up to date.\r\n We continue to see many industries, especially nontraditional tech industries, reach for Apple technology, then to Jamf to make that tech work for their organization. As I stated earlier, we're seeing strong momentum in professional services, financial services, retail, and healthcare.\r\n One example is Sharp HealthCare. Sharp HealthCare is the leading health provider in San Diego and a trailblazer in healthcare innovation. Their mission is to be the best place to work, the best place to practice medicine, and the best place to receive care.\r\n One recent innovation is the deployment of more than 1,500 iPads to patient bedside, providing access to their medical records, patient education, and entertainment. These iPads are powered by Jamf's healthcare listener, patented technology, which receives patient admit, discharge, and transfer messages from the epic electronic healthcare system.\r\n The technology can automatically trigger management tasks such as remote wipe and full device reset between patients to automatically personalize the experience for each patient, while ensuring personal identifiable information and protected health information are secure.\r\n Another example of a company reaching for Jamf to power its unique industry specific workflows is the longest running airline in India. This customer chose Jamf Pro over their existing management solution and two competitive solutions to manage 5,000 iPads with future plans to implement additional products to achieve trusted access.\r\n Jamf continues to lead the way with continued innovation across our business. One recent Apple innovation that we are particularly excited about is Vision Pro and its potential for the enterprise. Recently, Apple highlighted a number of enterprises that are deploying Vision Pro.\r\n This month, we announced we are the first to market with support for Apple Vision Pro, adding this powerful new endpoint to our Apple-first security and access products, Jamf Protect and Jamf Connect. This means Jamf customers can now confidently explore new ways of working while maintaining security, performance, and privacy.\r\n Additionally, with the introduction of MDM support for Vision OS 1.1 beta announced earlier this month by Apple, Vision Pro will soon include the key foundations for deploying and leveraging an enterprise-grade device at scale. Jamf will be working alongside Apple to support MDM in Vision Pro and we are excited to continue to fill the gap between Apple's powerful technology and the security, identity, and management needs of the enterprise.\r\n As we look ahead into 2024, we will continue to execute our strategy. We are committed to simplify work by helping organizations succeed with Apple, and by doing so, at the pace of Apple. To do that, we need to ensure we have a healthy company in service to our stakeholders over the long term.\r\n Our business has evolved both because of continued innovation in this space and because of the changing needs of our customers. Over the last few years, Jamf has been on a dedicated journey to align our workforce to meet the evolving needs of today's IT and security teams while remaining sustainable and profitable business.\r\n Over the last year, we've seen reduced customer budgets and muted hiring and layoffs in the technology space, which in turn to the elongated sales cycles and decreased customer purchases of new devices. This has put pressure on our land-and-expand strategy. And in education K through 12 remains in a COVID overhang. These challenges in tech and K through 12 will likely remain throughout 2024.\r\n On the flip side, we are seeing expansion in industries outside of these two as I mentioned earlier. We are controlling what we can by transforming and adjusting our investments in resources consistent with our current growth rate. This involves a more rigorous approach that we've taken in the past.\r\n We will continue to invest in areas that further solidify Jamf's position as the leading platform for managing and securing Apple at work. We remain committed to innovating at the pace of Apple and enhancing our platform to deliver the best solution for our customers today and in the future.\r\n We're prioritizing investments in areas where we're seeing tremendous growth and opportunity like security and AI, while reducing spend in areas not providing as fast or as high returns. We've also embarked on a number of scalability and efficiency efforts, including realigning our organizational structure to match our investment areas, which resulted in a reduction in force we announced in January.\r\n These efforts span every area of our business, and we're subject to a rigorous process that involves each member of my management team. Ian will provide more detail on the scalability and efficiency efforts in a bit.\r\n As a result, we are anticipating achieving nearly 700 basis points of non-GAAP operating income margin expansion in 2024 when compared to 2023. We believe this is the right course of action to align Jamf's current revenue growth profile and establish a foundation for success in the future.\r\n With that, I'll now turn it over to Ian to review our results and give more color around our 2024 outlook.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nThanks, John. We ended Q4 with year-over-year revenue growth of 16%, exceeding the high end of our revenue outlook by $1.6 million. This resulted in fiscal year-over-year revenue growth of 17%.\r\n Total ARR reached $588.6 million, representing year-over-year growth of 15% exceeding expectations. For the first time since Q3 2022, we saw year-over-year new bookings growth with Q4 representing one of our strongest quarters for commercial new bookings.\r\n This helped drive Q4 net new ARR of $22 million, resulting in Jamf's commercial ARR increasing to 74% of Jamf's total ARR and security ARR increasing to 23% of the total. These results benefited from the conversion of Jamf Now customers to Jamf Fundamentals. We continue to believe that Jamf's commercial business, and specifically security, will be a key growth driver.\r\n Similar to Q2 and Q3, the strategic core of Jamf's business, SaaS recurring revenue, remained strong in Q4. Less strategic revenue sources like license, services, and on-premise revenues continued to experience year-over-year declines.\r\n Additionally, softness in Jamf's two largest industries, tech and K through 12 education, remained; while Jamf's next three largest industries, professional services, financial services and wholesale and retail saw continued momentum. And in addition, healthcare saw a momentum, too.\r\n Our net retention rate remained flat at 108% in Q4 when compared to Q3. The remainder of my remarks on margins, expense items, and profitability will be on a non-GAAP basis. Our GAAP financial results, along with a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP, are found in our earnings release.\r\n Q4 non-GAAP gross profit margin was 82% and within our expectations. We continue to anticipate gross margins in the low-80% range and expect slight fluctuations each quarter. Non-GAAP operating income exceeded the high end of our Q4 outlook at $21.1 million or 14% margin due to increased revenues, representing a 700 basis point improvement over Q4 2022.\r\n For full year, non-GAAP operating margin was 8%, a 300 basis point increase over fiscal 2022 due to revenue outperformance and cost containment measures. Our trailing 12-months unlevered free cash flow margin was 10% compared to 18% in the prior year. It's important to note that year-over-year decrease in unlevered free cash flow is not indicative of lost customers nor that customers are committing shorter and lower dollar contracts with us. In fact, customers are growing with Jamf just not paying their full contract value upfront.\r\n Additionally, the trailing 12 months unlevered free cash flow margin of 10% was slightly lower than expected, primarily related to a shift in customer payments during year end. Our effective tax rate for Q4 was negative 7%, resulting in a full-year effective tax rate of negative 2.1%, with both rates consistent with our expectations.\r\n As a reminder, for non-GAAP metrics, we use our domestic statutory rates for calculating tax impacts, which is currently 24%. Please note that we pay a negligible amount of cash taxes on a US federal basis and pay an immaterial amount of cash taxes outside the US.\r\n Now turning to our outlook for 2024. As John discussed, we are aligning investments and resources to match Jamf's current revenue growth profile with a focus on key investment areas and scalability and efficiency initiatives. Now is the right time to take these measures to set Jamf up for profitable growth in the future.\r\n Some of the scalability and efficiency initiatives include: adjusting the sales organization for current and expected growth levels; enhancing the customer journey to make it easier to do business with us; enhancing channel relationships through stronger programs and automation, reducing reliance on field sales; investing in process improvement and automation in sales and marketing and general and administrative; leveraging leadership talent and create more efficient organizational structures; and optimizing our global footprint, aligning to where our customers need us most.\r\n Most of these initiatives are in process with some seeing benefits in 2024 and others with benefits expected throughout the next few years.\r\n With respect to revenue growth, given the subscription nature of our business, softness in device upsell in 2023 will impact our 2024 revenue growth rate. We expect continued pressure on device upsell through 2024.\r\n Based on these factors, for the first quarter of 2024, we expect total revenue of $148 million to $150 million, representing year-over-year growth of 12% to 13%. Non-GAAP operating income of $19 million to $20 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 13% at the midpoint.\r\n For the full-year 2024, total revenue of $614.5 to $619 million, representing year-over-year growth of 10% at the midpoint. Non-GAAP operating income of $89 million to $93 million, representing a non-GAAP operating income margin of 15% at midpoint and a nearly 700 basis point improvement over fiscal year 2023.\r\n While we don't provide an outlook for ARR, we would expect to end fiscal year 2024 with ARR growth similar to full-year revenue growth. With respect to unlevered free cash flow for full-year 2024, we expect unlevered free cash flow margin to be similar to non-GAAP operating income margin.\r\n We also provide estimates for amortization, stock-based compensation, and related payroll taxes, and other metrics to assist with modeling in the earnings presentation as part of the webcast and also posted on our Investor Relations website.\r\n As we look beyond 2024, we remain committed to Jamf achieving the Rule of 40. Using our historical calculation method of revenue growth and unlevered free cash flow margin, we anticipate approaching the Rule of 40 by the end of 2025. We plan to exceed the Rule of 40 in 2026.\r\n We look forward to sharing more regarding our plans through 2026 as part of our Investor Day on March 13, 2024, at Nasdaq in New York. If you would like to attend in person or virtually and have yet to register, please reach out to investorevents@jamf.com.\r\n And now John and I will take your questions. Operator?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions)\r\n Joshua Reilly, Needham & Company.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nAll right. Thanks for taking my questions. Starting off on the macro here. Tech obviously remains a headwind. Maybe some color, were the Q4 renewal consistent with your expectations entering the quarter? And then overall with tech incrementally weaker than what you expected entering the quarter as well?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nHey, Josh, this is John. As part of Q4 renewals, no, that was in line with what we had expected, hadn't anticipated. And we're pretty happy with the Q4 performance, especially as it ended the year.\r\n And as far as the tax weakness, we just haven't seen the hiring resume in tech yet. We anticipate that's going to come along with IDC and everyone else, but we haven't seen it yet. And we also haven't contemplated in our guidance either.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nGot it. That's helpful. And then just one follow-up. If you look at the guidance for 2024, can you just help us understand, are you also assuming working on a conservative assumption around new customer activity as well? And are you planning for more contracts or renewals with device down-sell in these assumptions? Thank you.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYeah. Thanks, Josh. We build our guidance using a bottoms-up approach. And in 2024, we're factoring in the same muted economics that we saw in 2023. Also, impacting our revenue growth rates in 2024 is the reduced upsell in 2023 because we are a high recurring revenue business.\r\n And as we just talked about or you alluded to, 46% of our ARR does come from information communication, i.e., tech, which has the reduced customer hiring practices. And EDU still have the COVID overhang.\r\n On the new logos specifically, we are factoring in assumptions similar to 2023. In addition, on the less strategic choppy revenue sources, we have those factor in a slightly lower level than what we saw in 2023.\r\n But we are focused on all things we can control. We're focused on the cross-sell opportunities. We're focus on security and selling into mobile. And the thing we haven't factored in is if the upsell return, that would be something that would drive that number higher in the form of customers, hiring more employees. It would come back in the form of more refresh programs within 2024 and choice programs with that (inaudible) and on the education side and then the replacement market being even stronger than we've anticipated.\n\nJoshua Reilly\n\nGot it. Very helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nRob Owens, Piper.\n\nRob Owens\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my question. And I guess just around some of those dynamics, you stated net retention rate of 108%, which I believe was flat quarter over quarter. First part, can you just remind us of the calculation of that at that point in time versus trailing 12 months?\r\n And second, as we contemplate 2024, what are your expectations there given some of the turnover issues? I think we're seeing in high-tech and not seeing the upsell that you were likely in the last couple of years. Thanks.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nHey, Rob, I'll jump in on that question. So you're correct that our net retention rates didn't change from Q3 to Q4. Remain that one way. And as a reminder to your question, it is based on a trailing 12-month measure.\r\n What we are looking forward to based on the guidance that we just provided is that the net retention rate will trickle down throughout the year by about 100 basis points per quarter. But we do believe that actually bottoms out at the end of the year and stabilizes from our cross-sell efforts. And as the macro turn, then as we get better and better, which we are, we have gotten really good at selling security, those will go well and will accelerate that number upward.\n\nRob Owens\n\nThank you much.\n\nOperator\n\nGregg Moskowitz, Mizuho.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nHey, thank you for taking the questions. Good afternoon, guys. I guess first question, can you expand on your latest thoughts on PC and Mac refresh activity in 2024?\r\n I think we all have seen what IDC is saying. I'm wondering if you have any additional perspective from your conversations with customers. And then also what sort of assumptions around refresh are baked into this revenue guide for the full year?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nHey, Greg, I'll take the first part of that question and then Ian can expand on expectations. With respect to the PC refresh and speaking with our customers, they're just being prudent in their expense management as well. And they're just looking out into the out years, looking at what their hiring practices are. And they're just -- they're not -- we're not seeing a great anticipation (technical difficulty) But again, we're seeing the budget management. We're seeing on platform consolidation, and that's kind of how we set our guidance accordingly in '24.\r\n Ian, do you got something more?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. What I'll add on that refresh program within 2024, we are factoring the same economics we saw in 2023. So we saw that lack of upsell of device expansion in 2023. So we're factoring in that same muted upsell at renewal.\r\n But if that comes back, we see that as a good opportunity for us as choice programs come into play. We do note in that IDC article and other places and other checks that we've heard is an opportunity next year for refresh cycle. So that is something we think could be a tailwind for us next year.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nPerfect. Thanks, Ian. Just as a follow-up, you mentioned, John, that you saw benefit from Jamf Now conversions to Jamf Fundamentals. Are you able to put a finer point perhaps on how this is impacting the business today as well as how it may help in 2024 and beyond? Thank you.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, I can certainly speak to what the customer is seeing from the benefit. And then Ian can follow up with some with some numbers, if needed. You know, really we've seen a tremendous value. Our customers have seen a tremendous value with the security and the management being part of the same product. In fact, when we go to market with security and management, we win almost twice as many times as we just are talking about security on its own.\r\n And we also have a greater stickiness when those customers are using our using both our management and security products together. And so this was really something our customers have asked for with respect to the security side. And so we wanted to make sure that we had that bundled solution for those customers. And there's been a great benefit.\r\n We've done that a few months ago. And we haven't really seen any negative pushback or attrition from that as a result. So we're getting good feedback from our customers.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes, I would just add some number of points to that. Out of the net new ARR of $22 million, the impact was about $6 million. We haven't seen any material changes in churn there. So customers are loving it and accepting it. And we are seeing success in our other bundles.\r\n And just to quote to other stats there, one, we see 79% growth year over year when combining both our business plan and enterprise plan. And in the fourth quarter alone, Jamf business plan had the most successful quarter in the form of net new ARR.\n\nGregg Moskowitz\n\nVery helpful. Thank you, guys.\n\nOperator\n\nDJ Hynes, Canaccord Genuity.\n\nHey, guys, this is Ryan on for DJ. So I just wanted to double click on some of the go-to-market motions you're building out, I guess, particularly the self-directed and the partner-led motions we've spoken about before. Can you just elaborate on any traction you're seeing there? And I guess, like when we'd start to see any of that progress reflected in S&M as we progress through 2024?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nOkay, Ryan, this is John here. So I've got two parts of that question. One is how the go-to-market has been optimized through self-directed; and the other is through our partner. We would classify that as our third-party channel as well as our strategic partnerships.\r\n And with respect to the first one, the self-directed, that's really what the investment opportunity or investments that we have done in our systems to gain some efficiencies there that we'll see primarily toward the back half of the year.\r\n And those are things like the partner portal. When partners can come in and actually put data directly into the portal and make their own quotes. It's also buying product from within the product, whether that's additional seats on their renewal or additional products from within our product. And those are all things that we're putting into place from a technological investment.\r\n With respect to our third-party channel, we've actually increased the amount of business going through that third-party channel on a global basis. We've always run primarily channel led outside the US and in the US, that's becoming even more so, and in fact, increasing in its percentage there.\r\n And we're going to continue to do that. Some of the optimizations that we've done in our go-to-market teams just early even this year are really focused on that, leveraging more in the channel, which we've talked about for some time. And that's actually coming to fruition. And we're seeing that in the percentage of our business going through our channel partners.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Great to hear. And then I guess just a quick follow-up. I know you have your Investor Day coming up in a couple of weeks. But when you talk about meeting the Rule of 40 by the end of 2025 and exceeding it in 2026, can you help me think about like what are your expectations there between the balance of growth and profitability?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes, I can talk to that. So we would expect our revenue to be a higher growth rate in '25 and '26 than what we see in 2024 for all the reasons of the tailwinds that we mentioned that we haven't factored into 2024. With 2025 and 2026 profitability, we would expect that to expand as well.\r\n As we talked about, we have certain initiatives to make the customer journey easier. We have certain back-office automation, and both those will provide benefits in '25 and '26. And as a last reminder I make here is you'll hear more specifics on that at our Investor Day on March 13 at Nasdaq in New York.\n\nOkay. Awesome. Thanks. Appreciate the time.\n\nOperator\n\nJake Roberge, William Blair.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nHey. Thanks for taking the questions. I know it's hard to predict when hiring really starts to ramp more meaningfully. But as you look into 2024, should we expect the headwinds in tech and education to trough this year? Or does that dynamic that we'll still have to kind of deal with and work through in 2025 as you work through some of the longer renewal cycles from potentially larger tech customers and education customers? Just curious how those renewal cycles are shaping up heading into next year.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, Jake. This is John. We, along with a lot of the market, had anticipated the tech hiring to resume in 2023 or the back half of '23. But we didn't see that. And so really taking that into consideration, we wanted to have a balanced approach going into our 2024 guidance, which is what we see here.\r\n So we're going to continue to run a balanced growth profile with investing in growth as well while maintaining profitability in the meantime.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nOne thing I'd add, as we look at our, let's say, top five industries, so we talked about tech and education, we are actually seeing continued strength in the next three pieces or industries. So professional services, financial services, and retail and wholesale. And those have provided a really good strength and growth rate for us. And we're really excited about the opportunities in those segments.\r\n And the last thing I'd mention here is as we've talked about non-tech leading important industries have really been looking at that flip use of our products, and that has been a success story for us as well.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nOkay. Very helpful. And then really nice growth in the security suite this quarter. Now that you're hitting a more meaningful scale there, how should we think about a durable growth rate in that segment?\r\n And then just kind of on the other side of that coin, do you expect to see similar headwinds in the security business in 2024 as you see on the device management side? Or could that actually be more insulated heading into next year?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. On the security side, look, we have a business that grew 33% year over year. It now represents 23% of our total ARR. We continue to think that's a really strong focus point for us that we've allocated resources that way. And we think that can continue to be a very strong rate -- growth rate in the future.\r\n I would say that we are going to provide more details around that at our Investor Day. But what we are seeing and it goes back to our bundles discussion before, when we are combining management and security, it has been a very successful win rate. And we actually are seeing customers stay a little bit more sticky and are happier when we combine those products together.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nAnd Jake, I'll just add to that as well. I mean speaking to our customers, they're certainly not investing less in security. And as our customers will come back to us and talk about Apple's specific functionality that we have, that's really been a benefit.\r\n And when you combine that with the management piece, not only can you identify the threat, but you can also do something about it and actually deploy that, that's really what we've seen. So we're continuing to be optimistic about the management and security piece together and how that resonates with our customer base.\n\nJake Roberge\n\nSounds great. Thank you for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nMatt Hedberg, RBC.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGreat, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. John, have you noticed anything competitively, maybe an increased pipeline or anything of that from VM or AirWatch, just kind of given the ongoing acquisition there by Broadcom? And just sort of want to competitively, is there anything there maybe improving a bit?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. Thanks, Matt. It certainly has. We've been working on this for quite a while. And while we are really optimistic about that replacement opportunity, it's not going to happen all at once, just given those customers have multiyear contracts. And we're really tied into that customer base.\r\n And so when those renewals come up, we're certainly showing the advantage of not only the management security together, but then an Apple-led and Apple-focused ecosystem support. And that again, is resonating with our customer base. So we continue to remain optimistic about that. And now with the recent events that have transpired over the last few days, we were even just as, if not even more optimistic about it.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGot it. And that's great. There's a lot of good commentary specifically what you guys are doing to maybe offset some of the tougher spending that you're seeing, other device adds, headcount growth, et cetera. But I still reflect on the opportunity still seems like such a greenfield opportunity as it stands.\r\n Are there things from either strategic marketing or targeting greenfield accounts through like ROI-based selling that can drive sort of up above Jamf growth above market trends? Maybe from -- just trying to go after what feels like a really, really greenfield opportunity still?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, there's all of the above. I mean, we're certainly doing all the account base. We're doing all the analytics and making sure that we target the accounts that are available. And with what we mentioned earlier, just with budgets being a rather muted this year in anticipation of tech hiring and the refresh cycle in education, we're certainly poised for that.\r\n We've done a lot of the market research, and we've had some elongated sales cycles like many of us in the industry have. But again, the opportunity is there. We've got great win rates, especially when we put management and security together. We'll just keep doubling down on those things that have been successful and open up new areas where they become available. And the replacement market is just one.\r\n Ian mentioned earlier about the desk lists workflows and industry workflows that we're seeing with all the other additional devices that are coming out from Apple and the ones that are out now just being put into process in a lot of different functions in ways that we hadn't anticipated before. And that's also something that we're really focused on and working with our channel partners to really optimize and take advantage of that opportunity.\n\nMatthew Hedberg\n\nGreat. Thanks.\n\nOperator\n\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\n\nHey, this is Isaac on for Raimo. Thanks for taking the question. John, you've talked about enterprise being a bit more resilient than SMB over the last couple of quarters. And I was wondering if there was anything to call out here, whether to the benefit of enterprise again or the weakness of SMB.\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes, thanks, Isaac. We've seen -- when we talk about the volatility in the SMB, as markets uncertainty, you have small businesses that can go out of business or get bought. There a lot of reasons for them, that volatility to have nothing to do with the products that they're using necessarily. So we've seen some there, but I don't think any more than the industry on average.\r\n We have -- two-thirds of our business is volume base, small-to-medium size. But we have a good chunk of that business and enterprise. And we've seen the scalability that we provide over -- doing this for over 20 years alongside Apple that has really, really resonated with our customers.\r\n In fact, when we get into the enterprise, the higher we get up, generally the less competition we have, especially as it relates to the Apple -- as it relates to the Apple ecosystem. So they're good benefits in the enterprise.\r\n We saw Q4 finished strong. We saw companies that had budget the end of the quarter that went ahead and pulled the trigger on that. And we've seen some good progress earlier this year, even with the enterprise groups.\n\nGreat. That's really helpful. And then one for Ian. On cash flow, you talked again about the shift from upfront to annual billings. Was the level there similar to last quarter? Should we think about that being a bit more predominant now in the customer base? And then as we look into FY24, should we expect that shift to move back to upfront or to the end of the year?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. Just to clarify a couple of things there. So when comparing '23 to '22, the primary driver was that shift in multiyear being -- that used to be paid upfront to annually paid. That was the primary driver. Within the quarter itself, we actually saw our customers just defer payments to basically January of '24. So it was just a timing issue, not indicative of our business. Neither of those are.\r\n As we roll forward, I would say operating income or margin is the bigger driver of our unlevered free cash flows as we move forward. And we just raised our operating income about 700 basis points. And we've said that unlevered free cash flow is going to be about consistent with that. And that has factored in all the changes in customer payment behaviors.\n\nAll right, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nChad Bennett, Craig Hallum.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nGreat. Thanks for taking my questions and fitting me in. So Ian maybe, just in terms of how we should think about both device growth and ARR per device relative to your revenue growth guidance, is there any type of correlation there? And how should we think about those two metrics?\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nYes. I would call your attention back to our growth algorithm. We have new logos. We have upsell, device expansion, and we have cross-sell. And we are going to continue to focus on those things that we can control, which is cross-sell specifically.\r\n We are factoring in the same upsell, muted upsells at renewal. But we are definitely focused on the successes we've had and seeing customers see the value in both management and security. That is where we're going to drive, and specifically, in the bundles because we think that's what drives the most customer value.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nAnd then maybe one quick follow-up for John. Just kind of a follow-up on the competitive question, I guess, a couple of questions ago. Just specific to the endpoint security market and protect. And obviously that product is still growing nicely. Is there any kind of new revelations there just competitively now that you're another quarter and year into that product and into that endpoint security market that you'd like to share?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. I mean, you're right, Protect has done really well and we're very happy about that. In fact, in security in general, 44% of our pipeline was security. So we're really seeing to get traction there.\r\n With Protect, we continue to add functionality to it. We're going to continue to add more pieces of security as our customers' requests that. And yes, I mean, that's pretty much all we have to do with Protect. It's done well. Our reps are becoming even more well versed in selling that, especially as it relates to in conjunction with security. And we're going to continue to double down on that.\n\nChad Bennett\n\nGot it. Thanks much.\n\nOperator\n\nPat Walravens, JMP.\n\nPat Walravens\n\nGreat. Thank you. I think, John, usually companies guide revenue below where expectations are after they've had a disappointing bookings or a renewal quarter. But in your case, it sounds like bookings and renewals in Q4 were actually pretty good. So when did you guys decide it was time to increase the profitability to align with the current growth profile, as you worded it in the press release?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nThanks, Pat. Good question. No. We understand that. And what we're really trying to do is have a balanced approach to profitability and growth going into 2024. And as I mentioned earlier, we, as the rest of the market, expected that returned to come in mid even until late '25 -- or '23, and that didn't happen. So we're just trying to be judicious in our approach in our guidance in '24.\r\n As Ian mentioned, there are things that could impact that in 2024. The tech hiring could resume. We expect that there's going to be an EDU refresh. But we haven't anticipated that in our guidance because the market hasn't behaved like we thought it was going to in '23.\r\n And so we're just making sure that we're doing the right thing for the business and our customers long term. And that's making sure that we're optimized for efficiency and scalability as we go into '24. But we are well placed to be able to scale up when those growth vectors continue or start to resume. And we're watching that very, very closely. So we're on point.\n\nPat Walravens\n\nOkay, great. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nKoji Ikeda, Bank of America Securities.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nYes. Hey, guys. Thanks for taking the questions. There's a couple from me here. First one, maybe a question for John or Ian. What do you view as the most attractive levers to drive upside to growth in 2024?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nYes. I'll take that one, Koji. So our most attractive levers, we have many of them. We really do. I mean, certainly the replacement market. Absence of the tech hiring resuming and the ED refresh and those things we've already talked about, but certainly the replacement market as it becomes more apparent. And again, the events of the last few days have continued our optimism in that as we really lean into those customers and show the value of management and security together, especially at scale and focused on Apple first and Apple best. So those are the areas that we really see.\r\n International is a great opportunity for us. We saw some softness in international in the middle of the year in '23. We saw that tick up towards the end of the year. We continue to see that at the beginning of this year.\r\n So as Apple mentioned on their earnings call that they've had some success internationally as well. We work very closely with Apple outside the US and in the US but certainly outside the US. And so we're continuing to leverage that as we expand internationally. So those would be some of the biggest areas.\r\n And then I guess to wrap it up would be security. I mean, every device can have one device management product on it. But every device can have five or six or more security products on it. And IT and infosec teams generally do that. They want belt and suspenders on security. And then when we offer something that's Apple specific along with the management fees, that gives us a good opportunity and really a lever to increase.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nYes. Got it. That's super helpful. And maybe following up to Pat's question, just booking sounds good. So what sort of triggers are you looking for as maybe a signal that it's time to invest at a greater rate than what the plan is currently set for?\n\nJohn Strosahl\n\nWe've seen close ratios while sales cycles have been elongated. We've seen close ratios maintained pretty similar. We measure our go-to-market organization with a very disciplined and rigorous approach. Our cadence is very, very tight on that.\r\n And so we can get those leading indicators and shift accordingly. So we know that sales cycle is starting to drop. We know if that conversion rate is starting to go higher. We know when the ASPs of each one of those deals in the pipeline are starting to raise. Any one of those indicators are going to lead us to really lean in to that and to invest in that growth. And also geographically, to the extent that we've seen international continue to take the momentum up, we're going to look at that and invest in that area as well.\n\nIan Goodkind\n\nI would just add one thing on our operating income guidance there at a midpoint of 15%, we are committed. To John's point, we have optimized our organization and made it so we can commit -- continue to commit to that 15%.\n\nKoji Ikeda\n\nThanks, guys. Thanks for taking the questions.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This does conclude the question-and-answer session of today's program. I'd like to hand the program back to Jennifer Gaumond for any further remarks.\n\nJennifer Gaumond\n\nThanks, Jonathan, and thank you again for joining us today.

        "title": "Berkshire and Lilly Race to Shake Tech’s Grip on Trillion-Dollar Club",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Big Tech stocks created, and have so far dominated, the trillion-dollar club in the US. For the first time, there’s a race brewing for an outsider to join their ranks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Apple's Scrapped Car Project Means AI and Headset Bets Are More Urgent\n\nRallies since the start of the year in Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. — which has its hands in businesses ranging from Dairy Queen to Fruit of the Loom — and weight-loss drug darling Eli Lilly & Co. have the two jockeying for a spot in that top echelon of S&P 500 stocks. The two firms couldn’t be more different — from each other and the tech giants they’re chasing.\n\nThe Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate has slowly but steadily marched upward to command a market valuation of nearly $900 billion. In contrast, the world’s largest drugmaker has momentum on its side after rapidly tripling in value over the past two years. A recent paradigm shift in how the world treats obesity has left Lilly’s value standing at more than $700 billion.\n\nAs Wall Street obsesses over the narrow breadth of the stock market’s ascent, the two firms provide a key foil for the so-called Magnificent Seven which have held sway over the market. Fascination with the tech giants has juiced their valuations and shot the S&P 500 well ahead of an equal-weighted version of the benchmark that dilutes the megacaps’ impact, leaving investors searching for fresh narratives outside of all things artificial intelligence-related.\n\n“You’ve got two other companies besides the tech names that are exciting to talk about,” said Matt Orton, chief market strategist at Raymond James Investment Management. “It gets the conversation started that there’s a lot working within the market besides megacap tech.”\n\nStory continues\n\n“That’s generally a good thing — to highlight that there is in fact non-tech breadth out there,” he added.\n\nTortoise vs Hare\n\nBerkshire and Lilly have taken very different paths to their current valuations, climbing roughly 15% and 59% last year, respectively. While Buffett’s firm reported growing operating earnings from its medley of insurance, energy, railroad and other businesses, Lilly has skyrocketed on hopes for demand for its blockbuster weight-loss drugs, Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nIf either stock were to replicate its 2023 gains in the months ahead, they would surpass a market capitalization of $1 trillion, joining the ranks of tech giants including Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Nvidia Corp.\n\nSuch returns are never guaranteed, not even for the Oracle of Omaha, who reminded investors of that recently.\n\n“All in all, we have no possibility of eye-popping performance,” Buffett wrote in his annual letter to shareholders over the weekend, cautioning that the company’s size constrains its ability to make needle-moving deals.\n\nStill, a deal could be one catalyst for the stock. “If it’s seen by the market as a smart play — which Warren Buffett typically does — they could make that bounce over the trillion-dollar goal line,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist for LPL Financial.\n\nMeanwhile, optimism about Lilly’s prospects rose at Morgan Stanley where earlier this month analysts lifted their price target to $950 on the drugmaker, the highest on the Street. The bank’s analysts speculated on if Lilly would become the first trillion-dollar biopharmaceutical company, signaling there’s room for the stock to run higher.\n\nConsensus still implies a long road for Lilly to hit the $1 trillion milestone. Analysts tracked by Bloomberg have an average price target of $777 on Lilly, putting it at a less than $750 billion valuation over the next year, according to Bloomberg calculations.\n\nSky High\n\nLilly’s valuation premium may be behind Wall Street’s skepticism. The stock currently trades above its five-year average at about 57 times forward earnings, far higher than that of the front-runner of the AI revolution, Nvidia, or any of the other names in the Magnificent Seven with the exception of Tesla Inc. Meanwhile, Berkshire trades below most of the group on a price-to-earnings basis.\n\nCrossing the Line\n\nIn the US, tech giants have long ruled the thirteen-digit ranks. Apple first broke the ceiling in 2018. Microsoft recently eclipsed the $3 trillion mark and currently commands the highest market capitalization in the S&P 500.\n\nNvidia has been flirting with the $2 trillion mark, while Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. all trade above a $1 trillion valuation. Tesla joined the club’s elite ranks amid its feverish 2021 rally, but has since dropped out — a warning to future new conscripts.\n\n“When valuations become richer and richer, it doesn’t matter which company it is, which sector, the market becomes much more discerning and therefore more critical — and demanding more positive guidance during the earnings season,” said LPL’s Krosby.\n\nThe promise of new markets for its weight-loss treatments — ranging from heart failure to sleep apnea — is a likely factor in propelling Lilly toward the one trillion milestone, according to Shams Afzal, a portfolio manager at Carnegie Investment Counsel.\n\n“Lilly has truly become the unicorn in the space,” Afzal said. “It may not touch a trillion dollars this year, but the milestone is not an improbable one.”\n\nIf Berkshire breaks into $1 trillion territory, it will be in part due to the success of one of the tech giants it’s chasing: Apple is the top holding in the firm’s stocks portfolio after Buffett amassed a roughly $165 billion stake. Last year’s 48% rally in Apple shares bolstered that position.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen There’s One Musk Endeavor That’s Not Doing So Great China’s Piano Dreams Are Fading for a Cash-Strapped Middle Class Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta in the $1 Trillion Club",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is widely considered to be one of the most successful investors in history. He was born in 1930 and bought his first stock at age 11. By 1965, he was running his own investment company, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B).\n\nBuffett remains at the helm of Berkshire today. It has amassed an expansive portfolio that includes several wholly owned private companies, and 47 publicly traded stocks and securities.\n\nBerkshire's largest holding is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), which became the world's first $1 trillion company in 2018. That rare milestone has since been achieved by five other technology giants: Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Nvidia, and Meta Platforms.\n\nBerkshire could be the first U.S. company outside the tech sector to join the $1 trillion club. Its stock has delivered a mammoth 4,384,748% gain since 1965, carrying the company to a valuation of almost $900 billion. Here's why it could cross the trillion-dollar milestone as soon as this year. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nBuffett's investing strategy is simple\n\nBuffett is all about value investing. He likes to buy great businesses at a fair price -- though the cheaper the better -- with the intention of holding on to them for the long term. He looks for companies generating a steady profit, combined with consistent revenue growth and strong management teams. He especially likes companies that return money to shareholders through dividends and stock buybacks.\n\nBuffett's most powerful weapon is time. He's a big advocate for compound interest, which is responsible for building most of his wealth. For example, Berkshire spent $1.3 billion accumulating shares of Coca-Cola between 1988 and 1994. Today, that position is worth $24.4 billion -- but it also paid Berkshire $736 million in dividends in 2023.\n\nIn other words, Berkshire recoups its initial Coca-Cola investment in dividends alone every two years. But that's just one of the conglomerate's many success stories.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire's portfolio is filled with high-quality businesses\n\nBerkshire was a textiles company on the brink of failure before Buffett stepped in and bought it in 1965. He quickly realized its core business was no longer viable, so he transformed it into a holding company to house various investments.\n\nBerkshire now has a full ownership stake in a number of famous businesses including Dairy Queen, Duracell, and GEICO. Plus, its portfolio of publicly traded stocks and securities is worth $371.9 billion, a sizable portion of which is attributable to one stock: Apple.\n\nBerkshire first bought Apple stock in 2016 and it has steadily increased the size of its position over time, spending around $38 billion in total. That single holding is worth $165.3 billion as of this writing, accounting for 44% of the total value of Berkshire's portfolio of publicly traded securities.\n\nBank of America and American Express are Berkshire's second- and third-largest holdings, respectively. Last year, Berkshire received more than $2.1 billion in dividends from its top three positions alone.\n\nBerkshire owns smaller positions in energy companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum. Plus, if owning American Express wasn't enough, its portfolio also includes the two other major credit card companies, Visa and Mastercard.\n\nWhile Buffett is known to avoid most technology stocks, Berkshire has accumulated small positions in Amazon and cloud computing company Snowflake.\n\nBerkshire's market-crushing returns are the result of incredible financial growth\n\nAs I touched on at the top, Berkshire stock has delivered a whopping 4,384,748% gain since 1965, or 19.8% compounded annually. That trounces the 31,223% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index over the same period, which translates to just 10.2% compounded annually.\n\nThe difference is staggering in dollar terms. A mere $1,000 invested in Berkshire stock in 1965 would be worth $48.4 million today. The same investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $313,230.\n\nThe conglomerate has the financial results to back up those substantial gains. It generated $49.3 million in revenue in 1965, and in 2023, that number was a record-high $364.4 billion. Over $155.6 billion came from sales and services across the various businesses under Berkshire's umbrella, with a further $83.4 billion coming from its insurance businesses. Its railroad, utility, and energy interests contributed $101.4 billion.\n\nBerkshire also delivered a record profit last year, with a net income of $96.2 billion. That compares to just $2.3 million in net income in 1965.\n\nBerkshire could join the $1 trillion club in 2024\n\nWith a market capitalization of almost $900 billion as of this writing, Berkshire stock only needs a gain of about 11% from here to cross the $1 trillion milestone. Considering its 58-year track record of delivering 19.8% annual returns, on average, it appears sure to get there in 2024.\n\nA number of factors will probably work in the conglomerate's favor as the year progresses. The stock market is at an all-time high right now, and most Wall Street analysts predict it will continue to move higher. Plus, Berkshire could earn record dividends in 2024 because companies like Apple, Coca-Cola, and American Express continue to increase their payouts.\n\nIn the broader economy, the U.S. Federal Reserve estimates it will cut interest rates three times in 2024, which will serve as a tailwind for Berkshire's consumer-focused businesses. Its transport and logistics businesses would also benefit if rate cuts drive more economic activity.\n\nFinally, Buffett continues to believe in the conglomerate's prospects because he authorized the repurchase of almost $9.2 billion worth of Berkshire's shares in 2023. Buffett has overseen $73.6 billion worth of share repurchases during the last five years alone, which is more than he has deployed into any other stock.\n\nBuffett recently told investors that Berkshire's enormous size will prevent it from generating \"eye-popping performance\" in the future, but based on its share repurchases, it's clear he still feels Berkshire stock is the best bet he can make in the world.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Financial Freedom? These 5 Dividend Stocks Offer Fantastic Passive Income to Help You on Your Way.",
        "content": "Financial freedom is a beautiful goal and the reason many people invest. Being able to work because you want to, not because you have to, is the ultimate flex. You can take different roads and get to the same place, but dividend stocks are an excellent path for this journey.\n\nDividend stocks are shares of companies that share their profits with you. Own enough of them, and the dividends might even cover your living expenses without you having to sell shares to raise money.\n\nConsider adding these five fantastic stocks to your portfolio if you want dividend-driven financial freedom.\n\nThey have the goods to pay you ever-increasing dividends for the foreseeable future.\n\n1. A real estate stock yielding 5.8%\n\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) is a real estate investment trust (REIT): a company that leases real estate it owns and pays at least 90% of its taxable income to shareholders as dividends. A REIT allows investors to benefit from real estate profits without owning properties.\n\nRealty Income focuses on single-tenant retail properties, including grocery stores, convenience stores, dollar stores, restaurants, and more. These are recession-proof businesses, which means they can reliably pay their rent.\n\nThe company uses net leases, which obligate the tenant to pay taxes, insurance, and maintenance. It makes Realty Income's business more dependable because there isn't much to disrupt its revenue streams.\n\nRealty Income has paid and raised its dividend for 31 consecutive years, and its 71% dividend payout ratio leaves room for plenty more increases.\n\n2. A dependable 9.5% superyield\n\nAltria Group(NYSE: MO) sells tobacco products, primarily Marlboro cigarettes, in the United States. It also sells cigars, oral tobacco, and smokeless nicotine products like On oral pouches. Smoking rates in America have declined for decades, but Altria uses its pricing power to offset declining volumes with higher prices. The company is a Dividend King with 54 consecutive years of increases.\n\nStory continues\n\nA high dividend yield can be a red flag. However, Altria looks like an exception to the rule. Dependable cash flows, a manageable 80% payout ratio, and a strong balance sheet should allow management to keep tacking on small increases. The company must slowly transition away from cigarettes as a core business, but there is time for that to happen over the coming years. Until then, keep banking that humungous dividend.\n\n3. Warren Buffett's largest holding\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is more than a household name for its iOS devices: It's the largest investment in Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, by a country mile. Buffett admires the company for its strong loyalty from consumers who religiously buy and upgrade their iPhones, smartwatches, and other personal electronics. Apple is so big it generates a remarkable $106 billion in free cash flow annually. Not revenue, free cash flow.\n\nThat sets up investors for a ton of dividend growth. Apple has raised its dividend yearly since it began paying shareholders 11 years ago. The dividend payout ratio is still tiny at just 14%, so decades of dividend increases are likely ahead. That should be music to the ears of any long-term investor.\n\n4. A long-term wealth compounder\n\nHome Depot(NYSE: HD) is one of the most successful stocks ever. Shares have returned more than 3,000,000% since its initial public offering (IPO), creating life-changing returns for long-term investors. How? Home Depot became the largest home improvement retailer in North America. Homes are part of people's identity. People make upgrades and repairs, and new homes are constantly being built.\n\nThe company is also a stellar dividend stock. The company has raised its payout for 14 consecutive years after freezing it during the Great Recession. Today, the payout ratio is manageable at 46% of cash flow, so investors should look for raises to continue at a healthy pace. The average increase over the past five years is an impressive 15%.\n\n5. A legendary cult coffee brand\n\nStarbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX) has a grip on consumers that few food and beverage companies do. I'm sure you, or someone you know, loves their Starbucks. The company's loyalty program has a whopping 34.3 million active 90-day users in America alone.\n\nStarbucks has expanded from the northwestern United States to become a global juggernaut with 38,587 open stores worldwide. Starbucks is highly profitable and returns a lot of its profits to investors. The company has paid and raised its dividend for 13 consecutive years.\n\nIt also repurchases a ton of stock to help boost earnings growth. The company's outstanding shares have decreased 25% over the past decade. Juggling both has made Starbucks a stock that can deliver income at its current 2.4% yield and total returns. The payout ratio is solid at 56%, so investors can continue to buy and hold confidently and expect more of the same.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meet the 2 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Currently Held in Warren Buffett's $621 Million \"Secret\" Portfolio",
        "content": "Few money managers command the attention of professional and retail investors quite like the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), Warren Buffett.\n\nSince becoming Berkshire's chief in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a jaw-dropping 5,080,168% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 23. For context, we're talking about a nearly 20% annualized return spanning six decades, which is roughly double the annualized total return, including dividends, of the benchmark S&P 500 over the same period. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nEven though the Oracle of Omaha and his team of investors aren't perfect, their track record undeniably points to a history of recognizing plain-as-day values hiding in plain sight. This is why investors pay such close attention to Berkshire Hathaway's quarterly Form 13F filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nA 13F offers a snapshot of what Wall Street's brightest minds purchased and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the December-ended quarter). However, Berkshire's 13F doesn't tell the complete story of Berkshire Hathaway's equity holdings.\n\nWarren Buffett has a \"secret\" portfolio that contains two prominent Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nIn 1998, Buffett's company completed a $22 billion acquisition of General Re. While the reinsurance segment was the catalyst behind the deal, General Re also owned a specialty investment firm known as New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire purchased General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM.\n\nBecause New England Asset Management continues to oversee more than $100 million in assets under management, it's required to file a 13F with the SEC every quarter. Although Warren Buffett isn't involved with the investing activity at NEAM in the same way he is with Berkshire Hathaway's $371 billion portfolio, the $621 million NEAM had invested as of Dec. 31, 2023 is, nevertheless, part of Berkshire Hathaway's aggregate holdings. In other words, New England Asset Management is Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs of the end of 2023, this $621 million portfolio held positions in 115 securities, which includes common stock, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), and preferred stock. But what really stands out is this portfolio's stake in two of the Magnificent Seven stocks.\n\nThey are seven of the largest and most-influential publicly traded companies in the United States. I'm referring to:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stocks have two lures. First, as you can see in the chart above, they have handily outperformed the broad-based S&P 500.\n\nMore importantly, the Magnificent Seven provide sustained competitive advantages and/or virtually impenetrate moats.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is the leading global operating system, while its Azure has quickly become the world's No. 2 provider of cloud infrastructure services. Apple's iPhone is the clear leader in smartphone market share in the United States. Furthermore, Apple's share-repurchase program is unrivaled, with more than $600 billion worth of its common stock bought back since the start of 2013. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) could account for up to a 90% share of GPUs deployed in artificial intelligence (AI) accelerated data centers in 2024. Amazon's marketplace captured a nearly 38% share of online spending in the U.S. in 2023. Meanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services. Alphabet's Google accounted for more than 91% of global internet search in January. It also owns Google Cloud, the world's No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider, and YouTube, the second-most-visited social site on the planet. Meta Platforms' social media real estate is unmatched. Facebook is the most-visited site globally, and its family of apps attracted just shy of 4 billion monthly active users in the fourth quarter. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker and the only EV pure play that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nWarren Buffett's secret portfolio holds stakes in two of these seven companies. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's hidden portfolio is Alphabet, the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud, and autonomous vehicle company Waymo, among other ventures. NEAM closed out December with 18,200 shares of Alphabet's Class A shares (GOOGL), which were worth more than $2.5 million at the time.\n\nThe longtime draw for investors to Alphabet has been its foundational search engine. It's been nearly nine years since Google last accounted for less than a 90% share of worldwide internet search in a given month. As a virtual monopoly, it is able to command exceptionally strong ad-pricing power and take advantage of disproportionately long periods of economic expansion. Internet search should continue to be a healthy cash-flow driver.\n\nHowever, the company's most-exciting cash flow growth is liable to come from its smaller but substantially faster-growing segments. For instance, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating income in 2023 after years of steady operating losses. Businesses are still very early in the cloud spending cycle, which suggests the high margins associated with cloud infrastructure services can really lift Alphabet's cash flow.\n\nSimilarly, YouTube's monthly active user count is marching higher. Daily views for Shorts (short-form videos that usually last less than 60 seconds) have climbed from 6.5 billion in early 2021 to north of 50 billion in early 2023. This represents an excellent monetization opportunity for YouTube, as well as another catalyst to spark an increase in high-margin subscriptions.\n\nAlphabet remains cheap, as well. Despite a sizable bounce from their 2022 bear market low, shares of the company can be picked up for less than 13 times estimated cash flow per share in 2025. That's a marked discount to the average multiple to cash flow of 17.9 that Alphabet has traded at over the trailing-five-year period.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nAt one time, Warren Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio had a sizable position in Apple and owned shares of GPU giant Nvidia. But as of Dec. 31, 2023, neither company remained in New England Asset Management's $621 million portfolio. The only Magnificent Seven stock represented in that portfolio, other than Alphabet, is tech stock Microsoft. NEAM held 30,845 shares of the company as of Dec. 31, which equated to roughly $11.6 million in market value.\n\nThe reason asset managers are attracted to Microsoft is its exceptional cash flow, which is a function of its seemingly flawless operating model and pristine balance sheet.\n\nAs I've pointed out previously, Microsoft's success is a reflection of its blending the old with the new. Although its legacy Windows and Office segments are no longer growing much, if at all, they still generate exceptionally juicy margins that provide abundant cash flow. The company is able to use this cash to reinvest in high-growth initiatives or make acquisitions.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, Microsoft is betting its future on cloud services (including Azure), as well as the rise of AI. It has invested billions in OpenAI, the company behind popular chatbot ChatGPT, and is expecting longtail growth from the AI revolution.\n\nAnd Microsoft is one of only two publicly traded companies with the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's, a division of S&P Global. The company closed out 2023 with $81 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and it's on pace for almost $99 billion in net cash generated from operations in fiscal 2024, based on the $49.4 billion of net cash it has generated through the first six months of its current fiscal year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy on the Dip",
        "content": "The stocks known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has had a pretty mixed start to the year. This group includes high-profile tech companies that delivered excellent returns over the past decade: Alphabet, Amazon, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia, and Tesla.\n\nSome of them, most notably Meta Platforms and Nvidia, have been outperformers since January, while others haven't had the same luck. Apple is in the latter category -- the stock is down by nearly 5% year to date, the second-worst performance in the group.\n\nStill, that's no reason to ignore Apple stock. Let's find out why Apple remains an excellent pick for long-term investors. GOOG Chart\n\nApple's quarterly update wasn't great\n\nApple's shares fell following the release of its financial results for the first quarter of 2024, which ended Dec. 30, 2023. The tech giant's results were not great, especially on the top line. Net sales increased by just about 2% year over year to $119.6 billion. Apple's earnings per share did increase by a solid 16% year over year to $2.18. There's a reason why investors weren't happy with Apple's quarterly report: The company's performance in one crucial region looks worrisome.\n\nThat region is China. Apple's sales in the country declined by 13% year over year to $20.8 billion -- that's roughly 17.4% of Apple's first-quarter 2024 revenue. Apple blamed lower sales of the iPhone and several other devices for the decline. However, this shouldn't be a long-lasting problem for Apple. Smartphone sales fell in China for much of last year partly due to economic issues.\n\nApple likely wasn't the only company affected. Moreover, Apple remains the top-selling smartphone brand in the country and elsewhere. CEO Tim Cook recently noted, \"According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the U.K., and all top five models in Australia.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two more reasons to look at Apple's first-quarter results with more optimism, especially concerning its performance in China.\n\nFirst, this period included 13 weeks compared to the 14 weeks from the previous fiscal year's parallel quarter. Second, currency exchange-rate fluctuations negatively impacted Apple's sales growth metrics in China.\n\nAt any rate, the economic slowdown in China won't last forever. More importantly, Apple has plenty of growth opportunities to exploit over the long run.\n\nPlenty of growth opportunities ahead\n\nApple's iPhone category remains the largest by revenue. In Q1 2024, the company's iPhone sales increased by about 6% to $69.7 billion. No other segment of the company did better in terms of revenue growth except Apple's services unit. Services sales grew by 11.3% year over year to $23.1 billion. While it still accounts for around 19% of Apple's revenue, the services segment might be the most important for the company's future.\n\nApple boasts an installed base of 2.2 billion devices and exceedingly high customer loyalty, which grants it the opportunity to create increasing, high-margin, recurring revenue from the suite of services it offers, from health-related apps to video and music streaming and more.\n\nThere's one key opportunity Apple is currently trying to get in on: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nCook was a bit tight-lipped on the matter during the company's latest earnings conference call, only saying: \"As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\"\n\nApple is unquestionably trailing some of its peers in the potentially highly lucrative AI market. Microsoft and Alphabet are way ahead.\n\nStill, it'd be unwise to bet against Apple here. After all, it has made it a business -- and a highly successful one at that -- to put its own tweak on existing technologies. Apple generates enough money to pour into research and development (R&D) and make headway into this space.\n\nApple has $106.9 billion in free cash flow. But whether within AI, healthcare, fintech, or some other area, the company has multiple growth paths that should enable it to remain successful for a long time.\n\nSo, Apple's recent issues in China are by no means a deal breaker. If anything, long-term investors should take this opportunity to scoop up the company's shares while it lags most of its Magnificent Seven peers year to date.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple's Scrapped Car Project Means AI and Headset Bets Are More Urgent",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- In abandoning plans for a self-driving car, Apple Inc. is giving up on billions in potential revenue and the dream of selling what one executive called “the ultimate mobile device.” The hope is that other big bets — including generative AI and mixed-reality headsets — can make up the difference.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nApple to Wind Down Electric Car Effort After Decadelong Odyssey How Much Wealth You Need to Join the Richest 1% Around the World Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Nvidia’s $70 Million Florida Supercomputer Hobbled by DeSantis Law\n\nApple reached this crossroads Tuesday, when it told employees it was winding down the car project and reassigned some of the staff to its AI efforts. The decision followed months of frenzied meetings between top executives and the company’s board over how to proceed. Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and project head Kevin Lynch broke the news to the roughly 2,000-member team during a meeting that lasted less than 15 minutes.\n\nThe upshot: Apple’s future isn’t going to hinge on selling $100,000 cars with self-driving features. Instead, it will focus on catching up with rivals in the generative AI industry, where chatbots from OpenAI and Google have captured the imagination of consumers and investors. The shift also lets Apple concentrate on turning the Vision Pro headset — still a fledgling product — into a mainstream hit.\n\nInvestors and analysts applauded the move, which lets Apple avoid an electric-vehicle market that’s grown more perilous in recent months. Shifting resources toward generative AI is the right call “given the long-term profitability potential of AI revenue streams versus cars,” Bloomberg Intelligence analysts Anurag Rana and Andrew Girard said.\n\nBut the decision also eliminates a future revenue source at a time when Apple has been struggling to maintain growth. Though the company managed to pull out of a sales slump last quarter, it warned that the current period will be sluggish again. The Vision Pro just launched this month and isn’t expected to be a major contributor to growth for years, if ever.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a car, profit margins would have been slim but the revenue potential was massive. The idea was long touted as one of Apple’s famous “next big things” and could have more firmly locked consumers into the company’s ecosystem. Tesla Inc., which led the EV revolution in the US, generated nearly $100 billion in revenue last year. Furthermore, tech giants like Alphabet Inc. and Chinese rivals remain focused on cars.\n\nApple’s decadelong car effort, known as Project Titan, also was an AI challenge in itself. Apple attempted to build an artificial intelligence system that was powerful and energy-efficient enough to make a car fully autonomous.\n\nWith that off the table, Apple can concentrate on applying AI to its current products, including the iPhone and iPad, and avoid falling further behind tech peers like Alphabet’s Google, Amazon.com Inc. and Microsoft Corp.\n\nApple is planning to reveal new AI capabilities, including more automated tools for software development and features for summarizing news articles, at its conference for developers in June. The first new features are planned for iOS 18, which will be released around September alongside the next iPhones, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nRead More: Apple Readies AI Tool to Rival Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot\n\nThose efforts now have fresh recruits, thanks to the winding down of the car endeavor — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG. The company will relocate about a third of the vehicle team to other divisions.\n\nMeanwhile, hundreds of people working on autonomous driving hardware, car interiors and exteriors, and vehicle electronics will need to seek new jobs inside the company. If they can’t find roles, they’ll be laid off. And some employees have already been informed that they’ll be heading for the exits.\n\nThree main groups within SPG — a software team based in Ottawa under executive Dan Dodge; a cloud engineering and software group under Libo Meyers; and a software project management team under Vera Carr — will be shifted to Craig Federighi’s software department to work on Apple’s main operating systems.\n\nApple’s artificial intelligence team for the car, which had been reporting to Stuart Bowers, will be shifted to work on generative AI in John Giannandrea’s machine learning division. Some of the car talent could also apply their skills to the Vision Pro. That product has many features, including the ability to create a virtual representation of its wearer, that rely on artificial intelligence.\n\nThe big question is how soon AI might make serious money for Apple. It’s unlikely that the company will have a full-scale AI lineup of applications and features for a few years. And Apple’s penchant for user privacy could make it challenging to compete aggressively in the market.\n\nFor now, Apple will continue to make most of its money from hardware. The iPhone alone accounts for about half its revenue. So AI’s biggest potential in the near term will be its ability to sell iPhones, iPads and other devices.\n\nAs for the Vision Pro, which melds virtual and augmented reality, that too is years away from being a major moneymaker. The immersive technology has thrilled some early adopters, but the first version of the device remains too cumbersome and costly. Even if it sells a few million units a year, the $3,500 headset will only be a small percentage of Apple’s nearly $400 billion annual revenue total.\n\nThe company is exploring other big ideas, including lighter-weight AR glasses, new smart-home devices and AirPods with cameras.

Such “last rites” meetings are often one of the last steps before a lawsuit is filed.\n\nAntitrust enforcers, who have been probing the company since 2019, allege that Apple has imposed software and hardware limitations on its iPhones and iPads to impede rivals from effectively competing. The suit is expected in the coming weeks, likely by the end of March, the people said.\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment. The Justice Department declined to comment.\n\nApple’s App Store, which charges developers a commission of either 15% or 30%, has come under heavy criticism by developers and lawmakers.\n\nIn January, Apple said it will allow US developers to use alternative payment systems, but charge a 27% fee for most digital purchases or 12% on subscriptions. Epic Games Inc., which sued the company over its App Store policies, is contesting the proposed changes, saying they are inadequate and would effectively prevent developers from reducing consumer prices.\n\nRead More: Apple Accused by Epic of Failing to Fix App Store as Court Asked\n\nThe Justice Department has also been monitoring Apple’s moves in Europe as it prepares to begin enforcing new digital gatekeeper rules on March 7.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo comply with those rules, Apple said it will allow customers to download software from outside its App Store, use alternative payment systems and more easily choose a new default web browser. Yet several developer groups have slammed Apple’s proposed changes as “malicious compliance” with the EU’s rules, criticizing the iPhone maker for introducing new fees for payment processing and a €0.50 per app installation fee for software downloaded more than 1 million times. While Apple said most developers in the EU would see their payments decrease or stay the same, developers say the new fee will force them to stay within the App Store or face prohibitive payments.\n\nApple is expected to face a fine of at least €500 million ($542 million) by EU’s antitrust watchdog as soon as next week related to allegations it silenced music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology SA, on its platforms.

The company's Annual Recurring Revenue (ARR) also saw a 15% rise, reaching $588.6 million.

These cash flow metrics are crucial for Jamf's ability to invest in growth initiatives and navigate economic uncertainties.\n\n\"We achieved significant margin improvement on both on a GAAP and non-GAAP basis in 2023 as a result of revenue outperformance and diligent cost management,\" said Ian Goodkind, Jamf CFO. \"As we look to the next three years, well ramp up our efforts to increase profitability to align our cost structure with the current revenue growth profile of Jamf, with the goal of exceeding the Rule of 40 in 2026.\"\n\nJamf's balance sheet remains solid, with cash and cash equivalents totaling $243.6 million as of December 31, 2023. The company's commitment to strategic investments and cost management is expected to drive further financial improvements and shareholder value.\n\nLooking Ahead\n\nAs Jamf looks forward to the fiscal year 2024, it anticipates total revenue to be between $614.5 and $619.5 million, with non-GAAP operating income projected to be between $89.0 and $93.0 million. These forward-looking statements reflect the company's confidence in its business model and the continued demand for its solutions.\n\nJamf's emphasis on security and innovation is evident in its recent business highlights, including a 33% year-over-year growth in security ARR and the launch of support for Apple Vision Pro. The company's participation in the Microsoft Security Copilot Partner Private Preview and the release of its annual Security 360: Annual Trends Report further demonstrate its commitment to staying at the forefront of enterprise security.\n\nValue investors and potential GuruFocus.com members interested in the software industry and cloud-based SaaS solutions will find Jamf Holding Corp (NASDAQ:JAMF)'s financial results and strategic direction indicative of a company poised for continued growth and profitability.

        "content": "Despite markets continuing at record highs, Charles Schwab (NYSE:SCHW) Investment Management still identifies investment opportunities within long-term stocks. According to its recent filings, the respected investment house perceives potential upside in interesting companies, increasing holdings.\n\nThe top 5 Charles Schwab stocks include Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stakes. These are the long-term stocks to which Charles Schwab allocates the most capital. Evidently, the prominent investment house remains highly confident in its substantial bet on Microsoft, having also purchased in the filing period. If one of the largest investment firms accumulates the long-term stock MSFT, it appears to be a sound investment for the long haul.\n\nBut beyond high-profile names, what additional long-term stocks may offer opportunities within the latest moves of Charles Schwab?​\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs one of the largest holdings for many Charles Schwab investment portfolios focused on long-term stocks, Microsoft saw its shares increase substantially over the last year. The software giant experienced impressive growth of around 70% in its stock price during 2023. However, this level of growth has been common for Microsoft over the long term, with its shares increasing almost ten-fold in value in the past decade alone.\n\nCharles Schwab analysts believe that Microsoft can continue expanding its business and market share for many years. Even though some commentators worry about a tech bubble given high valuations across the sector, Schwab’s ongoing increases in its holdings of Microsoft shares show faith that the company remains well-positioned as a long-term stock pick.\n\nWith a current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 37x and an average price target of $456 per share, Charles Schwab continues to see upside potential in holding Microsoft as a core long-term stock within its client investment portfolios.\n\nStory continues\n\nMerck (MRK) Merck (MRK) logo outside of corporate building\n\nSource: Atmosphere1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nMerck (NYSE:MRK), one of the long-term stocks featured in recent Charles Schwab stock picks, has witnessed its P/E ratio expand considerably. From late 2023 through to the present, its valuation increased substantially from 19.4 to 71.\n\nThe company relies heavily on its cancer treatment drug Keytruda, which recently received expanded approval for use within the European Union. Analysts consider the now long-term stock to have further growth potential moving forward and also view Merck as well positioned to withstand a potential economic downturn due to the nature of its operations.\n\nAccording to its most recent quarterly disclosures, the Charles Schwab stock has received a sizable investment, totaling over half a billion U.S. dollars.​​\n\nVeralto Holdings (VLTO) Stocks to buy: smartphone with the words \"buy\" and \"sell\" displayed on the screen.

The company provides water treatment and water quality solutions and posted relatively modest Q4 results last month.\n\nThe company saw sales increase by 3% over the last year and forecast similar growth for the coming year. Analysts also see modest similar growth in the company’s share price this year. Overall, it seems the interest in the long-term stock is based on expectations that it will deliver solid, albeit modest, growth in the coming years as water scarcity becomes a top concern when exacerbated by climate change.\n\nThe company trades at a P/E ratio of 25.5x, slightly below the benchmarkS&P 500 index’s 27.6x times.​\n\nDisclaimer:\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple boss Tim Cook has plenty of challenges in his inbox - Richard Drew/AP\n\nApple has cancelled its plans to build an electric car after reports that it was struggling to create a self-driving vehicle.\n\nThe company told the 2,000 staff working on the project on Tuesday that it is axing the ambitious project, according to Bloomberg.\n\nIt is reportedly planning to move many of those employed to work on artificial intelligence projects, a priority for the electronics giant. It is understood that there will also be redundancies.\n\nApple had been working on the car - codenamed Project Titan - since 2014. It aimed to deliver breakthrough battery technology that would radically cut their cost, according to insiders, and create car software that would mean the car would genuinely drive itself.\n\nIn January, it was revealed that Apple was delaying the release of the car from 2026 to 2028 and had cut the ambitions for its self-driving capabilities, so that it would offer a capability similar to Tesla’s Autopilot technology.\n\nThis would mean the car would perform some manoeuvres on its own, such as braking, lane changing, parking or driving on a motorway, but with the driver remaining in control. Artist's impression of how Apple's electric car might have looked - Vanarama\n\nThe cancellation of the project comes amid escalating competition between electric carmakers, with China’s BYD overtaking Elon Musk’s Tesla as the world’s best-selling electric vehicle manufacturer.\n\nThe Chinese firm’s rise - fuelled by low prices - has alarmed Western carmakers, with the boss of Renault, Luca de Meo, urging Europe and Britain to jointly pursue an industrial policy to encourage “European champions”.\n\nAnalysts had queried the logic of Apple entering the car industry. “It makes no sense whatsoever for Apple to sell a car,” technology analyst Richard Windsor said last year. “Apple makes 40-50pc gross margins on the products it sells, and it will not make that on seats and steering wheels.”\n\nApple’s decision to axe the project takes place as investors show signs of nervousness about the company’s growth potential. Its shares are down over 4pc during the past month with the company facing battles on multiple fronts.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts sales in China plunged 13pc in the final quarter of 2023, with its share of phones priced above $600 (£470) falling from 75pc to 71pc. Huawei, in particular, is eating into Apple’s sales in the country, after launching its Mate 60 Pro phone, which has proved a hit.\n\nApple has also suffered the distraction of court battles over its smart watches, while some customers of its high-cost Vision Pro headsets, its first major product launch since the Apple Watch in 2015, have returned them complaining that the gadgets are making them feel sick. Apple has issued advice on how to minimise motion sickness.\n\nApple was approached for comment.",

AAPL hit a Dec. 14, record high of $199.62, and thanks to a historically bullish trendline may soon notch a fresh peak.\n\nApple stock is within one standard deviation of its 260-day moving average.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) — Apple Inc. is canceling a decade-long effort to build an electric car, according to people with knowledge of the matter, abandoning one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the company.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers Apple Cancels Work on Electric Car, Ending Decadelong Effort Nigeria Delivers Jumbo Rate Hike to Aid Its Battered Naira BYD’s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini\n\nApple made the disclosure internally Tuesday, surprising the nearly 2,000 employees working on the project, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the announcement wasn’t public. The decision was shared by Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams and Kevin Lynch, a vice president in charge of the effort, according to the people.\n\nThe two executives told staffers that the project will begin winding down and that many employees on the car team — known as the Special Projects Group, or SPG — will be shifted to the artificial intelligence division under executive John Giannandrea. Those employees will focus on generative AI projects, an increasingly key priority for the company.\n\nThe Apple car team also has several hundred hardware engineers and car designers. It’s possible they will be able to apply for jobs on other Apple teams. There will be layoffs, but it’s unclear how many.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, declined to comment.\n\nThe move came as a relief to some investors, who pared declines in the stock on Tuesday. The shares gained about 0.5% to $182.01 at 2:18 p.m. in New York after Bloomberg reported the news.\n\nElon Musk, head of Tesla Inc., also celebrated the move. He sent a post on X with a saluting emoji.\n\nThe decision to ultimately wind down the project is a bombshell for the company, ending a multibillion-dollar effort that would have vaulted Apple into a whole new industry. The tech giant started working on a car around 2014, setting its sights on a fully autonomous electric vehicle with a limousine-like interior and voice-guided navigation.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the project struggled nearly from the start, with Apple changing the team’s leadership and strategy several times. Lynch and Williams took over the undertaking a few years ago — following the departure of Doug Field, now a senior executive at Ford Motor Co.\n\nApple’s most senior executives finalized the decision in recent weeks, according to the people. It comes just a month after Bloomberg News reported that the project reached a make-or-break point. The most recent approach discussed internally was delaying a car release until 2028 and reducing self-driving specifications from Level 4 to Level 2+ technology.\n\nMost recently, Apple had imagined the car being priced at around $100,000. But executives were concerned about the vehicle being able to provide the profit margins that Apple typically enjoys on its products. The company’s board was also concerned about continuing to spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year on a project that may never see the light of day.\n\nApple continues to invest heavily in other areas. The company spent $113 billion on total research and development over the past five years, with an average annual growth rate of about 16%. The company also recently launched the Vision Pro headset — its first new product category in almost a decade — and has built up that business.\n\n(Updates with shares in the sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple is set to be handed an EU antitrust fine of about 500 million euros ($543 million) next week in a music streaming case triggered by a Spotify complaint, sources said.\n\nThe European Commission last year charged the iPhone maker with preventing Spotify and other music streaming firms from informing users of options outside Apple's App Store.\n\nApple declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe European Union's competition watchdog said such \"anti-steering obligations\" constitute unfair trading conditions, a relatively novel argument in an antitrust case and one which has also been used Meta Platforms in a separate case.\n\nThe sources said that Apple was set to be fined on March 5, although the final timing and the amount of the fine could change depending on EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager.\n\nThe EU will also order Apple to stop such practices, something it will have to do anyway under new EU tech rules called the Digital Markets Act (DMA) which six tech companies including Apple will have to comply with from March 7.\n\nWhile fining Apple is designed as a deterrent, it pales compared with billion euro fines for Google in its three EU antitrust cases over the past decade.\n\nSeparately, the Commission is also looking into Apple's decision to remove home screen web apps for users in the EU, which the company said is to abide by the DMA.\n\n\"We're in particular looking into the issue of Progressive Web Apps, and can confirm sending the requests for information to Apple and to app developers, who can provide useful information for our assessment,\" a Commission spokesperson said.\n\nThe spokesperson said the scrutiny is part of its assessment of the six companies' compliance with their DMA requirements.\n\nHome screen web apps, which can be launched as a standalone app on a device, allow developers to sell subscriptions through their websites, bypassing Apple's App Store and its 30% fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has said EU users will be able to continue accessing websites directly from their home screen through a bookmark with minimal impact to their functionality and that removing home screen web apps affect only a small number of users in the EU.\n\nBreaches of the DMA can result in fines up to 10% of a company's global turnover.\n\n($1 = 0.9215 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith)",

        "title": "Sonos’ Highly Anticipated Move Into Headphones Hits Software Snag",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Sonos Inc.’s ambitious foray into the headphone market has hit a software snag, delaying production of the device and its release date, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Office Tower Deal for $1 Reveals Anxiety Among Longtime Buyers BYD’s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini Nigeria Delivers Jumbo Rate Hike to Aid Its Battered Naira\n\nThe setback — tied to how the wireless over-ear headphones connect to Wi-Fi networks — means the company now expects to begin selling the product in the first half of June, a month later than previously hoped, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private.\n\nThe company has been building prototypes at Luxshare Precision Industry Co. in China and will mass-produce the headphones there. But a key stage called production validation testing, or PVT, was halted due to the bug. The PVT step normally occurs two weeks before mass production.\n\nSonos is working to resolve the problem and still expects the headphones to be a blockbuster new product. It aims to produce between 650,000 and 1 million units over the next year to fulfill demand, the people said.\n\nThe company is looking to price the headphones at $449, competing with others at the top of the market. But the release timing is still fluid and could shift again depending on how the snag is resolved.\n\nRead More: Sonos Readies $400-Plus Headphones to Rival Apple and Bose\n\nChief Executive Officer Patrick Spence is betting that the headphones can help reignite growth at the company, which is best known for its sound bars and speakers. Sonos’ sales have stagnated in recent years, and his comeback plan involves getting into a number of new categories. But it means going up against big rivals, including Apple Inc., Sony Group Corp. and Bose Corp.\n\nInvestors have grown more optimistic. The shares are up 11% this year following a flat performance in 2023 and a 43% plunge the prior year. On Tuesday, the stock briefly went negative after Bloomberg reported on the headphone delay. The shares rebounded to a gain of almost 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company, which has been working on headphones since at least 2019, plans to sell the device in black and white options — similar to the color choices on its current products. The headphones are designed to work with existing Sonos devices, including smart speakers, and stream audio directly from TVs and various music services.\n\nThe Santa Barbara, California-based company is eyeing other new categories as well. That includes a previously unreported large speaker for use at parties, according to the people. It would compete with the PartyBox from JBL, a popular speaker maker and subsidiary of Samsung Electronics Co.’s Harman, and launch in 2026.\n\nThe Sonos headphones, codenamed Duke, will be the biggest test yet for Spence, who took the helm in 2017. He hasn’t officially announced the plans but has touted the imminent arrival of a new device.\n\n“We now turn our undivided attention to the launch of our highly anticipated new product, which we will announce and ship in Q3,” Spence said during an earnings call this month. The company’s fiscal third quarter runs through June.\n\n“This launch will give us a foothold into a new multibillion-dollar category, expanding the number of categories we play in from five to six and further diversifying our business,” he said.\n\nSonos is planning to eventually offer the headphones in all its major markets and will add new retail partners to help sell the device. The company is also discussing a second-generation model internally and exploring the idea of an in-ear model — codenamed Disco — aimed at Apple’s AirPods. The latter may also connect to Wi-Fi for streaming. Most headphones typically only use Bluetooth.\n\nRead More: Sonos Plans to Cut Jobs as It Prepares Push Into Headphones\n\nThe headphones have taken a circuitous route to market. People with knowledge of their development say Sonos originally planned to release headphones codenamed Trident in mid-2021, but Spence shelved the project at the beginning of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020.\n\nTo get ready for the headphone launch, Sonos is planning a revamped mobile app codenamed Passport. That will allow users to more easily set up and control Sonos products outside of the home. But the new app has faced software-engineering challenges as well and probably won’t launch until May. It was originally planned for March. Sonos wants to release it at least a few weeks before the headphones debut.\n\nSonos is also working on a television set-top box, new TV sound bars, an upgraded portable speaker and fresh amplifiers, Bloomberg has reported. But the set-top box — a rival to Apple TV and Roku Inc. devices — has hit some delays as well, with the company now expecting a launch around August 2025 instead of as early as this year.\n\n(Updates with latest on shares in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations Hong Kong’s Hottest New Store Is the Costco in Shenzhen Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theWarren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 12 Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top 5 Stock Picks.\n\nWarren Buffett recently penned his anticipated annual letter to Berkshire shareholders. The key themes of Buffett's letter were similar to what they are every year, and understandably so. Buffett does not believe in changing his investing strategies based on short-term market movements. Buffett said Berkshire's goal remains owning entire or parts of businesses which \"enjoy good economics that are fundamental and enduring.\"\n\nBuffett on Lack of Good Investing Opportunities\n\nWhat caught the market's attention was Buffett's revelation that Berkshire's cash pile has soared to about $167.6 billion as of the end of 2023. But what was alarming in this figure was the reason why Buffett, who is always a fan of letting the money do the work, is not deploying this cash. Buffett said that there remain \"only a handful\" of companies that impress Berkshire in the US and outside the country there are \"essentially no candidates\" for capital deployment opportunities for Berkshire.\n\nBuffett said to think that investors have gotten wiser over time would be a mistake. The billionaire said the constant availability of financial news and trading platforms have only made the investors \"active\" because of the \"casino-like\" behavior of the markets.\n\n\"Market Seizures\": An Opportunity for Warren Buffett\n\nIn his latest letter, Warren Buffett talked about how he likes to view \"market seizures\" as investing opportunities:\n\n\"Occasionally, markets and/or the economy will cause stocks and bonds of some large and fundamentally good businesses to be strikingly mispriced. Indeed, markets can – and will – unpredictably seize up or even vanish as they did for four months in 1914 and for a few days in 2001. If you believe that American investors are now more stable than in the past, think back to September 2008. Speed of communication and the wonders of technology facilitate instant worldwide paralysis, and we have come a long way since smoke signals. Such instant panics won’t happen often – but they will happen. Berkshire’s ability to immediately respond to market seizures with both huge sums and certainty of performance may offer us an occasional large-scale opportunity. Though the stock market is massively larger than it was in our early years, today’s active participants are neither more emotionally stable nor better taught than when I was in school. For whatever reasons, markets now exhibit far more casino-like behavior than they did when I was young. The casino now resides in many homes and daily tempts the occupants.\"\n\nStory continues Warren Buffett 2024 Portfolio: Top Stock Picks\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Warren Buffett's Q4'2023 portfolio and chose his top 12 stock picks. These were the stocks Buffett had in his portfolio heading into 2024.  Some top picks of Berkshire are Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Coca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) and Chevron Corp (NYSE:CVX). Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n12. Kroger Co (NYSE:KR)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $2,285,500,000\n\nWarren Buffett continues to hold Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) in his portfolio for 2024. Berkshire Hathaway had a $2.3 billion stake in the grocery company as of the end of 2023. BofA recently set a $65 price target on Kroger Co (NYSE:KR) stock, which shows a strong upside potential from the current levels of around $47.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 45 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Kroger Co (NYSE:KR).\n\nIn its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter, Oakmark Global Fund stated the following regarding The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR):\n\n“The Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) (U.S.) is the second-largest grocery retailer in America, behind only Walmart. Although the grocery industry is highly competitive, Kroger’s scale advantages allow it to offer a more compelling value proposition than smaller peers and earn higher returns on capital. In recent years, the market has assigned Kroger a lower multiple due to concerns that e-commerce would disrupt traditional brick-and-mortar grocery businesses. However, we believe Kroger’s performance through the pandemic highlighted that its store footprint, distribution infrastructure, technology investments and strong brand all position the company well for a world with higher online grocery adoption. The stock trades for just 10x our estimate of next year’s EPS, which we believe is attractive given Kroger’s competitive positioning and earnings growth outlook. The pending merger with Albertsons could accelerate the company’s earnings growth and produce additional scale advantages. If the merger is not approved, the company will have the capacity to return over 25% of its market cap to shareholders.”\n\n11. VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $2,639,503,654\n\nDNS registry and internet infrastructure company VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN) ranks 11th in our list of the best Warren Buffett stocks for 2024. Berkshire owns a $2.6 billion stake in VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN) as of the end of 2023. The stock is down by about 3.8% over the past one year.\n\nIn February, VeriSign, Inc (NASDAQ:VRSN) posted Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $2.60, beating estimates by $0.74. Revenue in the period jumped 3% year over year to $380.4 million, surpassing estimates by $2.53 million.\n\n10. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $2,841,792,358\n\nWarren Buffett's 2024 portfolio includes Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C), in which the billionaire's Berkshire Hathaway owns a $2.84 billion stake. BofA recently published a list of \"Magnificent 80\" stocks which are expected to deliver more in dividends than cash over the next three years. Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C) was part of the list. According to BofA estimates Citi has a three-year annualized dividend yield of 4.8%\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023,  87 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Citigroup Inc (NYSE:C).\n\nPatient Capital Management stated the following regarding Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Citigroup Inc. (NYSE:C), run by Jane Fraser since 2021, is on a multi-year journey to reorganize the business and reach return on tangible common equity of 11-12% by 2025-2026 (and higher further out). Citigroup is finally taking the hard actions necessary, cutting unprofitable departments, taking out middle management layers, and reducing overall headcount. We have high confidence Citi will hit its targets.”\n\n9. Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $3,781,371,913\n\nKidney dialysis services company Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA) ranks ninth in our list of Warren Buffett stocks for 2024. Berkshire owns a $3.78 billion stake in Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.  Earlier this month Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.87, beating estimates by $0.21. Revenue in the quarter jumped 7.9% year over year to $3.15 billion, beating estimates by $140 million.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of last year, 39 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Davita Inc (NYSE:DVA).\n\n8. Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $9,635,028,496\n\nWarren Buffett's 2024 portfolio features Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO), whose shares are up by about 29% over the past one year. Moody's Corp's (NYSE:MCO) recently increased its dividend by 10.4% and said its board of directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases.\n\nA total of 56 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Moody's Corp (NYSE:MCO) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nL1 Capital International Fund made the following comment about Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Portfolio adjustments during the September 2023 quarter were modest, diversified, but meaningful. In total around 10% of the Fund was divested and reinvested into opportunities we consider provide a superior risk-adjusted base case return.\n\nWe continued to trim our investment in high-quality technology businesses such as Intuit, mentioned previously. These adjustments were purely for valuation considerations, rather than any business concerns and some of these companies remain significant portfolio holdings.\n\nThe Fund’s remaining investment in Moody’s Corporation (NYSE:MCO)’s was fully divested during the September quarter. Moody’s is the world’s leading credit rating, risk assessment and analytics business. The core credit ratings business is largely a duopoly with S&P Global, with modest competition from Fitch Ratings and regional competitors – a great example of our preferred ‘Noah’s Ark’ industry structure.\n\nThe share price of Moody’s has been volatile over recent times, often reacting too greatly to changes in short-term capital markets conditions. During the quarter we took advantage of positive market sentiment to divest our holding at a share price we considered to be above fair value. Moody’s is very well managed and ‘ticks all our boxes’ for one of the world’s highest-quality businesses. The company has moved from our Portfolio to our Bench of potential investments. Having a Bench of ‘ready to go’ investment opportunities is a core aspect of our investment process. We continue to analyse Moody’s as if we owned it and are excited by the pull-back in the share price from recent highs.”\n\n7. Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $12,041,975,570\n\nKraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) is one of the most important stocks in Warren Buffett's 2024 portfolio. Berkshire has been holding the stock since 2015 and over the past nine years the fund hardly made any changes to its stake in the consumer company. As of the end of the last quarter of 2023 Berkshire had a $12 billion stake in Kraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC).\n\nKraft Heinz Co (NASDAQ:KHC) recently posed Q4 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $0.78, surpassing estimates by $0.01. Revenue totaled $6.9 billion, missing estimates by $80 million.\n\n6. Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY)\n\nWarren Buffett's Stake: $14,552,270,657\n\nWarren Buffett owns a $15 billion stake in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) as of the end of 2023. Berkshire kept boosting its stake in the energy giant last year. Berkshire bought a whopping 10 million shares of Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) worth $588 million during a single week in December 2023.\n\nReuters recently reported that Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY) was exploring a sale of Western Midstream Partners, its natural gas-focused pipeline operator.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 66 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Occidental Petroleum Corp (NYSE:OXY).

        "title": "Warren Buffett Just Revealed the 8 Stocks That Berkshire Hathaway Will Likely Hold Forever -- and Apple Wasn't One of Them",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is known as a buy-and-hold investor. He even once stated, \"When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.\"\n\nHowever, Buffett doesn't hold forever every stock he buys. There's a good bit of churn in Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) portfolio. But the legendary investor has identified a handful of Berkshire's holdings that he believes are forever stocks. Buffett just revealed the eight stocks that he thinks Berkshire Hathaway will likely hold forever -- and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) wasn't one of them.\n\nTwo long-term Berkshire holdings\n\nIn his letter written to Berkshire Hathaway shareholders last year, Buffett discussed two long-term holdings -- American Express(NYSE: AXP) and The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO). He noted that Berkshire completed building big positions in both stocks in the mid-1990s after several years of buying.\n\nAmerican Express and Coca-Cola have been massive winners for Buffett and Berkshire. In his letter written last year, he used them to make an important point: \"The weeds wither away in significance as the flowers bloom. Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.\"\n\nBuffett mentioned AmEx and Coca-Cola again in his most recent letter to Berkshire shareholders, which was released on Saturday. He emphasized the lesson from these two purchases: \"When you find a truly wonderful business, stick with it.\"\n\nAnother stock Buffett really likes\n\nIn his latest shareholder letter, Buffett added other stocks that he said Berkshire \"expect[s] to maintain indefinitely.\" The first new addition to the list was Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY).\n\nBerkshire has been buying Occidental shares hand over fist. At the end of 2023, the conglomerate's stake in the company stood at 27.8%. It's now the sixth-largest position in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nBuffett stressed that Berkshire doesn't have any intention of fully acquiring Occidental or gaining control of the oil and gas producer. However, he said that \"we very much like our ownership,\" along with the option to increase its position.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are two things about Occidental that Buffett especially likes. First, the company has extensive oil and gas operations in the U.S. Second, Occidental is a leader in carbon capture.\n\nAlthough Buffett acknowledged that the technology is still unproven, he argued that it, along with Occidental's large oil and gas holdings, \"are very much in our country's interest.\"\n\nFive birds of a feather\n\nBuffett discussed the other five stocks that he believes Berkshire will hold practically forever as a group, rather than individually. They're the five huge Japanese trading houses:\n\nItochu(OTC: ITOCF)(OTC: ITOCY) Marubeni(OTC: MARUY) Mitsui(OTC: MITSF)(OTC: MITSY) Mitsubishi(OTC: MSBHF) Sumitomo(OTC: SSUM.F)(OTC: SSUM.Y)\n\nBerkshire currently owns stakes of roughly 9% in each of these Japanese companies. Buffett noted that the conglomerate has committed that it wouldn't increase its ownership in any of them beyond 9.9%.\n\nWhat does Buffett like about these five companies? For one thing, he mentioned that each of them \"operates in a highly diversified manner somewhat similar to the way Berkshire itself is run.\" He likes the Japanese companies' policies that are beneficial to shareholders, including smart stock buybacks. Buffett also stated that the investments could open the door for Berkshire to partner with the companies down the road.\n\nWhat about Apple?\n\nApple remains Berkshire's largest holding, by far. Buffett didn't list the tech giant in his list of stocks that Berkshire would hold forever. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Berkshire even trimmed its position in Apple.\n\nDoes this mean that Buffett doesn't view Apple as a forever kind of stock? I don't think so.\n\nFor one thing, it's important to remember that Buffett only focuses on a small number of specific Berkshire holdings in each shareholder letter.

        "title": "Apple and Tesla Veterans Aim to Help Japan Design AI Chips",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Japan government-backed research group developing semiconductors will partner with US startup Tenstorrent Inc. on the design of its first advanced AI chip.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBYD’s New $233,450 EV Supercar to Rival Ferrari, Lamborghini A Spike in Heart Disease Deaths Since Covid Is Puzzling Scientists Freddie Mercury’s London Residence Lists at £30 Million Jacob Rothschild, Financier and Philanthropist, Dies at 87 Stock Rally Stalls at Start of Data-Packed Week: Markets Wrap\n\nTenstorrent, led by Tesla Inc. and Apple Inc. veteran Jim Keller, will license its design for part of Japan’s artificial intelligence accelerator and also co-design the overall chip, the US company said at a joint event in Tokyo on Tuesday. Working with the open-source RISC-V standard, Tenstorrent aims to provide customers with an alternative to the leaders Nvidia Corp. and Arm Holdings Plc, who have their own so-called instruction sets to communicate between hardware and software.\n\nThe Japanese government is funding a range of projects from research to advanced chip manufacturing, making an ambitious $67 billion bid to reclaim a central role in the semiconductor industry. The Tenstorrent agreement has the potential to advance those efforts, with the goal of producing the jointly designed AI chips at the government-backed startup Rapidus Corp.\n\n“Concerns around AI using up all the electricity in the world make technology to decrease power consumption important,” said Rapidus Chief Executive Officer Atsuyoshi Koike at the event alongside Tenstorrent CEO Keller. “With Tenstorrent, we hope to launch AI accelerators at the fastest time-to-market rate.”\n\nThe 18-month-old company is aiming to begin chip production in 2027 in competition with leaders Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. and Samsung Electronics Co. But Rapidus will need customers for its facility and Keller’s team sees Japan working to ensure both supply and demand.\n\n“What Japan is doing is they recognize that you can’t just build a fab and hope,” David Bennett, chief customer officer of Tenstorrent, said in an interview. “So they’re taking large investments to make sure that they’re filling this fab. So what you see today is really the first one.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBennett said that Tenstorrent has “line of sight to hundreds of millions of dollars of business in Japan” and is working closely with the Japanese government and corporations. His firm presently has 400 employees across the US, Canada, Serbia, India, South Korea and Japan. Tenstorrent is also in close contact with the US government to ensure it’s in full compliance with Washington’s technology export controls.\n\nBeside Keller, Tenstorrent has Keith Witek, who spent 13 years at Advanced Micro Devices Inc., as its chief operating officer and Wei-han Lien as its chief chip architect. Lien led Apple’s work on advancing its in-house chip design, which has grown from powering the iPhone to also running its iPads and even desktop Mac computers.\n\nIn Japan, the company will work on AI chip designs with the government research group, known as Leading-edge Semiconductor Technology Center or LSTC.\n\nStill, production in Japan may be a challenge. Rapidus’ goal of manufacturing state-of-the-art, 2-nanometer logic chips by 2027 is considered something of a long shot.\n\nJapan’s LSTC will pursue and promote AI tech dedicated to “edge inference processing applications, including generative AI, through international collaboration,” its chairman, Tetsuro Higashi, said in the announcement. The country has managed to attract many of its semiconductor experts who’d gone to work overseas back, Bennett said, as it works to bolster its expertise.\n\nRead More: Japan Earmarks $300 Million to Fire Up Chip Research at Home\n\n--With assistance from Takashi Mochizuki.\n\n(Updates with quotes from executives)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk’s Vegas Tunnel Project Has Been Racking Up Safety Violations The High Cost of Eating Out in America Transcript: Did Musk Buy Twitter to Keep His Movements Secret?

        "title": "3 ETFs with Big Nvidia Positions: SMH, IYW, SPMO",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is taking the market by storm, and it’s not just the stock that is benefiting. Three ETFs with big positions in Nvidia, the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH), the iShares U.S. Technology ETF (NYSEARCA:IYW), and the Invesco S&P Momentum ETF (NYSEARCA:SPMO) are reaping the rewards of Nvidia’s historic run and look poised to capture more upside if shares continues to rise.\n\nTo find these ETFs featuring significant Nvidia exposure, I went to Nvidia’s page on TipRanks and used the ETF Exposure tab on the side of the page, a useful tool that enables investors to sort through ETFs by a stock’s percentage weight within the ETF.\n\nLet’s take a more in-depth look at these three ETFs, which all have different strategies and different reasons for owning Nvidia. All have large positions in the surging stock, which is up 235.5% over the past year and closing in on a $2 trillion market cap.\n\n1. VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH)\n\nSMH is a $16 billion ETF from VanEck that, according to the fund, seeks to give investors “exposure to the top 25 most liquid U.S.-listed semiconductor companies, spanning the entire industry value chain from chip design and fabrication to manufacturing machinery.”\n\nSMH has a massive Nvidia position. In fact it makes up over one-quarter of this semiconductor-focused fund’s assets, with a weighting of 25.7%.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of SMH’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nIn addition to Nvidia, SMH owns Nvidia’s competitors like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), and it also owns companies that are vital to the semiconductor manufacturing process like foundry Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) and semiconductor equipment manufacturers Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT), Lam Research (NASDAQ:LRCX), and ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML).\n\nSMH’s top holdings are viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score system, as eight out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis ETF has crushed the market in recent years, thanks in no small part to its outsized position in Nvidia. As of January 31, SMH has returned an impressive 18.8% over the past three years, a phenomenal 32.1% over the past five years, and an incredible 26.1% over the past 10 years, easily beating the broader market S&P 500 (SPX) and tech-oriented Nasdaq (NDX) indices over each time frame.\n\nOf note, SMH has an expense ratio of 0.35%, meaning that an investor in the fund will pay $35 in fees on a $10,000 investment annually.\n\nI’m bullish on SMH, given its large position in Nvidia, its track record of market-beating performance, and its portfolio of highly-rated stocks (according to Smart Score ratings). For investors looking to gain exposure to Nvidia in ETF form, SMH is a great way to do so due to its massive 25.7% Nvidia position and the fact that it gives you exposure to additional stocks that are swimming in the same lane as Nvidia.\n\nIs SMH Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSell-side analysts view SMH favorably, giving it a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SMH stock price target of $223.22 implies 6.1% upside potential from current levels.\n\n2. iShares U.S. Technology ETF (IYW)\n\nMeanwhile, the iShares U.S. Technology ETF owns Nvidia as part of its strategy to “track the investment results of an index composed of U.S. equities in the technology sector.” IYW invests in U.S.-based electronics companies, computer hardware and software companies, and IT companies.\n\nNvidia makes up 6.8% of IYW’s assets under management. This is a relatively large position, but it pales in comparison to SMH’s massive 25.7% position. Altogether, IYW owns 135 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 63.9% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of IYW’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ Holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, IYW has a broader focus than SMH, so while it has top-10 positions in semiconductor stocks like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), it also owns stocks from beyond the semiconductor space like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nLike SMH, IYW’s portfolio is viewed favorably by TipRanks’ Smart Score, and even more so, an impressive nine out of SMH’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above.\n\nWhile this ETF’s focus is different than SMH’s, one thing that the two funds have in common is that they’ve both generated excellent returns over time. As of January 31, IYW has put up annualized returns of 14.2% over the past three years, 24.5% over the past five years, and 20.2% over the past 10 years.\n\nIYW has an expense ratio of 0.40%, meaning that investors in the fund will pay $40 in fees annually on a $10,000 investment.\n\nI’m bullish on IYW overall, given its strong track record of performance and its highly-rated portfolio of top tech stocks, although it should be noted that SMH gives investors considerably more exposure to Nvidia.\n\nIs IYW Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, analysts assign IYW a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 106 Buys, 27 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average IYW stock price target of $145.91 implies 10.2% upside potential from current levels.\n\n3. Invesco S&P 500 Momentum ETF (SPMO)\n\nLastly, the Invesco S&P 500 ETF is another large Nvidia holder with an entirely different approach. SPMO is “based on the S&P 500 Momentum Index,” which “tracks the performance of stocks in the S&P 500 Index that have a high ‘momentum score.’” The fund and index are reconstituted and rebalanced twice a year, and components of the index are weighted by their market caps and their momentum scores.\n\nNvidia makes up 11.4% of SPMO’s holdings, which is less than SMH’s exposure but more than IYW’s. In total, SPMO owns 100 stocks, and its top 10 holdings make up 56.1% of the fund.\n\nBelow is an overview of SPMO’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nSPMO isn’t specifically focused on semiconductor or technology stocks like SMH or IYW, but some of these stocks, like Nvidia and Broadcom, appear in SPMO’s top holdings, as these stocks have been leading the market higher. Beyond semiconductors, Meta Platforms is SPMO’s largest holding, and the fund also owns plenty of names from outside of the tech sector that are performing well, like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), General Electric (NYSE:GE), and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nAn impressive nine out of SPMO’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 9 or higher. Like SMH and IYW, SPMO has also generated good returns over time, although it doesn’t have a track record as long as that of the other two funds, as it only launched in 2015. Still, as of January 31, SPMO had posted a solid three-year annualized return of 10.9% and an even better five-year annualized return of 15.1%.\n\nSPMO is reasonably priced, with an expense ratio of just 0.13%, making it the cheapest of the three funds profiled here. An investor in SPMO will pay just $13 annually in fees on a $10,000 investment. I’m bullish on SPMO based on its decent performance, highly-rated portfolio, and substantial Nvidia position.\n\nIs SPMO Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAnalysts view the fund favorably, as SPMO earns a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 87 Buys, 12 Holds, and two Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average SPMO stock price target of $81.45 implies 6.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nNo Shortage of Ways to Invest in Nvidia\n\nAll three of these ETFs are good options for investors, as they have strong portfolios and have generated solid returns over time. Any of the three is a worthy investment, but my pick of the three is SMH, as it offers by far the highest exposure to Nvidia, plus the best performance track record.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "The 3 Most Popular Stocks Owned by Congress in Q1",
        "content": "Sometimes, the best trading advice can come from a list of stocks owned by Congress. If they’re buying, you may want to look into it. Politicians seem to have an uncanny, remarkable track record of success.\n\nFor example, on Nov. 22, Rep. Nancy Pelosi bought 50 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) 20 Dec 2024 $120 call options even as the underlying stock traded at a high of $503.31. Today, NVDA stock trades around $784. Had you followed her into NVDA, you stood to make a good deal of money.\n\nGranted, not all of her trades worked out so well, but the exception proves the rule.  So if you find that a top official is buying something, you may want to do your due diligence and consider following them in. The only downfall to this strategy is that elected officials don’t have to disclose their transactions for 30 to 45 days under the STOCK Act. These three companies are some of the most popular stocks owned by Congress.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSimon Property Group (SPG) building facade of simon property group (SPG)\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top stocks owned by Congress is Simon Property Group (NYSE:SPG), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that yields 5.2%.\n\nOn Feb. 2, Rep. Victoria Spartz bought 91,000 shares for around $138 — just as it was bottoming out around the time earnings were coming out. The trade was then disclosed on Feb. 16, as SPG traded at $146. A week later it was up to $151. So, even if you and I bought on the disclosure, we would still have walked away with a few dollars.\n\nAt the time, it was a good bet on potential interest rate cuts and the company’s announcement of a $2 billion stock buyback. However, with no interest rate cuts to be seen, and the buyback news priced in, I’d wait for SPG stock to put in a healthy pullback before even considering buying Simon Property Group here.\n\nWith earnings, the REIT is seeing improvements. In its fourth quarter, Simon saw funds from operations (FFO) of $3.69, which beat by 36 cents. Revenue of $1.53 billion was up about 9% year over year, and beat estimates by $160 million. Guidance was a bit underwhelming, though. For the full-year 2024, it now expects its FFO to come in between $11.85 and $12.10 per share, which is lower than expectations for a range of $12.20 to $12.51 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nApollo Medical Holdings (AMEH) Image of a hospital with workers walking in the halls\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWe learned that Rep. Judy Chu bought just over $350,000 worth of Apollo Medical (NASDAQ:AMEH), as noted by CapitolTrades.com. The stock was purchased on Jan. 10 at $37.66. When the transaction was disclosed on Jan. 22, it traded at $37.65. Today, it closed at $42.79. If you bought on the disclosure, you could have made a nice little profit.\n\nAt its current price though, I’d wait for it to pull back. Right now, it’s overbought on various technical analysis indicators like relative strength, moving averages, and momentum. However, over the long term, it could be attractive. According to Bank of America – which upgraded it to a buy rating – there’s “an inflection point in the growth story, with a high confidence path to sustaining 30-40%+ revenue and 20%+ EBITDA growth through at least 2026,” as quoted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nThe firm also points to a few key headwinds for AMEH, including organic contract wins, tuck-in mergers and acquisitions and a reduction in its corporate tax rate. Of special note is the end of Medicaid redeterminations, which is Apollo Medical’s largest customer segment.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) Explore the stock market trends for 2024 with analytical visuals of businessman planning long term investments and future business growth, Navigate towards success with smart strategies. growth stocks with millionaire potential\n\nSource: Thapana_Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother top trade was the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG). We can see that on Nov. 3, Rep. Hal Rogers bought shares just under $270. That was then disclosed on Dec. 20. Then, on Jan. 19, Rep. Blake Moore bought shares at $319.98. He then disclosed that five days later on Jan. 24. Since then, the VUG ETF ran to $338.84.\n\nWhile it’s also a bit overbought at the moment, it could eventually see higher highs. Vanguard Growth has an expense ratio of just 0.04%.

        "content": "Samsung's (005930.KS) showcased its latest wearable smart tech, the Galaxy Ring, at the 2024 Mobile World Congress in Barcelona, Spain. Yahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley joins the Live show to discuss the smart ring's health tracking features\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: The potential brand new wearable from Samsung it's the Galaxy Ring which I guess is a competitor to the Oura Ring. What do we know about it?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah. This is a new space for tech companies, these smart rings. And as you said, Oura is the chief company out there with one. At the moment, Samsung will be rolling out their Galaxy Ring in the future. They were showing it off as part of the mobile world Congress event in Barcelona. This is basically a health tracking gadget that it acts as a ring.\n\nIt can track you for multiple days. They haven't said exactly how long it will last. But the benefit of something like this is it's not as bulky or as attention grabbing as a watch. But it does provide you with the ability to track your health, your sleep habits, your heart rate, things along those lines. And it's on you for the whole day. I mean, it doesn't have to be charged too often. The Oura Ring can go several days without a charge. Can track all of this kind of information.\n\nSo this seems to be a way that more companies are going to be going. And oh, yeah, apparently according to Mark Gurman at Bloomberg, Apple is investigating whether it wants to invest in a ring of its own. So it'll be interesting to see how the market responds to these. I actually saw an Oura Ring in the wild on the subway a few days ago. First time I saw one, but still it proves that people are out there buying them.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: That's an interesting. You mentioned Gurman with that-- the idea here, Dan, that maybe Apple could get into it as well. Now Apple doesn't hint at its product pipeline, maybe some other tech companies do. But what do you say? If you were to bet, you think that could be coming?\n\nStory continues\n\nDAN HOWLEY: It could be. Honestly, I mean, it feels as though it's something that they would explore. Apple explores all sorts of products and then just says, nah, we're not going to do it. The Apple Watch is the best selling smartwatch in the world. If they start to see maybe a divergence in the wearables category where people are starting to pick up steam. When it comes to purchasing these smart rings, then I would see Apple jumping in to the arena.\n\nBut right now it seems as though it's still a relatively niche market. And when it came to the Apple Watch itself, Fitbit already had a foothold in it. People had known about the technology. So it only made sense for them to get in on that action. It's done very well for them. The ring, it's still very hard to say whether or not Apple would do it. But like I said, they are looking into it according to this report. And it just doesn't necessarily mean they're going to put a product on the market.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: All right, Dan. Thank you very much. Appreciate it. It's interesting these companies wanting to get into wearables which hasn't been a huge as Dan alluded to. It's been a niche market. It hasn't been a huge market. And you look at some of the wrist wearables like a whoop strap, for example, which I feel like there have been different trends in going up and down in these things being popular.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And the other tough part is you move into health, which you can understand why so many tech companies want to do because that's an enormous market and an aging demographic. And it checks all the right boxes. But as you move into health, you often can run into patent trouble. You start designing. We've of course seen-- Apple has run into that exact issue, with Masimo. So the more you run into-- the more you want health, it just seems to be a place where you can find legal trouble and regulatory trouble very quickly as well.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Right. So we'll see if that becomes an issue with any of that.",

        "title": "7 High-Upside Tech Stocks to Buy That Also Pay Dividends",
        "content": "Generally speaking, investors buy tech stocks for their exposure to growth and not dividends. When the tech sector gets hot, it grows very quickly producing rapid returns. 2023 was a prime example of that broad truth. Investors will continue to buy tech stocks primarily for that exposure.\n\nYet, text stocks also provide the stability of dividend income in some cases. Most tech firms direct cash toward growth prospects primarily. More established firms also choose to direct the sum of their cash back to investors in the form of dividends and share buybacks.\n\nThose are the firms we will be discussing below. These firms tend to pay lower yields but there are also cases in which yields exceed 3% or more. Let’s take a look at these tech firms and their dividends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia logo seen on smartphone which is placed on pile of US dollar bills. Concept. Selective focus. Stocks to buy like Nvidia\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who do their homework on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will discover that it actually pays a dividend. In fact, the company instituted its dividend program all the way back in 2013. Nvidia has never reduced its dividend payment during that time.\n\nWhile its yield is very low at 0.02%, it is clearly very reliable overall. To be clear, Nvidia is not highly focused on its dividend program as an enticement to investors: the dividend has only grown by 2% on average over the past five years.\n\nIn any case, investors are interested in Nvidia for its growth prospects. The small dividend is something of a novelty but provides a slight amount of income nonetheless. Investors will buy NVDA shares at the moment primarily because it continues to shine. Its fourth quarter earnings beat was yet another strong signal from the world’s leading chip maker. Buy Nvidia because it has the potential to move as high as $1,300 but also consider that dividend which will continue to grow over time.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nCisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) Is one of the better known tech dividend stocks. The internet networking firm pays a dividend yielding more than 3% and which has not been reduced for more than a dozen years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat dividend looks to add an additional $1.60 to each share of CSCO stock in 2024. Consider that in light of the fact that analysts believe share prices could rise above $76 this year. That would put the total return at $78. Cisco Systems shares currently trade for approximately $49. There is legitimate potential for investors and that dividend yield is critical.\n\nEven if those share prices don’t rise that high, the consensus is that they will rise above $57. In that case, the $1.60 in dividends becomes even more attractive.\n\nOne of the primary reasons Wall Street is bullish on Cisco Systems is the simple fact that IP protocol demand should continue to rise in light of the continued emergence of AI. By the shares for their exposure to that potential growth and rest easy knowing that they provide income.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is no doubt that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock is a high upside investment. Despite its meteoric growth over the past year there is likely more ahead. In fact, analysts believe it could rise as high as $600 this year. That would represent roughly 50% growth above its current price.\n\nThat potential is pushed marginally higher by Microsoft’s dividend which yields 0.75%. Microsoft pays $3 in annual dividends. In total, MSFT shares could rise as high as $603. The other thing to note is that Microsoft’s dividend is rock solid. The company has never reduced the dividend for the entirety of its existence. That’s probably not much of a surprise to readers: Microsoft is a cash rich firm that instituted the dividend as a bonus in reality. The likelihood that Microsoft reduces the payout is effectively zero.\n\nThe argument in favor of investing in Microsoft as a dividend stock is largely the same as that for the other tech giants with dividends: buy them for the growth potential and consider the dividend as a nice to have novelty.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) provides semiconductor products to firms around the world. Its stock is highly regarded and widely expected to grow from its current price of $103. The consensus opinion is that those shares will rise in value to $115 and potentially move as high as $140.\n\nThe company’s dividend adds an additional $2.72 to its potential returns. Should Skyworks Solutions shares reach the consensus price of $115, that equates to a difference between 11.65% returns and 14.3%. Investors can easily understand the value of a higher yield dividend such as that which Skyworks Solutions provides. The 2.63% yield may not sound particularly impressive but the figures show that it makes a large difference overall.\n\nThe company last reduced that dividend in 2014. However, the semi-annual dividend has been in existence since 1980. Higher yield dividends require more cash and are thus more likely to be reduced in leaner times. That doesn’t seem to be the case at the moment and Skyworks Solutions continues to be an excellent choice among tech dividend stocks.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is another of the leading tech firms that also pays a dividend. In fact, among the best known Silicon Valley firms, only Google (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) lacks a dividend entirely.\n\nUntil recently, Meta Platforms was similar to Google and did not pay any dividend. That changed on February 1st when the company reported 4th quarter earnings and initiated its first ever dividend of 50 cents.\n\nThe decision coincided with the company’s 20th anniversary. It also followed after the company beat 4th quarter expectations on Wall Street. Advertising revenues have rebounded as the unexpectedly strong economy continues to hum along.\n\nWhile the move was welcomed by Wall Street, it is also curious given the fact that META needs all the cash it can get at the moment. The company is trying to satisfy the dual beasts of AI growth and its continued losses in its metaverse segment. Again, it is welcome none-the-less and makes META shares currently among dividend paying tech firms worth investing in.\n\nAAPL (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nWould you believe that AAPL (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been paying a dividend since 1987? It has, but there was a long pause during that period in which it paid no dividends at all. The company paused its dividend payment between late 1995 and the summer of 2012. That was the last time that the company reduced its dividend payment which currently yields 0.5%.\n\nThe decision heralded the beginning of a new era as Apple transitioned from the leadership of Steve Jobs into that of Tim Cook. The rationale for the reintroduction of the dividend was that it would attract liquidity in the form of institutional investment thus increasing share prices. The history of Apple’s share growth over the past decade makes it difficult to argue against the decision. AAPL shares have returned more than 27% on average annually over the past decade. That was enough to 11x an investment made at the beginning of that period.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast but certainly not least on this list of dividend tech stocks is Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM). The company provides investors with $3.20 annually in dividends per share owned. That equates to a yield of more than 2% which is relatively high in the tech world. The general thinking is that that cash would be better served pursuing growth prospects and thus yields of say 5%, for example, are exceedingly rare.\n\nIt’s fair to characterize Qualcomm’s dividend as being stable and relatively quickly growing. It was last reduced in 2003 and has grown at an annual rate of 5.3% over the last five years.\n\nWhile those points of attraction are logical reasons to buy Qualcomm, there are others to consider. Qualcomm is well diversified and exposed to current growth trends. It is one of the better positioned tech firms in relation to the confluence of AI and phones. The company has released updated AI features on its flagship phones. Investors remain very curious to see how the application of advanced AI to phones will drive revenues.  Smartphone revenues have been extraordinarily high as the world remains glued to their handsets. Qualcomm is a major provider to Apple which is a major catalyst to consider overall.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investors learned an important lesson in 2023: investing in the biggest companies and their stocks is a surefire way to capture strong gains. The Magnificent 7 – all of which are trillion dollar stocks – produced strong returns for investors.\n\nTherefore, it’s easy to see why investors continue to look for the next trillion dollar companies to buy now.  These companies promise to provide similar returns for investors. The names discussed below populate the ranks between the 8th and 18th most valuable firms.\n\nIf you have reached the trillion dollar threshold in the past but have since fallen back below that level. The others are in a strong position to pass that level in the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s take a look at these juggernaut companies in order to understand why investors should buy now.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nWall Street continues to ask whether Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock has the ability to reach  a valuation of $1 trillion. Morgan Stanley is among the firms that  remain bullish in answering that question.\n\nAnalysts there recently raised their target price from $805 to $945. Should LLY shares reach $945 that still would put its valuation short of $1 trillion. Prices would have to reach just above $1,050 in order for Eli Lilly to become the first pharmaceutical stock valued at that level.\n\nThe obvious question then becomes why should investors believe that will be the case? The obvious answer is that Eli Lilly is at the forefront of a new era of drug making.\n\nThere is a huge market for FDA approved weight loss therapeutics. Eli Lilly has a winner in Zepbound. It received FDA approval for weight loss in November. Demand for the drug –  which shares the same active ingredient as Mounjaro –  is sky high. Mounjaro did more than $5 billion in sales in 2023 with an FDA indication for treating diabetes. Patients were demanding the drug for its ability to induce weight loss so when the FDA approved Zepbound for that indication Eli Lilly’s prospects brightened further. Sales reached $176 million in the fourth quarter, its first with FDA approval. analysts believe sales will be particularly strong given that Zepbound is indicated to reduce heart disease risks as well. That should make it easier for the drug to receive insurance approval.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.B) is already a juggernaut by most standards. The stock is associated with Warren Buffett, arguably the most famous investor ever. Yet, at the same time, it has not reached the level of the Magnificent 7, all of which are valued at more than $1 trillion.\n\nHowever, when investors take a look at its history it is very clear to see that it is on a trajectory to pass that level in the future.\n\nWarren Buffett’s firm is well known for its strategy of investing in Blue Chip American companies.  The core of the company’s portfolio still consists of plays such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) primarily. Yet, a shift has emerged. The company is now investing more heavily in growth plays and lesser known names. That means it is increasingly invested in companies like Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) that poise the company for more growth.\n\nThe company is also highly invested in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) which makes up more than 50% of its overall holdings.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on stock market. Tesla financial success and profit.\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s fair to assert that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has the best chance among the stocks listed in this article of reaching $1 trillion first. The company has been a trillion dollar firm in the past but current troubles plaguing the EV industry have slashed its valuation well below that level at present.\n\nAnalysts have pinpointed the reason for the decline to earnings projections. Wall Street continues to lower its earnings expectations for Tesla throughout 2024. The percentage by which their estimates have fallen correlates highly to the percentage by which Tesla’s shares have fallen over that time frame.\n\nWhile it’s difficult to argue with the numbers and the logic, I think there is something even simpler at play: Tesla doesn’t necessarily need Wall Street to come out and say that it has suddenly become positive about earnings for the shares to rebound.\n\nInstead, the company simply needs Elon Musk to show signs of his dedication to Tesla above all else. Should he do that and focus less on AI robots or X that might be just the spark that shares need.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA big part of the reason to believe in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) stock is its bullish expectations for the year. The company is already on record announcing that it expects 2024 to be a big year for growth, and a big reason to believe in that growth is the continued growth of Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThe leading AI chip firm again bested expectations with its 4th quarter earnings report. Both earnings and revenue figures were well above levels that Wall Street had been expecting. Yet, as promising as that sounds, it raises a question: can Nvidia continue to keep up with demand for its high priced processors that are strongly preferred for all things artificial intelligence?\n\nIf the answer is yes, then Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing has even further to grow in 2024. Nvidia relies on TSMC for chip production and packaging. So, it is an integral part of Nvidia’s ability to quiet critics who believe that it may not be able to keep up with demand in 2024. Bullish investors should ignore the noise and buy TSM stock as a direct indication of their confidence in both the firm and Nvidia.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock has doubled in the past 12 months. That puts it more than halfway on the path to a $1 trillion valuation. It clearly has a way to go before it can legitimately be considered a real threat to reach that level.\n\nWhile it will take time for Broadcom to realistically reach a $1 trillion valuation, it is worth investing in at the moment. For one, the company recently became more deeply entwined in the artificial intelligence race. CEO Hock Tan was recently added to the board of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe move deepens the already strong relationship between Meta and Broadcom. Meta is attempting to distance itself from Nvidia as a supplier and strengthen its collaborative efforts with firms like Broadcom in order to reduce costs. That should increase Broadcom’s sales from Meta in the future. Meta spent $500 million on service revenues with Broadcom last year.\n\nSo, while Broadcom has a long road ahead to reach $1 trillion, its relationship with Meta promises to speed up that trajectory.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nNovo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is the other pharmaceutical industry firm contending for its place as the first trillion dollar drug maker stock. It is very similar to Eli Lilly in both that regard and its drug portfolio.\n\nBoth firms have now FDA approved weight loss drugs that first received FDA approval as diabetes drugs. Novo Nordisk’s weight loss drug is branded under the trade name Wegovy. The weight loss drug is given as an injection but the company also plans to sell it in pill form.\n\nThat should spike sales as the option of an orally taken pill is much more palatable than an injection. However, this is both a problem and an opportunity for Novo Nordisk. The company needs to increase manufacturing in order to meet the potential demand. The oral version of the drug requires more of the active ingredient than does the injectable form. Novo Nordisk will need to address its ability to manufacture the active ingredient at greater volumes in order to take advantage of the huge opportunity before it.\n\nThe company has agreed to pay $11 billion for three factories in connection with its acquisition of Catalent. That news alone should give bulls all the confidence they need that Novo Nordisk can meet manufacturing demand for its drug.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who believe the oft repeated refrain that the rich are getting richer should consider buying LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) stock. In fact, it’s very easy to find sources to substantiate that opinion. This article and this one both suggest that the rich are indeed getting richer.\n\nAs people get richer they tend to buy greater volumes of the luxury goods that LVMH sells. The company, which is the largest luxury group globally, reported sales of 86.2 billion euros in 2023. That represented growth of 13% top line for the company and was a record year for the firm.\n\nLVMH is currently valued at approximately $450 billion. It has a long road ahead of to reach $1 trillion. Regardless, the company also has an incredibly diverse portfolio of luxury products and brands overall. Whether it’s jewelry, fashion, watches, expensive alcohol, or upscale retail shops, LVMH owns assets in those areas. That broad exposure to the world’s top luxury brands gives the company a scale that will allow it to continue to grow and head toward $1 trillion in valuation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Steve Jobs Wanted Apple Employees To 'Bond' By Wearing A Uniform So He Had A Vest Designed For Them —  'Oh Man, Did I Get Booed Off The Stage. Everybody Hated The Idea'",
        "content": "The late Steve Jobs, the visionary co-founder and former CEO of Apple Inc., not only transformed technology but also became an icon himself, partly because of his signature look — a black turtleneck, Levi’s 501 jeans and New Balance sneakers. His distinctive style has its origins in a story that intertwines Jobs’s admiration for Japanese design and his relationship with fashion designer Issey Miyake.\n\nJobs’s visit to Sony Group Corp. in the 1980s sparked the idea of creating a uniform for Apple employees. In Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs, this moment is captured with a detailed account of how Jobs was inspired by the uniformity and sense of belonging among Sony’s workers, leading him to pursue a similar vision for Apple.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCopy and paste Mark Cuban’s startup investment strategyaccording to his colorful portfolio. This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\n\n“He looked very ashamed and told me that after the war, no one had any clothes, and companies like Sony had to give their workers something to wear each day,” Jobs said of then Sony Chairman Akio Morita.\n\nAccording to the biography, the Sony uniform was a taupe nylon jacket, distinguished by its innovative and functional design, which features a standout characteristic: The sleeves can be detached from the shoulders with a zipper, transforming the garment into a sleek vest.\n\nMotivated by this concept, Jobs reached out to Miyake, hoping to instill a similar sense of identity at Apple.\n\n“I decided that I wanted that type of bonding for Apple,\" Jobs said. \"So I called Issey and asked him to design a vest for Apple. I came back with some samples and told everyone it would be great if we would all wear these vests. Oh man, did I get booed off the stage. Everybody hated the idea.\"\n\nTrending: Average retirement income in America has been revealed – Will you make enough each month?\n\nAlthough the idea of an Apple uniform was not embraced by employees, it opened a new chapter in Jobs’s style and his friendship with Miyake. Despite the initial rejection, Jobs found a personal uniform that suited him, saying, “So I asked Issey to make me some of his black turtlenecks that I liked, and he made me like a hundred of them.”\n\nStory continues\n\nJobs’ choice of a personal uniform was more than a fashion statement; it was a reflection of his approach to work and life. The simplicity and consistency of his attire mirrored his philosophy of focusing on what truly mattered. By eliminating the daily decision of what to wear, Jobs could concentrate more on his work and the innovative endeavors at Apple.\n\nWhen Jobs died in 2011, he left behind a world transformed by his vision. His influence continues to resonate, not just in the products Apple creates but in the way people think about technology and its role in their lives. Jobs’s story — a blend of innovation, personal branding and unconventional thinking — is a lasting inspiration for future generations. His distinct personal uniform was a visual reminder of his commitment to challenging the status quo and making a mark on the world.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.

        "title": "Major League Soccer: Apple deal 'set the bar at a different level'",
        "content": "Watching an NFL season these days means viewers must subscribe to various streaming services in addition to a pricey cable package. That's not the case with professional US soccer.\n\nMajor League Soccer (MLS) said its desire to avoid what has become a fragmented viewing landscape for sports fans is what led it to sign an exclusive 10-year, $2.5 billion agreement with Apple (AAPL) in 2022.\n\n\"We think that the deal we did set the bar at a different level for people to think about how you do a partnership with a media company,\" Seth Bacon, executive vice president of media for MLS, told Yahoo Finance in an interview. \"We're completely ingrained in Apple ecosystem with everything that we do. It's a true partnership.\"\n\nSo far the partnership appears to be paying off as sign-ups surge and viewership numbers skyrocket.\n\nApple senior vice president of services Eddy Cue said at a conference in November that each of the biggest MLS games last season attracted more than a million viewers on the service, noting \"no one expected that.\"\n\nThere's additional upside for Apple too. Matthew Ball, author of the bestselling book \"The Metaverse\" and former head of strategy at Amazon Studios, said in a new Stratechery podcast interview that Apple's MLS deal will likely amplify sales of the tech giant's new Vision Pro headset.\n\n\"There’s a pretty good chance that in a few weeks or at least a year when [Lionel] Messi takes a free kick, I’m going to get to be able to wander onto the field and stand right beside him at the box and watch or take the keeper’s position,\" he predicted. \"And that I think is going to be remarkable and probably push this device in a way that we could never have imagined a year ago.\"\n\nApple's MLS deal 'completely different' Major League Soccer's Lionel Messi of Inter Miami CF stands with teammates during the Leagues Cup 2023 Round of 16 match between Inter Miami CF and FC Dallas at Toyota Stadium on Aug. 6, 2023, in Frisco, Texas. (Logan Riely/Getty Images) (Logan Riely via Getty Images)\n\n\"When we started the process of reviewing our media rights at the end of 2017, we started to look down the road a little bit,\" Bacon said. \"We started to see that the world was going to look very different [and] that streaming was going to play a big part in it.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThe league strategically consolidated all of its media rights about three years before the negotiation window for the rights opened. The goal? Create \"one big package\" to offer potential domestic partners.\n\nBacon explained the league, which kicked off its 2024 season last week, wanted to offer something \"completely different\" in the way games were distributed. That captured Apple's attention as it allowed the tech giant to control how it presented and delivered the game.\n\nAdditionally, the exclusive nature of the decades-long deal provided Apple the flexibility to fully invest in new concepts in order to deliver a more consistent fan experience.\n\nAs for MLS, the league knew Apple had the global distribution capabilities and would be able to amplify the brand on a much larger scale. Inter Miami's Lionel Messi controls the ball during the friendly soccer match between Vissel Kobe and Inter Miami CF at the National Stadium, Wednesday, Feb. 7, 2024, in Tokyo, Japan. (Eugene Hoshiko/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nOf course, it didn't hurt that Apple and MLS received a big boost from Argentine soccer legend Messi, who signed a historic MLS deal with Inter Miami in June.\n\nMessi's deal instantly led to a surge in ticket sales, sports apparel, and, most importantly, sign-ups to Apple's streaming package MLS Season Pass.\n\nSubscribers to the package \"over-delivered on expectations\" and have more than doubled since July, according to the league. Spanish language viewership has also surged, surpassing over 50% for Messi matches.\n\nAnalytics platform Antenna revealed that 110,000 users signed up for MLS Season Pass on the day of Messi's debut, representing a 280% increase from the number of sign-ups generated on the first day of the 2023 season. To note, Apple does not disclose subscriber figures.\n\nThe MLS partnership extends beyond just the live event games.\n\nEarlier this year, MLS and Apple announced an all-access docuseries, produced in partnership with Box to Box Films, the filmmakers behind Netflix's \"Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\"\n\nBacon said the docuseries is just the beginning given Apple's exposure to not only original content production but also music, podcasts, news, and fitness. The tech giant also just debuted a sports app that will provide users with real-time scores, betting lines, stats, and more.\n\n\"In the long haul, Apple is the place that we're pushing people,\" Bacon concluded. \"There's a huge amount of incentive for us and for our fans to lean into Apple and help grow the sport.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 14 best S&P 500 dividend stocks to invest in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis of dividend stocks in the S&P 500 and their performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024.\n\nIn 2023, despite the presence of higher interest rates, consumers remained unfazed, and investors displayed more optimism than apprehension, largely fueled by the excitement surrounding advancements in artificial intelligence (AI). Consequently, the S&P 500 experienced a remarkable surge, gaining over 24% last year. This surge was primarily attributed to the dominance of what has been dubbed the \"Magnificent Seven.\" These seven major companies, which include Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), played a pivotal role in driving the S&P 500's performance, contributing significantly to its overall returns. On the flip side, a staggering 72% of stocks failed to match the performance of the S&P 500 index, setting a new record for underperformance. Additionally, dividend-paying stocks experienced a downturn in 2023, paving the way for the dominance of technology equities. Despite this, the stock market returns throughout the year were both exceptional and notably robust in comparison to historical trends.\n\nDespite their recent lackluster performance, dividends remain a crucial aspect of returns for equity investors and have garnered considerable attention in capital markets research. The appeal of dividend-paying stocks is substantial, and rightfully so as they have the potential to significantly enhance long-term investment outcomes. This general observation has been well-documented across various periods and global markets. For instance, one study analyzed the components contributing to total equity returns of U.S. stocks spanning from 1802 to 2002. It revealed that dividends, along with real growth in dividends, constituted a substantial portion, accounting for 5.8% of the total annualized return of 7.9% over 200 years. Another study, conducted from a global perspective by researchers at the London Business School, examined data from 1900 to 2005 across 17 countries. It found that the real return averaged around 5%, with an average dividend yield of 4.5% during that timeframe. These findings provide compelling evidence for the significance of dividends for long-term investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet another report from S&P Dow Jones Indices provided insight into the enduring impact of dividend-paying equities over the long term. This report emphasized that since 1926, dividends have played a significant role, contributing roughly 32% of the total return for the S&P 500, with capital appreciations making up the remaining 68%. Hence, both sustainable dividend income and the potential for capital appreciation are key considerations for forming expectations regarding total returns. Furthermore, the growth of dividends proves to be beneficial for investors. Over an extended period, the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats, which monitors the performance of companies with 25 or more consecutive years of dividend growth, has surpassed the S&P 500 index while exhibiting lower volatility, indicating higher risk-adjusted returns. The S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats' ability to mitigate losses can be observed through its upside and downside capture ratios. According to a report by S&P Dow Jones Indices, it has outperformed the S&P 500 in down months 69.34% of the time and in up months 43.61% of the time from December 29, 1989, to July 31, 2023. Additionally, it's worth noting that the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats experienced lower drawdown levels compared to the benchmark index.\n\nConsidering these points, let's explore some of the top S&P 500 dividend-paying stocks. 14 Best S&P 500 Dividend Stocks To Invest In 2024\n\nImage by Sergei Tokmakov Terms.Law from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nTo create this list, we first examined the S&P 500 stocks based on their weight in the index and picked the top 25 stocks that consistently distribute dividends to their shareholders.

        "title": "After Epic Games' $700 Million Google Antitrust Lawsuit Win, CEO Tim Sweeney Has His Sights Set On Apple's Decision To Ban Web Apps",
        "content": "Nobody is likely a more outspoken dissenter against the ongoing stronghold Apple Inc. and Google have on the mobile apps store than Epic Games Inc. Founder and CEO Tim Sweeney.\n\nGoogle's Play Store and Apple's App Store collectively have a 90% market share. Going up against Apple and Google is no easy feat — they are two of the biggest companies on the planet with armies of top lawyers around the world. Funding such a suit would bankrupt many companies, but Sweeney isn't deterred, taking on both of them in recent lawsuits.\n\nThe popular maker of Fortnite makes billions from skin sales and in-game items. With tens of millions of mobile players, it's easy to see how the 30% fee the app stores charge would add up over time. A successful lawsuit that lowered fees or costs would end up saving Epic billions over the long term.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nNew in startups – Fortnite’s creator company greenlights partial ownership for up to 100 accredited investors in the upcoming series. Did you know StartEngine Private is your portal to investing in venture-backed businesses without spending millions?\n\nNeither Apple nor Google allow users to skirt their app stores. For example, code driving someone to a website to purchase Fortnite's in-game currency V-Bucks, rather than in an app, breaks the terms of service and will, as happened to Fortnite, result in removal from the store. When Fortnite was removed, Epic filed an antitrust lawsuit and lost. But in a nearly identical case, it defeated Google, which resulted in a $700 million fine against the company.\n\nNow, Sweeney is back taking another swing at Apple after the company's recent decision to scrap web apps entirely in the EU. The EU passed the Digital Markets Act (DMA), which Apple is using as an excuse to snub home screen web apps. Users will no longer be able to download apps on their iPhones in the EU unless they are on the Apple App Store. They will be able to open links to websites from their home screens, just not stand-alone apps. This is yet another blow to anyone trying to avoid the 30% fees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSweeney and other critics argue Apple’s latest policy update, which effectively stifles the functionality of web apps by imposing stringent limitations, will undermine the open nature of the web and restrict consumer choice.\n\nTrending: This startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?\n\nThe policy change comes at a time when the European Union is pushing for greater digital openness through initiatives like the DMA. Critics, including Sweeney, argue that Apple’s move is not only antithetical to the spirit of the DMA but also represents a significant step back for digital innovation and accessibility in Europe.\n\nLegal experts and industry watchers predict this latest conflict could lead to increased regulatory scrutiny of Apple’s practices in Europe and potentially beyond. The European Commission has already shown a willingness to tackle what it sees as anti-competitive behavior by tech giants, and Sweeney’s fight against Apple could catalyze further action.\n\nSweeney recently went to X to speak about Apple's continued anti-competitive practices, posting, \"Apple needs to completely reset its relationships with regulators and developers on the foundation of enlightened, lawful business practices as Microsoft did after the DOJ [Department of Justice] case. They can't go on like this, not as a self-respecting company that's honest with itself and the world.\"\n\nAs this saga unfolds, the tech world watches closely, recognizing that the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how digital markets operate, how developers create and distribute apps and how consumers access digital content. Sweeney’s crusade against Apple’s monopoly is more than a corporate skirmish; it’s a battle for the soul of the digital age.\n\nRead Next:\n\nHarvard-founded AI startup is solving paywalls, growing 5x yearly and looking for new shareholders.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "If you're looking for your next great all-around stock pick, you can't go wrong borrowing one or two ideas from Warren Buffett. At BerkshireHathaway, his investment portfolio regularly outperforms the broad market. Better still, his holdings are chosen for their long-term potential. More often than not, you can buy a stock owned by Berkshire and safely plan on staying in the position for years on end.\n\nTo this end, here's a rundown of three stocks Warren Buffett has steered Berkshire Hathaway into that would also be at home in most investors' portfolios.\n\nAmerican Express\n\nCredit card company Capital One is planning on acquiring rival Discover. If the merger is allowed to happen, it certainly seems to pose a threat to American Express(NYSE: AXP). But that potential threat may not be anywhere near as dire as it seems to be on the surface.\n\nWhile American Express is a credit card company, it's dramatically different than its credit card peers. It would be more accurate to describe its business model as the management of perks and rewards programs that just happen to revolve around charge cards.\n\nIndividuals and business alike will pay as much as $695 per year for the right to use an American Express card simply because cardholders receive credit toward air travel tickets, rebates on certain forms of at-home entertainment, spendable credits at a handful of retailers, bonus hotel-stay time, cash back on grocery purchases, and more. Other card companies offer perks, but none of those rival programs hold a candle to American Express'.\n\nThe company not only generates fee-based revenue each and every year, of course, but also collects interest payments as well as a small portion of each card-based transaction it facilitates. This is why the company has been such a reliable grower for years now despite plenty of competition.\n\nIt's also worth noting that American Express' clientele tends to be more affluent than average, which means its customers are less likely to become delinquent on their payments or outright default on their loans.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn this vein, while higher interest rates and a challenging economy are now leading lenders to report bigger write-downs, American Express' past-dues and write-offs are holding more or less level. Ironically, this stock could be a relative safe haven should the economy continue to weaken.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is holding nearly 152 million shares of American Express, by the way -- a position it's been sitting on since 2006. It's also Berkshire's third-biggest holding, if that tells you anything.\n\nApple\n\nAmerican Express may account for a significant chunk of the Berkshire Hathaway stock portfolio, but it's a distant third to the fund's single-biggest position. That honor belongs to Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). This $174 billion trade makes up half of Berkshire's holdings in publicly traded companies.\n\nThere's no denying the iPhone maker's very best days may be in the rearview mirror. Last quarter's top line was up a modest 2% year over year, bouncing back only a bit from the 3% revenue lull reported for the fiscal year ended in September. iPhone revenue remains relatively stagnant, and IDC reports that unit sales of iPhones have actually been declining for over a year now. Given that the popular smartphone makes up over half of Apple's business, this trend is more than a little concerning.\n\nThe company is pivoting, though. Take its services arm as an example. Sales of apps and digital content are now the organization's second-biggest business. And, while still miles behind the iPhone in terms of the total amount of operating profit it produces, Apple's operating profit margins on its services business are ridiculously high at 70% of its revenue. Indeed, this division now accounts for roughly one-third of the company's bottom line. As this services unit grows, it's going to make an oversized impact on Apple's overall net income.\n\nIt's not just the ongoing growth of its services business keeping Buffett and his acolytes on board with Apple. The company's finally venturing into other businesses lines that mesh well with its existing technologies. For instance, it's reinventing its voice-activated assistant Siri now that artificial intelligence is making such tools wildly useful. Its recently launched Vision Pro goggles represent the next step in the evolution of augmented reality as well, even if it's not yet perfectly clear how this tech can be best monetized.\n\nThe point is, Apple's got several different levers it can pull here even if the iPhone itself has peaked.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nLast but not least, add The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks you may want to consider buying for yourself.\n\nIt's not a complicated, sexy pick. But that's kind of the point. When you own a stake in Coca-Cola, you own a piece of a cash-generating juggernaut that's easy to defend. This cash is then turned into dividends, which have not only been paid like clockwork every quarter for decades, but have now been raised in each of the past 62 years. There are only a handful of companies out there that can make the same (or better) claim.\n\nThe secret to Coca-Cola's success? There are three of them actually, although they're not exactly secrets. The first of these is Coca-Cola's ability to build and maintain brands that consumers love and purchase without even thinking about it. More than mere marketing, Coca-Cola is part of a lifestyle, and even part of the global culture.\n\nThe second pillar of The Coca-Cola Company's consistent success is its business model. It's not quite what you may think it is. It's never actually bottled all of its products, and in recent years it's done very little of its own bottling. Rather, its core business is selling concentrated flavor syrups to bottlers that then take on the burden -- and the inconsistent costs -- of producing the products you find placed in stores.\n\nThis model is a much more consistent one than bottling itself, since the cost of creating and handling these syrups is minimal compared to the labor-intensive and input-intensive process of creating the final products that consumers buy.\n\nFinally, while you certainly know the company's namesake cola, The Coca-Cola Company is far more diversified than you might realize. In addition to familiar sodas like Sprite and Fanta, Coca-Cola is also the name behind Powerade sports drinks, Minute Made juices, Gold Peak tea, Dasani water, and more. It's got something to sell to everyone at any given time.\n\nThe 400 million shares of Coca-Cola Berkshire Hathaway's been holding since 2006 are worth a total of nearly $24 billion, by the way. That makes it Berkshire's fourth-biggest holding.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will be navigating through the 10 smartphones with the best cameras and battery life. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can move directly to the 5 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life.\n\nRivalry in the Smartphone Market\n\nAs reported by the Financial Times, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ended 12 years of Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd.’s (OTC:SSNLF) dominance in the global smartphone market in 2023. Although overall device shipments declined in 2023, the iPhone manufacturer managed to witness annual unit growth. At the same time, Huawei secured market share in China. Low-end mobile makers also emerged while Samsung lost its global share due to an intense focus on the high-end smartphone market. In the low-end market, the Chinese company Transsion has been dominant especially in Africa through its brands Tecno and Infinix. You can also take a look at some of the best-selling smartphones in 2023.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled its latest iPhone 15 series in September 2023. The company experienced a rebound in iPhone sales by 11.6% in the fourth quarter of 2023 after the launch. You can also take a look at the top 30 countries using iPhones to better analyze the iPhone vs Android market share dynamics around the world.\n\nIn terms of top-notch features that help smartphone manufacturers capture the market, an emerging trend has been camera phones which have an overall good performance as well. In competition with the recent iPhone series is the Samsung S24 series. While the Samsung Galaxy S24 Ultra has a camera system comprising a 200MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 10MP telephoto (3x zoom), 50MP periscope (5x zoom), and a 12MP front camera, the iPhone 15 Pro Max features a 48MP main, 12MP ultra-wide, 12MP periscope (5x zoom) and a 12MP front camera. Battery size, which is an important feature while assessing how long the smartphone will last, is a 5,000mAh battery for the former and a predicted 4,442 mAh for the latter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is another prominent player in the smartphone arena. The company has launched many popular models such as its Pixel series. It revealed the latest Pixel 8 series in October 2023. The company upgraded the camera system for the series apart from brightening the display. The ultrawide lens on the phones enables an improved macro focus. A new editing tool Magic Editor in Google Photos also helps reposition objects as preferred, in the pictures captured.\n\nWhat Have the Big Players Been Up To?\n\nLet’s take a look at what Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF), and Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google have been up to. Other valuable smartphone companies have also been previously covered.\n\nOn February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported strong earnings for its fiscal 2024 first quarter. The company reported earnings per share of $2.18, beating EPS estimates by $0.08. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) revenue for the quarter amounted to $119.58 billion, up 2.07% year-over-year and ahead of revenue consensus by $1.31 billion. As of February 26, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gained nearly 23% over the past 12 months.\n\nSamsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) has recently exposed its users to a new mobile AI era. On February 25, Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. (OTC:SSNLF) reported that it will be offering hands-on Galaxy AI on all Galaxy products for visitors at the Mobile World Congress 2024. AI features of the latest Galaxy S24 series will be presented at the company’s booth. Some of these features include Live Translate, which can translate calls in real time, and the introduction of faster searching using Circle to Search with Google. To demonstrate the camera features and the Nightography capability of the Galaxy S24 series, visitors can even take pictures in low light settings. Galaxy’s AI-based ProVisual Engine in the Galaxy S24 series has enabled improved photography in low light.\n\nAlphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google introduced new features to the Google Pixel 8 series earlier this year. On January 25, the company reported that Pixel 8 Pro’s Thermometer app will now be enabling users to take forehead temperature. The Circle to Search feature was also unveiled, with which users can simply search online for anything they circle on the screen. Simultaneously, the Magic Compose feature will help users create better and more concise messages through suggestions regarding various styles for a drafted text.\n\nNow that we have taken a look at the smartphone industry, let’s move to the 10 smartphones with the best cameras and battery life. 10 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life\n\n10 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 10 smartphones with the best cameras and battery life, we conducted a consensus. Initially, we gathered a list of the phones with the best cameras and good battery life from more than 5 mobile review sources. We then checked their listings on online vendors such as Amazon, Best Buy, and Walmart. We sourced the average rating and the number of reviews for each smartphone.\n\nFinally, we chose the average rating as our primary metric and the cumulative number of reviews as our secondary metric. The average rating is simply an average of the product ratings across all sources while the cumulative reviews were found by totaling the product reviews across the sources used. The rationale behind these metrics is that the average rating is a better representation of how well the product was perceived to be, while the number of reviews suggests what customers have to say about the product which could either be a good remark or a bad comment. Hence, the 10 smartphones with the best cameras and battery life were ranked according to their average rating and number of reviews, on a priority basis.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using different consensus approaches, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n10 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life\n\n10.

        "title": "How Much Longer Will Apple Underperform the Nasdaq Composite?",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has long been king of the stock market. It is Warren-Buffett-led Berkshire Hathaway's largest public equity holding. And until recently, it was the most valuable company in the world.\n\nBut Apple has lost its crown to Microsoft, and some even fear it will slip into third place if Nvidia keeps up its scorching-hot valuation expansion.\n\nApple stock is down 5.3% so far in 2024 compared to a 5.1% gain in the Nasdaq Composite. Over the last year, Apple is up 18.6% compared to the Nasdaq's 33.1% gain. Apple underperformed the Nasdaq over the past year, whereas Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, Alphabet, and Meta Platforms have all crushed the Nasdaq.\n\nHere's why Apple is out of favor on Wall Street, and what the tech stock needs to do to regain investor optimism. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSlowing growth\n\nWhen talking about a company as relevant and influential as Apple, it's easy to focus too much on the numbers and miss the big picture. The big picture is that Apple's bread-and-butter business, which is selling phones, computers, and other devices, is under pressure.\n\nApple's product sales stagnated, while its services continue to put up record quarter after record quarter. The problem is that products make up over 80% of revenue and 69% of gross profit.\n\nServices include Apple TV+, Apple Music, Apple Podcasts, Apple Books, and more. The services rollout has been a major success and is a core reason why many investors continue to see Apple as a growth stock.\n\nApple is struggling to grow its product business. If you zoom out, it's easy to see why.\n\nEach new iPhone, MacBook, etc. must justify a higher price tag. Part of that justification is new features, but another aspect is longevity. Consumers with older models have less incentive to upgrade because the older models have gotten progressively better and the next-generation device improvements are less impactful than they used to be. In other words, Apple is a victim of its own success, and it is showing in its performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has overcome marginal product improvements for some time. Apple operates a vertically integrated hardware model featuring different devices, from phones, computers, wearables, tablets, headphones, and more. But it also has a vertically integrated services model that builds upon those hardware options, like Apple Pay and iCloud. Apple is one of the best companies in the world at blending hardware and software to add value for consumers. There's no phone or laptop pairing with Amazon Prime Video. And Microsoft's devices don't hold a candle to the level of vertical integration that Apple has achieved. Plus, Apple has several brick-and-mortar stores that add a service element consumers expect if they pay top dollar for multiple devices.\n\nThe new paradigm\n\nApple's vertically integrated model fosters lifetime customers. Apple is having no problem keeping folks engaged within its system. Rather, the issue is that it is struggling to generate those big-ticket sales that come with new product purchases.\n\nThe good news is that some of this may be due to the product upgrade cycle. Apple's sales and earnings soared during 2020 and 2021 because many consumers shifted their buying toward goods purchases rather than services. This artificially pulled future Apple product sales forward. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nIt stands to reason that many consumers who bought new Apple products in 2020 and 2021 haven't upgraded since then. That lag factor is weighing on Apple's performance.\n\nThe COVID-19-induced spike in sales is partially to blame for Apple's slowing growth. The beauty of Apple's business is that it doesn't bank on one-off transactions, but rather, keeping customers within its ecosystem and building products and services around that system to grow the lifetime spending of the buyer.\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro is yet another product that could further expand this ecosystem. But it's too early to tell if it will have a measurable impact on Apple's bottom line.\n\nApple's greatest headwinds\n\nThe glaring issue with Apple is that it has already pulled out all the stops, and yet it is still struggling to sustain a high growth rate. The vertical integration and harmony between products and services is increasing, but Apple's results just aren't delivering at the pace that investors have grown accustomed to.\n\nThe short-term slowdown in Apple's performance shows its dependence on iPhone and Mac performance. We can talk about services and potential all day. But when the chips are down, this company needs to sell new phones and computers -- plain and simple.\n\nPerhaps the greatest red flag from Apple's recent report was slowing growth in China. China is Apple's second-largest market. In Q1 fiscal 2024, China made up 17.4% of total sales compared to 42.1% for the Americas and 25.4% for Europe. But China sales fell 12.9% compared to Q1 fiscal 2023. Reasons for the slowdown include pressure on Chinese consumers, a shaky Chinese real estate market, and fierce competition from Huawei's new 5G phone.\n\nChina has been a key part of Apple's growth story, but it doesn't have to play the same role going forward. The iPhone saw all-time record revenue in India, South Korea, Indonesia, Latin America, Western Europe, and the Middle East. These markets could more than makeup for a slowdown in China. To quote Apple's CEO, Tim Cook, from the Q1 fiscal 2023 earnings call:\n\nLooking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very good about how we performed, and that was -- that's despite the headwinds that we've talked about. Taking a step back, India is hugely exciting market for us and is a major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple retail there. So we're putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There's been a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable and give people more options to buy. And so there's a lot going on there. We are, in essence, taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scale to China and bringing that to bear.\n\nIf the slowdown in China accelerates, then Apple's short-term results will suffer, and the stock could fall under pressure. But the bigger story is Apple's growth in emerging markets long term. It's ultimately better for Apple's sales to be more geographically diversified and less dependent on China.\n\nApple's pros outweigh its cons\n\nGiven the uncertainty, it's understandable that investors aren't piling into Apple stock right now. But the company has so much going for it that overlooking its potential would be a grave mistake.\n\nApple has essential qualities that make it the perfect long-term investment.\n\nBrand power Industry leadership Vertical integration Customer loyalty High margins Strong cash flow The ability to invest in long-term growth while supporting stock buybacks and dividends Rock-solid balance sheet\n\nApple's greatest red flag is the lack of innovation regarding the iPhone and Mac. That flaw is exposed on the public markets right now. Apple is still a great company despite this pressing issue.\n\nA surefire investment\n\nWhat I like about Apple stock right now is that it has every reason to underperform in the short term and every reason to outperform over the long term.\n\nI could see Apple continue to underperform the Nasdaq until one of three things happens. Either the market shifts from a growth mindset to a value mindset, in which case Apple may look more attractive than more expensive than its big tech peers. Or Apple proves resilient against challenges in China and growth returns. Or China continues to grow in emerging markets and makes up for a slowdown in China that way.\n\nIt's hard to get excited about Apple right now, but it has the qualities that can unlock growth for decades to come.\n\nApple also has the cash needed to make a sizable acquisition if it needs to unlock growth that way. Apple is a sleeping giant because it has yet to make a splash in artificial intelligence, but it has the means to do so.\n\nFor Apple to begin outperforming the Nasdaq, it needs to show Wall Street that it can grow at a rate deserving of a premium valuation. After all, Apple has a 28.3 price to earnings ratio. That valuation is supported by its brand and the other qualities discussed, not its growth. If growth ticks up, then that valuation will start to look much more reasonable.\n\nFundamentals have and will continue to drive Apple stock. But even when they are lacking in the short term, investors can always fall back on the qualities discussed. For that reason, Apple is the perfect stock to buy and hold over time, as well as buy the dip when it becomes out of favor on Wall Street.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Zacks Industry Outlook Highlights Apple, HP and 3D Systems",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 26, 2024 – Today, Zacks Equity Research discusses Apple AAPL, HP HPQ and 3D Systems DDD.\n\nIndustry: Mini-Computers\n\nLink: https://www.zacks.com/commentary/2231033/3-stocks-to-watch-from-the-prospering-computer-industry\n\nThe Zacks Computer - Mini Computers industry is benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple, HP and 3D Systems are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for the industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants.\n\nRobust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers. However, waning demand for consumer PCs and geopolitical challenges, including raging inflation and high interest, are major headwinds.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung.\n\nExpanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\n\nStory continues\n\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung.\n\nImproved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\n\nPCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple's MacOS-based ones, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Stiff competition from smartphones has compelled global PC makers to not only upgrade hardware frequently but also add apps and cloud-based services to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the emergence of 5G, AI, machine learning and foldable computers is likely to be the key catalysts in expanding the total addressable market of PCs.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #104, which places it in the top 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\n\nThe group's Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\n\nThe industry's position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group's earnings growth potential. Since Oct 31, 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry's 2024 earnings has moved up 0.5%.\n\nGiven the bullish outlook, there are a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let's take a look at the industry's recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\n\nThe industry has gained 22.8% over this period compared with the S&P 500's return of 27% and the broader sector's rise of 50.9%.\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.61X compared with the S&P 500's 21.02X and the sector's 26.72X.\n\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.32X and as low as 13.92X, with the median being 24.64X.\n\n3 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now\n\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from a steady demand for iPhone devices, as well as an expanding footprint in emerging markets. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nA growing subscriber base and improving customer engagement are tailwinds for the services business. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store's traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has decreased by 0.6% to $6.56 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has declined 4.2% in the year-to-date period.\n\nHP: This Zacks Rank #3 company's sustained focus on launching the latest and innovative products is likely to help it stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.\n\nProduct innovation and differentiations are the key drivers that have helped HPQ maintain its leading position in the PC and printer markets.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $3.45 per share over the past 30 days. HP shares have declined 3.8% year to date.\n\n3D Systems: This Zacks Rank #3 company expects the dental market to stabilize amid the high inventory level in the supply chain and weakness in consumer discretionary spending.\n\n3D System expects a slower recovery in 2024 than its earlier expectation. Dental sales are expected to benefit from the continuing migration of orthodontic solutions from metal brackets and wires to clear aligners in the long run. Improved asset management and resource utilization are anticipated to reduce its total inventory significantly in 2024.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has increased by a penny to 8 cents per share over the past 30 days.

        "title": "13 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best consumer cyclical dividend stocks to invest in. You can skip our detailed analysis of the consumer cyclical sector and its performance over the years, and go directly to read 5 Best Consumer Cyclical Dividend Stocks To Invest In.\n\nConsumer cyclical companies produce goods and services that are considered non-essential or discretionary, meaning consumers are more likely to purchase them when they have extra income or feel confident about their financial situation. Consumer cyclical stocks include companies in sectors such as retail, automotive, travel and leisure, entertainment, and luxury goods.\n\nOver the past year, we've seen clear evidence that consumers have remained strong despite challenges like high inflation, increasing interest rates, and greater recession concerns. This resilience notably buoyed the performance of stocks within the consumer discretionary sector, which includes businesses offering non-essential products and services such as apparel, automobiles, and accommodations. The S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary Index ended 2023 with a total return of 42.41%, reporting one of its best years on record. In addition to the support from a strong consumer base, the stocks in this sector also gained from broader market trends that propelled the overall stock market higher in 2023. These trends included relief as the Federal Reserve signaled the potential end of its rate-hiking cycle as the year progressed. Furthermore, sector-level performance was boosted by specific issues affecting some of the largest companies within it. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), the two largest companies in the sector by a significant margin, have both seen remarkable gains in the past year, driven by the surge in mega-cap, tech-related stocks. Additionally, both companies are considered potential investment opportunities in the field of artificial intelligence.\n\nAfter experiencing robust performance in 2023, analysts are also showing a preference for the sector in the current year. Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director at U.S. Bank Wealth Management, stated that consumers' willingness to sustain moderate spending growth has been crucial for the economy. He suggested that this could be attributed, at least in part, to the robust labor market and notable wage increases. Based on a Fidelity report, the performance of sectors is expected to be influenced by broader economic factors in 2024. If inflation remains low and the Federal Reserve stops raising interest rates, it could be advantageous for the sector, as consumers may be more inclined to buy expensive items like cars or homes. An even more positive scenario would be if the economy avoids a recession and job markets stay robust, which would particularly benefit this sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe report highlighted that following the sector's strong performance in 2023, stock valuations are not as low as they were previously. However, there are still segments of the market where the firm has identified robust long-term growth prospects, and where stocks are trading at attractive prices. One ongoing area of opportunity includes certain retailers. These companies possess defensive characteristics within their business models, offering some protection in case of a deteriorating economic outlook.\n\nAnother factor contributing to the positive outlook for the sector is that certain companies within it opt to distribute dividends when they maintain a steady cash flow and have a track record of sharing profits with shareholders. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD), and NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) are some of the best consumer cyclical dividend stocks among others that are discussed below.

        "content": "In this piece, we are going to look at the 20 Countries Facing the Biggest BrainDrain. If you want to skip emigration situation and its trends globally, and how immigration has contributed substantially to the U.S. economy, you can go directly to 5 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain.\n\nYouth brain drain in the world, especially the Western Balkan Six countries (WB6) poses a significant challenge, with high rates of emigration affecting their economic and democratic advancement, potentially impacting their integration into the EU. Current strategies for addressing youth emigration focus on broader policy areas like youth employment and education but may not fully address the issue.\n\nConversely, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, a substantial migration from Russia to Kazakhstan has created an opportunity for economic growth and brain gain in Kazakhstan. However, cautious policymaking in Kazakhstan could hinder capitalizing on this potential influx.\n\nIn the global context, attracting and retaining specialized talent is paramount for economic growth. Recent immigration policy changes, such as Ireland's expanded employment permits and the EU Blue Card enhancements, demonstrate efforts to facilitate foreign national movement. The introduction of remote work visas and visa waivers by various countries further showcases a concerted effort to attract and accommodate foreign talent, underscoring the strategic measures in place to address the complex issue of brain drain on an international level.\n\nU.S. has been a focal point in context of emigration. In 2022, the workforce in the United States consisted of approximately 28.4 million immigrant employees, showcasing a notable increase of nearly 7 million from the 21.5 million recorded in 2010. Comparatively, there were approximately 129.4 million native-born workers in the same year. Among the various industries, the educational and health services sector employed the highest number of immigrant workers, totalling 5.2 million individuals, which accounted for 18.2% of all foreign-born employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis was followed by professional and business services with 4.3 million workers (15.2%) and construction with 3.3 million workers (11.7%). Notably, the construction industry boasted the largest proportion of immigrant workers in 2022, with an estimated 3.33 million individuals, representing 11.7% of all immigrant employment. Comparatively, 8.05 million native-born workers were employed in construction, constituting 6.2% of the native-born workforce.\n\nA significant proportion of immigrant workers, accounting for 22.8% of the workforce, were engaged in the services sector. This category spanned various occupations, including automotive repair, barber and beauty salons, and religious organizations. Additionally, immigrant workers comprised 21.3% of the professional and business services sector in 2022, encompassing occupations in legal services, accounting, and veterinary services. Within the agricultural sector, approximately 468,000 immigrants were employed, representing 1.7% of the total immigrant workforce. In contrast, native-born individuals accounted for a larger presence in agriculture, with 1.82 million workers in 2022, comprising 1.4% of the native-born employed workforce.\n\nAlso, immigrant entrepreneurs have been integral to America's economic success story, with many of the country's largest and most renowned companies tracing their origins back to immigrants or their descendants. These \"New American\" businesses, ranging from well-known brands like Apple and Costco to newcomers on the Fortune 500 list such as Coupang and Lululemon, have consistently fueled innovation and growth in diverse industries. Recent analyses have shown that a significant percentage of Fortune 500 companies have immigrant or immigrant-descended founders, underscoring the enduring impact and entrepreneurial spirit of immigrants in shaping the business landscape of the United States. Namely, Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) and Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) are few companies consisting of immigrant-descended founders. Before we move to our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, let’s take a look at these companies one by one.\n\nBig Companies with Immigrant-Descended Founders\n\nThe existence of the American computer company Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL) can be directly attributed to the immigration of Steve Jobs' father, Abdul Fattah Jandali, as a political migrant from Homs, Syria. By allowing this Syrian refugee into the U.S., a pivotal pathway was created for the establishment of Apple, influencing the technology landscape significantly.\n\nAs of now, Apple Inc. (NASDAQGS:AAPL) stands with a market capitalization of $2.82 trillion. More so, Apple unveiled its fiscal 2024 first-quarter financial outcomes concluding on December 30, 2023. The company reported a quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, reflecting a 2% increase compared to the previous year, along with quarterly earnings per diluted share of $2.18, representing a 16% surge year over year. This underscores the profound impact that immigration has had on shaping the tech industry.\n\nMoreover, the Cuban immigrant background of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) founder Jeff Bezos further exemplifies how the origins of influential U.S. companies are intricately connected to immigrant contributions. Currently, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQGS:AMZN) has a market capitalization of $1.82 trillion. In the fourth quarter of 2023, Amazon’s net sales surged by 14% to reach $170.0 billion, displaying notable growth from the $149.2 billion recorded in the fourth quarter of 2022.\n\nColgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) was a small soap and candle company founded by the English Immigrant William Colgate in New York City in the early 19th century. Now, it has a market capitalization of $71 billion. Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) manufactures and sells consumer products in the United States and internationally. In the upcoming fiscal year of 2024, Colgate-Palmolive Company (NYSE:CL) is anticipated to report earnings of $3.47 per share on revenues totaling $20.02 billion, reflecting a 7.43% variance in earnings per share and a 2.9% shift in revenue. Projections for the following fiscal year indicate an expected increase in performance, with the company projected to earn $3.75 per share on revenues of $21.02 billion, signifying year-over-year changes of 8.03% and 5%, respectively. 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain\n\nHumannet/Shutterstock.com\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, we referred to Fragile States Index, particularly focusing on the Human Flight and Brain Drain Index, which is capped at 10, where higher the index (closer to 10), higher the rate of brain drain in a country i.e. higher the number of skilled workers leaving the country. With this, let’s now jump onto our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20. Sri Lanka\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.6\n\n20th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is Sri Lanka, which is currently experiencing a significant brain drain issue, with over 300,000 individuals choosing to migrate abroad since the country defaulted on its foreign debt last year. Factors such as high inflation, increased taxes, shortages, and limited opportunities have prompted professionals and laborers to seek better prospects overseas. The country's bankruptcy in the recent past hasn't helped the situation.\n\n19. Fiji\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.6\n\nFiji is currently grappling with a significant brain drain crisis, with approximately 22,000 individuals having relocated abroad, with 16,000 departing on work permits. The Finance Ministry's permanent secretary addressed this issue at the National Economic Summit, emphasizing the ongoing loss of skilled personnel.\n\n18. Chad\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.7\n\nChad has experienced significant brain drain as a result of prolonged instability and conflict. Many Chadians have migrated to countries such as Saudi Arabia, UAE, Kuwait, Egypt, Syria, Lebanon, and France within the European Union in search of better opportunities.\n\n17. Mali\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.7\n\nMali's economy has displayed resilience despite challenges like ECOWAS sanctions, high food inflation, and cotton production difficulties, which has led to brain drain over the years, resulting in its appearance here in the list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain. The outlook for 2023-2024 poses risks concerning the electoral schedule and stricter financial conditions. The increased cost of financing, especially given Mali's high financing requirements, presents a notable risk. Tighter monetary policies have led to higher yields on Treasury bills and bonds within the WAEMU region.\n\n16. Grenada\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 7.7\n\nDespite facing the challenge of brain drain, Grenada's economy shows resilience and growth, with expectations to exceed pre-pandemic levels by 2023. The growth is propelled by the construction sector's strong performance and a steady rise in tourist arrivals, supported by successful initiatives to enhance airlift connectivity.\n\n15. Syria\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8\n\nSyria is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, with more than two-thirds of the population in acute need of assistance. The combination of factors such as the global economic recession, the impact of COVID-19, sanctions, and economic challenges in neighboring Lebanon has led to over 90% of the population living below the poverty line. The erosion of purchasing power, high inflation rates, and currency depreciation have further exacerbated the economic hardships faced by Syrians. Additionally, the conflict in Ukraine has impacted the cost of staple foods, leading to increased food insecurity in the country.\n\n14. Cabo Verde\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8\n\n14th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is Cabo Verde, which is facing a significant brain drain issue, with more of its population residing outside the country than within its borders. However, since 2019, the Cape Verdean government has initiated a new digital plan to establish the country as a prominent tech hub in the sub-region, aiming to compete with tech powerhouses like Nigeria and Ghana in West Africa. This strategic plan seeks to address the brain drain challenge and propel Cabo Verde as a key player in the tech industry through innovative initiatives and investments.\n\n13. Moldova\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.1\n\n13th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is Moldova, which is facing a significant brain drain issue, as many young individuals have been compelled to seek opportunities abroad due to limited job prospects and low wages at home. Various global and regional crises, including the COVID-19 pandemic and Russia's invasion of Ukraine, have exacerbated the economic challenges in the country. The departure of talented young Moldovans has resulted in a shortage of skilled workforce needed for economic reconstruction, posing risks to local industries' competitiveness and growth. Moldova has experienced a significant loss of its student population over the past 16 years, further intensifying the brain drain phenomenon.\n\n12. Guyana\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.2\n\nGuyana has been grappling with a significant brain drain issue, leading to an exodus of highly skilled individuals seeking better opportunities and higher pay abroad. The departure of skilled professionals has resulted in shortages in critical sectors like healthcare, education, and technology, leading to a decline in service quality and innovation. Reports indicate that a large percentage of individuals with tertiary education have left the country for more lucrative jobs. The World Bank's 2021 report highlights the need for Guyana to address the lack of opportunities and low pay for skilled professionals in order to retain talent and combat brain drain.\n\n11. Haiti\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.3\n\nHaiti is the 11th country on our list of 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, as it is experiencing ongoing emigration, fueled by historical challenges such as poverty, natural disasters, political crises, and insecurity. The country's struggles, including a massive earthquake in 2010, violent riots in 2018, and the assassination of President Jovenel Moïse in 2021, have contributed to a power vacuum and increased migration. Economic instability, exacerbated by widespread poverty, has further driven Haitians to seek opportunities abroad.\n\n10. Micronesia\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.4\n\nA significant number of young Micronesians have been leaving their country in pursuit of better economic prospects, which are limited in the Federated States of Micronesia. President David Panuelo highlighted this issue in his state of the nation address, revealing that over 2,000 citizens migrated permanently in 2020, followed by another 2,500 in 2021. The trend shows a disproportionate loss of youth, with the average age of emigrating citizens ranging between 25 and 28, posing a challenge for the nation.\n\n9. Afghanistan\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.5\n\nThe Taliban have appealed to Western nations to halt the evacuation and resettlement of educated and skilled Afghans abroad, stating it is detrimental to Afghanistan. They claim improved security within the country, assuring the safety and freedom of all Afghans, including those affiliated with the previous government. Despite this, tens of thousands of educated Afghans have fled in fear of Taliban persecution in the past two years, prompting countries like the United States, Canada, and various European nations to accept Afghan refugees. This significant brain drain, including media professionals, has resulted in setbacks for free media in Afghanistan.\n\n8. Albania\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.5\n\nAlbania has been grappling with a significant brain drain issue, ranking among the top countries globally for emigration prior to the Covid-19 pandemic. Despite being the only non-African country in this top tier, Albania has faced a resurgence in emigration over the past decade, affecting its population and educational system. This brain drain has led to a workforce crisis in various industries and sectors within the country.\n\n7. Somalia\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.6\n\nSomalia, 7th on our list of Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain, continues to face challenges with brain drain as the number of diaspora academic returnees remains lower than desired. Despite an increase in the return of diaspora academics each year, the country still experiences a net loss of people according to World Bank migration data. The shortage of qualified and experienced academic staff in higher education institutions further exacerbates the brain drain issue in Somalia.\n\n6. Eritrea\n\nHuman Flight and Brain Drain Index: 8.6\n\nThe prolonged conflict between Eritrea and Ethiopia has resulted in significant loss of life and instability in the region. This historical conflict, coupled with the current political challenges and humanitarian crises, contributes to a dire situation in Eritrea. The country's issues, such as a dictatorial system and poor governance, further compound the challenges faced by its people.\n\nClick to continue reading and find out about the 5 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nBest Immigration Lawyers in Each of 30 Biggest Cities in the US 19 Countries that Encourage Immigration from USA 25 Countries With Highest Immigration To U.S.\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Countries Facing the Biggest Brain Drain is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nVision Space, a Beijing-based VR start-up, has several bricks-and-mortar stores that allow customers to try out the device for 98 yuan (US$13.60) an hour. The biggest one, in Hopson One mall in eastern Beijing, has received more than 10,000 customers since February 4, according to company founder and chief executive Song Lei.\n\n\"It's been super busy over the weekend as people line up to interact with the gadget,\" said Song.\n\nChinese tech enthusiasts try out Apple's Vision Pro at the Vision Space store in Beijing on Feb 26, 2024.

Photo: SCMP/ Coco Feng>\n\nA tech enthusiast surnamed Fu, who owns Meta Platform's Quest 3 headset, tested the Apple gadget at the Vision Space store on Monday. He said that the Vision Pro \"excelled\" the Quest 3 \"in every sense\".\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the adverts, rental prices varied from 98 yuan per hour to 1,500 yuan per day, with some merchants requiring a deposit of at least 30,000 yuan. Some adverts said the borrower would have the option of buying the device after use.\n\nOne lessor in Shanghai said the rental was \"better than Apple Store's 30-minute demo session\" in terms of time flexibility, referring to the free trial of the Vision Pro currently only available in US stores.\n\nAnother lessor in Beijing said his gadget is fully booked up until March 4, and that he expects to earn about 9,000 yuan by the end of this month. \"I should recover the total cost in about three months\", he added.\n\nA third Shanghai-based renter said that most of her customers were satisfied and that more than half expressed a desire to buy the device, although one said it was \"ill-fitting for a typical Asian face [with a low nose bridge]\".\n\nAs the hype builds, cheaper alternatives such as the Vision SE, made by local headset maker EmdoorVR, can be found in the southern tech hub of Shenzhen for less than 2,000 yuan.\n\nThe Vision Pro is Apple's first major release since the Apple Watch nine years ago.

Photo: AFP>\n\nHowever, those renting the Vision Pro may not have long to pull in customers as Apple CEO Tim Cook said earlier this month that the device would be on sale in China \"soon\".\n\nChinese financial media outlet Wallstreetcn.com reported earlier this month that the Vision Pro's China release would be no later than May, and that the registration process with the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology was \"nearing completion\".\n\nMeanwhile, the buzz continues. On microblogging site Weibo, the topic #AppleVisionPro has attracted 60 million views, while #VisionPro had 12 million views as of Monday.\n\nPopular tech reviewer He Shijie, who made headlines after interviewing Cook in 2021, published a Vision Pro review that has amassed more than 3.5 million views.\n\nHe praised the device for \"providing disruptive sensory experiences and interactions\", including a high-resolution screen with low latency, but said \"it's not comfortable to use\".\n\n\"Most of the weight is on the face. I have to take a rest every 20 minutes,\" he said in the review published on video site Bilibili.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at theJim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 11 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 5 Stocks.\n\nJim Cramer continues to challenge the market bears after NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) smashed the Wall Street estimates with another stunning quarter, essentially proving that the AI rally that kept giving a boost to stocks in 2023 was not based on a hype after all. Cramer recently said in his program \"Mad Money\" on CNBC that NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  did not defy gravity with its latest earnings, rather it defied the \"unwarranted negativity\" and \"cynicism.\" Cramer said the performance of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  stock has proved wrong the idea that stocks are \"hostage\" to an \"all powerful Fed.\"\n\nCramer said that he kept recommending NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA)  shares all along because he knew the company's chips are much faster than its competitors like Intel. Cramer said \"for years\" he believed Nvidia stock would look cheap in \"retrospect\" because its earnings would always be much higher than expected. Cramer lamented:\n\n\"I documented this time and time again yet for ages nobody seemed to catch on.\"\n\nWhy Didn't People Listen to Cramer on NVIDIA?\n\nJim Cramer wondered why people failed to foresee the potential of NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) over all these years? Jim Cramer believes part of the reason why nobody was willing to listen to his advice on buying Nvidia stock was the Fed-related fears. Cramer said it makes sense to pay attention to what the Fed is doing but believing that you should not own any stocks if rates are high causes you to miss on the benefits of owning top stocks like NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT). Cramer said back in the day he made \"millions of bucks\" when the Federal Reserve was raising rates aggressively. Cramer said too many people dwell on unimportant details and \"miss the big picture.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nCramer's Advice: \"Unshackle Yourself from the Chains of the Macro\"\n\nCramer also said that the Federal Reserve's actions are mostly relevant for big hedge funds which \"only invest in the averages.\" Jim Cramer said people should notice \"how rarely they (big hedge funds) talk about individual stocks.\"\n\nJim Cramer said people should pay attention to high quality names like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) because the leadership at these companies have a long-term vision and investors have a high chance of making money if they \"stick\" with them. Cramer said you need \"curiosity\" and you have to \"unshackle yourself from the chains of the macro\" to see the true potential of companies like Nvidia before they become big. Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These Stocks Stock Picks\n\n11. Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 2\n\nJim Cramer has been bearish on Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP) for a long time. Earlier this month he yet again reiterated his bearish case on Icahn Enterprises LP Common Stock (NASDAQ:IEP), whose shares are up about 12% this year through February 25.\n\n\"I have no idea what it really owns. I will not recommend stocks on Mad Money when I do not know what they own.”\n\n10. AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 8\n\nJim Cramer is bearish on Texas-based  space-based cellular broadband network company AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS) and recommends investors not to buy the stock. Cramer recently said that he does not see \"any way shape or form that they’re going to be making money, so I’m going to have to hold off that one.”\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, eight hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS). The biggest stake in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS) is owned by Sander Gerber's Hudson Bay Capital Management which owns a $4.5 million stake in AST SpaceMobile Inc (NASDAQ:ASTS).\n\n9. Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 10\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked whether ecommerce SaaS platform company Bigcommerce Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:BIGC) shares should be bought. Cramer's reply was \"no\" because he thinks \"we got Amazon.\"\n\nCramer has long been a believer of best of breed stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) and he believes when there's a first-grade, top quality player available in any industry it should be given preference instead of buying other smaller players.\n\n8. C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nJim Cramer has said in the past that there's too much hype around the shares of C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI). Earlier this month he was yet again asked about the stock. Cramer said he does not see \"any earnings\" there and he cannot recommend a stock \"that has no earnings.\"\n\nHowever, Cramer praised C3.ai Inc (NYSE:AI) CEO Thomas Siebel and said he's a \"bankable guy\" and he's known Siebel for 30 years.\n\nTo ride the AI wave Cramer recommends buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Our final new short position is in a company called C3.ai, Inc. (NYSE:AI). Originally named “C3 Energy,” C3.ai has changed its name multiple times based on whatever hot new trend they were supposedly capitalizing on. The “energy” theme was about smart grid and cap-and-trade. Then the firm changed its name to “C3 IoT” to attempt to capitalize on the Internet of Things buzz. After that trend fizzled out, the moniker was altered once more, with the company capturing the “AI” ticker in December 2020 – a savvy move if it wants to sell stock to credulous investors, but irrelevant to its business prospects. As Kerrisdale put it, the company is a “minor, cash burning consulting and services business masquerading as a software company.”\n\n7. Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 19\n\nJim Cramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Mississippi-based fresh eggs producer Cal-Maine Foods Inc (NASDAQ:CALM). Cramer said it's an \"unnecessary stock to own.\" Cramer however said he does like Tyson Foods from a valuation perspective.\n\nThe dividend-paying company missed fiscal Q2 estimates when it posted earnings in January. GAAP EPS in the quarter came in at $0.35, missing estimates by $0.48. Revenue in the quarter fell 34.7% year over year to $523.23 million, missing estimates by $2.16 million\n\nDiamond Hill Small Cap Fund made the following comment about Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“On an individual holdings’ basis, top contributors to return in Q3 included Civitas Resources and Cal-Maine Foods, Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM). Fresh egg producer Cal-Maine Foods has positioned itself well to capitalize on the growing trend toward cage-free and specialty eggs. In May, the US Supreme Court upheld Proposition 12, whereby California can dictate only cage-free eggs be sold in the state — an outcome which will likely open the door for other states to either institute or maintain similar mandates, and which should drive increased long-term demand for Cal-Maine Foods’ eggs.”\n\n6. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nSurgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer is recommending investors to stay away from. Last month Cramer said he was taking a \"hard pass\" on the stock. Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) shares are however up about 4.4% year to date through February 25.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 22 hedge funds out of the 933 funds had stakes in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY). The most notable stakeholder of Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY) was Henry Ellenbogen's Durable Capital Partners which owns a $175 million stake in Surgery Partners Inc (NASDAQ:SGRY).\n\nInstead of SGRY, Cramer is recommending big stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nBaron Health Care Fund stated the following regarding Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We established a small position in Surgery Partners, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGRY), a leading operator of ambulatory surgery centers in the U.S. Like Stryker, the stock sold off during the quarter due to concerns about the impact of GLP-1s on its business, and we felt the sell-off offered a buying opportunity. The company, which operates primarily majority owned centers in partnership with physicians or hospital systems, is benefiting from a multi-year trend of surgical procedures migrating from inpatient to outpatient settings, facilitated by advances in medicine, payors’ push towards lower cost outpatient facilities and patient/physician preference and convenience. The company’s solid organic revenue growth profile has multiple drivers, including the mix shift to higher acuity, higher cost orthopedic and cardiac procedures, volume growth from additional physician recruitment and expanded medical specialties and better payor contracting. On top of this organic growth, management intends to deploy $200 million annually for acquisitions, leading to mid-teens EBITDA growth. We believe the stock can compound for many years as the company executes on its plan.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer Says Do Not Buy These 5 Stocks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we take a look at the Best Immigration Lawyers in Each of the 30 Biggest Cities in the US. You can skip our detailed analysis and go directly to Best Immigration Lawyers in Each of the 10 Biggest Cities in the US.\n\nHuman movement across borders has been a part of life since the beginning of time. However, there is no doubt that the rate has substantially increased over the years. There are multifarious reasons why people leave their homes and move to a strange land. While some are dictated by the harsh realities of life, such as geopolitical strife and poor economic conditions, others are motivated by a prosperous career and a desire for diverse cultural experiences.\n\nInternational Immigrant Outlook and Industry Overview\n\nIn July 2020, the estimated global international migrant number was recorded at 281 million, constituting 3.5% of the global population. Approximately 48% of this number comprises females, and three out of four international migrants were observed to be in the age bracket of 20-64 years. The migration trend was more pronounced towards Asia and Europe (31% each), followed closely by North America (21%), Africa (9%), Latin America and the Caribbean (5%), and Oceania (3%). By the end of 2022, an astonishing number of refugees reached 35.3 million, with asylum-seekers amounting to 5.4 million.\n\nWith such large movements across countries, a significant proportion of immigrants may struggle to comprehend and select the most feasible and legally sound method for migration. This is where the role of immigration consultancies and law firms becomes crucial. They can assist individuals in streamlining the most feasible migration method according to their specific needs, help them understand their status in the migrated country according to its laws, and pave the way for a secure immigration. It is no wonder that the Immigration consulting services market is not only growing (reaching $1.42 billion in 2022) but is also expected to register a CAGR of 5.73% during the period 2023-2029, reaching $2.11 billion by 2029.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs there a Need for an Immigration Lawyer?\n\nHiring an immigration lawyer is not a requirement, and one can even choose to dispense with it when the immigration case is extremely straightforward. However, in more complicated scenarios, an immigration lawyer can indeed prove very helpful. Immigration law is intricate and contingent upon the immigrant rules and regulations of the country. US immigration lawyers would be the best avenue for aspirant US immigrants who are unable to navigate the winding path to citizenship and residency in the country. Their guidance becomes even more crucial in situations where certain elements complicate matters. For instance, cases involving deportation, prior immigration violations, criminal history, or being out of status in the US are some situations in which the expertise of immigration lawyers would prove beneficial.\n\nUS Immigrant Situation\n\nAccording to recent estimates from the US Census Bureau, the number of immigrants in the US increased by a million, reaching a record high of 46 million. The share of the foreign-born population has surged to nearly 14% after a slowdown due to the COVID-19 pandemic and governmental restrictions. People from all over the world move to this land of opportunity. The data from 2021 showed Mexico in the lead as the origin country for migrants (23.7%), followed by India (6.0%), China (4.7%), the Philippines (4.4%), and El Salvador (3.10%). Immigrants play a vital role in the economic prosperity of the country, contributing substantially, ranging from entrepreneurs to skilled and unskilled workforce, backing the economy.\n\nCompared to the overall US population, immigrants emerge as leaders in entrepreneurship. The data from 2021 revealed that 22.2% of immigrants are entrepreneurs. Notably, 44.8% of the 2023 Fortune 500 list was founded by either immigrants or the children of immigrants. This includes four prominent US tech companies: Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST). Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) was founded by the son of a Syrian immigrant, Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG) was co-founded by a Russian immigrant, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN) was established by a Cuban immigrant, and Costco was brought into being by the son of Canadian immigrants.\n\nImmigrants also constitute a fair share of the workforce, making up 17.10% of the labor force. They fill positions at both skilled and unskilled levels, working in diverse sectors from high-tech positions to agriculture, hospitality, and service jobs.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 13 best major stocks to buy right now. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest stock market news and some recent trends, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nThe start of 2024 for the stock market is more of the same. The first month of the year saw investors turn their attention to the Federal Reserve as usual in order to set expectations for the remainder of 2024. The Fed, if you're unaware, has been rapidly raising interest rates to combat inflation. Now that inflation has started to drop, Wall Street is eager to know when rates will start to drop, and on this front, ironically, the economy is proving to be the biggest hurdle in forcing the Fed's hand.\n\nHigher interest rates increase the cost of doing business and restrict consumer access to capital. This means that firms have a tougher time posting both revenue and earnings growth, and when their figures don't grow, neither does the economy. However, since the American economy continues to outshine peers, the Fed has more leeway to keep rates higher and deflate Wall Street's balloon that had become accustomed to easy money after the 2008 Great Recession and the more recent coronavirus pandemic.\n\nAt the same time, even as rates are high, the stock market is still continuing to impress. In fact, bears have been left rather red faced as major indexes such as the NASDAQ Composite and the S&P 500 have continued to soar despite the depressing effects that high interest rates have on stock valuation. In fact, despite the tepid interest rate environment, it's the S&P 500 that has once again proven that no matter how shrewd analysts are, they can still miss out on major trends.\n\nThis is because the flagship Wall Street stock index which contains the crown jewels of the American stock market set a new all time record in February 2024 when it soared above 5,000 points for the first time in its history. Quite a sharp turnaround from the tail end of 2022 had seen speculation far and wide that a recession was incoming and that everyone should batten down their hatches.\n\nStory continues\n\nJust like 2023 saw the NASDAQ 100 soar to new highs on the back of major stocks such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). 2024's record setting index levels are also influenced by such companies. The start of the year ushered in all important earnings season that saw major stocks the likes of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) take the lead on the artificial intelligence front. A.I. was the biggest theme on the stock market last year, and the mega stock earnings calls saw their management share strategies about costs, future plans, and other data that investors parsed over with eagle eyes to see whether the hype in A.I. is really worth investing in.\n\nAnd as we've seen through major stock performance in 2024, seems like investors are impressed. Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and NVIDIA's shares are up by 7.64%, 35%, 13%, and 49.7%, year to date, respectively. This shows that even though small cap stocks that are often touted for their ability to deliver double digit and higher percentage returns, major stocks the likes of some of the magnificent seven that we've talked about above can also stun everyone given the market and economic contexts align in their favor.\n\nBefore we head on to the best major stocks to buy, another big news for these stocks this year has come from Meta. Meta has traditionally been a high growth technology company whose income statement for years was a classic example of a venture capital model that saw negative profits but revenue growth. Yet in 2024 Meta declared a 50 cent dividend for the first time in its history to mark its entry into the list of stable big guns that can regularly pay out their profits to investors as a reward for patience and belief.\n\nSo, as major stocks continue to shine, which ones are hedge funds interested in? We took a look and some notable picks are Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). 13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best major stocks to buy, we made a list of the common top constituents of the S&P 500 index and the NASDAQ 100 index and ranked them by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares as of Q4 2023 end. Out of these, the top stocks were chosen as the best major stocks to buy.\n\nFor these best major stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n13 Best Major Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\n13. Intuit Inc.

        "title": "Ken Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at Ken Fisher's latest investment portfolio and the 12 biggest positions. If you want to skip our overview of Fisher, his investment firm, and the broader U.S. stock market and macroeconomic environment, then you can take a look at Ken Fisher Portfolio: 5 Biggest Positions.\n\nKen Fisher is one of the richest people in the world courtesy of his hedge fund Fisher Asset Management. The fund had $203 billion in investments spread across its portfolio according to filings with the SEC. Fisher set up his hedge fund nearly five decades ago in 1979 and served as its CEO until 2016 before relinquishing the role. Right now, he's the Executive Chairman of Fisher Investments and holds the title of co-chief investment officer along with Jeff Silk.\n\nA $203 billion investment portfolio is no small achievement, even if the highly risky nature of the hedge fund industry sees the biggest players such as Ken Griffin's Citadel and Seth Klarman's Baupost often take leverage to fund their bets and double their returns. Investment portfolios of this size mean that not only do Fisher Investment's clients have to trust the firm, but also that the hedge fund has to demonstrate that it is able to outperform either the market or the economy or at least serve as a buffer against sharp capital depreciation during times of economic turmoil.\n\nThe start of the year is the tone setting mood for stock markets, and for Fisher Investments, the year did not miss out on a beat after the firm had to jump in to release an unusual press release. This press release countered a report by the Wall Street Journal that had stated that Ken Fisher's firm, over which he holds 100% control through a trust that he shares with his wife, was being sold to the Boston, Massachusetts based private equity firm Advent International. The WSJ was not the only publication that cited anonymous sources for its report, as Bloomberg also published a similar piece which outlined that Advent had had talks to  \"acquire billionaire Ken Fisher's eponymous Fisher Investments, according to a person with knowledge of the matter\" but also went on to quote Fisher Investment's response that bluntly denied any such speculation.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fact Fisher's firm, which is quite widely covered in the press and is known for its founder's ability to generate buzz, was quite hard hitting its response. Its press release bluntly stated:\n\nFisher Investments is not being bought by Advent International, or anyone else—plain and simple.\n\nThe story also had numerous other inaccuracies. Had The Wall Street Journal's reporters bothered to verify the facts, we would have corrected their reporting. Instead, The Wall Street Journal printed the rumors first and followed up with us last.\n\nThe WSJ's coverage had speculated that not only was Advent having 'talks' to acquire Fisher Investments, but that the hedge fund might see other partners emerge for a deal. Reading Fisher's press release, while it did deny that a transaction was not officially underway, the text nevertheless missed out on sharing any details of potential 'talks' - leading to the assumption that since there were no talks for a potential sale, there was no need to deny them in the press release.\n\nMoving forward to other news in 2024, the year has started off by providing investors with the latest data set to read the tea leaves and see where the Federal Reserve's current interest rate hiking cycle will be at the year's close. This data set is the retail sales for January which showed an 0.8% annual drop that came as part of a release that saw the Commerce Department also revise down the data for December.\n\nOn the surface, this data paints a softer picture of the economy that shows that as consumers face the pinch of high interest rates, they are starting to cut down their spending. However, economists also preached caution after the release, as they speculated that while it is possible that a spending, and by extension economic, slump had led to the sales falling, the contribution of cold temperatures across the U.S. could not be completely ignored in the aftermath of the release.\n\nHowever, and as has been the case for more than a year now, the optimistic data set was followed by the exact opposite just a day later. On Friday, data from the Labor Department revealed that import prices jumped by 0.8% in January, which was the high reading since the first quarter of 2022. In short, nearly a two year old record of an inflationary indicator was broken, and perhaps unsurprisingly, when paired by the producer price index (PPI)'s 0.3% jump in January, futures linked to the S&P 500 and other indexes dropped.\n\nWith the fourth quarter hedge fund filing season well on its way, we decided to see which stocks Fisher Investments is piling into as the year gets off to a roaring start. Some notable names are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Ken Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions\n\nKen Fisher of Fisher Asset Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest stakes in Ken Fisher's investment portfolio, we ranked Fisher Investments' fourth quarter of 2024 investment portfolio by the dollar value of the stakes and picked out the biggest positions.\n\nKen Fisher Portfolio: 12 Biggest Positions\n\n12. Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY)\n\nFisher Investments' Q4 2023 Stake: 2.6 billion\n\nEli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) is an American pharmaceutical and healthcare giant headquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana. Amidst the fire injected into its stock by weight loss drugs such as Mounjaro, Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) scored a big win in February 2024 when Morgan Stanley increased its share price to $950 for a whopping $145 increase. This makes the share price target the highest on Wall Street, and the average Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY) share price target is $757 - below the current share price.\n\nAs of Q4 2023 end, 102 out of the 933 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Eli Lilly and Company (NYSE:LLY). Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management was the firm's largest hedge fund shareholder in Q4 due to its $2.6 billion stake.\n\nAlong with Apple Inc.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 11 cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024. To skip the detailed analysis of the artificial intelligence industry, go directly to the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) revolution has hit the ground running since last year, and there seems to be no stop in sight to it in the near future. The PwC Emerging Technology Survey suggests that after the launch of ChatGPT, more than half of the surveyed companies have introduced generative AI in some form to their business. The AI stocks also performed quite well in 2023 and are still trending in 2024. The Magnificent 7 stocks outperformed the rest of the S&P 493 heavily in the year, and analysts like Goldman Sachs' David Kostin are positive that the gains will continue in 2024. The seven big tech stocks, including Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), which were the top performers of the group, collectively gained around 75% during the previous year compared to 12% gains for the rest of the 493 stocks in the S&P 500 index.\n\nOther than the big tech, AI technology gave a boost to a range of AI companies. The Invesco Dynamic Software ETF (IGPT) gained over 30% in 2023 compared to the S&P 500's 25% growth. Moreover, the ETF is also 15.80% higher year-to-date (YTD) at the time of the February 23 market close, compared to the S&P 500’s 7.3% gains.\n\nAI is changing the face of every sector in the market. For example, the mortgage finance company Rocket Companies, Inc. (NYSE:RKT) uses AI for mortgage banking, underwriting, and servicing. In 2023, The company piloted an AI virtual assistant with 325 mortgage bankers and outbound client calls.\n\nIn addition, the real estate company Equinix, Inc. (NASDAQ:EQIX) sets up networks and data centers, making it quite exposed to potential growth in AI computer facilities. At the company’s Q4 2023 earnings call CEO Charles Meyers said:\n\n“We had a solid close to 2023 as digital transformation and accelerating AI demand drove a record quarter for xScale leasing, robust pricing dynamics and continued momentum across our data center and digital services portfolios. For the full year, we delivered more than $8 billion of revenues, eclipsing 21 years of consecutive quarterly growth, all while driving AFFO per share performance above the top end of our long-term expectations.\n\nAs we look ahead, we see our overall relevance to customers continue to rise with our global reach, highly differentiated ecosystems and full-range portfolio of services, positioning us as a key long-term partner to fuel digital transformation and unlock the enormous potential of AI.”\n\nStory continues\n\nEffects of AI on Labor\n\nAn International Monetary Fund (IMF) report defines AI as a double-edged sword. While AI can potentially create many jobs, it can also replace human labor in several other areas. The IMF believes that nearly 40% of the jobs around the world are exposed to AI. In the developed countries, 60% of the jobs will be affected by the new technology creating a higher risk/reward situation for their labor markets. However, the report mentions that wealthier countries are also better equipped to adopt AI.\n\nFor emerging economies and under-developed nations, the IMF suggests laying concrete groundwork and infrastructure to be better prepared for the AI revolution in the job market.\n\nThe artificial intelligence industry is on the rise, and it’s significantly far away from its peak. This creates some entry points for investors in cheap AI companies. Keeping that in mind, some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024 include Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor this article, we identified 30 stocks trading on NYSE and NASDAQ that directly benefit from the rise of AI or are actively working for the growth of the artificial intelligence space. Next, we chose the stocks with the highest average analyst price target upside as of February 23. The analyst price targets were taken from TipRanks. We only chose the companies that were covered by at least two analysts and didn’t have many Hold or Sell ratings, as compared to Buy-equivalent ratings. The 11 best cheap AI stocks are listed in ascending order of their average analyst price target upside.\n\nWe also added the number of hedge fund investors for each stock as of the fourth quarter of 2023. The hedge fund data was taken from Insider Monkey’s database that tracks 933 elite hedge funds. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator. 11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\n11 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Analysts\n\n11. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 11.40%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $196.65\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 120\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) takes the 11th spot on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy. It produces semiconductor devices and its products, including AMD Vitis AI platform, MI300, and Ryzen 8040 laptop processors are driven by and designed for AI applications.\n\n34 Wall Street analysts covered Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) over the last three months, and 29 maintained a Buy rating on the stock. As of the February 23 market close, the average price target of $196.65 represented an upside of 11.40%.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, along with Rekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV).\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n10. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 12.95%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $206.15\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 131\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is famously known for its signature consumer electronics and more, but it has been working tirelessly to integrate AI and machine learning into its products.\n\nOn February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) declared a quarterly dividend of $0.24, payable by February 15 to the shareholders of record on February 12. The stock’s dividend yield was 0.53% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) posted a GAAP EPS of $2.18, surpassing the analysts’ estimates by $0.07. The revenue jumped 2.1% year-over-year (YoY) to $119.6 billion, topping the estimates by $1.34 billion.\n\nMairs & Power mentioned Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”\n\n9. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.33%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $164.59\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 214\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the biggest tech holding companies and has many AI-driven products under its belt, including Bard, Gemini 1.5, and more.\n\nOn February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) introduced its new next-generation AI model, named Gemini 1.5. The mid-size multimodal model is set to be released for testing soon and will be called the Gemini 1.5 Pro version.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s database which tracks 933 elite hedge funds, 214 funds had investments in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)’s stock in the fourth quarter. With 45.22 million shares worth $6.3 billion, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management was the top investor in the company.\n\nFirst Pacific Advisors stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”\n\n8. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 14.44%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $469.58\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has been long making headlines in the AI industry with its investments in AI companies and AI products like Azure AI.\n\nOn February 20, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s Vice Chair and President Brad Smith took to Twitter and announced that the company would be investing $2.1 billion over the next two years to develop the AI infrastructure in Spain.\n\nOn February 15, it was reported that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is planning on furthering the AI infrastructure in Germany through an investment of 3.2 billion euros ($3.44 billion) in the next two years.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was mentioned in Baron Funds’ fourth quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Our biggest purchase in the fourth quarter was a new position we initiated in the software platform Microsoft Corporation. While we have owned shares of Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the large-cap core growth Baron Durable Advantage Fund, we have been reluctant to add Microsoft to this Fund for many years namely since we viewed it as a better fit for a post high-growth strategy. However, Microsoft’s transformation under the helm of Satya Nadella has changed the company’s trajectory as it went from a windows-centric, on – premises technology provider to one of the top two global cloud providers. Cloud now represents over 55% of total revenues and has been growing rapidly. Over time, Microsoft was able to build a $125 billion run-rate cloud business that is still growing at a rapid pace and continues to take market share, while becoming a more important driver for the company. For example, in the last quarterly earnings release, Microsoft Cloud grew 23% year-over-year in constant currency, significantly outpacing the company’s 12% overall constant currency growth as well as the growth of its main competitors. A 23% growth rate at this scale essentially implies that Microsoft added a run rate of around $24 billion of cloud revenues year-over-year. Just to put this in perspective, $24 billion is nearly the size of Mastercard’s business, it is over 8 times Snowflake’s total revenue and is nearly 3 times ServiceNow’s total revenue. We continue to view cloud as early in its penetration opportunity – according to latest estimates from Gartner, global cloud spend is expected to be $564 billion3 which still represents only 12% of the total $4.7 trillion worldwide IT spending.\n\nWe also believe that Microsoft is one of the best competitively positioned large-cap companies with its vertically integrated software stack (infrastructure + applications), while the inflection in the adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) and GenAI represents potentially the biggest addressable market expansion for the company in recent history. We also view Microsoft’s competitive positioning in AI as advantaged thanks to both the fact that it does not face an innovators dilemma in its core business (as compared with Alphabet’s core search business, which could potentially be at risk due to GenAI). Microsoft also has a tight partnership with OpenAI, has a large proprietary data asset built over time, and has a go-to-market advantage through a vast and robust partner ecosystem and its significant installed base and product bundling opportunities. These should enable it to cross-sell its existing user base as AI becomes embedded into current and new products…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\n7. Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 17.66%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $122.30\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 20\n\nSynaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) is a California-based company that designs and sells user interface solutions, and many of them are integrated with AI, like its Smart Home SoC solution. It ranks seventh on our list of cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nOn February 9, Rosenblatt analyst Kevin Cassidy raised the price target on Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA)’s stock to $130 from $110 and kept a Buy rating on the shares.\n\nOn February 8, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) released its Q2 earnings result with a  non-GAAP EPS of $0.57, which beat the estimates by $0.13. The revenue of $237 million topped the estimates by $1.33 million.\n\nTimesSquare Capital Management made the following comment about Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the Information Technology sector, Synaptics Incorporated (NASDAQ:SYNA) develops and markets semiconductor product solutions. Their products enable users to interact more easily with smartphones, notebooks, tablets, and other portable multi-media devices. While the fiscal third quarter results were in line with sell-side projections, forward guidance was worse than expected. Management sees growing macroeconomic headwinds further impacting IT budgets, and the inventory draw-down has been slower than they had anticipated on weaker sell-through trends. Synaptics lost -23% and we added to the position.”\n\n6. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target Upside: 18.07%\n\nAverage Analyst Price Target: $653.43\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 105\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a California-based company that manufactures and sells computer software and its Adobe Sensei is just one feather among many in its hat when it comes to AI technology.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, 105 hedge funds owned a stake in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)’s stock. Fisher Asset Management was the most significant stakeholder in the company, with 4.56 million shares worth $2.72 billion, representing 1.33% of the portfolio.\n\nOut of 30 Wall Street analysts that covered Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in the last three months, 24 kept a Buy rating on the stock. The average price target of $653.43 had an upside of 18.07% as of the February 23 market close.\n\nRekor Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:REKR), Symbotic Inc. (NASDAQ:SYM), and AeroVironment, Inc. (NASDAQ:AVAV) are some of the cheap AI stocks to buy in 2024, besides Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE).\n\nPolen Capital commented on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its third quarter 2023 investor letter. Here is what it said:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Cheap AI Stocks to Buy in 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n11 Best Japanese Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best Semiconductor Equipment Stocks to Invest In 15 Best Family Vacations on a Budget for $5000\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 30 highest paying jobs in the world in the future. We have also discussed the future of jobs and some prominent trends. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paying Jobs In The World In The Future.\n\nThe future of jobs is intricately intertwined with technological developments, demographic changes, and global economic dynamics. Forecasts suggest that automation, robotics, and artificial intelligence (AI) will largely alter the outlook of employment. By 2030, these technologies could redefine job roles, with projections indicating that up to 800 million jobs could be automated globally. Moreover, studies show that a large portion of tasks — up to 30% —could be automated, potentially leading to a prodigious job displacement. To read about AI-proof jobs, see 20 Jobs Artificial Intelligence Can’t Replace.\n\nIn addition, the shift in global economic power will influence job markets worldwide. Emerging and developing countries with a strong focus on innovation and education may gain significant advantages, while developed countries can face challenges such as wealth disparity and job losses due to automation. By 2030, it is estimated that demand for energy and water will increase by as much as 50% and 40% respectively, indicating a sizable need for workforce adaptation in sectors addressing these needs.\n\nBetween these transformations, the role of digital platforms and AI will be crucial. Studies show that 73% of respondents believe that technology can never replace the human mind. However, concerns regarding data privacy, cyber threats, and job displacement persist. While some envision a future where AI augments human capabilities, others worry about its implications for job security. Regardless, embracing digitalization and leveraging AI responsibly will be essential for navigating the future job market. Ultimately, how societies adapt to these changes will determine the trajectory of the workforce in 2030 and beyond. To read more about the digital skills in demand, seeIn Demand Skills for Freelancers.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother major trend expected for present as well as future jobs is the theme of sustainability. In 2023, millions of sustainability jobs awaited skilled workers, yet many lacked necessary qualifications, particularly women. Only 1 in 8 globally possessed requisite green skills such as carbon measurement or renewable energy project development. LinkedIn data revealed a 29% higher green hiring rate in 2023, indicating promising job prospects. However, the gender gap persists, with 9 in 10 women lacking green skills or experience. Encouragingly, women are joining the green talent pool at a higher rate, though not rapidly enough to close the disparity.  To read more about green jobs, see the Fastest Growing Green Jobs in the World.\n\nTo shed light upon the growing influence and spead of AI, it is interesting to note that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has recently made an agreement with Reddit, valued at $60 million, to utilize the diverse content of the social media platform for training its AI models.\n\nThis collaboration has sparked a range of reactions, with some expressing concern over the potential consequences of exposing AI to Reddit's often unconventional and extreme content. Instances of peculiar narratives and contentious discussions on the platform have raised doubts about the wisdom of this partnership, as critics fear the AI may adopt problematic behaviors or viewpoints.\n\nHowever, between this apprehension, it's essential to acknowledge Reddit's positive contributions, offering valuable insights and uplifting narratives alongside its more controversial content. This deal highlights a broader trend in the tech industry, where major players seek to leverage social media data to bolster AI capabilities. 30 Highest Paying Jobs In The World In The Future\n\nAn overview of a commodities exchange room where traders buy and sell futures contracts, physical commodities, and Treasury Bills.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo list the highest paying jobs in the world in the future, we first identified by 50 fastest growing jobs in the future between 2023 and 2027 as highlighted by the Future of Work 2023 Report by the World Economic Fortum.

So here with more, we've got Nancy Tengler who is the CEO and CIO of Laffer Tengler Investments. Also here, we've got Steven Glass, Pella Funds Management Managing Director and Investment Analyst. Great to have you both here with us today.\n\nNancy, I want to begin with you because you are looking specifically at one of the best positioned companies. We'll start with the good. Then we'll get to the bad.\n\nBest position here, Amazon. Make the case for why Amazon even up against Meta and NVIDIA is the outperformer.\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Well, it's a game of relative performance from here. I think, I mean, clearly, NVIDIA is the winner. And will continue to win, I believe.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Amazon has yet to hit-- to retest its highs. And it's a company that has done improved efficiency, growing the advertising business. Cloud came in better than expected.\n\nAnd you have a CEO who is committed to taking the company to the next level. And so we think from here, you'll get really solid performance out of Amazon. And so we've moved it into our 12 best ideas portfolio and continue to hold it across our large cap equity strategies.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steve, I'm going to ask the same question to you in terms of who is best positioned. It looks like you think NVIDIA is. What do you see as the upside there just in terms of how much more gain is still in play?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, it's very difficult to actually have to have to force one to use their imagination. But the fact of the matter is this is a company on a 2% free cash flow yield, and it's only expected to grow 20% in 2015. So really its valuation fundamentals remain very strong. And it can continue growing here.\n\nI mean, Jensen Huang was commented on the size of the opportunity. It's bigger than everyone expected. It's a whole new industry. And it keeps on surprising. So in actual fact and royal valuation figures, it's actually one of the better positioned of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nBRAD SMITH: All right, I want to get to one that, Nancy, you believe is worse position. And, Steve, I'm going to bring you in on this as well because I know you've got some commentary on their positioning.\n\nBut it's Google. It's Alphabet. Nancy, why is this the worst position to you?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: That's a great question, Brad. Because it should by its recent performance at least be teed up to outperform going forward. But they keep stumbling.\n\nSo this latest issue with the images, on Gemini is the second hiccup since they've announced generative AI. They are behind at least in the intellectual capturing war with Microsoft. And so I think you want to be dubious.\n\nUse weakness, maybe if you don't own the position to add to it or initiate it. But we are holding firm and not adding to our holdings. Because we think it's going to be a while before the company gets past these negative issues.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Steven, do names that you see as worse position are Tesla and Apple? Tesla, I think, everyone can pretty much wrap their heads around just the fact that we've seen declining sales. The fact that margins have been under pressure. But why don't you see Apple turning it around anytime soon?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Well, the fact is that that's a fully penetrated market. I mean, obviously, we're depending on services now. And they are doing very well in services.\n\nBut they have to justify that market cap, they don't seem to have a large pipeline of new products coming through. And we're not suggesting for a moment that Apple is a bad business. It's just not growing, and it does not justify its valuation given its growth profile. One just has to accept that if they invest in Apple, they're going to get based on the current valuation and growth profile quite Meager returns.\n\nBRAD SMITH: What's going to unlock the next supercycle? Just to follow up on that, Steven.\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: Supercycle for, which company?\n\nBRAD SMITH: For Apple. We often talk about an iPhone supercycle, whether or not generative AI is part of the smartphone or the handset is actually going to propel. A wave of new people to go trade in, trade up, and get whatever the new iPhone is. What from your perspective can drive it?\n\nSTEVEN GLASS: That's unlikely. Because actually at the moment, the AI is happening in the cloud rather than at the edge. So it's not really a device, a personal device-driven market.\n\nAnd even if that was to happen, I mean, it's very well penetrated. So we're just swapping a current user for a new user. So then you've got to ask yourself, OK, can they expand their margins on the iPhone? Well, no.\n\nCan they grow more sales potentially? But then they've got the problems on the App Store. They rarely do in our view need to come out with a new product to justify their current valuation. They need some new growth vector.\n\nAnd we don't think it's going to be the headset. So it's based on what we can see right now. We can't see where that new growth vector is going to come from.\n\nAnd in actual fact, we actually think the App Store is at threat from this new-- from we see the regulation around the world, we see it in Europe, we've seen some in the US. And maybe it'll be more difficult for them to take their 30% cut on all app sales going forward.\n\nSEANA SMITH: Nancy, one of the names that we have not mentioned yet is Meta. And I bring that up given the outperformance that we saw last year. Given the fact that the stock is up just about nearly 190% over the past year.\n\nThey declared their first dividend last quarter on the earnings report. Obviously, lots of excitement there. Why isn't that one of your top names?\n\nNANCY TENGLER: Yeah, well, we did own it, Seana. We owned it for many years. And we got out kind of in the high 300.\n\nAnd then we missed this last run. But we instead owned a name like Spotify in its place. And that's done extremely well also.\n\nI love the dividend. I think that there is an opportunity for Google potentially to announce a dividend. I mean, they certainly have enough free cash flow.\n\nBut I think Meta, for me, it's at this point, I'd rather jump into NVIDIA than into Meta because I think the model is not nearly as robust as NVIDIA's model is. And I would just point out that I think one of the things that's going to put a floor under all these stocks are share buybacks.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven have announced about $190 billion in share buybacks. As the stock sell off, that the companies are going to step in and put a floor under it for investors.\n\nSo I think you can't go wrong owning any of them in my view. But I think our favorite right at this point is Amazon.\n\nSEANA SMITH: All right, Nancy and Steven, great to get your insight here, especially on names that we know so many of our viewers want to own, would like to own, or closely follow here when it comes to some of the trends that we're seeing in the broader market. Thanks so much. Have a great weekend.",

Strong momentum for the equity combined with strong financial growth suggests that Nvidia can surpass both of them within a few years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock has become a fan favorite in part due to its 214% over the past year. Shares have gained an even more impressive 1,733% over the past five years. Artificial intelligence has been a key growth driver that helped the company achieve 206% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24.\n\nNvidia also experienced meaningful growth in its gaming and professional visualization segments. Even the company’s automotive segment experienced year-over-year revenue growth although it didn’t contribute much to the company’s blockbuster quarter.\n\nIt’s nice to know that Nvidia has several business segments, and some of them are growing quickly. However, the main story for Nvidia is artificial intelligence. Investors don’t know when the AI boom will slow down, but as long as it stays strong, Nvidia stock should continue to surge.\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nCredit and debit cards have become economic staples. Many people prefer to pay with one of these cards to get rewards for every dollar they spend. The rewards add up, and a plastic card leaves more room in your wallet.\n\nStory continues\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is a global technology company in the payments industry that has a large market share in credit and debit cards. Mastercard and Visa (NYSE:V) are deeply ingrained within the industry. Families that use one of the issuer’s cards will recommend that card to their children, enabling cards to go from generation to generation.\n\nThis multigenerational advantage also comes with growing financials and healthy profit margins. Mastercard reported 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 11% year-over-year net income growth in the fourth quarter of 2023. The fintech firm regularly posts net profit margins above 40%.\n\nMastercard initiates many buybacks to increase value for shareholders and distributes dividends each quarter. The firm spent $9.0 billion on stock repurchases and $534 million in dividends in 2023.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) wins people’s attention and knows how to optimize ad placements. This dynamic combination results in many businesses rushing to get their ads listed for important keywords. Once businesses use Google Ads and see good results, they continue to use these ads which means steady cash flow for Alphabet.\n\nThat formula has worked for quite a while, including in the most recent quarter. Alphabet closed out 2023 with 13% year-over-year revenue growth and 51.5% year-over-year net income growth.\n\nWhile Alphabet makes most of its revenue from advertisements, the company also has a profitable Cloud segment. Google Cloud is one of the top choices to store data and keep it safe from hackers.\n\nAlphabet is also primed to capitalize on the artificial intelligence boom. The company is using the technology to improve its search engines and cloud platform. These innovations can help Alphabet retain its market share and strengthen its financials.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA and GOOG.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Watch From the Prospering Computer Industry",
        "content": "The Zacks Computer - Mini Computers industry is benefiting from steady demand for enterprise devices, including laptops, tablets and smartphones. Industry participants like Apple AAPL, HP HPQ and 3D Systems DDD are benefiting from these trends. The improving availability of 5G-enabled smartphones has been a key catalyst for the industry participants. The launch of foldable and AI and ML-infused smartphones, tablets, wearables and hearables is another major growth driver for the industry participants. Robust demand for production printers, materials and software bodes well for 3-D printing solution providers. However, waning demand for consumer PCs and geopolitical challenges, including raging inflation and high interest, are major headwinds.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry comprises companies that offer smartphones, desktops, laptops, printers, wearables and 3-D printers. Such devices are based either on iOS, MacOS, iPadOS, WatchOS, Microsoft Windows, or Google Chrome and Android operating systems. The companies predominantly use processors from Apple, Intel, AMD, Qualcomm, NVIDIA and Samsung. Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors. Laptops, both consumer and commercial, benefit from faster processors, sleek designs and expanded storage facilities. The addition of healthcare features has been driving the demand for wearables.\n\n3 Mini Computer Industry Trends to Watch\n\nEnterprise Adoption Remains Healthy: Strong enterprise demand has been benefiting the industry participants. The growing adoption of a hybrid working environment bodes well for the players, as demand for laptops and tablets is expected to increase. Demand for smart devices that offer facial recognition, retina scans or finger impressions to verify the user for biometrics is gaining traction as enterprises enhance security.\r\n\r\nImpressive Form Factor Drives Demand: Expanding screen size, better display and enhanced storage capabilities have been the key catalysts driving the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. This has been well-supported by faster mobile processors from the likes of Qualcomm, NVIDIA, Apple and Samsung. Improved Internet penetration and speed, along with the evolution of mobile apps, have made smartphones indispensable for consumers. Improved graphics quality is making smartphones suitable for playing sophisticated games. This is driving the demand for high-end smartphones and opening up significant opportunities for device makers.\r\n\r\nPCs Face Extinction Risk: Personal computers (desktops and laptops), be it Windows or Apple’s MacOS-based ones, have been facing the risk of extinction due to the rapid proliferation of smartphones and tablets. Stiff competition from smartphones has compelled global PC makers to not only upgrade hardware frequently but also add apps and cloud-based services to attract consumers. Nevertheless, the emergence of 5G, AI, machine learning and foldable computers is likely to be the key catalysts in expanding the total addressable market of PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Bright Prospects\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry is housed within the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector. It carries a Zacks Industry Rank #104, which places it in the top 41% of more than 250 Zacks industries.\r\n\r\nThe group’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates bright near-term prospects. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than two to one.\r\n\r\nThe industry’s position in the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries is a result of a positive earnings outlook for the constituent companies in aggregate. Looking at the aggregate earnings estimate revisions, it appears that analysts are optimistic about this group’s earnings growth potential. Since Oct 31, 2023, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for this industry’s 2024 earnings has moved up 0.5%.\r\n\r\nGiven the bullish outlook, there are a few stocks worth watching in the sector. But before we present those stocks that you may want to consider for your portfolio, let’s take a look at the industry’s recent stock-market performance and valuation picture.\n\nIndustry Lags Sector and S&P 500\n\nThe Zacks Computer – Mini Computers industry has underperformed the broader Zacks Computer and Technology sector as well as the S&P 500 index over the past year.\r\n\r\nThe industry has gained 22.8% over this period compared with the S&P 500’s return of 27% and the broader sector’s rise of 50.9%.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month P/E, which is a commonly used multiple for valuing computer stocks, we see that the industry is currently trading at 26.61X compared with the S&P 500’s 21.02X and the sector’s 26.72X.\r\n\r\nOver the last five years, the industry has traded as high as 32.32X and as low as 13.92X, with the median being 24.64X, as the chart below shows.\n\nForward 12-Month Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio\n\n3 Computer Stocks to Watch Right Now\n\nApple: This Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is benefiting from a steady demand for iPhone devices, as well as an expanding footprint in emerging markets.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here. \r\n\r\nA growing subscriber base and improving customer engagement are tailwinds for the services business. Apple currently has more than 1 billion paid subscribers across its Services portfolio. The App Store continues to draw the attention of prominent developers worldwide, helping it offer appealing new apps that drive the App Store’s traffic. A growing number of AI-infused apps will attract subscribers to the App Store.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has decreased by 0.6% to $6.56 per share over the past 30 days. The stock has declined 4.2% in the year-to-date period.\n\nPrice and Consensus: AAPL\n\nHP: This Zacks Rank #3 company’s sustained focus on launching the latest and innovative products is likely to help it stay afloat in the current uncertain macroeconomic environment.\r\n\r\nProduct innovation and differentiations are the key drivers that have helped HPQ maintain its leading position in the PC and printer markets.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has been steady at $3.45 per share over the past 30 days. HP shares have declined 3.8% year to date.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HPQ\n\n3D Systems: This Zacks Rank #3 company expects the dental market to stabilize amid the high inventory level in the supply chain and weakness in consumer discretionary spending.\r\n\r\n3D System expects a slower recovery in 2024 than its earlier expectation. Dental sales are expected to benefit from the continuing migration of orthodontic solutions from metal brackets and wires to clear aligners in the long run. Improved asset management and resource utilization are anticipated to reduce its total inventory significantly in 2024.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has increased by a penny to 8 cents per share over the past 30 days. The stock has declined 21.9% in the year-to-date period.\n\nPrice and Consensus: DDD\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Navigating PayPal's Decline",
        "content": "Financial services conglomerate PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains in the shadow of its former glory. After peaking at record highs of $310 a share at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2021, the stock has come tumbling down.\n\nThe company has seen its market value fall by 80% over the past three years, compared to a 16% gain for the S&P 500. The payment technology company's stock fell 22% last year, underperforming the overall financial services sector, which benefited from an uptick in interest rates.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Signs with PYPL. Navigating PayPal's Decline\n\nNavigating market shifts and intense competition in the post-pandemic era\n\nThe underperformance can be attributed, among other things, to investors reacting to underwhelming margins in recent quarters. Eroding market share in the high-value core branded checkout business has also significantly dragged margins and stock sentiments into the market.\n\nPayPal was one of the beneficiaries as millions of people locked down at the height of the pandemic rushed online to do shopping. The coronavirus-driven shift to online shopping and digital transactions drove record payment volumes, adding about 50 million active users in 2021.\n\nLikewise, the company registered its strongest-ever annual performance in 2020 as it processed over 900 billion in payments. That is no longer the case, as an end to pandemic restrictions has seen a significant shift in consumer shopping patterns. Traffic to brick-and-mortar stores has rebounded, translating to reduced payments that people make on e-commerce platforms through the company's offerings.\n\nAdditionally, the company's unbranded businesses, led by payment processing, have remained resilient. However, the same cannot be said about branded businesses led by Venmo that face intense competition from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), among others. A shift in the company's payment volume into lower-margin channels is also a serious concern.\n\nWhile PayPal remains a leader in digital payments, its long-term outlook remains threatened as tech juggernauts look to encroach on its niche market. Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) are the two tech heavyweights that threaten to disrupt the company's fortunes on mobile payments, which continues to send jitters throughout the investment community.\n\nStory continues\n\nSolid earnings, but disappointing guidance\n\nFollowing the past year's underperformance, CEO Alex Chriss has set outlined a strategic plan to make the company leaner as one of the ways to fuel profitable growth. Nevertheless, he has warned that it could take some time before some of the initiatives bear fruit and move the needle, as depicted by the company's flat growth forecast on adjusted profit for the current year.\n\nEven though the company delivered solid fourth-quarter results, the stock fell by almost 10% as the market reacted to 2024 guidance. The full-year outlook further underlined the problems the fintech giant faces even as it strives to chart a new path.\n\nRevenue increased 9% to $8 billion for the quarter, beating consensus estimates of $7.33 billion. The increase came as the company recorded a 15% increase in total payment volume, which peaked at $409.80 billion. Navigating PayPal's Decline\n\nSource: PayPal\n\nThe bottom line came in better than expected at $1.48 a share, representing a 19% year-over-year increase and was better than consensus estimates of $1.27. Even though the company delivered earnings growth in the fourth quarter, it is no longer growing at the high rates it did at the height of the pandemic.\n\nNevertheless, a 2% decline in active accounts to 426 million underlines weakness in the underlying business as PayPal faces stiff competition on digital payments. It marked the fourth consecutive quarter of account losses for the company, signaling the impact of other digital payment services.\n\nGrowth is mainly fueled by the unbranded business units that handle transactions with merchants that come with low profit margins. While the total payment volume in unbranded business units grew by 30% year over year, the company generated less earnings.\n\nThe branded segment is the bread and butter of the entire business, as fees range between 2.49% and 3.49%. The low payment costs at stake also translate to high margins. The higher rates generated by the branded business units are reasonable as they generate additional revenue for the same business. According to Craig Maurer of Financial Technology Partners, PayPal needs to generate about $10 of unbranded checkout volume to generate the same margin dollar as $1 volume with branded payments. Navigating PayPal's Decline\n\nSource: PayPal\n\nAdditionally, Venmo boasts a robust network of more than 35 million merchants. The platform, which allows people to send and receive money through peer-to-peer technology, has started allowing users to hold money in their accounts. The decision is expected to positively impact the total payment volume that the service handles, which has been increasing since 2017.\n\nThe increase can be attributed to Venmo allowing people to send money online for free. The service has since become a hit with people who do not carry cash, like students and teens. The service makes money through a 2.90% transaction fee for businesses and a 1% fee for users who want to withdraw money installed into a linked card. Navigating PayPal's Decline\n\nSource: Statista\n\nNevertheless, a shift in growth drivers to less lucrative operations could put more pressure on the company's operating margin. During the earnings call, PayPal told analysts it expects flat transaction margin dollars in 2024 relative to last year.\n\nIf profit margins are to improve, PayPal will have to earn more whenever customers click on its branded services, such as the Venmo button, to make payments. The branded checkout payment volume was up by 6.50% in the fourth quarter. Compared to the unbranded business unit, the much-subdued growth can be attributed to stiff competition from offerings by Apple Pay, Google Pay, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nFurther indication that a decline in business accounts is a concern is the company's disappointing full-year guidance. The guidance has overshadowed the market-beating earnings, signaling the company might have to tweak its operations to bounce to high growth levels.\n\nStreamlining operations and embracing AI for a competitive edge\n\nLike any innovative fintech company, PayPal is already looking to address the issues that have triggered a significant contraction in its operating margins. It is also trying to address its competitive threat as tech giants push for market share in the lucrative digital payments landscape.\n\nThe new management seeks to turn the company into a leaner entity pursuing profitable growth. The plan is already underway, with the company announcing plans to cut about 2,500 jobs, or 9% of its global workforce, as part of a plan that targets up to $900 million in cost savings that should significantly impact its operating margin. Navigating PayPal's Decline\n\nThe results of the restructuring are already visible, with the operating income margin in the fourth quarter improving to 23.30%. If inflation continues to drop, consumer spending is expected to improve, increasing the total payment volume it handles and boosting income margins.\n\nThe layoffs come as the company seeks to focus more on efficiency and deploy automation. The digital technology company is also consolidating its technology as it looks to reduce complexity and duplication, which should reduce its labor force costs and strengthen profit margins. Amidst the cut, the company will continue to invest in areas likely to create and accelerate growth.\n\nConsequently, the digital payment company has affirmed its push into artificial intelligence as it looks to unveil new products and solutions capable of enhancing efficiency and competitive edge. One of the new AI-powered features the company is launching will help ensure a faster checkout experience. It is also making it possible for customers to enjoy AI-powered merchant recommendations.\n\nIn addition to the AI push, regulatory winds are blowing in favor of PayPal. Amid regulatory pressure, Apple has agreed to open the tap-to-pay functionality to third parties. The move opens the door for PayPal to be one of the tap-to-pay applications on iOS devices.\n\nConsequently, the company is working on a new consumer app to exploit the new EU regulation. Integrating PayPal services into Apple Wallet should translate into big business for the company in terms of payments and transactions through iOS devices.\n\nOffloading BNPL loans to KKR to boost cash reserves and shareholder returns\n\nPayPal is also aggressively offloading its credit risk as it looks to free up more cash that can be used to return cash to shareholders. The signing of a deal with private equity firm KKR (NYSE:KKR) to purchase up to $43 billion of the buy-now-pay-later loans (BNPL) in Europe is part of the strategic plan to bolster cash reserves.\n\nBNPL was a hit at the height of the pandemic as it allowed the payment giant to attract millennial and gen Z consumers to its platform. Nevertheless, their fortunes have turned sour in recent years, especially with rising interest rates and runaway inflation dampening customers' purchasing power.\n\nThe closing of the BNPL deal with KKR is expected to free up close to $1 billion, which PayPal will redirect to share buybacks. In addition, given the uncertainty about whether customers will clear the loans, the KKR deal removes an element of risk from its books.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhile PayPal has underperformed over the past year, going by the 22% slide, it is not necessarily on the wrong track. Total payment volume, a key metric in the payment sector, is growing at an impressive double-digit rate, which underlines the company's core business that is growing at a solid pace. In addition, the company continues to deliver operating income margin improvements, signaling its cost-cutting initiatives are bearing fruit.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

The communications sector remained the saving grace for the Nasdaq and investors, with communication stocks adding 4.4% during the month, and being the index’s best-performing sector alongside financials which gained 3.1%.\n\nElsewhere, the Wall Street Journal reported that the Dow Jones Industrial Average started the year on somewhat rocky territory, but the index quickly made up near the end of the first trading month of the year. On January 22, the index advanced 0.4% adding 138 points, and ended above 38000 for the first time.\n\nOverall, Wall Street continues to ride on this momentum, taking leaps and bounds, and hoping to keep the fire burning for longer despite economic headwinds and several sore spots that could leave the market bruised and investors out in the cold.\n\nAnalysts are ready to jump back into the market, pulling together some of the most rewarding stock picks investors should add to their portfolios before the market begins to advance full steam ahead.\n\nApple\n\nThere’s a lot that can be said about Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), however, the company remains a market leader mostly due to the popularity of its products, including the iPhone and Mac computers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company has gained a massive market share in recent years due to the advancement of technology and the widespread availability of its products, there’s still a lot of steam left in the company.\n\nFor starters, Apple has generated a lot of attention surrounding their Apple ecosystem, which sees consumers using mostly Apple devices, including phones, computers, headsets and earphones, smart watches, and even banking.\n\nThe company continues to elevate the user experience with cutting-edge software and user interface, while simultaneously looking to churn out record-setting profits for most of its business segments, including services, which recently hit record profits.\n\nThe company posted its first quarterly earnings for the fiscal year 2024 at the beginning of February. In total, the company posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, an increase of 2 percent year over year. Elsewhere, quarterly earnings per diluted share was up 16% year over year, ending the quarter at $2.18.\n\nApple's services, including iTunes, AppleCare, Apple Pay, and licensing, hit a record of $23.12 billion for Q1 2024. The digital content and software segment continues to witness positive growth on the back of customer demand and advancements in software capabilities in a highly competitive market.\n\nLast year, AAPL shares gained nearly 25 percent throughout the 12 months, and during the first few trading weeks of 2024, shares were already up by 2 percent. There’s one thing, if not many, that Apply continues to do right, and that’s retaining customers, boasting customer loyalty, and providing a rounded service, including their product line-ups.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices\n\n2024 will be yet another massive year for artificial intelligence (AI), with companies such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) looking to spearhead the industry and gain traction in the race towards innovation.\n\nConsumer demand coupled with industry competition always brings out the most competitive side of any company, and this has perhaps worked mostly in AMD’s favor last year.\n\nThe company ended 2023 on a high note following its Q4 2023 earnings results. The company posted $6.2 billion in revenue, with a gross margin of 47%. Total operating income and net income were $342 million and $667 million, respectively for the reported period.\n\nEarnings per share were slightly below expectations, although that depends on who you might ask, with EPS for Q4 2023 ending at $0.42 per share.\n\nNow, looking at the full-year performance, there’s a lot to be excited about. Total reported revenue for the full fiscal year of 2023 ended at $22.7 billion, with the gross margin standing at 46%. On a non-GAAP basis, earnings per share was roughly $2.65, while gross margin was around 50%.\n\nAMD is witnessing staggering support from large-scale customers, something which is helping their bottom-line performance. Most of their business segments, including data services such as data centers, clients, gaming, and embedded technology have reported a positive year of growth.\n\nElsewhere, the company is hoping to further invest in the advancement of its artificial intelligence segment and has already gone to partner with major players such as Microsoft in recent months to deliver high-end AI-powered hardware engines. The company expects to report Q1 2024 revenue of roughly $5.4 billion and a non-GAAP profit margin of approximately 52 percent.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) isn’t taking the backseat anytime soon, and neither are they planning to back down from other major contenders such as Nvidia (NVDA); Amazon (AMZN), or Google (GOOG).\n\nThe company continues to generate substantial profit from its line of consumer and commercial products, however, they’re seemingly far past those early days of doing business by selling computer software.\n\nLike their contenders, Microsoft is now in the business of AI. The company has both the resources and know-how to develop some of the most advanced and highly sophisticated AI-powered tools and software - and that’s exactly what they’re doing.\n\nThe company continues to pursue innovations in the artificial technology front, with AI-powered Bing and Microsoft 365 Copilot being their most coveted headlines last year. Not only this, but the partnership with ChatGPT creators, OpenAI has given them another edge above their competitors.\n\nOther segments such as cloud computing, which falls under Microsoft's dynamic products and services segment are witnessing a strong performance, with the company reporting a revenue increase of 21%, while Dynamics 365 revenue growth increased 27 %.\n\nYet, this success hasn’t come without shedding some fat. Last year the company announced layoffs for its HoloLens and GitHub teams, among others. This has enabled the company to rather focus its attention and resources on service and product segments that are more driven towards AI-powered capabilities.\n\nOn the financial side, Microsoft reported Q2 2024 revenue of $62 billion, an increase of roughly 18 percent and up 16 percent in constant currency. Business segments such as Office commercial products and Office consumer products grew 15% and 5%, respectively.\n\nInvestors who managed to scoop up MSFT shares during the company’s post-pandemic slump saw stocks skyrocket by roughly 55% last year. On a year-to-date basis, MSFT is up close to 12%, with many analysts expecting shares to continue on this pace in the remainder of the year.\n\nSnowflake\n\nThen there’s Snowflake (SNOW) a cloud and data company that integrates third-party applications to help companies make better sense of their data. Just as the case may be with AI, data is perhaps the second-best powerhouse for investors this year, and there are many reasons why investors can get excited about the data-driven future.\n\nFor starters, experts suggest that roughly 90 percent of all data currently available were generated in the last two to three years. This only shows that there is seemingly endless opportunity for companies such as Snowflake.\n\nWhat’s more, Snowflake currently has around 9,000 commercial and corporate customers. This is only a drop in the ocean considering that there are close to more than 300 million businesses worldwide.\n\nThe limit to which Snowflake can expand is perhaps unknown, at least for now. Yet, investors aren’t sleeping on Snowflake. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK) holds more than $1.2 billion worth of SNOW stocks as of last year. Outside of Berkshire's portfolio, Buffet owns a staggering 6.12 million SNOW shares.\n\nWhen you begin to follow the money, you understand why the Oman of Omaha is dead set on holding as many SNOW shares as possible for the remaining future. For the third quarter of the fiscal 2024 financial year, the company reported product revenue of $698 million, translating into 34 percent year-over-year growth.\n\nOutside of technology, the company reported a net revenue retention rate of 135% and continues to hold its performance obligations of $3.7 billion, representing a total 23% year-over-year growth.\n\nSNOW shares have close to double their value over the last 12 months, with stock performance up 15.39% year to date. Analysts are positive that the company could be bringing a new set of eyes to the stock market in the coming months due to soaring performance and the long-term positive turnaround SNOW can provide investors.\n\nFinal Thoughts\n\nLooking around, there are countless new opportunities for investors to take advantage of the new bull market, and getting a head start is better than holding out until stock prices come down. While the market continues to remain volatile due to economic headwinds, and Wall Street uncertain of when the Federal Reserve will begin loosening its monetary policy in the coming months, investors are instead riding out the momentum of the current bull market, keeping their losses at a minimum and exposing their portfolios to high-yielding winners.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n20 Fastest Growing Biotech Companies in the US 16 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 10 New Picks\n\nDisclaimer: Not investment advice, speak to an investment professional before making decisions.\n\nDisclosure: No positions in any securities mentioned",

        "title": "2 Top Buffett Stocks to Buy and Hold for the Long Haul",
        "content": "Many are drawn to Warren Buffett's investing style because it makes sense to the average investor. Adopting his philosophy can lead to extraordinary results if executed well and with patience. What does he advocate? Berkshire Hathaway's CEO has a propensity to invest in companies with competitive advantages over their rivals.\n\nBuffett also likes to buy stocks for Berkshire when the stocks are trading for less than their intrinsic value. Still, it's a company's competitive advantages that ensure it will be around for decades, compounding the investment's value.\n\nIf you want to invest like Buffett, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and American Express(NYSE: AXP) would be two good stocks to buy and hold long-term. Here's what Buffett likes about these two companies, and why they should grow for a long time in Berkshire's portfolio of stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nBuffett has said Apple was better than any business Berkshire owns. The qualities he likes about Apple are its powerful brand and the attachment people have to their iPhones.\n\nApple is investing a lot of money in technology, especially artificial intelligence (AI), but Buffett sees it as a strong consumer brand more than anything else. The company rakes in $385 billion a year in revenue, with around half that coming from iPhone sales.\n\nThere haven't been any significant changes to the iPhone, the iPad, or Mac computers in years, but Apple continues to generate a fairly stable base of revenue across its product portfolio. The company's installed base of active devices hit a new all-time high of more than 2.2 billion in the most recent quarter.\n\nApple's large customer base provides it with enormous profits that the company can invest in developing new products, such as its recently launched Vision Pro \"spacial computing\" headset, not to mention AI-powered features to make its products better and keep customers on a continuous upgrade path. Apple's $100 billion in annual profits, in combination with its high 58% return on invested capital, point to more returns for shareholders in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. American Express\n\nAmerican Express is one of the longest-held positions in Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio. While the stock underperformed the broader market over the last 10 years, it has slightly outperformed the S&P 500 index over the last five. A big reason for that is the company's resilient business model.\n\nThe average Amex cardholder tends to spend more than the users of rival credit card brands. It's for this reason that merchants are willing to accept it and pay its higher transaction fees. The company invests some of the revenue from those fees into the premium rewards and services it provides to its cardholders -- offerings that help insulate the business from its competitors.\n\nDespite sluggish consumer discretionary spending last year, American Express earned $8.3 billion in profit on $60 billion of revenue net of interest expense in 2023. Its revenue rose 14% on a constant-currency basis. Those were impressive results for a 173-year-old company, and they were consistent with management's long-term goal to grow revenue by 10% or more per year and earnings per share at a mid-teens percentage.\n\nAmerican Express is an old company but it's seeing strong growth from millennials and Gen Zers. This is a good indicator that the brand is stronger than ever and should remain a rewarding investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Last week marked one of the most important days of the first quarter for the investing community. Feb. 14 was the deadline for institutional investors with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).\n\nPut simply, a 13F provides professional and everyday investors alike with an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest and most successful money managers bought and sold in the latest quarter (in this instance, the quarter ended Dec. 31, 2023). Despite their drawbacks, 13Fs can clue investors in to the stocks, industries, and trends that Wall Street's top money managers are focused on. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nThough many 13Fs are filed with the SEC in a matter of days, no 13F tends to be more anticipated than that of Warren Buffett with Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B). That's because the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has delivered north of a 4,800,000% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) since he took over as CEO in the mid-1960s. Clearly, he's doing something right, and people are eager to follow in his footsteps by mirroring his investments.\n\nBased on Berkshire's latest 13F, Warren Buffett and his team entered 2024 overseeing 45 stocks in their roughly $371 billion portfolio. Mind you, I'm excluding the two index funds owned by Berkshire Hathaway -- the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF and SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust -- because index funds represent baskets of securities and aren't themselves stocks.\n\nHere's a detailed breakdown of Buffett's investment portfolio for Berkshire Hathaway entering 2024.\n\nWarren Buffett's core investments\n\nIf there's a defining characteristic of Berkshire Hathaway's investment portfolio, it's that it's heavily concentrated in a few top investment ideas. Both Buffett and the late, great Charlie Munger long believed that diversification is only necessary if you don't know what you're doing. A nearly 20% annualized return for Berkshire's stock over close to six decades suggests the Oracle of Omaha knows a thing or two about investing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe following eight core investments comprised more than 84% of Berkshire's $370.6 billion of invested assets, as of the closing bell on Feb. 16, 2024:\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $167,564,822,400 in market value Bank of America: $35,209,924,885 American Express(NYSE: AXP): $32,226,370,392 Coca-Cola(NYSE: KO): $23,756,000,000 Chevron(NYSE: CVX): $18,989,654,896 Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY): $15,010,057,107 Kraft Heinz: $11,335,348,015 Moody's: $9,146,566,891\n\nIf there's one common theme among Warren Buffett's core investments, it's strong brand recognition. Tech stock Apple, which accounts for more than 45% of Berkshire's invested assets, is consistently the most valuable brand in surveys and is the leader in U.S. smartphone market share. Meanwhile, Kantar's annual \"Brand Footprint\" report notes that Coca-Cola has been the most chosen brand by consumers every year for a decade (as of 2022). Familiar brands with sustained competitive advantages tend to produce predictable operating results -- and that's something Buffett absolutely loves.\n\nMany of these core investments are also longtime holdings. Coca-Cola, American Express, and Moody's have been continuous holdings in Berkshire's portfolio since 1988, 1991, and 2000, respectively. Buffett and his investing aides understand that the U.S. and global economy tend to grow over long periods, and have positioned their company's portfolio to take advantage of this expansion. Companies like American Express should enjoy higher fee collection and interest income from lending, as well as higher fee revenue from merchants, as transactional volume increases over time.\n\nInterestingly, Buffett's core investment thesis also involves energy stocks. Energy has never been a huge focus for the Oracle of Omaha or his team, but Chevron and Occidental Petroleum currently combine for about $34 billion of invested assets. This is a crystal-clear indication that Berkshire's brightest minds expect the spot price for crude oil to remain elevated.\n\nAlthough Chevron is a highly diversified integrated energy company, and therefore isn't as sensitive to spot-price movements in crude oil, Occidental's revenue stream is highly skewed toward drilling. A higher spot price for crude would definitely help the latter far more.\n\nThe other billion-dollar bets at Berkshire Hathaway\n\nAlthough the aforementioned eight core investments make up more than 84% of Berkshire Hathaway's close to $371 billion investment portfolio, there are still 20 additional holdings that tally at least $1 billion in market value (as of Feb. 16):\n\nMitsubishi: $7,271,277,217 Itochu: $5,222,432,191 Mitsui: $5,215,608,560 DaVita: $4,411,600,565 Citigroup(NYSE: C): $3,030,177,115 VeriSign: $2,489,304,669 Kroger: $2,382,000,000 Sumitomo: $2,372,187,302 Visa(NYSE: V): $2,311,340,458 Marubeni: $2,266,233,990 BYD: $2,134,256,139 Mastercard(NYSE: MA): $1,866,269,528 Capital One Financial: $1,711,399,447 Amazon: $1,695,000,000 Liberty Sirius XM Series C: $1,455,469,155 Snowflake: $1,410,735,347 Aon: $1,276,084,000 Charter Communications: $1,121,879,713 Nu Holdings: $1,109,750,602 Ally Financial: $1,043,420,000\n\nThe big theme of this mid-tier group of holdings which could, in theory, grow into core holdings for Buffett and his team, is valuation. The Oracle of Omaha is a stickler for a good deal, and this group of companies (mostly) demonstrates that.\n\nFor instance, the five Japanese trading houses Buffett and his team have been piling into (Mitsubishi, Itochu, Mitsui, Sumitomo, and Marubeni) trade at single-digit price-to-earnings multiples. If a broad-reaching business sustains its competitive advantages, trades at a single-digit earnings multiple, and offers a market-topping dividend yield, there's a good chance it's going to intrigue Warren Buffett.\n\nYou'll also note that Berkshire's top investment minds gravitate to financial stocks. Sizable bets have been placed on industry leaders like Visa, Mastercard, and Citigroup. The reason financial stocks are well-liked by Buffett is because they're cyclical. In other words, they ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nAs an example, Visa and Mastercard are the respective No. 1 and No. 2 in credit card network purchase volume in the United States. Meanwhile, Citigroup is one of the largest banks by total assets. If the U.S. economy continues to expand over time, fee collection from merchants should climb for Visa and Mastercard, while interest income can power Citigroup higher. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Oracle of Omaha's smaller holdings\n\nLast but not least, there are 17 holdings in Warren Buffett's approximately $371 billion portfolio that range in market value from a low of $8.6 million to as much as $840.9 million:\n\nT-Mobile: $840,869,220 Paramount Global(NASDAQ: PARA): $823,192,383 Liberty Sirius XM Series A: $717,186,367 HP(NYSE: HPQ): $653,130,595 Liberty Formula One Series C: $534,239,160 Floor & Décor Holdings: $530,293,200 Louisiana-Pacific: $482,858,063 Liberty Live Series C: $418,362,732 Sirius XM Holdings(NASDAQ: SIRI): $191,959,387 Liberty Live Series A: $181,414,375 NVR: $181,414,375 Lennar Class B: $82,124,903 Diageo: $33,456,475 Jefferies Financial Group: $17,827,905 Liberty Latin America Series A: $17,494,767 Atlanta Braves Holdings Series C: $8,979,347 Liberty Latin America Series C: $8,628,614\n\nThis bottom rung of the ladder in Berkshire's portfolio is typically reserved for smaller investments made by Buffett's top \"lieutenants,\" Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, as well as companies that may be falling out of favor.\n\nFor example, Buffett and his team sold a substantial percentage of their respective stakes in HP and Paramount Global during the fourth quarter. The recovery in personal-computing sales is taking longer than anticipated for HP. Meanwhile, Paramount Global is mired under a mountain of debt and contending with weaker ad sales and increased streaming competition.\n\nWhen Berkshire's top investors decide that it's time for a holding to get the heave-ho, they aren't shy about it. Don't be surprised if HP and/or Paramount Global aren't holdings for much longer.\n\nHowever, these smaller holdings in Berkshire's investment portfolio can still be gems. Satellite-radio operator Sirius XM Holdings is a perfect example. It's a legal monopoly that enjoys exceptionally strong pricing power with its subscribers. Since it generates more than three-quarters of its revenue from subscriptions, it's better positioned to navigate normal downturns in the U.S. economy than traditional radio operators that are heavily reliant on advertising for the bulk of their revenue.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen.

Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Xiaomi 14 Ultra hits the shelves amid cutthroat competition in the high-end smartphone segment following Huawei's return to the scene with its 5G-capable Mate 60 Pro handset, launched in late 2023.\n\nXiaomi has been promoting its camera and photography features as selling points following a partnership with Leica in 2022, after the German camera maker ended its seven-year deal with Huawei.\n\nXiaomi president Lu Weibing described the Xiaomi 14 Ultra as \"a new flagship in mobile imaging\" with upgraded photography kits, including a main camera with a large one-inch sensor and a variable aperture.\n\nThe new handset is powered by Qualcomm's Snapdragon 8 Gen 3 chipset and is equipped with Xiaomi's proprietary HyperOS operating system.\n\nOther new products launched this week include a new tablet, the 6s Pro 12.4, the laptop Redmi Book Pro 2024 and Remi Monitor G Pro 27.\n\nLei Jun, the co-founder and CEO of Xiaomi, said in late 2021 that the company aimed to become the world's biggest smartphone maker in three years by exceeding Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Xiaomi has kept its third place globally for smartphone sales for 14 quarters in a row, behind Apple and Samsung. According to IDC data, China's mobile shipments in 2023 dropped 5 per cent from a year ago to 271 million units, the lowest in over a decade, although a recovery is expected in the coming year.\n\nLei wrote in a social media post this week that Xiaomi's smart factory in Beijing has completed construction and is capable of producing over 10 million phones per year.\n\nXiaomi's stock price closed 1.34 per cent lower at HK$13.22 in Hong Kong on Friday.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 23, 2024 – Zacks Market Edge is a podcast hosted weekly by Zacks Stock Strategist Tracey Ryniec. Every week, Tracey will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds and ETFs and how it impacts your life. To listen to the podcast, click here:  https://www.zacks.com/stock/news/2230305/how-to-start-stock-investing-in-your-50s\n\nHow to Start Stock Investing in Your 50s\n\nWelcome to Episode #391 of the Zacks Market Edge Podcast.\n\n(0:45) - Can You Start Investing In Your 50’s? (10:45) - Where Should You Be Investing For The Long Term? (32:10) -  Episode Roundup: AAPL, COST, LLY, HLT, WSM Podcast@zacks.com\n\nEvery week, host and Zacks stock strategist, Tracey Ryniec, will be joined by guests to discuss the hottest investing topics in stocks, bonds, and ETFs and how it impacts your life.\n\nThis week, Tracey is going solo to discuss how you can start investing, for the first time, in your 50s. She does not address retirement investing but this would be a side account, simply for investing. There’s a lot of talk about how to get started in your 20s and 30s but what about in your 50s?\n\nFirst Step: Have a Plan\n\nAll investors, no matter their age, should have a plan. What is the goal for this money? Why are you saving, and investing, it?\n\nIt could be a 5-year plan to save for a dream vacation. It could be an account to fund a boat in retirement. It could be because you simply always want to buy some stocks but just never started, outside of your retirement accounts.\n\nA plan will keep you heading towards your goals, even if things get rocky.\n\nIs It Too Late in Your 50s?\n\nMany people think that it’s too late to buy stocks in your 50s yet nearly all of the examples of top investors that have been featured on this podcast over the last 8 years had started investing later in life.\n\nRemember Boston Pops clarinetist Edward Avedisian who donated $100 million to Boston University in 2022?\n\nStory continues\n\nHe didn’t start investing in stocks until his 40s. He bought tech IPOs in the 1980s and 1990s and held them, including companies like Microsoft. When he died in 2022 at age 85, he had an investing portfolio worth $125 million.\n\nAnother top investor was Anne Scheiber who invested $5,000 in stocks when she was 51. She bought and held brand name companies, including drug companies, for the next 50 years. When she died in 1995, she donated $22 million to Yeshiva University.\n\nHow Do You Decide on What Stocks to Buy?\n\nOnce you set up a brokerage account, you need to fund it and then actually buy some stocks. Investors can buy ETFs, which provide a basket of stocks, or individual companies.\n\nTracey discusses two ETFs in the podcast that could help you get started. However, many investors like buying individual stocks.\n\nBut how do you decide what stocks to buy?\n\nBuy-What-You-Know Method\n\nTracey likes the Peter Lynch method of “buy what you know.” Peter Lynch, the famed Fidelity Magellan portfolio manager from the 1980s and 1990s, liked to buy companies whose products he was familiar with and used. He always had a caveat that investors should always research companies before buying the stock.\n\nDid you just buy new living room furniture and loved the selection at West Elm? Are you a big fan of Costco and have been a member for year? Are you a loyalty member at Hilton hotels and love their resorts in Mexico?\n\nDoes everyone in your family own Apple products, including the new Apple Vision Pro virtual reality headset? Have you been keeping up with the news on weight-loss drugs and think the drug companies, like Eli Lilly, are going to make a ton of money?\n\nThis is “buy what you know.” Start with an idea and then do the research.\n\n5 Buy-What-You-Know Stocks in 2024\n\n1. Apple Inc. AAPL\n\nApple has a dedicated fan base which buys the new products, no matter what they are. It recently launched the Apple Vision Pro, a new virtual reality headset. Will it be the next big thing to power Apple’s earnings higher?\n\nShares of Apple have fallen 5.3% year-to-date but it remains an expensive stock on a forward P/E level. It trades at 27.7x. Apple pays a dividend, yielding 0.5%.\n\nShould Apple be on your short list?\n\n2. Costco Wholesale Corp. COST\n\nCostco has been a top retailer for years, with consumers loving the brand in both the United States and Mexico. Shares are up 9.5% year-to-date and have hit new all-time highs.\n\nCostco is not a cheap stock, on a P/E basis. It has a forward P/E of 46. Investors will get a dividend, however, currently yielding 0.6%.\n\nShould Costco be on your short list?\n\n3. Williams-Sonoma, Inc. WSM\n\nWilliams-Sonoma is a furniture and home accessory retailer with powerhouse brands like West Elm, Pottery Barn and Williams-Sonoma. Shares of Williams-Sonoma are up 9% year-to-date.\n\nBut Williams-Sonoma is still attractively priced, with a forward P/E of 15.2. It’s also shareholder friendly and pays a dividend, yielding 1.6%.\n\nShould Williams-Sonoma be on your short list?\n\n4. Eli Lilly & Co. LLY\n\nEli Lilly shares are hitting new all-time highs in 2024 on the rollout of weight loss drugs. Shares are up 28% year-to-date.\n\nEli Lilly’s earnings growth is incredible. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is calling for earnings growth of 96% this year. Eli Lilly pays a dividend, currently yielding 0.7%.\n\nShould Eli Lilly be on your short list?\n\n5. Hilton Worldwide HLT\n\nHilton is a global leisure and hospitality company. It’s been making a push into the all-inclusive market in Mexico and the Caribbean in recent years. Shares are up 9.3% year-to-date as consumers are still looking for experiences.\n\nWhile earnings are expected to rise 12.7% in 2024, the shares aren’t cheap with a forward P/E of 28. Hilton does pay a dividend, but it’s yielding just 0.3%.\n\nShould Hilton be on your short list?\n\nWhat Else do you Need to Know About Buying Stocks in Your 50s?\n\nTune into this week’s podcast to find out.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "Apple has hit out at music streaming giant Spotify over its long-running competition complaint filed with the EU, which could reportedly soon see Apple facing a huge fine.\n\nFollowing reports the EU has concluded its investigation into Spotify’s claims of anti-competitive behaviour by Apple over its App Store rules – and is ready to issue a 500 million euro fine – the iPhone maker has accused the music firm of trying to get “limitless” access to Apple’s tools without paying for any of it.\n\nSpotify filed a complaint with the EU in 2019, claiming that Apple’s App Store rules limit choice and competition because it charges a 30% fee on purchases made through the store – including music streaming subscriptions – which Spotify claims is an unfair “tax”, and that Apple’s own competing Apple Music streaming service is not subject to the same fees, giving it an unfair advantage.\n\nThe Swedish music giant has also argued that Apple’s rules do not allow it to tell users about cheaper ways to subscribe outside of the App Store.\n\nAccording to reports earlier this week, the European Commission is close to concluding its investigation and Apple was said to be facing a 500 million euro fine.\n\nIn a statement issued on Thursday night in response to the reports, the US tech giant said Spotify did not offer subscriptions via the App Store and therefore did not pay Apple any commission in the EU.\n\n“We’re happy to support the success of all developers — including Spotify, which is the largest music streaming app in the world,” Apple said.\n\n“Spotify pays Apple nothing for the services that have helped them build, update and share their app with Apple users in 160 countries spanning the globe.\n\n“Fundamentally, their complaint is about trying to get limitless access to all of Apple’s tools without paying anything for the value Apple provides.”\n\nThe iPhone maker said Spotify had the option to directly link to their website for account creation and management, but chose not to use it, and that despite its claims of competition concerns and not allowing it to tell users how to subscribe, had grown into the largest digital music business in the world with more than 50% market share in Europe.\n\nStory continues The iPhone maker also criticised EU regulators (PA)\n\nThe US company also argued that Spotify and other music streaming services had many open channels, including email marketing and social media, to advertise to consumers and show them how to sign up outside of the App Store.\n\nApple also criticised EU regulators, claiming that despite being examined in different forms on this issue for around 10 years, the European Commission had failed to find any evidence of consumer harm or anti-competitive behaviour by the firm in this market.\n\nThe iPhone maker said the investigation could just cement Spotify’s dominant position as the market leader, rather than promote competition.\n\nAt the time it filed its complaint in 2019, Spotify founder Daniel Ek wrote in a blog post that Apple had “introduced rules to the app store that purposely limit choice and stifle innovation”.\n\nHe said the company was “essentially acting as both a player and referee to deliberately disadvantage other app developers”.\n\n“They continue to give themselves an unfair advantage at every turn,” he wrote.\n\n“Apple requires that Spotify and other digital services pay a 30% tax on purchases made through Apple’s payment system, including upgrading from our free to our premium service.\n\n“If we pay this tax, it would force us to artificially inflate the price of our premium membership well above the price of Apple Music. And to keep our price competitive for our customers, that isn’t something we can do.”\n\nHe also accused Apple of applying “a series of technical and experience-limiting restrictions” on Spotify when it chose not to use Apple’s payment system, including he claimed blocking some app updates at times.",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) launches its first sports app offering updates to real-time scores and stats. Yahoo Finance Reporters Josh Schafer, Brooke DiPalma, and Pras Subramanian discuss the content prospects for this app amid recent sports bundling trends among streaming providers.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: And today, we are starting off with a new app from Apple-- the Apple Sports app. This is an attempt from Apple to probably drive more users to their streaming service. We know Apple's gotten into streaming sports, namely the MLS, right? And they've also got into documentaries that involve sports.\n\nThere's a Patriots documentary that recently came out. So they're sort of getting more involved in the sports space. You can see the app here on your screen. One of the key features of it, really, is just live scores. It has live scores.\n\nWhen you click on Upcoming Games, you can see the standings. There's some gambling lines that go on there. Honestly, Pas, it seems like a pretty surface-level app right now, the app that's just launched, but it doesn't quite have some of the features from some of my favorite sports apps.\n\nI'm thinking of maybe ESPN where you click and there's news that comes up with the app and other videos that come up with the app and sort of more content that it brings you. I favorited my favorite team here, the Boston Bruins. They've played in the NHL.\n\nAnd it just isn't really giving me a lot on the Bruins was sort of my service-level takeaway. Again, the app just launched. Maybe there'll be more sort of features to come with it.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yeah. I mean, it's like almost an alpha stage right now, right? Because basically, you can either add leagues, which the NFL is not part of. Like, you notice the NFL is not part of it for some reason. I guess because the season's over.\n\nStory continues\n\nOr you can add your favorite teams. And then just the scores or upcoming games come up, you can't click in, you can't get any news. There's no video component yet. But I think you're right.\n\nMaybe it's a way to drive users to maybe the Apple TV app, where it has a pretty cool way-- I have it and it has a pretty cool way of notifying you when certain games are close or how to watch them and stuff. So, maybe that integration is coming later. But right now, I think the Yahoo Sports app is better, right? I think the-- I think ESPN app is better for both scores and kind of like maybe some video, too.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Yes. I mean, the old Google to see how your team's doing just isn't the thing anymore. All of that.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: You get an app. There's always an app for that, right, Brooke?\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: I do that. But I truly do think that app, this has been a long time coming, as Apple really try to make their mark in the sports arena. I mean, we saw them do the halftime show with Usher. Now they've had the halftime show for quite a few years.\n\nIt formerly was PepsiCo. It just goes to show that Apple is really doubling down trying to get in the space. Of course, Tim Cook is super excited about this, tweeting that he can't wait to use it during the 2024 MLS season, which kicks off tonight, right?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Mm-hmm.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Or last night?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Sure.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Between Inter Miami CF and Real Salt Lake on Apple TV. So it really just trying to see returns from this MLS partnership that they did. Don't know if they're quite seeing the returns that they had initially hoped for.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yeah, it seems like at the surface right now, the best use case is for the MLS, right? Because that's where Apple has the content. One of my favorite things about, say, the ESPN app is that ESPN has so many sports rights.\n\nSo when you click on a game, you're able to watch the game inside that app and it sort of creates more content for you inside the app, and with push notifications, too, as Pras mentioned. So I think it'll be interesting to see sort of where it goes for Apple as they get deeper into sports, maybe even get more sports rights, how they're able to leverage the app.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: I think sports right will be a game changer for this Apple TV. In addition to that, they're also getting-- these stats are supplied by DraftKings, right?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Mm-hmm.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: So in that case, you know, where does that partnership evolve to? And how do they work together to ultimately grow this?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: All about the betting lines always, Brooke.\n\nBROOKE DIPALMA: Always about the betting lines.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: And Tim Cook noted Auburn fan, right? I think alum, too. So maybe that's-- he is a sports guy, so we'll see.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Go Tigers.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Go Tigers, yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: That applies to like half of the colleges in the country.\n\nPRAS SUBRAMANIAN: Yes.",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nAfter NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) posted another monster quarter, a jubilant Jim Cramer praised the company's CEO Jensen Huang and went on to \"grade\" the Magnificent Seven stocks based on their earnings performance in a latest program on CNBC. Cramer said he wanted to see which stocks in the Mag. 7 group deserve the praise and a role in the \"trillion dollar chase\" and which companies \"might be pretenders.\"\n\nCramer called NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) CEO Huang the \"Taylor Swift\" of business and a \"long-term visionary.\"\n\nJim Cramer \"Grades\" Magnificent Seven Stocks After Earnings\n\nJim Cramer also praised Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and said there was a time when the market was starting to think Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s growth might be slowing down but the company did an excellent job by spending money to improve its delivery service. Cramer also said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s advertising business is \"on fire\" and AWS is back to double digit growth.\n\nJim Cramer is also bullish on Meta Platforms and said he thinks WhatsApp has a $100 billion valuation.\n\nRegarding Microsoft, Cramer said you don’t have to \"worry about this one\" as he thinks Microsoft's Cloud business is \"smoking hot.\"\n\nJim Cramer's thoughts on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) are mixed in the short-term as he believes China \"remains an issue.\" However, Cramer is bullish on Apple Vision Pro and also likes strong iPhone sales. Jim Cramer repeated his \"own it don’t trade it\" mantra for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nJim Cramer is in a wait-and-see mode on Alphabet because he was disappointed with the company's advertising business. Cramer said while Meta and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) thrived in their ads business, Alphabet failed to impress, and the fact that YouTube and Search business of Alphabet are based on ads business worries him.\n\nStory continues\n\nLastly, Tesla is the weakest company in the Mag. 7 group of stocks according to Jim Cramer as the CNBC host yet again pitched Eli Lilly as its replacement in the group.\n\nHowever, Cramer said that a single quarter should not make or break a stock and he believes in long-term approach in investing. Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 10 Latest Stock Picks\n\nMethodology For this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. We have also mentioned hedge fund sentiment for these stocks. Why? Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\n10. MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 9\n\nA questioner recently asked Jim Cramer about his thoughts on midstream energy infrastructure company MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX). Cramer said \"I like it very much.\" Cramer said he was telling some \"colleagues\" recently that \"these master limited partnership pipelines are very good.\"\n\nCramer said that MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) is \"like a fixed income bond.\"\n\nInsider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds shows that just nine hedge funds had stakes in MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX).\n\nLast month MPLX LP (NYSE:MPLX) posted fourth quarter results. GAAP EPS in the period came in at $1.10 beating estimates by $0.17. Revenue in the period jumped 11.7% year over year to $2.97 billion, surpassing estimates by $120 million.\n\n9. Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 31\n\nFintech company known for buy now pay later solutions Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) is one of the top Jim Cramer stock picks as of February 2024. Cramer recently said in a program that \"you've got a winner with Affirm.\"\n\nCramer said that Levchin (Max Levchin, the founder of Affirm) is \"constantly underrated.\" He said that people don’t understand that the \"guy has got passion.\" Cramer said that \"they keep thinking\" Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) is going to \"bust\" but \"they are wrong.\"\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 31 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM). The biggest stakeholder of Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) during this period was D. E. Shaw which had a $461 million stake in Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM).\n\n8. Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 48\n\nZscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) is one of the stocks Jim Cramer recently recommended investors to buy in 2024. Answering a question about Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS), Cramer praised Zscaler's Zero Trust security platform and said the stock is a \"good one\" to buy. Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) shares are down by about 11% over the past one month and Jim Cramer believes this dip is an opportunity to buy the stock.\n\nLike Zscaler, Cramer also loves Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and  NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 48 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS). The most notable stakeholder of Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS) was D E Shaw which had a $268 million stake in Zscaler Inc (NASDAQ:ZS).\n\nArtisan Mid Cap Fund made the following comment about Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Notable trims in the quarter included Zscaler, Inc. (NASDAQ:ZS), BioNTech and Ingersoll Rand. Zscaler provides cloud-based Internet security solutions. In the quarter, it announced solid financial results including 43% revenue growth and 38% growth in billings, which were both ahead of expectations. We believe the dual trends of rising security vulnerability and increased enterprise digitization will lead to sustained demand, even in a recession. Cybersecurity remains a top concern for businesses and governments as cyberattacks can have devastating financial and reputational consequences. Meanwhile, managing the security needs of legacy on-premise applications, a growing number of cloud-based applications (e.g., Office 365 and Salesforce) and more remote workers than before the pandemic make operating IT infrastructures increasingly complex. The stock has been a top performer this year, and we decided to trim the position based on valuation considerations.”\n\n7. General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 49\n\nA caller asked Jim Cramer about his thoughts on General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) during his program on CNBC. Cramer recommended the investor to \"stick with\" the stock and said:\n\n\"Oh, I love that CEO.\"\n\nCramer said that General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) is not expensive. He also said \"problems overseas\" (a reference to the geopolitical situation) are expected to bode well for the stock.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 49 hedge funds out of the 933 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD). The biggest stakeholder of General Dynamics Corp (NYSE:GD) during this period was James A. Star's Longview Asset Management with a $7.3 billion stake.\n\n6. Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 70\n\nJim Cramer was not impressed with Home Depot Inc's (NYSE:HD) numbers for the fourth quarter where comp. sales fell 3.5% during the period (still better than a 3.6% expected decline) and sales per retail square foot dropped 3.6% to $550.50.  But Cramer recommended investors to hold on to Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) and wait for the turnaround which he believes is around the corner.\n\n“Sure, the quarter wasn’t great, but the conference call commentary I found encouraging, which is why I’m willing to be patient and hold on to Home Depot. Remember, you can’t wait for the actual turn, you have to get in ahead of time or you’ll miss the move.”\n\nJim Cramer also thinks Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD) shares can gain in the future on the back of the \"spring planting season, which is like Christmas for any retailer with a gardening business.\"\n\nIn addition to Home Depot Inc (NYSE:HD), Jim Cramer is also bullish on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nClearBridge Sustainability Leaders Strategy made the following comment about The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Home Depot, Inc. (NYSE:HD) has long been a leader in advancing sustainable forestry, and its wood products can have a significant impact, as timber rates at the top of high-risk commodities responsible for most agriculture-related deforestation (Exhibit 3). The home improvement retailer adopted its first wood purchasing policy in 1999, pledging to give preference to sustainably sourced wood and to eliminate wood purchases from endangered regions around the world.\n\nBiodiversity-boosting efforts at Home Depot have included tracing the origin of all the wood products it sells. This forms part of the process of verifying sustainable production, which it does using the certification standards of the Forest Stewardship Council (FSC). Since 2000 Home Depot has developed programs to purchase FSC wood products, such as doors, boards and patio furniture, from over 60 global suppliers. It has also moved more than 90% of its cedar purchases to second-and third-growth forests, with the rest coming from areas with local community stakeholder review.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer's 2024 Portfolio: 5 Latest Stock Picks.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "In this article, we will discuss the 25 fastest growing economies in the last 50 years. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to 5 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years.\n\n50 Years of Global Growth: An Analysis\n\nIn the last 50 years, the world has witnessed technological miracles. In July 1969, America's Apollo 11 was the first spacecraft to carry humans to the moon. America has always been a key driver to economic growth with its top tech companies at the center of technological advancements. American companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) entered the market with their new products in the late 1970s, rocking the tech sector. Later, more tech companies followed such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). Back in the 1970s, the medical, automobile, and oil sectors were on the rise with companies including Merck & Co., Inc. (NYSE:MRK), Ford Motor Company (NYSE:F), Mercedes Benz Group AG (ETR:MBG) and Saudi Arabian Oil Company (TADAWUL:2222), among others, driving growth.\n\nPost World War 2, the global reserve currency came into being. In 1944 at the Bretton Woods Conference, the US Dollar (USD) was agreed to be the global reserve currency accepted by forty-four countries at the time. This resulted in the creation of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the World Bank. After more than half a century of global dominance, the US dollar faces various threats such as the emergence of the BRICS economy. On February 12, FXStreet reported that according to the economists at Scotiabank, the USD has appreciated around 28% over the past 10 years and it may be difficult for the USD to experience additional gains in the medium or longer run. Whereas, some experts also believe that the USD will not lose its status anytime soon. On February 15, Reuters reported that Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller said that the increased use of digital assets like stablecoins, which are pegged to the USD, could potentially lead to an improvement in the USD’s international profile. Waller further added:\n\nStory continues\n\n“I do not expect to see the U.S. dollar lose its status as the world's reserve currency anytime soon, nor even see a significant decline in its primacy in trade and finance.”\n\nIn 1972, exactly 50 years ago, the world’s current GDP stood at $3.84 trillion, as per the World Bank. The United States led the global economy back then, with a GDP (PPP) of $1.28 trillion in 1970. USSR, Germany, Japan, France, and the United Kingdom followed the US as the other leading economies in 1970. In 2024, the US, China, Germany, Japan, and India are the top five largest economies in the world.\n\nIn the last 50 years, Asia and Africa have been two of the fastest growing regions and continue to grow at a rapid rate compared to the rest of the world. According to the Asian Development Bank, Asia now holds one-third of the global GDP compared to only 12% of the global GDP in the early 1960s. According to the IMF, global growth is projected at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025. While, Asia’s growth is expected to be 4.5% in 2024 and 4.3% in 2025. Africa’s growth is expected to average at 3.8% in 2024 and 4.2% in 2025, as per the African Development Bank Group. Both Asia and Africa’s projected growth rates for 2024 and 2025 are higher than projected global averages. China and India will be the leading economies in Asia, while South Africa and Nigeria will be major economic drivers in Africa.\n\nBiggest Tech Companies of the Last 50 Years\n\nOver the last 50 years, several companies have contributed to the global economy and invented new products and services. We cannot talk about all the companies in this one article so we will stick with the top tech companies including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). These three tech giants are also the most valuable companies in history.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the pioneer of Macintosh. The company’s most successful invention was the iPhone which revolutionized the smartphone industry. In the last 10 years, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has continuously made it to the top 5 of the Fortune 500 companies list, excluding 2013 when it was ranked sixth. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported earnings for the fiscal first quarter of 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $2.18, beating consensus estimates by $0.08. The revenue was reported at $119.58 billion and surpassed estimates by $1.31 billion.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) made a breakthrough invention of Windows software and later launched more top-notch software such as Microsoft 365. On January 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its earnings for the second quarter of 2024. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing the estimates by $0.16. The revenue was reported at $62.02 billion and beat estimates by $888.18 million. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) cloud segment is experiencing rapid growth with the applications of AI. Here are some of the comments from the company’s Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.”\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns the famous internet search engine, Google, and multiple software. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has been a key player in driving the internet economy, connecting the world through its search engine and other online platforms. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is now one of the leaders in Generative AI and is working on various aspects of the technology. On February 15, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) launched Gemini 1.5 with the ability of new enhanced performance. Since the launch of Gemini 1.0, the company has been testing and refining the capabilities of its AI software. The Gemini 1.5 is more efficient to train and serve with a new Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture.\n\nWith this context, let’s take a look at the fastest growing economies in the last 50 years. 25 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years\n\n25 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 25 fastest growing economies in the last 50 years, we gathered countries' real GDP growth rates from 1972 to 2022 from the World Bank database. Real GDP growth rates of countries over the last 50 years were averaged and then sorted in ascending order to rank the top 25 fastest growing economies with the highest growth in the last 50 years. We have excluded countries whose data was not available for at least 40 years. There was an exception for some countries, such as Qatar and Vietnam, whose data was available for less than 40 years on the World Bank database. In that case, we consulted the IMF database for such countries. We have included economies such as Qatar and Vietnam because they are some of the biggest economies in the world and are growing at a rapid rate. We cross-checked the World Bank database with the IMF database to make sure we did not miss any countries. We have also mentioned the GDP (PPP) of countries, as of 2024. The data for GDP (PPP) is taken from the IMF database.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or a professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nNote: The IMF database had a limitation as the data was only available for the last 42 years. That’s why we went with the World Bank data.\n\n25 Fastest Growing Economies in the Last 50 Years\n\n25.

        "title": "Nvidia stock surges after earnings beat estimates across the board",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) reported its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, beating analysts' expectations on the top and bottom lines.\n\nFor the quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.16 on revenue of $22.1 billion. Analysts were expecting EPS of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion. That's a massive jump from the same period last quarter when Nvidia reported EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. To put a finer point on Nvidia's performance, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nThe company also guided higher than analysts' expectations for the first quarter, saying it anticipates revenue of $24 billion, plus or minus 2%. Wall Street was expecting $21.9 billion for the quarter.\n\n“Accelerated computing and generative AI have hit the tipping point. Demand is surging worldwide across companies, industries and nations,” Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said in a statement.\n\nShares of Nvidia were up more than 15% in Thursday trading following the report.\n\n“Our Data Center platform is powered by increasingly diverse drivers — demand for data processing, training, and inference from large cloud-service providers and GPU-specialized ones, as well as from enterprise software and consumer internet companies. Vertical industries — led by auto, financial services and healthcare — are now at a multibillion-dollar level,\" Huang said in the statement.\n\nDespite the across-the-board beat, Nvidia did have at least one negative comment in its report, with CFO Colette Kress warning that data center revenue out of China fell \"significantly\" in Q4 due to US licensing requirements. The US has blacklisted the sale of certain Nvidia chips to China on fears that they could be used for military applications.\n\nNvidia's all-important Data Center business, which includes sales of its high-powered GPUs for AI applications, saw revenue of $18.4 billion, beating analysts' expectations of $17.2 billion. The company reported revenue of $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Overall, Nvidia's Data Center revenue jumped 217% for the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Nvidia's Data Center segment is driving the ship, its gaming business is still an important piece of the company. Revenue for the division topped out at $2.9 billion. Investors were expecting revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nNvidia's stock price has skyrocketed more than 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), thanks to its position as the world's leading AI chipmaker.\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, faces challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nAnd that could prove especially problematic as the company said more than half of its Data Center revenue in Q4 came from large cloud providers for internal workloads and external customers.\n\nBut Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "7 Terrific Tech Stocks to Buy Instead of the Magnificent 7",
        "content": "The Magnificent 7 stocks – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) – have been the darlings of Wall Street for the past few years. And for good reason – they have dominated their markets and delivered outstanding returns for investors. However, their meteoric rise has pushed their valuations into the stratosphere. As an investor, I believe it’s prudent to take some chips off the table and redeploy that capital into other promising tech stocks that have not yet received their time in the spotlight.\n\nI will highlight seven terrific tech stocks that have been executing at a high level, but have mostly flown under the radar on Wall Street. Many of these stocks have the potential to generate triple-digit returns over the coming years. The best part? Most of these stocks can still be scooped up at reasonable valuations before the herd catches on. Let’s take a look!\n\nPriority Technology (PRTH) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a payments technology company, Priority Technology (NASDAQ:PRTH) is well-positioned to benefit from the inevitable rebound in lending and borrowing once interest rates are cut. The entire fintech space remains depressed from the post-pandemic cooldown, but companies like PRTH that partner with banks or facilitate lending have huge upside when activity picks back up.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPriority is already seeing promising progress on the financial front. Revenue grew 14% year-over-year in Q3 to $189 million, and the company is getting close to breakeven profitability. While any profits right now may not be sustained, analysts expect Priority to hit its stride in 2025 with solid earnings growth. Importantly, the company’s balance sheet is healthy enough to fund losses until profitability scales.\n\nYes, Priority’s hefty debt load of $623 million is a concern with rising rates. But as rates inevitably fall, payments on this debt will decrease considerably, leading to much stronger profitability and a higher stock price. I’m bullish on Priority Technology’s ability to thrive as fintech rebounds. The company has an excellent payment platform and lending exposure to capitalize on renewed borrowing activity.\n\nStory continues\n\nFutu Holdings (FUTU) An iPhone screen displaying the Futu Holdings logo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider/Shutterstock\n\nFutu Holdings (NASDAQ:FUTU) has performed remarkably well as a digitalized brokerage platform, despite the recent market downturn. While the financial industry is still reeling from the post-pandemic hangover, companies like Futu will bounce back strongly once headwinds clear.\n\nCase in point – Futu achieved a stunning 36% dollarized revenue growth in Q3 to $338 million, with net margins of 46%. The company continues growing its user base rapidly, even amid weakness in the Chinese market. Investors are returning in droves, with the S&P 500 hitting new highs and the Nasdaq poised to follow. When the Chinese market finally wakes up, I expect Futu’s growth to accelerate tremendously.\n\nThe stock has traded sideways for more than three years after its parabolic surge. But this consolidation sets the stage for an upside breakout as market sentiment improves. Futu has proven its resilience and ability to rapidly monetize its user base. Once China stimulates its economy, the company should see user growth re-ignite.\n\nIn short, the company is firmly profitable, with margins expanding, and its growth story is far from over. Futu still has substantial room for international growth, and the ability to cross-selling financial products beyond stock trading. I’m bullish on this long-term compounder.\n\nRELX (RELX) A businesswoman looks at a floating interface screen full of data.\n\nSource: metamorworks/Shutterstock\n\nRELX (NYSE:RELX), a global analytics company, is firing on all cylinders with double-digit sales growth. The stock has surged 42% over the past year as fundamentals accelerated, but I think the company still has room to run as a premium quality business.\n\nSpecifically, RELX’s Exhibitions and Risk businesses have achieved stellar top-line growth of 32% and 8%, respectively, in the first nine months of 2023. Meanwhile, the company’s Scientific, Technical & Medical, and Legal divisions saw more modest but steady growth of 4%-6%.\n\nRELX’s Exhibitions and Risk units will likely drive near-term gains as RELX continues leveraging its unrivaled data assets. However, all four business lines have strong competitive positions that enable pricing power and reinvestment into new verticals.\n\nThe company’s valuation looks rich at first glance. But for a high-quality compounder like RELX, growth investors are wise to pay up. RELX consistently delivers organic growth with 19%-plus net margins and rising cash flows. As analytics adoption increases across industries, RELX has an open runway for expansion.\n\nTechTarget (TTGT) hand using online banking and icon on tablet screen device in coffee shop\n\nSource: PopTika / Shutterstock\n\nTechTarget (NASDAQ:TTGT) operates an expansive network comprised of over 220 digital brands offering IT purchase intent data, research, and marketing services. Though shares currently sit around 70% off 2021 highs, the company’s recent combination with Informa’s digital business drastically expands TechTarget’s total addressable market by more than 10x.\n\nBeyond merger benefits, the company continues to execute well, with double-digit earnings and revenue growth pace expected again in 2024. Compared to richly-valued SaaS peers, TechTarget’s growth suggests upside from reasonable sub-20x earnings multiples. Pro forma estimates call for the combined entity to generate over $500 million in 2024 sales, expanding to exceed $1 billion in annual revenue within five years on 35%+ EBITDA margins. This consolidation also brings 50 million unique visitors.\n\nIf TechTarget can successfully harness merged assets to drive engagement with IT decision-makers, immense shareholder value could be unlocked, given the integral role purchase intent data plays in capturing trillion-dollar global IT spending.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nClaiming the #2 spot for U.S. dating app downloads behind Tinder in 2023, Bumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) faces near-term headwinds like slowing user growth and leadership changes. However, the company’s long-term growth story remains intact. Bumble ranked ahead of Hinge. And its financials are strong, with high gross margins and double-digit revenue growth.\n\nStill, Bumble must effectively manage costs and continue scaling its user base amid a competitive online dating market. Recent stock dilution also weighs on the company’s share price. However, I see a compelling bargain for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue growth should average around 12% annually this decade. More importantly, Bumble’s earnings per share are expected to grow ffom 27 cents in 2023 to more than $1.45 in 2028. I believe Bumble deserves a higher premium, with profitability inflecting higher as online dating becomes normalized.\n\nChallenges exist, but Bumble retains leadership in a secular growth industry. The path forward is clear – drive monetization and engagement through new features while optimizing marketing costs. I’m bullish on Bumble regaining momentum and delivering substantial upside from current depressed levels.\n\nOpera (OPRA)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nDelivering a unique web browser infused with messaging, crypto, and AI capabilities, Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) continues to gain share by targeting younger demographics—especially gamers. Last quarter, Opera beat guidance, with sales up 20% year-over-year to $103 million on surging profitability metrics. New Opera GX Cloud subscriptions also recently launched.\n\nDespite executing well into a $53 billion browser software market, the stock trades at a 58% discount to highs. It trades around 13-times forward earnings—presenting a compelling rebound opportunity as gamers plus smartphone users present adoption upside.\n\nBy integrating differentiated functionality like Twitch streaming and Discord messaging support, Opera’s ability to carve out enduring browser niche share seems continually underestimated to me. If conversion and monetization of its base exceeding 350 million users ramps successfully, material share price appreciation could follow over the long-term.\n\nQuickLogic (QUIK) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a small-cap semiconductor outfit developing embedded FPGA and edge AI solutions targeting high-potential markets like IoT and robotics, QuickLogic (NASDAQ:QUIK) finds itself strategically aligned with surging AI adoption trends. With earnings per share potentially tripling next year amid a nearly 100% revenue growth pace, the stock likely warrants a higher premium than the 36-times earnings multiple 2024 projections imply.\n\nQuickLogic’s strengths in facilitating optimized AI inferencing on power-constrained endpoints perfectly position the company to enable the proliferation of AI use cases where data privacy and real-time responsiveness prove critical—a vital need in automation. With shares up over 131% in the past year on rapid adoption traction, I believe this undercovered name still seems significantly underestimated by the Street.\n\nIf the relentless focus on expanding its embedded FPGA IP capabilities boosts QuickLogic’s design win pipeline as projected entering 2024, immense shareholder value could be created given the immense TAM pursuing low-power AI innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "If you’re looking for your stocks to outperform the S&P 500, one place where you ought to start is by assessing a company’s return on invested capital. ROIC stocks, according to a recent analysis by MarketWatch, care companies with high ROIC over the past 20 years.\n\nThese ROIC stocks have tended to outperform the index over the same period.\n\nFor example, the index’s average annual return over the past 20 years was 9.8%. The best performers over this period were Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Monster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST), up 37.1% and 36.7% annually. Not coincidentally, their 20-year average ROIC was 33.0% and 32.5%, respectively.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFor those unfamiliar, ROIC is defined as a company’s NOPAT (net operating profit after tax) divided by invested capital, which is the company’s debt and equity. The easiest way to calculate invested capital is to add net working capital (current assets less current liabilities), PP&E (property, plant, and equipment), and goodwill and intangibles.\n\nUsing Monster Beverage as an example, Morningstar.com’s ROIC number for the trailing 12 months is 21.3%, less than its five-year average of 25.1%, but still very high.\n\nMy task is to find three S&P 500 stocks with ROIC percentages higher than Monster.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) Plane travel. Man standing in airport waiting for flight. travel stocks to buy\n\nSource: Olena Yakobchuk / Shutterstock\n\nFirst up is Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), the online travel agency with an ROIC of 39.04%, more than double its five-year average. Its shares are up 53% over the past year and 94% over the past five years.\n\nOn Feb. 20, Seaport Research Partners analyst Aaron Kessler initiated coverage of the travel stock with a Buy rating and a $4,380 target price, about 18% above where it’s currently trading. As Barron’s pointed out, its stock performed 3x better than the index in 2023. BKNG is 165 basis points ahead of the index through Feb. 20.\n\n“Booking Holdings is also facing a ‘more difficult’ comparison from prior years, but ‘we are positive on the [company’s] fundamentals,’ Kessler said,” Barron’s reported.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe analyst projects bookings growth of 10% in 2024 and 9% in 2025. While those are well below the 24% growth in 2023, they’re still relatively healthy after two record years for travel.\n\nIts enterprise value is $130.1 billion, or 17.7x EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes). That’s less than half its five-year average. Its net debt is just $398 million, or 0.3% of its market cap.\n\nNVR (NVR) A photo of a person in a neon green vest holding blueprints and standing behind a white table covered with supplies like pencils, a computer, a ruler and two wooden house shapes.

Its shares are up 48% over the past year and 177% over the past five years.\n\nAre NVR shares cheap right now?\n\nThe company thinks so. On Feb. 14, NVR announced a $750 million share repurchase program with no expiration date. The buyback excludes purchases from company insiders and the Profit Sharing/401(k) Plan Trust or the Employee Stock Ownership Plan Trust. This provides shareholders with assurance that no favoritism is played in the process.\n\nThe company reported its Q4 2023 results at the end of January. It made $454.3 million in homebuilding income from $2.39 billion in revenue. Its mortgage banking unit’s income was $29.7 million. Unfortunately, while mortgage banking revenue was up year-over-year, its homebuilding revenues declined by 10.5% over Q4 2022.\n\nThe builder finished 2023 with 10,229 units sold but not settled, representing $4.76 billion in revenue once completed, with cancellation rates around 13%, lower than 14% in 2022 but higher than 9% in 2021. It’s a part of the industry.\n\nIts enterprise value is $21.5 billion, or 11.0x EBIT. That’s a fraction higher than its five-year average. At the end of December, its net cash was $2.1 billion, or 9% of its market cap.\n\nEOG Resources (EOG) Rise in gasoline prices concept with double exposure of digital screen with financial chart graphs and oil pumps on a field.

        "title": "Increases to CEO Compensation Might Be Put On Hold For Now at Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nApple to hold its Annual General Meeting on 28th of February CEO Tim Cook's total compensation includes salary of US$3.00m Total compensation is 458% above industry average Apple's EPS grew by 21% over the past three years  while total shareholder return over the past three years was 48%\n\nUnder the guidance of CEO Tim Cook, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has performed reasonably well recently. As shareholders go into the upcoming AGM on 28th of February, CEO compensation will probably not be their focus, but rather the steps management will take to continue the growth momentum. However, some shareholders will still be cautious of paying the CEO excessively.\n\nView our latest analysis for Apple\n\nComparing Apple Inc.'s CEO Compensation With The Industry\n\nAccording to our data, Apple Inc. has a market capitalization of US$2.8t, and paid its CEO total annual compensation worth US$63m over the year to September 2023. Notably, that's a decrease of 36% over the year before. While this analysis focuses on total compensation, it's worth acknowledging that the salary portion is lower, valued at US$3.0m.\n\nIn comparison with other companies in the American Tech industry with market capitalizations over US$8.0b, the reported median total CEO compensation was US$11m. Hence, we can conclude that Tim Cook is remunerated higher than the industry median. Moreover, Tim Cook also holds US$598m worth of Apple stock directly under their own name, which reveals to us that they have a significant personal stake in the company.\n\nComponent 2023 2022 Proportion (2023) Salary US$3.0m US$3.0m 5% Other US$60m US$96m 95% Total Compensation US$63m US$99m 100%\n\nOn an industry level, roughly 14% of total compensation represents salary and 86% is other remuneration. Apple has chosen to walk a path less trodden, opting to compensate its CEO with less of a traditional salary and more non-salary rewards over the last year. If total compensation is slanted towards non-salary benefits, it indicates that CEO pay is linked to company performance.\n\nStory continues ceo-compensation\n\nA Look at Apple Inc.'s Growth Numbers\n\nApple Inc.'s earnings per share (EPS) grew 21% per year over the last three years. Revenue was pretty flat on last year.\n\nThis demonstrates that the company has been improving recently and is good news for the shareholders. The lack of revenue growth isn't ideal, but it is the bottom line that counts most in business. Moving away from current form for a second, it could be important to check this free visual depiction of what analysts expect for the future.\n\nHas Apple Inc. Been A Good Investment?\n\nBoasting a total shareholder return of 48% over three years, Apple Inc. has done well by shareholders. As a result, some may believe the CEO should be paid more than is normal for companies of similar size.\n\nIn Summary...\n\nApple prefers rewarding its CEO through non-salary benefits. Given that the company's overall performance has been reasonable, the CEO remuneration policy might not be shareholders' central point of focus in the upcoming AGM. Still, not all shareholders might be in favor of a pay raise to the CEO, seeing that they are already being paid higher than the industry.\n\nWhile it is important to pay attention to CEO remuneration, investors should also consider other elements of the business. That's why we did some digging and identified 2 warning signs for Apple that investors should think about before committing capital to this stock.\n\nArguably, business quality is much more important than CEO compensation levels. So check out this freelist of interesting companies that have HIGH return on equity and low debt.\n\nHave feedback on this article? Concerned about the content?Get in touch with us directly.

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks Billionaires Are Selling, and the 1 They Can't Stop Buying",
        "content": "Since the beginning of 2023, investors have enjoyed a true running of the bulls on Wall Street. The iconic Dow Jones Industrial Average and broad-based S&P 500 galloped to fresh highs, while the growth-driven Nasdaq Composite ended the previous week a stone's throw from eclipsing its November 2021 record-closing high.\n\nWhile I'd love to tell you that this has been a broad-driven rally, the emergence of a new bull market is the result of outsized returns from the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm referring to some of the largest, most influential businesses on Wall Street:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese are seven innovation-driven businesses that offer an abundance of competitive advantages. Examples include Alphabet's virtual monopoly in internet search with Google; Microsoft's continued dominance with its Windows operating system; Tesla's position as North America's leading electric vehicle manufacturer; Amazon's dominant e-commerce marketplace; and Meta's top social media assets, which attract nearly 4 billion active users each month.\n\nWhile the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven isn't lost on Wall Street, its most successful money managers have very different outlooks on these top-tier stocks, as evidenced by the latest round of 13F filings. A 13F allows investors to see what Wall Street's brightest minds bought and sold in the latest quarter.\n\nBased on 13Fs for the December-ended quarter, three Magnificent Seven stocks were given the heave-ho by billionaire investors, while another was aggressively purchased.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 1 billionaires are selling: Meta Platforms\n\nThe first Magnificent Seven stock that was sent to the chopping block in the fourth quarter is social media giant Meta Platforms. A half-dozen billionaire money managers lightened their respective fund's stakes in the parent of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nStory continues\n\nJeff Yass of Susquehanna International (3,037,082 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,430,767 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (542,399 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (371,850 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (307,709 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (100,000 shares)\n\nThe most logical reason for billionaires to be wary of Meta is the likelihood of a U.S. recession taking shape in 2024. Meta generates almost 98% of its revenue from advertising on its social media platforms, and it's perfectly normal for advertisers to reduce their spending during periods of economic weakness. A recession would hurt Meta's sales and its ad-pricing power in the short run.\n\nThe other potential concern for billionaires might be Meta's valuation. Shares of the company have more than quintupled in value from their 2022 bear market low. Billionaires selling could represent simple profit-taking, or perhaps signal that top asset managers anticipate a short-term pullback in Meta stock.\n\nHowever, the interesting thing about Meta is that it's still historically cheap, even after its run-up. Shares of the company are valued at 12.6 times forecast cash flow in 2025, which represents a nearly 20% discount to its average price-to-cash-flow multiple over the trailing-five-year period. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 2 billionaires are selling: Alphabet\n\nA second Magnificent Seven stock that got the boot from billionaire asset managers in the December-ended quarter is Alphabet. The parent of internet search engine Google, streaming platform YouTube, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud saw seven billionaires sell its stock, including (total shares sold in parentheses for Alphabet's Class A shares, GOOGL):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (3,302,342 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (3,113,001 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,278,300 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (806,651 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (571,317 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (236,969 shares)\n\nSimilar to Meta, the exodus among billionaires from Alphabet may have to do with concerns about the health of the U.S. economy. A few money-based metrics and predictive indicators have been blaring warnings that U.S. economic activity could weaken. Alphabet brought in about 76% of its net sales in 2023 from advertising on Google search, Google Network, and YouTube.\n\nAnd just like Meta, the selling doesn't seem to make much sense. In addition to periods of growth disproportionately outlasting recessions, Alphabet's Google accounts for more than 91% of worldwide internet search share, as of January. In fact, you have to look back nearly nine years to find the last time a month went by where it didn't account for at least 90% of global internet search. Alphabet's ad-pricing power is practically unsurpassed.\n\nAlphabet also completed its first year of operating profitability from its high-margin cloud infrastructure services segment. Google Cloud has gobbled up a 10% share of global cloud infrastructure service spending and shouldn't have any trouble meaningfully increasing its cash flow in the years to come.\n\nMagnificent Seven stock No. 3 billionaires are selling: Nvidia\n\nThe third Magnificent Seven stock that had billionaires willingly pressing the sell button during the fourth quarter is the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia. All told, eight billionaires were sellers of the hottest megacap stock on Wall Street, including (total shares sold in parentheses):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (1,689,322 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,170,611 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (1,088,821 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (235,000 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (218,839 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (142,900 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (30,663 shares)\n\nOne of the prime reasons billionaire investors may have rushed for the exit is growing graphics processing unit (GPU) competition. Not only is Nvidia going to fend off increasing competition from external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, but many of Nvidia's top customers are developing their own AI chips, including Microsoft and Meta Platforms.\n\nThere's also a real possibility that Nvidia could cannibalize its own gross margin as it expands its production of A100 and H100 AI-GPU chips. A modest increase in cost of revenue compared to an 86% jump in sales through the first nine months of fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ended in late January) pretty clearly demonstrates how powerful Nvidia's pricing power has been. Once this GPU scarcity wanes, its gross margin is liable to decline.\n\nLastly, every next-big-trend over the past three decades has worked its way through an early-stage bubble. History suggests that investors will overestimate the uptake of AI, just as they have with every previous next-big-thing trend for 30 years.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock billionaire money managers can't stop buying: Amazon\n\nThere was, however, one Magnificent Seven stock that didn't have billionaires abandoning ship. During the December-ended quarter, eight billionaires gobbled up shares of e-commerce company Amazon, including (total shares purchased in parentheses):\n\nKen Griffin of Citadel Advisors (4,321,477 shares) Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies (4,296,466 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (947,440 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (888,369 shares) David Siegel and John Overdeck of Two Sigma Investments (726,854 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (462,179 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (85,532 shares)\n\nThe lure of Amazon for billionaires is that its business isn't as reliant on e-commerce as you might think. Although e-commerce accounts for a sizable percentage of Amazon's sales, online retail sales are low margin. If the U.S. economy were to stumble and online retail sales tapered off, it won't have much impact on Amazon's cash flow.\n\nBy comparison, the company generates the lion's share of its operating income from its cloud infrastructure services platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS was responsible for close to a third of global cloud infrastructure service spending in the third quarter of 2023. As long as AWS continues to grow by a double-digit percentage, Amazon's cash flow can motor substantially higher.\n\nDespite a huge rally in its share price, Amazon remains inexpensive, relative to its cash flow. The reason I'm using cash flow, as opposed to the traditional price-to-earnings ratio, is because Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business. After ending every year of the 2010s at a multiple of between 23 and 37 times its cash flow, Amazon shares can be picked up right now for a little over 12 times forecast cash flow in 2025.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best magic formula stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our coverage of what magic formula investing is all about, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now.\n\nConsidering the thousands of companies that trade on stock markets such as the NASDAQ and the NYSE as well as the plethora of information that investors are bombarded with every day, investing sometimes appears as nothing short of wizardry. For novices, terms such as relative strength indexes (RSIs), standard deviations of returns, beta, earnings per share, yields, and other metrics appear to be a new language that requires a detailed study before one can become comfortable with it.\n\nOne investor who literally describes his investment strategy as 'magic' is Joel Greenblatt. Mr. Greenblatt is the chief investment officer of the ominously named Gotham Asset Management. While his investment decisions focus mostly on making returns for investors rather than fighting crime, Mr. Greenblatt's approach has nevertheless won him more fame in financial markets than Bruce Wayne. He set up Gotham Asset Management in 2008, which makes the fund relatively younger when compared to some other funds that have been around for decades.\n\nHowever, before Gotham Asset Management, the Magic Formula investor was at the helm of the fund Gotham Capital. He set up Gotham Capital in 1985, and the fund successfully focused on investing in distressed or 'special situation' companies and stocks. These stocks are of firms that might be facing troubles in managing their debt, or they might be struggling in their markets due to choices made of their own accord or broader macroeconomic factors. Mr. Greenblatt's Gotham Capital was one of the top performing funds in its league back in the mid 80s and 90s as it delivered net 30% returns during the time periods.\n\nLike some other hedge fund and investing heavyweights like Warren Buffett of Berkshire Hathaway and Seth Klarman of Baupost Group, Mr. Greenblatt is also an adherent of one of Wall Street's best known investment approaches. If you haven't guessed it already, this approach is called Value Investing. Value investing simply analyzes a stock to compute what the investor believes is a fair value of the shares. This value is then compared to the market price of the stock, and if it's higher than the market price, then a potential investment decision is made. This investment decision is also influenced by the difference between fair and market values. The higher this difference is, the more comfortable an investor is buying the shares as it leaves a greater 'margin of safety' for non fundamental downward share price movements.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo where's the magic? Well, Mr. Greenblatt's flavor of value investing is called Magic Formula investing. This strategy is based on the two fundamental metrics of share price and stock valuation. These are the Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) and the earnings yield. For the uninitiated, the ROCE divides a firm's operating income by the sum of its working capital and net fixed assets. The logic behind this computation is that the ROCE measures the return to investors over the costs of doing business as measured by buying and selling inventory and spending on assets. The earnings yield of a stock is its earnings per share divided by the share price, and it enables investors to understand the true post expenses, tax, and interest ability of their investment to make money.\n\nIn Magic Formula investing, the ROCE and earnings yield of stocks are calculated first. They are then ranked according to these metrics, and the top shares are bought and held for the long term to benefit from a firm's ability to capitalize on its assets and cash to turn a profit and return for investors.\n\nSo what are some magic formula stocks that can deliver magical returns? We took a look today, and some top stock picks are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Snowflake Inc. (NYSE:SNOW). 11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now\n\nRommel Canlas/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best magic formula stocks to buy now, we scanned the Q4 2023 investment portfolio of Joel Greenblatt's Gotham Asset Management and picked out the top holdings in U.S. dollar terms.\n\nFor these best magic formula stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best Magic Formula Stocks to Buy Now\n\n11. Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors As Of Q4 2023 end: 117\n\nGotham Asset Management's Q4 2023 Stake: $22 million\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-A) is the famed investment management company of Warren Buffett that also has the honor of being the most expensive stock on the U.S. markets.

        "content": "This story was first published in the Benzinga India portal.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) subsidiary Google is poised to begin manufacturing its Pixel smartphones in India as soon as the next quarter, according to a report by Nikkei. This move signifies a strategic pivot for the tech behemoth to diversify its supply chain and penetrate the burgeoning Indian smartphone market.\n\nThe production line for the premium Pixel 8 Pro is set to be established in Southern India in the coming weeks. This will be followed by the Pixel 8 production in Northern India by mid-year. The tech giant is initially starting with limited production volumes.\n\nThis move comes as India's reputation as a smartphone manufacturing hub continues to grow. Tech forerunners such as Apple, Samsung, Oppo, and Xiaomi are extending their presence in the region.\n\nSee Also: PhonePe Launches Appstore To Challenge Google Play's Dominance In India: Here's Why\n\nThe shift is a significant change in strategy for Google, which had been relying on Vietnam for manufacturing amidst the escalating tensions between the U.S. and China.\n\nThe decision mirrors a larger industry trend towards a 'China+2' strategy. This approach seeks to establish multiple non-China production bases to ensure supply chain resilience. Google's foray into India follows up on the 2023 announcement regarding the release of its first India-manufactured Pixel phones.\n\nWith this venture, Google joins the ranks of Apple and Samsung in capitalizing on the vast Indian market. The Indian government's efforts to transform the country into a tech manufacturing powerhouse through incentives and potential import restrictions further attract companies like Google.\n\nSimilar actions are being taken by other tech giants like Apple, Acer, and ASUS, which are also escalating their production efforts in India.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Samuel Angor on Unsplash\n\nRead next: Amazon Enters India’s Fast Fashion Arena With ‘Bazaar’, Rivals Flipkart And Ajio On Alert\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nALPHABET (GOOGL): Free Stock Analysis Report ALPHABET (GOOG): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Google Follows Apple's Lead, Set To Begin Making Smartphones In This Asian Country originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI^) just got less antiquated.\n\nOn Tuesday S&P Dow Jones Indices announced Amazon (AMZN) will replace Walgreens Boost Alliance (WBA) in the benchmark index. The change is set to go into effect before the market opens on Monday, Feb. 26.\n\n\"The index needs to stay relevant and reflect the higher end of US markets, and Amazon was a natural selection,\" Howard Silverblatt, S&P Dow Jones Indices senior index analyst, told Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nHe added: \"For the average investor it will mean that the index is more reflective of consumer selections at this point in time.\"\n\nThe swap of tech giant Amazon for Walgreens adds exposure to a variety of areas for the index. Amazon's wide range of industries including cloud computing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and e-commerce far exceeds the reach of the traditional pharmacy brand in Walgreens. This, Silverblatt, was crucial in influencing the switch.\n\n\"[Amazon is] developing and giving you exposure to a few other fields,\" Silverblatt said. \"But mostly you’re dealing with the consumer, the retail sector, where the bulk of [Amazon] is right now. And that’s a positive because the consumer is the biggest part of the economy.\"\n\nSilverblatt highlighted that unlike the S&P 500 which rebalances every quarter, the Dow Jones doesn't reshuffle the 30 companies within its index frequently. In the 120 year history of the Dow, there have only been 60 changes, per Silverblatt.\n\nOne reason a company can be swapped out of the index is if its share price deteriorates and becomes less relevant to the overall index. Walgreens has seen that over the last several years with shares down nearly 70% over the last five years, while Amazon is up more than 100% in that same time frame.\n\nWalgreen shares have notably slumped as more shoppers move to online options like Amazon. The struggles of pharmacies were most recently highlighted by Rite Aid's recent bankruptcy filing in October.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"We don’t not like to change the members in there because of consistency, but at times it has to be done because as the economy changes, the index has to change,\" Silverblatt said.

(AP Photo/Michel Euler, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe shift was a welcome sign from Wall Street, which now sees the index ending the year at 42,000, up from 41,000 prior the announcement, according to Silverblatt.\n\nPart of this call likely stems from the increased exposure Amazon's addition provides to the stocks that have been driving the S&P 500 higher over the past year.\n\nAmazon is now the third of the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks to be added to the Dow, joining the likes of Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT). Those seven stocks which also include Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA), have helped propel the S&P 500 to a 24% gain in the past year. Meanwhile the Dow Jones has risen 16% in the same timeframe.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Reuters) - U.S. smartphone sales plunged 10% in January on weak demand for cheaper Android devices and as customers delayed upgrades ahead of the launch of Samsung Electronics' Galaxy S24 series, according to data from Counterpoint Research.\n\nThe research firm said U.S. smartphone sales last month were nearly half of the record levels seen in the same period in 2017, underscoring fears that the market may have peaked.\n\n\"Tough times in the volume-driven low-end coupled with delayed upgrades in anticipation of new products drove the market lower,\" said Maurice Klaehne, senior analyst at Counterpoint Research.\n\nSmartphone sales have waned after the pandemic-driven boom, as an uncertain economic outlook and lack of major new features led consumers to stick with their existing devices.\n\nSamsung has tried to drum up interest for its new Galaxy smartphones, which went on sale on Jan. 17, by offering multiple artificial intelligence (AI) functions including a two-way voice translation in real-time.\n\nCounterpoint said the S24 series has performed well in the U.S. market during the initial 1-2 weeks of launch, and that it could spark a rebound in smartphone sales in February.\n\nApple, meanwhile, continued to gain market share in the U.S. last month, thanks to promotional offers for its iPhone 15 series, and as cost-conscious consumers sought its older iPhone 11 and iPhone 12 devices, whose prices have come down.\n\n\"This combination is enabling Apple to maintain stability in a market experiencing double-digit declines,\" Counterpoint said.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore and Devika Syamnath)",

        "title": "Streaming bundles: A new era has arrived",
        "content": "Media companies like Disney (DIS) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) used to compete for subscribers to their streaming services. Now, they are looking to team up.\n\nDisney's ESPN, Warner Bros. Discovery, and Fox (FOXA) announced they would launch a sports streaming service this upcoming fall. Meanwhile, Paramount (PARA) and Peacock owner Comcast (CMCSA) have held discussions about a potential joint streaming venture, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe developments come as media companies face pressure from investors to scale their streaming services and achieve profitability. At the same time, the companies are dealing with more competition from tech giants like Amazon (AMZN) and Apple (AAPL), which are gobbling up streaming deals.\n\n\"Big tech is now in this game,\" Jon Christian, executive vice president of digital media supply chain at Qvest, a media and entertainment-focused consulting company, told Yahoo Finance. \"These are highly diversified businesses that have a lot of money. It's a much different set of competitors for these legacy networks and studios.\"\n\nAs a result, consolidation through mergers and acquisitions or partnerships is the only way for these traditional players to compete, according to Christian.\n\n\"At the end of the day, you have to look at the consumer and ask, 'What is the least amount of friction for the end user to be able to view my content?'\" he said.\n\nThe concept of bundling isn't new. Companies in the space have been doing it with their own services. Apple, for instance, offers Apple One, which combines Apple TV+ with other services like Apple Music and Apple Arcade. The bundle launched globally in late 2020.\n\nDisney, which also has been offering a bundle with Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN+, officially began its domestic rollout of a one-app experience late last year that incorporates Hulu content via Disney+ — a similar play to Paramount's Showtime combination as well as the integration of HBO Max and Discovery+, which both merged their respective services last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe move toward partnerships among competing media companies, though, is different.\n\n\"It's more of an evolution as the industry matures, and the focus has become on maximizing profits,\" Morningstar analyst Matthew Dolgin told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCombining forces does create certain complications. For instance, there’s the question of how to share content without giving away all the goods.\n\nDolgin cited Disney partnering with other companies on a sports streaming service despite its eventual move to bring ESPN fully over-the-top as one example of this tension: \"Now with this joint venture, how does [Disney] navigate having nothing necessarily 'exclusive' on one platform?\"\n\nAnother key question will be whether or not consumers pay up for à la carte services on top of bundled plans, which often boast greater value in the minds of subscribers.\n\nStill, Dolgin said the strategy could lead to more loyal customers and lower churn, or cancellations.\n\n\"It's the most efficient way for these companies to reach their customers,\" he said. Media companies are partnering on new streaming bundles in the hopes of gaining a more loyal audience. (Serhii Bilohubets via Getty Images)\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Apple is leaning further into live sports, this time on your iPhone.\n\nThe company has introduced Apple Sports, a new app that will deliver real-time scores and stats to your phone, including (if you wish) the lock screen, meaning you can always be up to date on the teams you care about.\n\nAvailable now in the U.S., the U.K., and Canada, the app currently displays scores from Major League Soccer, the NBA, NCAA basketball, the NHL, and six other leagues that are now in season. Once other leagues, including the NFL and Major League Baseball, begin playing, data will be available for those as well.\n\n“We created Apple Sports to give sports fans what they want—an app that delivers incredibly fast access to scores and stats,” said Eddy Cue, Apple’s senior vice president of Services, in a statement. “Apple Sports…makes it easy for users to stay up to date with their favorite teams and leagues.”\n\nThe app itself is fairly bare-bones, seemingly by design. Users are asked to pick the leagues they’re interested in and, should they wish, their favorite teams. Once that’s done, the app will show scores from the previous day as well as upcoming games.\n\nClicking through to individual games will show you line scores, statistics, and betting odds on the two teams. (Users have the ability to turn off the betting information.)\n\nUsers can also tap the screen to go to the Apple TV app to watch live games, a push that the company certainly hopes will boost subscriptions to Apple TV+. (The app will also steer you to other connected streaming apps.) To get data on the lock screen, iPhone owners will have to activate the live activities box.\n\nApple Sports is a free download.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy.\n\nMarkets wavered as latest data showed inflation in January 2024 was hotter-than-expected. But many analysts believe the markets overreacted as a single month's data can only delay the Fed's planned rate cuts for 2024. UBS Global Wealth Management on February 20 said it expects the Federal Reserve to begin cutting rates in June instead of May. UBS expects the first rate cut to be of 25 basis points.\n\n\"Given the upside surprises to both payrolls and inflation, we now expect the Fed to wait a bit longer before cutting rates,\" UBS economists said in a note.\n\nUBS is expecting 75 bps of cuts in 2024, lower than its previous estimate of 100 bps cuts.\n\nThe era of elevated interest rates might be prolonged amid a resilient labor market and stubborn inflation but sooner or later the Fed will begin to cut rates. That means good times might be coming for small-cap stocks or risky equities, including penny stocks, which have hitherto suffered as investors' shunned smaller companies to find refuge in high quality stocks like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA). Historical data showed small-cap stocks perform exceptionally well in the first 12 months of the Fed's first rate cut.\n\nLord Abbett in its December 2023 report took a detailed look at what the private investment management company called a dovish \"pivot\" of the Federal Reserve where it hinted that its interest rate cycle might have peaked. The Lord Abbett report also said small-cap companies perform well during rate cuts.\n\n\"Currently, in fixed income, we find the short duration space to be attractive and underallocated. A “bull-steepening” environment, like what we’ve seen when the Fed turns dovish on policy, favors short duration. At the same time, the normalized rate environment can make active, opportunistic credit an attractive diversifier with expected returns at current yields rivaling equities. Equities, particularly small caps, historically have done very well when inflation falls and in Fed rate-cut cycles while growth equities have done well when growth slows. Finally, a more normalized rate environment means less of the “financing for everyone” that was prevalent in the zero-interest-rate era. Going forward, quality companies with greater financial strength should be able to differentiate in terms of financial performance and demand a premium. All in all, the Fed’s dovish December pivot shocked the markets and set the table for better performance by risk assets in 2024. What a difference a week can make,\" the report added.\n\nStory continues 12 Best NYSE Penny Stocks To Buy\n\nImage: Depositphotos\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we first used a stock screener to identify NYSE stocks trading under $5.

Earlier this week in New Delhi, my team held a signing ceremony with Rahul Bhatia, the Group Managing Director of InterGlobe, to announce our plans to work with InterGlobe to bring safe, sustainable and low-noise electric air taxi services to some of the most highly populated cities in the world. As part of the initiative, we will work with InterGlobe to set up an entity and will work with select in-country business partners to operate Archer’s Aircraft, enhance and build vertiport infrastructure, and train pilots and other personnel needed for these operations.\n\nInterGlobe and Archer also anticipate the purchase of up to 200 of our Midnight aircraft as we bring up operations. India is an incredibly important market for eVTOL, and it has the potential to be one of the largest in the world, with Delhi, Bengaluru and Mumbai being our initial focus where congestion costs cities over $22 billion annually. In these cities, traffic congestion contributes to 20% to 25% of the outdoor pollution, and I hope that Archer can be a part of reducing that over the next decade. I founded Archer to help give back time to millions of people and to make cities smarter, better, cleaner, more efficient places to live. Now that Midnight is flying and we are well along the pathway to commercialization, it’s clear that major cities around the world have the same goals as Archer does.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n6.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the13 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Right Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Booming Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nDespite latest data showing elevated inflation and a decline in retail sales, some major investment firms are looking beyond the short-term market turbulence and issuing highly positive outlook for the broader stock market. Goldman Sachs recently increased its S&P 500 target for 2024 to 5200. Goldman said the primary reason for this target revision was strong earnings and profit estimates. Goldman Sachs' analysts expect strong earnings and growth for IT and communication-services sectors. Some of the best booming stocks of 2023 were from these two sectors, including Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nGoldman Sachs also said in a note on February 16 that it expects the global manufacturing activity to come back to normal this year. Goldman noted a rate-cut environment is always a positive for risky assets but the market is already pricing in much of the effects of rate cuts that are expected later this year.\n\nGoldman Sachs isn’t the only bullish investment firm in the market. UBS recently increased its 2024 target for the S&P 500 to 5,400. UBS said while latest data shows a hotter-than-expected inflation, it's also an indicator of a strong consumer demand.\n\n\"Higher inflation tends to be a positive for stock prices. While the market sold off on more robust CPI and PPI reports last week, our work indicates that these demand-driven readings are constructive for future returns,\" UBS analysts led by Jonathan Golub said. Best Booming Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\nPhoto by Austin Distel on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nEveryone knows stocks like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) were booming in 2023. But what are the best booming stocks in 2024 so far? For this article we first used a stock screener to find stocks that have gained over 30% year to date through February 19. From these stocks we picked 13 stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. We used Insider Monkey's database of 933 hedge funds updated for the fourth quarter of 2023 to gauge hedge fund sentiment of these stocks. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues\n\n13. Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nArm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have gained about 86% in 2024 through February 19. The UK-based semiconductor giant went public last year but the shares have been skyrocketing this year amid optimism fueled by AI. The stock recently jumped after Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) posted strong Q3 results and gave a strong guidance.\n\nHowever, Daiwa Securities recently downgraded the stock as the firm believes Arm Holdings PLC - ADR (NASDAQ:ARM) shares have run too much and require a cautious approach.\n\n12. Cullinan Oncology Inc (NASDAQ:CGEM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 22\n\nCullinan Oncology Inc (NASDAQ:CGEM) shares have gained about 64% year to date. A total of 22 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database of 933 funds had stakes in the company as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\n11. Viking Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:VKTX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 25\n\nViking Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:VKTX) shares have gained about 98% since the start of 2024 through February 19. The stock has gained amid takeover speculation. Earlier this month, Betaville said Eli Lilly (LLY) could be one of the companies interested in buying Viking Therapeutics Inc (NASDAQ:VKTX).\n\nDuring its Q4 earnings call earlier this month, Viking talked about its catalysts and updated on key business developments:\n\n\"The ongoing Phase 1b study of VK0214 is being conducted in patients with the adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN form of X-ALD, which is the most common form of the disorder. This trial is a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled multicenter study in adult male patients with AMN. The primary objectives of the study are to evaluate the safety, tolerability and pharmacokinetics of VK0214 administered orally once daily for 28 days. The study also includes an exploratory assessment of changes in plasma levels of very long chain fatty acids. We expect to report the top line results from this study in the first half of 2024. In conclusion, 2023 was an exciting and productive year for Viking, with the company achieving significant progress with each of our clinical programs.\n\nDuring the year, we reported the results from the first Phase 1 trial of VK2735, which demonstrated early signals of efficacy as well as promising safety and tolerability. We also initiated the Phase 1 clinical evaluation of a novel oral formulation of VK2735, which we believe may expand the market opportunity for this compound. In the fall of 2023, we initiated and completed the upsized enrolment of the VENTURE Phase 2 trial to evaluate VK2735’s longer-term clinical benefit in patients with obesity. We look forward to reporting the results from the VENTURE Phase 2 study later this quarter, along with the Phase 1 data from the oral formulation study. We also look forward to reporting data from the VOYAGE Phase 2b study of our thyroid beta receptor agonist, VK2809 in biopsy-confirmed NASH and fibrosis.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\n10.

        "title": "Apple rolls out iMessage upgrade to withstand decryption by quantum computers",
        "content": "By Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Apple is rolling out an upgrade to its iMessage texting platform to defend against future encryption-breaking technologies.\n\nThe new protocol, known as PQ3, is another sign that U.S. tech firms are bracing for a potential future breakthrough in quantum computing that could make current methods of protecting users’ communications obsolete.\n\n“More than simply replacing an existing algorithm with a new one, we rebuilt the iMessage cryptographic protocol from the ground up,” an Apple blog post published on Wednesday reads. “It will fully replace the existing protocol within all supported conversations this year.”\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based iPhone maker says its encryption algorithms are state-of-the-art and that it has found no evidence so far of a successful attack on them. Still, government officials and scientists are concerned that the advent of quantum computers, advanced machines that tap in to the properties of subatomic particles, could suddenly and dramatically weaken those protections.\n\nLate last year, a Reuters investigation explored how the United States and China are racing to prepare for that moment, dubbed “Q-Day,” both by pouring money into quantum research and by investing in new encryption standards known as post-quantum cryptography. Washington and Beijing have traded allegations of intercepting massive amounts of encrypted data in preparation for Q-Day, an approach sometimes dubbed “catch now, crack later.”\n\n“Early planning is necessary,” the U.S. cyber watchdog agency, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, said in a 2022 advisory. “Cyber threat actors could be targeting data today that would still require protection in the future.”\n\nApple’s blog says PQ3 uses a new and overlapping series of technical safeguards aimed at closing that window of opportunity.\n\nMichael Biercuk, the founder and chief executive of the quantum tech company Q-CTRL, said the fact that Apple was publicly hardening its defenses was a \"vote of confidence\" in the idea that advanced computers could one day lay waste to existing protections.\n\n\"They are indicating that they believe this is a realistic threat and are preparing actively for it,\" he said.\n\n(Reporting by Christopher Bing and Raphael Satter in Washington.; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Apple Inc. (AAPL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned -7%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has lost 5.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.51 per share, indicating a change of -0.7% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -5.3% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $6.56 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +7%. This estimate has changed -0.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.11 indicates a change of +8.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -1.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Apple, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $90.86 billion indicates a year-over-year change of -4.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $386.09 billion and $406.54 billion estimates indicate +0.7% and +5.3% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is ratcheting up the security of its iMessage app to protect users against future attacks by high-powered, nation-state hackers. The company says it is updating the security protocol behind iMessage to combat attacks using quantum computers.\n\nAccording to Apple, while it’s difficult to break the company’s current encryptions using conventional supercomputers, quantum computers could make cracking those encryptions child’s play. To that end, the company is introducing what it calls its PQ3 cryptographic protocol, a new form of encrypting users' messages that will exist alongside Apple’s existing encryption tools.\n\nThe reason for the move, Apple says, is to prevent what are referred to as “harvest now, decrypt later” attacks. The idea is relatively simple: Sophisticated attackers suck up encrypted data, whether that’s a person’s texts or government secrets, with the hope of decrypting that information in the future when quantum computers become powerful and reliable enough to do so.\n\nQuantum computers are fundamentally different from the supercomputers in use today. Conventional supercomputers perform calculations using binary code, which is made up of strings of 1s and 0s that systems translate into everything from YouTube videos to the webpage you’re reading this on. The IBM Quantum System One quantum computing system is seen during a groundbreaking ceremony at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute on Friday, Oct. 13, 2023, in Troy, N.Y. (Hans Pennink/AP Images for Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nQuantum computers, on the other hand, process data using what are known as qubits, which can be made up of electrons and protons and can exist as 1s and 0s at the same time. They’re also capable of processing the kind of calculations that would overwhelm a traditional supercomputer.\n\nYou might have seen a quantum computer in an article or two displaying its intricate collection of cooling pipes that help keep the system hovering just above absolute zero, which allows for the use of superconductors.\n\nBut quantum computers aren’t exactly available at your local Best Buy. The systems are generally used by major tech firms — IBM (IBM) has famously been working with the technology for years — and government agencies.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, quantum computers aren’t as reliable as conventional supercomputers. But security experts fear when they reach a certain level of power and reliability, they’ll easily cut through traditional encryption methods. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe day when quantum computers can break those encryptions, which protect everything from our messages to national security secrets, is referred to as “Q-day,” and while there’s no firm agreement on when it will occur, many believe it will happen in the coming decades.\n\nApple is banking on Q-day coming sooner than later and is working to ensure iMessages are protected. Importantly, Apple says there are no motivating factors behind the move to roll out quantum computing protections. Rather, it’s a proactive move designed to upgrade the app’s overall security posture.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "title": "Apple Boosts iMessage Security to Fend Off Quantum Computing Attacks",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. is upgrading the security of its iMessage app, aiming to fend off a looming future threat: advanced quantum computing attacks.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions China Tightens Grip on Stocks With Net Sale Ban at Open, Close Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Top 2024 Deal US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nThe changes will be part of a new system called PQ3, Apple said on Wednesday. It’s a more advanced type of encryption that could thwart attacks from quantum computers — still-nascent technology that can perform calculations exponentially faster than traditional machines.\n\nThe fear is that these computers could someday have the power and mathematical capabilities to break through today’s tools for encrypting messages. The new security protocol has already been added to beta versions of iOS 17.4, iPadOS 17.4, macOS 17.4 and watchOS 10.4, which will roll out to all users in the coming weeks. It will replace the current security protocols for all iMessage chats by the end of the year.\n\nThough hackers don’t currently have quantum computers, they could conduct what’s known as a “harvest now, decrypt later” attack. That means they steal messaging data today and then use a more advanced computer in the future to break the encryption. Apple said its new system is designed to prevent that.\n\nThe warnings about quantum computing attacks have been dire. International Business Machines Corp. executive Ana Paula Assis has said that they’ll cause a “cybersecurity Armageddon.” SandboxAQ Chief Executive Officer Jack Hidary said that such computers will be available by the end of the decade and cause a “train wreck” for security. Governments are also getting involved, with the US Senate passing a bill two years ago to address the threat.\n\nApple said that PQ3 “has the strongest security properties of any at-scale messaging protocol in the world.” The company sees the defenses as more powerful than those of messaging app Signal, which has long been known as the gold standard for encrypted communications.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple considers its new system to be at a Level 3 of security, while it puts Signal at Level 2. The prior protocol for iMessage ranked as a Level 1, in Apple’s view, the same level as Meta Platforms Inc.’s WhatsApp. Other popular messaging apps — like Telegram, Skype, QQ and WeChat — sit below that, according to Apple’s analysis of messaging app security.\n\nThe company also said its current Contact Key Verification system, which allows users to verify that they’re actually communicating with the intended person, is coming to its Vision Pro headset. The change will be included with the visionOS 1.1 software update. Users with the feature enabled on their Apple devices previously had to disable it to send messages on the Vision Pro.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures How Bad Movie Dubbing Led to the Fake Biden Campaign Robocalls The Dangers of Relying on the US to Power the Global Economy US Citizens Become Collateral Damage in Global Sanctions Fight Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "3 Overlooked Semiconductor Stocks to Watch Now",
        "content": "Top AI semiconductor stocks have been hot through 2023, and so far this year, they’re showing no signs of cooling off as the newest slate of generative AI technologies continues to impress. OpenAI recently showcased Sora, an AI video generator that’s been the talk of the town over the past week.\n\nUndoubtedly, one can’t help but think that products such as ChatGPT and Sora OpenAI are going to put many folks out of a job. Perhaps most impressive is that ChatGPT and Sora can only get better from here. I think that just having a look at the videos Sora generated is enough to make an AI believer out of any investor.\n\nAs OpenAI’s top boss, Sam Altman, looks to raise as much as $7 trillion (yes, that’s a trillion with a “t”) to give the global semiconductor industry a boost, it seems like semiconductor demand could continue to outweigh supply as we enter AI’s second year of mass adoption. Let’s take a peek at three overlooked semiconductor stocks to watch closely as they continue their ascent.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSemiconductor Stocks: Qualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor those who may have missed out on the semiconductor boom of 2023, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) definitely stands out as a catch-up play that’s nowhere near as hot as some of its high-flying peers. At around $152 per share, Qualcomm is still down just over 19% from its 2022 all-time high. Given the ongoing AI boom, it’s hard to envision a semiconductor stock with AI exposure that’s not melting up to new highs.\n\nThough, there are some question marks clouding Qualcomm’s future. Most notably, what happens when Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) successfully creates its own modem, a move that would essentially give Qualcomm’s modem the boot from a future iPhone model?\n\nAs it turns out, making cellular modems is no easy feat. And with Apple extending its modem deal with Qualcomm through 2026, it seems like Apple’s foray into modems has been a tad rockier than anticipated. Only time will tell if Apple is able to replace Qualcomm in a few years. Regardless, expect Qualcomm to be less reliant on Apple over time as it looks to make a deeper dive into the world of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt 21.8 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), QCOM stock certainly looks cheaper than most other semiconductor stocks hogging the headlines of late.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) found itself flirting with all-time highs before slipping by around 5% over the past week and change. As critical as the firm is to the future of the AI chip market, you wouldn’t expect the firm to be overlooked. Undoubtedly, it’s the uncertain geopolitical risks making shares of TSM a tough hold, even as the firm itself continues firing on all cylinders in a market that couldn’t be hotter.\n\nIt’s the same deal with owning Chinese stocks; there are a lot of geopolitical risks with these investments. And though TSM stock’s valuation may be depressed, it’s tough to tell just how much of a discount warrants a potential bear-case scenario that sees China invade Taiwan.\n\nOn the plus side, Taiwan Semiconductor is doing a great job of expanding beyond Taiwan. The world’s largest foundry is set to build a second factory in Japan, a move that could take a little bit of the China-Taiwan risk off the table.\n\nArguably, it’ll take much more than just another factory opening to ease this risk. In any case, I view any potential escalation in China-Taiwan tensions as a risk, not just for Taiwan Semiconductor but the entire tech sector. With that in mind, I view TSM stock as incredibly cheap at just 24.5 times trailing P/E.\n\nAMD (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe secret is out: AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) is the AI chip bet for investors who want a suitable alternative to the great Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Though AMD isn’t overlooked anymore, after recently surging to new all-time highs, I think a strong case could be made for why the stock deserves more attention than top rival Nvidia as they look to battle it out at the front lines in the so-called AI war.\n\nOver the past year, AMD stock has been white-hot, up more than 121%. As jaw-dropping as the gain is, the performance still comes up short of Nvidia, which has more than tripled over the same time span. With the better chips, the better past year of performance, and the better valuation (96.2 times trailing P/E for NVDA stock vs. 334.4 times trailing P/E for AMD stock), why bother going with player number two (AMD) over the top dog (Nvidia)?\n\nAMD seems to be giving its all to challenge its AI chip rivals with an arsenal of new chip releases (like the Strix Point APUs for 2024).\n\nFurther, the company’s sheer hunger for Nvidia’s massive slice of the pie ought to be enough to justify diversifying into if you’re overweight in any single AI stock. Whether AMD can grab a big slice of Nvidia’s lunch remains to be seen. In any case, fellow InvestorPlace contributor Chris MacDonald has high hopes for AMD as it looks to continue its “aggressive” move into AI chips.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owns shares of Apple.

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade as revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed over 200% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC).\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third-most-valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adjused EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022.\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Ruben Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips.\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.

        "title": "3 Dividend Growth Stocks That Can Pay You for the Rest of Your Life",
        "content": "The big attraction of dividend growth stocks is that they can potentially pay you for years and even decades. But the danger for investors is assuming that just because a company has increased its dividend for decades, it will continue to do so, or that it will always be a great dividend stock.\n\nWalgreens Boots Alliance is a prime example. The pharmacy retailer slashed its payouts this year, breaking a dividend growth streak that was closing in on five decades.\n\nRather than focusing on the past, investors should carefully consider which stocks are safe buys for the future, and whose payouts could rise in the years to come. While there are never any guarantees when it comes to dividends, three stocks I expect should increase their payouts for years and be able to pay you for the rest of your life are Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola has a hugely successful business that it has been able to expand and transform over time. As consumers have become more health conscious, the company came out with healthier product choices. In 2023, for example, sales of Coca-Cola Zero Sugar grew at a rate of 5% -- higher than trademark Coca-Cola sales, which were up by just 2%.\n\nWhile investors may be most familiar with the company's Coca-Cola line of products, the business is far broader, with hundreds of brands in its portfolio, including Powerade, Fanta, Minute Maid, and Dasani. Coca-Cola's strong diversification makes it likely that the business will continue growing steadily over the years to come. And as consumer tastes evolve, so too will the business.\n\nLast year, the company's earnings per share rose by 13% to $2.47, which is well above the rate of its annualized dividend of $1.94. This month, Coca-Cola announced it was increasing its dividend for the 62nd consecutive year. And given the company's impressive results, there's little reason to doubt that streak will continue for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Costco Wholesale\n\nCostco doesn't have a long dividend streak like Coca-Cola, but Costco has been raising its payouts since 2005. And occasionally, the shopping club giant has also rewarded its shareholders with special dividend payments. The company's approach to dividends is why I'm confident this can be a reliable dividend stock to own forever.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, which ended on Nov. 26, 2023, Costco reported $56.7 billion in net sales, which was up 6.1% from the prior-year period. During the 12-week period, the company generated 11.2% comparable revenue growth in international markets and 6.3% revenue growth in e-commerce. Those are two areas of its business I expect will drive growth in the future, as there's still plenty of room for Costco to grow internationally (750 of its 874 warehouses are in North America) and for it to develop a greater presence online.\n\nThe stock still has a fairly modest payout ratio of just 27%, leaving plenty of room for Costco to continue growing its dividend. Although its yield of 0.6% may look underwhelming, this could be a key dividend stock for investors to hold for the long haul.\n\n3. Apple\n\nAnother low-yielding stock (0.5%) on this list is Apple. And like Costco, it's one that investors should expect to increase for decades. The tech company has only been increasing its payouts since 2013 but because of the iPhone maker's incredibly large profits and significant free cash flow, it's highly probable that Apple will pump more money into its dividend in the future.\n\nAt 15% of earnings, its payout ratio is the lowest on this list. The company reported a profit of $33.9 billion during the last three months of 2023, rising by 13% even amid challenging economic conditions. And its operating cash flow during that period totaled $39.9 billion. While the company is investing in growth opportunities, and a chatbot may even be on the horizon, Apple used up just $2.4 billion on capital spending during the period.\n\nApple's strong financials make it highly probable that the company will continue raising its dividend in the future. And while dividend investors may not target this stock today, that could change in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "It's not too tough these days to find growth stocks worth buying. Things change, however, when you're looking for growth stocks to buy and hold forever. Such companies must not only always be capable of firing on all cylinders, but must also be able to adapt as needed to maintain their growth into the indefinite future. Not every organization has that capacity.\n\nA handful of them do, though. Here's a closer look at three of them, any of which would make a fine \"forever\" holding for almost any growth-seeking investor.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nIt's such a commonly suggested stock pick that it's almost become a cliche. There's still good reason, though -- Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a great growth stock for nearly any portfolio.\n\nYou know the company as an e-commerce behemoth. Indeed, Amazon arguably pioneered online shopping as we know it today. Insider Intelligence says the organization accounts for over one-third of the United States' entire e-commerce market, leaving second-biggest Walmart in a distant second place at only around 7%.\n\nStill, according to data from the Census Bureau, e-commerce still only makes up roughly 15% of the nation's total retail sales. While much of that spending simply can't be done online, a big chunk of the other 85% is up for grabs by a company with an existing reach with consumers.\n\nAmazon's fourth-quarter product sales improved nearly 9% year over year despite the somewhat lethargic economy. Nationwide retail spending only improved by about one-third of that amount during the fourth quarter of last year. Perhaps more important, Amazon's e-commerce profit margins are finally starting to widen here and abroad. Data source: Amazon. Chart by author. Figures are in billions.\n\nAt the same time, while the company's cloud computing arm Amazon Web Services (AWS) may only contribute 16% of Amazon's total top line, AWS accounts for two-thirds of the organization's operating income. This cash-driving business is growing like crazy too, with Q4's and last year's sales both up 13%. Given GMI Research's expectation for worldwide cloud computing market growth of 19% per year through 2030 (and we'll never not need the cloud), look for AWS's strong profit profile to drive oversized earnings growth for the company as a whole.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nThere's a good chance you've never even heard of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM), better known as TSMC. But there's little chance you're not using at least some of its handiwork on a regular basis.\n\nAs the name suggests, Taiwan Semiconductor manufactures computer chips. It makes few components of its own, though. Rather, TSMC is a contract manufacturer, meaning it makes semiconductors, processors, and chips designed by more familiar technology outfits like Nvidia, Advanced Micro Devices, and Broadcom. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is also a partner, and is even supporting TSMC's efforts to establish a manufacturing facility in Arizona.\n\nWhy don't these tech giants build and operate their own chip foundries? Money, mostly. It's often cheaper and easier to punt this work to manufacturers that are better equipped to manage the complex process involved in producing semiconductors at scale.\n\nYes, this means TSMC's fate is tethered to the overall chip market's strength. That's why last year's top line slumped to the tune of 4.5%; economic lethargy crimped demand for chips.\n\nBut take a step back and look at the bigger picture. The world's not going to be using less technology going forward. If anything we'll need more of it. In fact, tech market research outfit Precedence Research believes the global semiconductor market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 12% per year through 2032.\n\nThe demand for chips, processors, and semiconductors is likely to continue growing. Moreover, the fiscal math of making large quantities of semiconductors and other computer chips is still likely to favor the use of contract manufacturers over in-house manufacturing.\n\nThe kicker: TSMC is already the dominant name in the business, manufacturing roughly half of the world's chips. It's more than big enough to defend its turf.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLike Amazon, Apple is a rather predictable, commonly suggested pick. But don't let that dissuade you from owning it. It's also one of the world's biggest companies as measured by market cap, and is the world's biggest in terms of sales and profits. It deserves its notoriety.\n\nSure, Apple's iPhone isn't the breadwinning growth driver it used to be. The device's total revenue fell just a bit last year, in fact. Unit sales of the popular smartphone also peaked in 2021, and since then have slightly dwindled. Given that the iPhone accounts for about half of the company's revenue, it's increasingly difficult to see Apple as a name worth owning at all, let alone a growth name.\n\nHowever, the organization is evolving. The development of its services arm is one of these evolutions.\n\nSee, users' apps and digital content subscriptions make the most of these premium-priced devices, and Apple has gotten very, very good at inducing this spending. iPhone owners spend as much as seven times more on apps and digital content than Android users do, according to data gathered by research outfit Asymco's analyst Horace Dediu.\n\nThere's also a less obvious benefit in getting iPhone owners to use their devices as much as they do. Given how seamless it is to transfer these products and services to a new device in the future, current iPhone owners have an incentive to purchase another iPhone when it comes time for an upgrade. In this vein, U.K.-based firm Bionic believes 92.6% of current iPhone owners intend to buy another one in the future. That incredible level of loyalty is second only to Netflix's.\n\nAnd Apple's evolution isn't just about more services and their beneficial impact on iPhone sales. The company is subtly setting the stage for several new profit centers -- perhaps without even knowing exactly how these new ventures might be monetized. Apple is reinventing its onboard virtual assistant Siri, for instance, now that the rise of powerful artificial intelligence has made such tools far more useful than they've been in the past.\n\nThe company's also still developing autonomous vehicles, and it just recently debuted a powerful virtual/augmented reality headset called the Vision Pro. Although the Vision Pro's pricing and app ecosystem aren't yet quite what they need to be, that will likely change over time. That matters, because this market is still in its infancy. Precedence Research believes the worldwide AR/VR market is set to grow from last year's $47.6 billion to $372 billion in 2032.\n\nYou get the idea. Apple is already an incredible brand name with staying power, and it's got lots of new growth levers it can pull in the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we discuss the 13 best stocks to buy now according to billionaire Cliff Asness. If you want to read about some more stocks in the Asness portfolio, go directly to 5 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nCliff Asness, the head of AQR Capital Management, stands out as one of Wall Street's most accomplished hedge fund managers. AQR, short for Applied Quantitative Research, traces its origins to Goldman Sachs' asset management division, a leading global investment bank. With an initial investment of $10 million from a select group of investors in 1995, Asness utilized quantitative methods to swiftly expand the Goldman Sachs Global Alpha Fund to over $100 million within a matter of months. Despite Asness departing from Goldman Sachs to establish his hedge fund in 1998, the Alpha Fund continued its growth trajectory, managing assets worth $12 billion by 2007.\n\nCliff Asness often appears on television and podcasts, where he shares his expertise on financial matters. In a Bloomberg podcast last year, he expressed apprehension about overinflated stock prices, cautioned about challenges in the commercial real estate sector, and even forecasted the possibility of a looming financial crisis.\n\n“My biggest concern is stocks and bonds seem to be taking a very, very different view. Bonds are pricing in multiple, severe cuts over the next year to two years. That is a forecast for a recession, and not a mild one. Equities are whistling past the graveyard. If inflation stays sticky, or it comes down because we enter a non-trivial recession, it’s equities that I think are a scary place. They’re not priced very consistently with bonds, and we’re going to find out who’s right in the next year.”\n\nAsness recently grabbed attention by reiterating his stance on emerging-market equities outperforming the US market, despite this trade's lackluster performance in recent years. AQR allocates approximately $8 billion of its $99 billion under management to an emerging-market equities portfolio, managed collaboratively like its other funds. This perspective challenging the dominance of US stocks aligns AQR with other major players in the industry, such as Morgan Stanley Investment Management.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the billionaire's hedge fund closed out 2023 with impressive double-digit returns across several of its funds, driven by strong performance in stock selection, bonds, European natural gas, and iron ore, as reported by Reuters. The investment manager achieved a net return of 18.5% for the year in its AQR Absolute Return strategy, its longest-running multi-strategy fund. This marked a notable comparison to the almost 44% net return achieved in 2022. Asness had predicted in January 2023 that this particular investing approach, involving \"going long cheap companies and shorting expensive ones\" within specific sectors, would be particularly appealing for the year. With that in mind, lets look at some of the top stocks in the AQR Capital Management portfolio, which include the likes of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness\n\nCliff Asness of AQR Capital Management\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThese were picked from the investment portfolio of AQR Capital Management at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. To provide readers with a more comprehensive overview of the companies, the analyst ratings for each firm are mentioned alongside other details. A database of around 933 elite hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey in the fourth quarter of 2023 was used to quantify the popularity of each stock in the hedge fund universe.\n\n13. Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 86\n\nAQR Capital Management's Stake: $351.6 million\n\nHumana Inc. (NYSE:HUM), headquartered in Kentucky, offers fully insured medical and specialty health insurance benefits to its customers. Latest 13F filings show that AQR Capital Management owned 1.7 million shares of Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) at the end of the fourth quarter of 2023 worth $351.6 million.\n\nOn December 12, Argus upgraded Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM)’s stock from a Hold to a Buy rating, with a $550 price target. This upgrade followed the company's decision to discontinue merger discussions with The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), a move perceived to have multiple downsides according to the analyst.\n\nBy the end of last year’s fourth quarter, 86 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey’s research had bought a stake in Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM). Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group owned the biggest stake which was worth $688 million.\n\nMuch like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Humana Inc. (NYSE:HUM) is one of the best stocks to buy according to billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\n12. The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 76\n\nAQR Capital Management's Stake: $352.6 million\n\nThe Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) is a for-profit American multinational managed healthcare and insurance company headquartered in Bloomfield, Connecticut. With a global presence spanning 30 countries, the company serves over 86 million customers and continues to be a prominent leader in providing global healthcare benefits. Securities filings show that AQR Capital Management owned over 1.179 million shares of The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) at the end of December 2023 worth $352.6 million, representing 0.66% of the portfolio.\n\nAs of the close of Q4 2023, 76 hedge funds in Insider Monkey’s database reported having stakes in The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI), a slight increase from the previous quarter. The consolidated worth of these stakes is more than $4.49 billion.\n\nDavis Funds mentioned The Cigna Group (NYSE:CI) in its Q3 2023 investor letter. Here is what the firm has to say:\n\n“In the attractive healthcare sector, we look beyond the obvious to identify businesses that simultaneously have exposure to this growth industry and also trade at low prices. We’re especially drawn to companies like Cigna Group, whose products or services play a part in helping to mitigate healthcare’s constantly rising costs. The healthcare industry has been a growing part of the U.S. economy for decades. As a result, many companies in this sector trade at high valuations reflecting their robust but well-known reputation for growth. For value-conscious investors like us, investing in healthcare requires looking beyond the obvious to identify businesses that have exposure to this growth industry but which trade at low prices. Furthermore, recognizing that the constantly rising cost of healthcare cannot go on forever, we have been particularly drawn to companies whose products or services play some role in managing or reducing the cost of care. As a result, we have positions in Cigna Group, a well-regarded provider of managed care.\n\n11. PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 38\n\nAQR Capital Management's Stake: $379.78 million\n\nPulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) is a prominent American residential home-construction company headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, United States. As of 2023, it held the position as the third-largest home-construction company in the United States in terms of the number of homes closed. Cliff Asness’ investment firm reduced its stake in PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) by 11% to $379.78 million in the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nIn the fourth quarter, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) reported a profit of $711 million or $3.28 per share, a decrease from $882 million or $3.85 per share in the same period last year. The company sold 7,615 homes, which was below expectations, at an average price of $547,000, down from $561,000 a year ago. The decline in home sales was attributed to the surge in the average rate on a 30-year mortgage to nearly 8%, the highest level in two decades. These high rates led many potential homebuyers to postpone their purchases and prompted sellers to offer concessions. However, as mortgage rates moderated in the latter half of the quarter, PulteGroup, Inc. (NYSE:PHM) experienced a 57% increase in net new orders to 6,214 homes valued at approximately $3.4 billion. This growth was driven by a more favorable selling environment and a decrease in cancellations, which decreased to 9% of backlog from 11% in the same quarter of the previous year.\n\nAfter looking through 933 hedge funds for their fourth quarter of 2023 shareholdings, Insider Monkey discovered that 38 were the firm’s investors.\n\n10.

(NASDAQ:CSCO) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Cisco Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ:CSCO) is the leading networking solutions company. Networking equipment becomes more important as businesses modernize their IT infrastructure, and Cisco is well positioned to capture this demand given its broad portfolio and highly effective go-to-market strategy. Cisco is transitioning away from selling mainly transactional hardware and toward selling more software and subscriptions. This shift is expected to accelerate revenue growth, improve operating margins and build recurring revenue. Despite these notable business improvements, Cisco still trades near a trough valuation relative to the S&P 500 Index. More recently, Cisco announced its intention to acquire Splunk, a leader in security and observability, adding to its already strong position in the increasingly important security market. At a low-teens multiple of our estimate of normalized earnings, Cisco is trading comfortably below our estimate of intrinsic value.”\n\n7.

Moreover, operating profits are rising due to an organization-wide focus on improving productivity and accelerating the time to market for new products. However, overall profitability continues to be weighed down by losses in the Reality Labs segment.

        "title": "Hedge Funds Cut Magnificent Seven in Last Quarter, Goldman Says",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Hedge funds pared exposure to the Magnificent Seven megacap tech stocks in the fourth quarter amid signs of extremes in the market, according to Goldman Sachs Group Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYour 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Stocks Fall Before Nvidia’s Must-Watch Earnings: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\n“Funds were net sellers of most of the Magnificent Seven stocks,” as their weights rose to records, strategists including Ben Snider and Jenny Ma wrote in a note dated Tuesday that analyzed 722 hedge funds with $2.6 trillion of gross equity positions. All seven except Amazon Inc. saw a decrease in exposure, they added.\n\nThe changes underscore how investors are increasingly questioning whether the group — comprised of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — can repeat last year’s performance, when an index of the stocks rose 106% versus the S&P 500’s 24% gain. Some strategists have started noting a wide dispersion of consensus growth estimates across the group.\n\nThe group’s earnings-reporting season has been mixed. While Meta and Amazon beat expectations, Apple and Tesla saw some weakness. Nvidia’s earnings are due later Wednesday, and traders will be looking for confirmation the company can meet the lofty expectations set amid the artificial-intelligence boom. Option trades are implying an 11% earnings move in the stock, which has tripled in price in the past year.\n\nMicrosoft, Apple and Nvidia “ranked among the Info Tech stocks with the largest net decreases in hedge fund popularity, while communication services stocks like Snap Inc. were added, the Goldman team wrote.\n\n“While trimming mega-cap tech stocks, hedge funds looked for opportunities in cyclicals and some pockets of growth,” the Goldman team wrote. Funds continued to rotate toward cyclicals over defensives, lifting that preference to the highest since 2016 amid strong US economic data and hints of improvement in global manufacturing.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe large degrees of hedge fund crowding, momentum exposure and gross leverage have all aided returns during the past year, but they also point to “the risk of a violent unwind if the market environment shifts,” as briefly occurred during the last several weeks of 2023, Goldman analysts added.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC The Rise of Starlink as a Geopolitical Force How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of major Apple supplier Foxconn, made his first high profile appearance in months on Tuesday at the firm's 50th birthday, following the ending of his bid for Taiwan's presidency late last year.\n\nGou, who stepped down as Foxconn chief in 2019 and resigned as a board member last September, remains the company's largest shareholder and is still reverentially referred to by company executives as \"the Founder\".\n\nIn late November he abandoned his latest attempt to become Taiwan's president after failing to broker a deal to unite the island's fractious opposition ahead of January elections, and largely vanished from view, though he did visit a temple last month.\n\nFoxconn, in a statement on Wednesday, said Gou had attended a gala in Taipei to mark the company's 50th anniversary, an event also attended in person by Apple's Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams, SoftBank Founder and CEO Masayoshi Son and ARM CEO Rene Haas.\n\n\"In the past 50 years, Foxconn has succeeded in changing the lives of millions of workers, thus their families and also their communities. As the Founder, I am most proud of it,\" the company quoted Gou as saying.\n\nFoxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, said that Apple CEO Tim Cook, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang and Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger all sent pre-recorded tributes to the closed-door event.\n\nFoxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said the celebration was for Gou.\n\n\"Tonight we are among friends, who are long-time customers and suppliers,\" the statement cited Liu as saying. \"This evening is for you. It is Terry's evening.\"\n\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, is seeking to expand beyond assembling smartphones and other electronics to making electric vehicles.\n\nFoxconn said some of the guests were taken to the event in the Foxconn-developed Model C car, which is now in mass production.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Michael Perry)",

        "content": "OpenAI’s recent introduction of Sora could provide the next step forward in leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) within the Metaverse. This will create an opportune moment for certain next-big-thing stocks. If generative AI technologies were a major focus of 2024, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) launch of its new Vision Pro product might help drive more widespread adoption of Metaverse concepts. One hurdle has been developing fully immersive and natural virtual worlds that move seamlessly with the user. Sora could address such challenges and make Metaverse experiences more appealing to broader audiences. These improvements can pave the way for the next big thing stocks in the tech industry.\n\nSeveral companies have already applied AI tools within Metaverse platforms, with gaming industry leaders demonstrating particular interest. According to some projections, the video games sector currently generates an estimated $282 billion annually. However, the Metaverse may contribute more than $615 billion to the global economy by 2030. Even Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) has unveiled initial Metaverse products. This includes its HoloTile system, which allows virtual mobility without physical movement. This could potentially lead to several next big thing stocks.\n\nBelow are three companies well-positioned to capitalize on OpenAI’s breakthrough. They will also help drive AI integration within emerging Metaverse technologies, making them potential next big thing stocks:.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Virtual character inside a virtual art gallery. Metaverse\n\nSource: MR Neon / Shutterstock\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META), Facebook’s parent company, went as far as to change its name to reflect its focus on the next big tech: the Metaverse. The company has invested more than $27 billion in developing and advancing Metaverse technologies since 2019. It continues investing heavily in the next big thing. In addition to Metaverse applications and other software, Meta also manufactures and sells its Mixed Reality headsets. These compete with Apple’s Vision Pro at a much more affordable price tag.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also largely involved in AI. They explore how it can be applied within Metaverse’s virtual and augmented reality (AR) experiences. It sees the Metaverse as the next big thing in online social experiences. Also, it appears to be positioning itself at the forefront of the tech industry.\n\nTrading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 31.9 times, Meta’s valuation is below the average 43.5x of the tech sector. With Metaverse representing a promising new frontier while being heavily invested in it makes the company one of the next big thing stocks to consider.​\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stands to significantly benefit from any innovations in AI resulting from its multi-billion dollar investment in OpenAI. While other companies have taken a more consumer and entertainment-focused approach to developing the Metaverse, Microsoft is adopting a strategic work/industrial lens. Although the company now derives most revenue from other business segments, its ties to the Windows operating system allow it to integrate advanced technologies like AI and cloud computing seamlessly. If generating static images within the Metaverse requires substantial cloud computing resources, generating immersive moving images will probably demand even greater capacity. This positions Microsoft well to boost its largest revenue stream further as virtual worlds consume higher volumes of video.\n\nWith a forward P/E ratio of 36.5 times, Microsoft offers a modest dividend yield of just 0.7%. This reflects the market’s view of the stock as a potential next big thing. Microsoft is another of the next big thing stocks to consider as it leverages its strategic investments and platform advantages in AI and cloud to capitalize on new Metaverse opportunities.​\n\nRoblox (RBLX) Roblox sign logo at headquarters. RBLX stock\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NYSE:RBLX) Roblox has been known as a pioneer in the Metaverse gaming sector. The company has seen notable growth thanks to strategic AI and virtual reality (VR) moves. It is currently working on integrating generative AI into developing and expanding immersive experiences. The company’s strategy drove 26% revenue growth in the prior year, with guidance for at least 18% sales growth this period.\n\nDespite planning big investments to expand its user base, Roblox maintained a positive free cash flow in the last reporting year, ending with $2.2 billion in net liquidity. Analysts have adopted a cautiously optimistic view on the stock, with an average target price of $49.03 representing solid upside to the current $42.91.\n\nThis could position Roblox at the forefront of the next big thing in tech but also gaming. This makes it a tempting opportunity for investors seeking exposure to Metaverse’s digital landscape and a solid addition to the list of next big thing stocks.​\n\nDisclaimer:On the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The high-water mark for Wall Street's S&P 500 (^GSPC) predictions has moved up yet again.\n\nThe benchmark index has hit new record highs to kick off 2024. The surge in stocks has alreadyput the S&Pabove the average Wall Street strategist year-end target less than two months into the year. And now, two strategistsare boosting their projections for how far stocks can run in 2024.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs boosted its year-end target from 5,100 to 5,200. On Tuesday, UBS also boosted its target. The UBS Investment Bank equity strategy team led by Jonathan Golub now sees the S&P 500 ending this year at 5,400, up from a prior call of 5,100. This reflects nearly an 8% increase from Tuesday's opening price.\n\n\"Despite our bullish outlook, it appears we were not bullish enough,\" Golub wrote.\n\nBoth Goldman Sachs and UBS expressed a more upbeat outlook for corporate earnings this year than previously forecast when describing why they see further upside in stocks.\n\nTheir new predictions come as earnings for S&P 500 companies are now expected to grow 3.2% in the fourth quarter, up from a 1.9% projection a month ago, per FactSet. For the full year 2024, analysts project the S&P 500 will grow 10.9%.\n\nIn a research note boosting the bank's S&P 500 projection on Feb. 16, Goldman Sachs chief US equity strategist David Kostin wrote earnings growth will be \"the primary driver\" of remaining upside for stocks during 2024.\n\nKostin noted that the more upbeat outlook on earnings stems from \"upgraded outlooks on US economic growth and mega-cap profit margins.\" Specifically, Goldman's call on earnings growth stems from megacap companies. The Charging Bull or Wall Street Bull is pictured in Manhattan, Jan. 16, 2019. (Carlo Allegri/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nIn the past three months, earnings estimates for the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks — Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and Nvidia (NVDA) have increased by 7%. Meanwhile, margin expectations have been revised up 86 basis points. This contrasts trends seen across the other 493 stocks, which have seen a downward earnings revision of 3% and 30 basis point downward revision in margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis leads Goldman to believe the Technology (XLK) and Communication Services sectors (XLC), which include five of the seven Magnificent Seven stocks, will lead the earnings growth in 2024.\n\n\"We expect demand drivers including AI growth and consumer strength will support revenue growth in these sectors, while margins will continue to expand as these companies focus on operating efficiency,\" Kostin wrote.\n\nHe added: \"The rest of the S&P 500 should also improve margins in 2024, but to a much smaller degree.\" Goldman Sachs projects an outsized portion of the S&P 500's net profit margin growth in 2024 to come from two sectors: Information Technology and Communication Services. (Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research)\n\nOf course, there are still many risks to the stock market rally. One that has weighed on stocks in recent days is the prospect of sticky inflation. Stocks sold off on Feb. 13 in reaction to a hotter-than-expected inflation report that sparked fears that the Federal Reserve may not cut interest rates as soon as hoped.\n\nBut UBS'sGolub points out that sticky inflation might not be all bad for corporates.\n\n\"Returns and profits are measured in nominal dollars.

        "title": "Apple Shuffles Leadership of Team Responsible for Audio Products",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. shuffled leadership at the hardware team responsible for audio features on AirPods, Macs and other products, tapping a new leader for an increasingly critical business.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCapital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Largest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Your 401(k) Will Be Gone Within a Decade Stocks Fall Before Nvidia’s Make-or-Break Moment: Markets Wrap US Tells Allies Russia May Launch Anti-Satellite Nuclear Weapon Into Space This Year\n\nGary Geaves, the company’s longtime vice president in charge of acoustics, is stepping down from the role, according to people familiar with the matter. He will be replaced by top deputy Ruchir Davé, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private.\n\nThe group, which has about 300 employees, is a core part of Apple’s growing AirPods and speaker businesses. It oversees sound and microphone technologies, and helped develop software features such as spatial audio that have become a selling point for AirPods, HomePods and the new Vision Pro headset. The group also operates audio testing labs at Apple’s Silicon Valley offices.\n\nThe leadership change adds to upheaval at Apple’s hardware engineering group, which is run by John Ternus. Tang Tan, the company’s vice president in charge of iPhone, Apple Watch and AirPods product design, recently departed. In preparation for that move, Geaves’ group was shifted in December to report to Matt Costello, the executive in charge of Beats headphones and the HomePod.\n\nGeaves joined Apple in 2011 after running research and development at audio company Bowers & Wilkins. He will remain at Apple as an adviser to Costello. Upon Tan’s departure, Costello also assumed responsibility over the product design group for accessories.\n\nRead More: Apple Plans AirPods Overhaul With New Low- and High-End Models\n\nApple executives announced the latest leadership changes internally last week. A spokesman declined to comment on the moves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe most notable products to come out of the acoustics group are the AirPods, which have quickly become a top seller — and a major reason people stick with the Apple ecosystem of devices. Over the past two years, Geaves has been focused on an end-to-end overhaul of the lineup. Consumers will see the fruit of that effort in the coming months, when Apple starts rolling out revamped models.\n\nAirPods now bring in more than $15 billion a year for Apple, according to estimates compiled by Bloomberg, and they lead the personal audio products market.\n\nGeaves was also key to development of the HomePod smart speaker, which wasn’t an immediate hit. That product, first released in 2018, has gained momentum in recent years thanks to cheaper models. The longtime Apple executive was promoted to the vice president level in 2019, Bloomberg News reported at the time.\n\nThe acoustics team also has been involved in efforts to explore new products, such as a wall-mounted smart display and a combined iPad and HomePod device.\n\nPeople familiar with Apple’s acoustics organization believe Geaves has been planning to retire for the last few years and that the move to an advisory role is an interim step toward that. Over the past few months, a slew of executives have decided to leave, including DJ Novotney, a hardware engineering vice president who also reported to Costello, and senior designers such as Bart Andre.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC How Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 best gold mining stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our overview of the latest trends in the world of gold and minerals, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Gold Mining Companies to Invest In According to Analysts.\n\nGold serves as a safe-haven investment, sought by investors to mitigate risks associated with factors like inflation, geopolitical tensions, and financial instability. These variables often contribute to gold price volatility, as witnessed in 2022 and early 2023. Gold surged to over $2,000 per ounce during this period due to concerns regarding inflation and geopolitical uncertainties. However, the market experienced significant price fluctuations as investors evaluated the possibility of a recession against the backdrop of increasing interest rates, inflation, and other dynamics.\n\nA Bloomberg report released earlier in 2023 unveiled a notable trend among global sovereign wealth funds and investors toward accumulating gold. Invesco's analysis was based on a survey encompassing 85 sovereign wealth funds and 57 central banks, collectively managing assets totaling around $21 trillion. The report underscored the sentiment surrounding gold, noting that \"a significant portion of central banks express concerns about the precedent set by the US freezing of Russian reserves, with the majority (58%) agreeing that this event has heightened the appeal of gold.\" The survey findings underscored gold's enduring role as an inflation hedge, with a considerable number of central banks indicating intentions to bolster their gold reserves over the next three years.\n\nAmidst forecasts of persistent upward trends in gold prices fueled by geopolitical tensions and uncertainties, Netherlands-based ING Group predicts a continuation of the surge witnessed in 2023 into 2024. The initial surge in gold prices followed the outbreak of conflict in Israel earlier in the year, and despite tensions easing, prices have remained high. ING Group anticipates that the Federal Reserve will begin reducing interest rates in May 2024, with a total expected reduction of 150 basis points throughout the year, and an additional 100 basis points in early 2025. These rate cuts are forecasted to bolster gold prices in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nConsidering this outlook, let's explore some of the best gold mining stocks to invest in according to analysts, which include the likes of Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM), Barrick Gold Corp (NYSE:GOLD), and Agnico Eagle Mines Limited (NYSE:AEM).

        "title": "Nvidia’s Q4 earnings will be a referendum on the AI trade. Revenue expected to jump 234%",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) will announce its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Wednesday, one of the most highly anticipated earnings reports in recent memory. Shares of the AI chip darling have skyrocketed 184% over the last 12 months, easily outpacing rivals AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC), which saw their shares rise 91% and 67%, respectively.\n\nNvidia’s incredible run briefly pushed its market capitalization past Amazon (AMZN) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) last week, making it the third most valuable publicly traded company in the world behind only Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL). But as of Tuesday, Amazon and Alphabet reclaimed their leads over Nvidia.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, analysts expect Nvidia to report adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $4.60 on revenue of $20.4 billion, up from adj. EPS of $0.88 on $6.1 billion a year ago. That’s a year-over-year increase of 234%. To put Nvidia’s performance into perspective, the company reported $27 billion in revenue for all of 2022. Nvidia president and CEO Jensen Huang speaks at a keynote presentation while holding the Grace Hopper superchip at COMPUTEX 2023 (Photo by Walid Berrazeg/SOPA Images/LightRocket via Getty Images) (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAnalysts expect Nvidia’s Data Center revenue of $17.2 billion in the quarter, up from $3.62 billion in the same quarter last year. Nvidia’s Data Center segment has quickly become its most important revenue stream thanks to the rapid increase in interest in artificial intelligence driven by the explosion in generative AI apps.\n\nIn January, Meta (META) said it is building out its AI data centers to include 350,000 of Nvidia’s flagship H100 chips by the end of 2024. While Nvidia doesn’t disclose the price of its chips, the H100 is estimated to cost tens of thousands of dollars. That means Meta alone will pay billions for Nvidia’s chips.\n\nGaming, which used to be Nvidia’s largest business segment, is expected to generate revenue of $2.7 billion, up from $1.8 billion last year.\n\nAnalysts will also be keeping an eye on Nvidia’s forward guidance. The company has easily surpassed revenue guidance in the last few quarters, and another beat would signal continued strength in the AI trade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo say that expectations for Nvidia are high would be a wild understatement. A number of Wall Street analysts have changed their price targets on the company’s shares, with UBS analyst Timothy Arcuri increasing the bank’s price target from $580 to $850, and Stifel’s Robin Roy setting a new target of $865 from $665. Wedbush’s Matt Bryson also increased the firm’s price target on Nvidia to $800 from $600.\n\nNvidia’s growth, however, is facing challenges from all sides. The company’s chief rival, AMD, is investing heavily in its own AI chips, including its new MI300X. According to AMD, the chip surpasses Nvidia’s H100 in certain workloads, but Nvidia has refuted those claims, saying AMD’s testing was incomplete. Intel also has its own server chips and continues to build on their capabilities.\n\nNvidia’s customers are also increasingly looking to develop their own specialized AI chips to ease their reliance on Nvidia’s offerings. Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft, and Tesla (TSLA) are just a few of the big-name firms that either currently offer or are actively developing their own in-house AI chips. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThose chips are designed specifically for each company’s needs, improving efficiency and power consumption, versus Nvidia’s more generalized chips. But Nvidia isn’t taking this threat lying down. According to Reuters, the company has met with Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and OpenAI to discuss building custom chips for them.\n\nIn addition to rivals, Nvidia continues to contend with US export restrictions on its most powerful chips to China. While the company has said that the ban won’t impact its financial situation at the moment, it has expressed concern that the measure could cause it to miss out on potential sales in the future.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "20 Most Carbon Productive Companies in the World",
        "content": "In this article, we will look into the 20 most carbon-productive companies in the world. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Most Carbon Productive Companies in the World.\n\nGlobal Carbon Emissions Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by the International Energy Agency, global carbon dioxide emissions increased 0.9% in 2022 and reached 36.8 billion tonnes. Globally, the emissions trajectory presented various paths. European Union's emissions declined by 2.5% in 2022, whereas the United States witnessed an increase of 0.8% in its emissions. Emissions in Asia's emerging and developing countries, except China, surged by 4.2% in 2022. Fossil fuels remained the major factor contributing to global GHG emissions. Coal alone reached record-high emissions of 15.5 giga-tonnes. Oil and gas rose to 2.5% and 1.8% respectively in 2022. Overall, global carbon emissions were still less than expected, compared to an over 6% rise in 2021. This can be attributed to the rise in the use of electric vehicles and energy-efficient alternatives, signifying the role of the companies in global GHG emissions. Clean energy deployment globally resulted in dodging an additional 550 million tonnes of emissions.\n\nExecutive Director IEA, Fatih Birol, highlighted the importance of companies working toward cutting down their emissions, he said:\n\n“The impacts of the energy crisis didn’t result in the major increase in global emissions that was initially feared – and this is thanks to the outstanding growth of renewables, EVs, heat pumps and energy efficient technologies. Without clean energy, the growth in CO2 emissions would have been nearly three times as high. However, we still see emissions growing from fossil fuels, hindering efforts to meet the world’s climate targets. International and national fossil fuel companies are making record revenues and need to take their share of responsibility, in line with their public pledges to meet climate goals. It’s critical that they review their strategies to make sure they’re aligned with meaningful emissions reductions.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe growing emissions demand innovative and sustainable measures by major economies. The European Union stands at the forefront of the positive change. On January 17, Reuters reported that the EU aims to capture and store up to 450 million tonnes of carbon dioxide annually by 2050, to reach its net-zero goals. The draft plan focuses on the cement and chemical sectors in the region. The captured CO2 would be used in industrial processes. This transition will require the companies in Europe to transform their production methods and shift toward green energy.\n\nCarbon Productive Companies: At A Glance\n\nSome of the major carbon productive companies include Assicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (OTC:ARZGY), Wheaton Precious Metals Corp. (NYSE:WPM), Sun Life Financial Inc. (NYSE:SLF), and Autodesk, Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK).\n\nAssicurazioni Generali S.p.A. (OTC:ARZGY) is one of the largest insurance and financial services providers in the world.

Here’s high street stalwart Sir John Timpson on what businesses can learn from her legacy:\n\nAnita was an integral part of The Body Shop brand. By putting her personal principles on the line, using third world suppliers and campaigning against animal cruelty she won over a big band of customers and set ethical standards for others to follow. She was one of the few entrepreneurs who proved that you can be nice and make money ...\n\nTo survive, businesses need to change. The Body Shop was an amazing brand, but the shops needed reinventing to still be a high street favourite in 2024 and appeal to the original customers’ children and grandchildren.\n\nAs a pioneer, Anita was bound to have competitors keen to follow her success. Market leaders must keep ahead of the game - Lush (you sniff the scent before you see their shop) prospered by following The Body Shop’s formula, and Bath and Body Shop has been a strong rival in the US. The Body Shop became trapped by its heritage – the shops look little different from 30 years ago, in contrast with Greggs, which over the last decade has been a masterclass in retail development.\n\nDid the brand miss Anita? Of course it did. She was a one-off. It was tough for the L’Oréal team to follow in her footsteps. A corporate professional management team is bound to find it difficult to replace an inspirational leader who ran the company using intuition, flair and moral principles rather than key performance indicators, management accounts and algorithms ...\n\nWhat can we learn from The Body Shop? At Timpson, we have taken 50 years to evolve from a specialist shoe repairer to a chain of multi-service shops with a strong culture of trust and kindness that we call upside down management, but we cannot stand still. To survive into the next century we must continue to innovate while keeping our company culture.\n\nIt helps being a family business – The Body Shop was never going to lose its ethical principles while Anita was at the helm. We will always need a chief executive who has our values ingrained in their heart. A professional manager from elsewhere would save money by cutting the colleague benefits that created our success. Succession planning is vital. Every Timpson line manager is homegrown and all new starters (including two of my grandchildren) are taught why trust, freedom and kindness matter so much. Sir John Timpson believes Anita Roddick was a 'one off' - Paul Cooper\n\n04:08 PM GMT\n\n'Punchy' review by Barclays causing investors to react 'with glee'\n\nShares in Barclays are up 9.26pc so far today after giving a big update to the City. Kathleen Brooks, research director at onlike broker XTB, has more:\n\nBarclays’ strategic review was punchy, and it essentially boils down to two things: cut costs aggressively and boost profits and continue to return capital to shareholders, to the tune of £10bn by 2026. This is exactly the type of message that shareholders love at the moment, and it is why the market has reacted with glee on Tuesday morning.\n\nBarclays is reorganizing into five new operating divisions, with more focus on the retail bank and a wealth management arm. Investment banking will still be one of the five divisions, although with less allocation of capital and in future the IB arm will get 50pc compared to 63pc currently.\n\nBarclays new financial targets set a high bar: a 12pc return on tangible equity. The return on equity in the investment bank was 7pc last year, so this division will have the furthest to go to reach this target. The $30bn revenue target for 2026, which is 13pc above analyst estimates, is a brave move from Barclays, and the bank has only given itself three years to do this.\n\nIt’s not quite a moon shot, but it does require a laser focus on not only the bottom line, but maximizing revenue opportunities, and building a greater institution than what Barclays is today. However, that will require job cuts, although management were not willing to give a specific headcount target ...\n\nInterestingly, Barclays is also bullish on the UK, saying that the country has come out of Covid, and that the Brexit situation has normalised.\n\nIt wants to be in the UK to ‘do business and from which to do business’, which is a sign that Barclays is not leaving the UK in order to get exposure to Europe. The focus seems to be on its UK and US consumer businesses, and its wealth management arm, which is likely to be a global business.

Hannah Boland reports:\n\nThe drugmaker is asking investors to green-light changes that will allow Mr Soriot, who is already the FTSE 100’s highest paid chief executive, to earn up to 300pc of his salary through a performance-linked bonus.\n\nThe changes, if approved, will take his maximum pay package to £18.7m.\n\nMr Soriot was paid a record £16.9m last year, according to AstraZeneca’s 2023 annual report. He is already the highest paid chief executive on the FTSE 100, according to the High Pay Centre.\n\nThe proposed bonus changes come as AstraZeneca races to keep pace with its overseas rivals who have boosted pay deals significantly in recent years. Last year, Pfizer handed chief Albert Bourla a 36pc pay rise to $33m (£26m), while AbbVie paid its chief executive $26m. Moderna boss Stephane Bancel took home $19.4m.\n\nAstraZeneca said increasing Mr Soriot’s maximum bonus would bring his pay package “in line with the median target bonus opportunity of his global peer group”.\n\nMr Soriot’s pay has sparked investors’ backlashes in the past. In 2021, almost 40pc of shareholders voted against a proposal to increase his maximum bonus. Mr Soriot said at the time that the policy needed to be “sorted out” to attract talent to replace him once he decided to leave.\n\nAn AstraZeneca spokesman said “The recommendation from the board’s Remuneration Committee reflects the need to be competitive in the global market for talent.”\n\nThey said the adjustments only applied to the discretionary bonus and share elements of remuneration and “so are not guaranteed payments”.\n\nThe spokesman added: “Over the past three years the total shareholder return has been 40pc, far exceeding the average of our peers in Europe and globally, and also the stock exchanges in London and the Nasdaq in New York.” Pascal Soriot at a breakfast with the Chancellor, Jeremy Hunt, last May - HM Treasury\n\n03:38 PM GMT\n\nNational Express owner hit by investigation into Germany business\n\nThe owner of National Express has been forced to launch a review of its German train business, triggering a 10pc slump in its share price. James Warrington reports:\n\nLondon-listed Mobico said it needed to carry out a further investigation into “accounting judgements” made relating to its rail division in Germany, including during its 2022 financial year.\r\n\r\nBosses said the company would delay its latest annual results to give it time to conduct the review, as well as to allow Deloitte to carry out its audit.\r\n\r\nShares in Mobico plunged as much as 20pc in early trading before trimming losses. The company’s shares are down almost 40pc in the last year, leaving it with a market value of around £470m.\r\n\r\nMobico, which operates regional train services in northern Germany, said trading in the region had been hit by driver shortages and volatile energy prices.\r\n\r\nAs a result, it warned an onerous contract provision on its rail business would be between £40m and £70m higher than previously expected.\r\n\r\nThe travel group, which rebranded from National Express last summer, has struggled to restore passenger numbers to pre-pandemic levels, while its profitability has been hit by higher costs.\r\n\r\nMobico’s shares tumbled by more than a quarter to an all-time low in October after it slashed profit forecasts and suspended its dividend.

He said:\n\nThis has resulted in pockets of the UK equity market being valued significantly below the true value of the businesses.\n\nUnless this changes, it seems likely that we will continue to see overseas corporate buyers step in to take advantage of the depressed valuations of UK equities with ownership falling into foreign hands and the number of quoted UK businesses will continue to decline.\n\nWe believe that a healthy equity market is beneficial to the functioning of the economy and would urge the relevant UK authorities to take action to incentivise investors to allocate to UK equities and save an integral cog of the country’s financial eco-system.\n\nWith that, I will say goodbye for the day and pass you over to Alex Singleton.

The data here can be revised.\n\nI remember well coming onto this committee and it was in my early days [on the Monetary Policy Committee] and I was asked about the possibility of a triple dip recession. It turned out we didn’t even have two dips because the numbers got revised.\n\nThe risk of this technical thing is there is not some sudden enormous difference that happens when you go from plus point one to minus point one, especially in an environment of relatively weak trend.\n\n11:12 AM GMT\n\nBritain's definition of recession 'unhelpful' says Bank of England deputy governor\n\nThe Deputy Governor of the Bank of England has hit out at the “unhelpful” description of Britain’s economy of being in a recession.\n\nAppearing on the Treasury Select Committee, Ben Broadbent said there was not a “sudden enormous difference” when the UK economy shifted from GDP growth of 0.1pc to a contraction of 0.1pc.\n\nTwo quarters in a row of such contractions are defined as a recession, but he said that this was not significant at a time when the UK economy has experienced low growth for a long period.\n\nTo nods from Governor Andrew Bailey, Mr Broadbent told MPs:\n\nI do find this technical definition unhelpful, frankly. If you go back to the decade before the financial crisis and a period of very good economic growth, trend supply growth in the UK was we think very close to 3pc a year - 0.7pc more than that per quarter.\n\nZero is a long way from that and you need quite a big departure from trend to get zero growth.\n\nNow I think trend supply growth is less than one. Indeed, productivity has fallen over the last year and in that environment, whether or not you happen to be technically plus point one or minus point one is a tiny difference and it is much easier as it were just by the normal volatility of the data to get those numbers.\n\n10:51 AM GMT\n\nBritain in 'very weak recession,' says Bailey\n\nBritain’s recession is the “weakest by a long way” since the 1970s, according to the Governor of the Bank of England, as he defended keeping interest rates at 16-year highs of 5.25pc.\n\nAndrew Bailey told MPs on the Treasury Select Committee:\n\nThe two successive quarters - ie Q3 and Q4 last year - cumulatively add up to minus 0.5pc on GDP.\n\nIf you look at recessions going back to the 1970s this is the weakest by a long way because the range for those two quarter numbers for all the previous recessions was something like 2.5pc to 22pc.\n\nMinus 0.5 is a very weak recession.\n\n10:43 AM GMT\n\nInterest rates could be cut before inflation hits 2pc, Bailey suggests\n\nThe governor of the Bank of England has said that inflation does not need to reach the Bank’s 2pc before it starts cutting interest rates.\n\nHe told the Treasury Select Committee:\n\nI’m looking for more sustained progress on ... three things which really are the more persistent elements.\n\nWe’ve seen, I think, encouraging signs on them. So, services inflation is still above 6pc, there are some signs of it coming down now.\n\nI think some signs that pay is now adjusting down towards the lower headline inflation, which is what I’d expect to see.\n\nThe quantity side of the labour market remains tight, there’s no question about that.\n\nBut it’s the progress of those three things.\n\nWe don’t need inflation to come back to target before we cut interest rates, I must be very clear on that, that’s not necessary.\n\nWe’ll be looking for sustained progress on those things to reach that judgment about how long this period of restrictive policy needs to be.\n\n10:35 AM GMT\n\nEconomy already showing 'distinct signs of an upturn,' says Bailey\n\nAndrew Bailey has raised hopes that Britain’s “very small recession” may already be over amid “distinct signs of an upturn”.\n\nThe Governor of the Bank of England told MPs that policymakers were looking for progress on services prices, wage growth and the labour market before they felt they could begin reducing interest rates, despite Britain falling into recession.\n\nBorrowing costs have been held at 16-year highs of 5.25pc for the last four meetings of the Monetary Policy Committee.\n\nHowever, pressure is growing on the Bank to bring down interest rates amid falling inflation and as official figures showed Britain fell into a recession in the second half of 2023.\n\nAppearing in front of the Treasury Select Committee, he said:\n\nWe’ve had this period of rapid disinflation, we’ve had restrictive monetary policy but in all the measures we use the economy appears to be at full employment. That is a very good story.\n\nWe don’t want unemployment rising rapidly. It has happened in the past when we’ve taken these sorts of actions, so I would just say against a lot of talk of what we think is going to be a very small recession, we think the economy is already actually showing distinct signs of an upturn.\n\n10:09 AM GMT\n\nGas prices muted as wind power whirls\n\nWholesale gas prices have remained subdued amid unusually mild weather and strong wind power generation.\n\nEurope’s benchmark contract was last up 1pc but remains below €24 per megawatt hour after nearing an eight-month low on Monday.\n\nDutch front-month futures have fallen 40pc since October amid robust wind generation and warm temperatures keeping a lid on demand.\n\nIn Britain, wind turbines accounted for more than 45pc of the nation’s energy needs, above 24pc for gas. The UK equivalent gas contract was last up 0.9pc but trading below 59p per therm.\n\n09:39 AM GMT\n\nBooming travel demand sends Holiday Inn owner's profits past $1bn\n\nHoliday Inn owner InterContinental Hotels Group (IHG) revealed full-year profits rose to more than $1bn (£794m) for the first time in its history thanks to booming travel demand.\n\nThe company pledged to launch a new $800m (£635m) share buyback programme, which together with ordinary dividends is expected to return more than $1bn to shareholders in 2024.\n\nOperating profits were up 23pc on the previous year after revenues increased 19pc, as pre-tax profits nearly doubled to £1bn from $540m (£429m) in 2022.\n\nIHG, which also owns chains including Crowne Plaza and Regent, said revenue per available room - a key performance measure for hotel companies - lifted 16.1pc over the year, and was 7.6pc higher in the final three months of 2023.\n\nIn a sign of the bounce-back in travel, it said global revenue per available room was 10.9pc higher than in 2019, before the pandemic struck.\n\nElie Maalouf, IHG’s recently appointed chief executive, said:\n\nTravel demand was strong across all markets, with revenue per available room up 16% on last year and 11% ahead of the 2019 pre-pandemic peak.\n\nThe travel industry has attractive, long-term drivers of demand.

The one-year rate was last lowered in August.\n\nChina’s shares finished higher, having initially fallen following the announcement.

A coherent strategy is needed for future success but is an uphill battle.\n\n07:49 AM GMT\n\nBarclays cuts boss' pay as bank sets out £2bn restructure\n\nBarclays’ annual report revealed that chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan, who is known as Venkat, was awarded £4.6m in pay and bonuses for 2023, including a £1.4m annual bonus.\n\nHis total pay package was down from £5.2m in 2022.\n\nThe group has also awarded the top boss and chief financial officer Anna Cross a 2.5pc annual salary rise to £2.9m and £1.8m respectively from March 1.\n\nIts report showed that bankers at the group shared a £1.75bn bonus pool for 2023, down 3pc on the previous year, although 2022’s payouts included a reduction of about £500m for “risk and control issues”.\n\nBarclays said in the report: “The risk and conduct adjustments to the 2023 incentive pool are materially less than those for 2022, so the incentive pool before risk adjustments each year fell by around 15pc from 2023 to 2022.” Barclays chief executive CS Venkatakrishnan took a reduction in pay last year\n\n07:47 AM GMT\n\nWatchdog ramps up pressure on baby formula makers as prices surge\n\nCompetition regulators have said they will scrutinise Britain’s infant formula market after prices soared by 25pc over the last two years.\n\nThe Competition and Markets Authority said it would launch a market study after the rising cost of baby milk formula came into the spotlight during the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nIt means the regulator will be able to force suppliers to provide information on pricing and other issues, instead of relying on voluntary submissions.\n\nNestle and Danone are amongst the companies which supply baby formula in Britain through brands such as SMA Nutrition and Cow & Gate.\n\nThe regulator said it would aim to publish its final report in September 2024, adding that it would consider whether there are problems in the baby formula market and if so what actions should be taken to address these.\n\nCMA chief executive Sarah Cardell said that the cost of infant milk remained at “historically high levels” even after prices fell over the last three months.

The shareholder handout will come in the form of buybacks and dividends.\n\nVenkat said: “Our new three-year plan, which we will be announcing at the investor update today, is designed to further improve Barclays’ operational and financial performance, driving higher returns, and predictable, attractive shareholder distributions.”\n\nThe bank took a £927m hit from restructuring as pre-tax profits slumped by 12pc to £6.6bn in 2023, slightly lower than forecasts and below the £7bn from last year.\n\nProfits were dented by a large restructuring charge in the final three months of 2023.\n\nIncome was £25.4bn, up slightly from the £25bn recorded in 2022.\n\nVenkat also upgraded the return on tangible equity from 10pc to 12pc by 2026, the first upgrade for seven years.\n\nThe 58-year-old is under pressure to revive the bank’s fortunes. Since taking over more than two years ago the shares in the company have fallen by 27pc.\n\nThe overhaul is the first since 2014, when former chief Antony Jenkins tried to trim back the investment bank after replacing former investment bank boss Bob Diamond.\n\nHe left shortly after the shake-up to be replaced by former JP Morgan banker Jes Staley.\n\nVenkat was parachuted into the role in November 2021 after former chief executive Jes Staley stood down to battle allegations about his links to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein, the sex offender.\n\nThe FCA later found Staley had not been frank about his relationship with Epstein, although he is appealing the decision.

        "title": "US Supreme Court won't review Apple's win against $503 million patent verdict",
        "content": "By Blake Brittain\n\nWASHINGTON, Feb 20 (Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Tuesday declined to hear patent-licensing company VirnetX's bid to revive a $502.8 million jury verdict it won against Apple in a dispute over internet-security patents.\n\nThe justices turned away Zephyr Cove, Nevada-based VirnetX's appeal of a lower court's decision to overturn the verdict against Cupertino, California-based Apple that had been reached by a jury in Tyler, Texas. VirnetX had challenged the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office's decisions to invalidate its patents.\n\nApple and VirnetX have waged a 14-year-long court battle over VirnetX's internet-security patents that has included several trials and appeals.\n\nThe jury awarded VirnetX $502.8 million in 2020 after a separate jury determined that Apple's iPhones and iPads infringed patents related to virtual private networks.\n\nThe patent office's Patent Trial and Appeal Board allows petitioners to challenge the validity of specific patents. The process, known as inter partes review (IPR), is often used by big tech companies that are frequently targeted with patent lawsuits to contest patents they are accused of infringing.\n\nThe board rejected Apple's requests to invalidate the patents under the IPR process after it found that Apple had waited too long to file its petitions. The board later declared the patents invalid based on separate requests from hedge fund Mangrove Partners in cases that Apple was allowed to join.\n\nThe patent-focused U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit upheld the decisions to invalidate the patents and overturned the verdict last year. VirnetX had told the Supreme Court that letting the rulings stand would incentivize the \"harassment\" of patent owners at the board.\n\n\"A veritable cottage industry has sprung up,\" VirnetX said. \"Entities with no discernable stake file IPR petitions challenging patents successfully asserted in litigation - only for well-heeled but time-barred infringement defendants to conveniently join the proceedings and shoulder the cost.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nVirnetX cited a patent board case in which patent office director Kathi Vidal imposed sanctions on an entity called OpenSky Industries for attempting to extort both sides in a multi-billion-dollar dispute between Intel and patent owner VLSI Technology. Vidal removed OpenSky from the case based on its misconduct, and the tribunal allowed the challenge to a VLSI patent to continue with Intel leading it.\n\nVirnetX also argued that former patent office interim director Drew Hirshfeld, who presided before Vidal was appointed, exceeded his authority by denying VirnetX's requests for director review of the decisions.\n\nApple and Mangrove responded that VirnetX's arguments were not supported by applicable federal law. President Joe Biden's administration, representing the patent office, also urged the justices to reject the case.\n\nVirnetX previously won $440 million from Apple based on a 2016 verdict that the tech giant used its security technology in features like FaceTime video calls.

        "content": "Apple, Tesla downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nDeutsche Bank upgraded Southwest (LUV) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $42, up from $28. The firm believes more moderate domestic available seat mile growth for 2024 will have positive implications for domestic unit revenue performance, and by extension, should translate into solid sales performance for the domestic-focused names. As such, Deutsche upgraded Alaska (ALK), JetBlue (JBLU), and Southwest to Buy from Hold. Meanwhile, Bernstein also upgraded Southwest to Market Perform from Underperform with a price target of $32, up from $26. UBS upgraded US Foods (USFD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $64, up from $47. Following the company's Q4 results, UBS is becoming more bullish on US Foods based on expectations for further market share gains on the back of sales force investments and its differentiated tech platform as well as higher conviction that the company's EBITDA growth trajectory is sustainable. Piper Sandler also upgraded US Foods to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $59, up from $45. B. Riley upgraded Brunswick (BC) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $108, up from $100. The firm upgrades the shares following positive indications from the Miami International Boat Show around underlying demand trends, market share upside, increased moves to boost operating margins, and overall 2024 guidance conservatism.  Wolfe Research upgraded Freshworks (FRSH) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $27 price target. The firm sees the combination of improving fundamentals, execution, and competitive dynamics supporting multi-year 20% revenue growth with expanding margins for the company.  Mizuho upgraded LivaNova (LIVN) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $70, up from $60. The company has a \"well-hedged path\" to either 20-plus annual earnings growth over the next three years or upside optionality based on outcome of the RECOVER trial by mid-year, the firm tells investors in a research note.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nPhillip Securities downgraded Apple (AAPL) to Neutral from Accumulate with an unchanged price target of $194. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the stock's recent gains, but says it expects Services to continue being Apple's main growth driver as its installed base increases. Phillip Securities downgraded Tesla (TSLA) to Neutral from Accumulate with a $175 price target. The near-term outlook for Tesla \"looks quite bleak, with the company set on sacrificing margins and growth also slowing,\" the firm tells investors in a research note. Phillip Securities downgraded Airbnb (ABNB) to Neutral from Buy with a $150 price target, down from $157. The firm cites valuation for the downgrade following the recent rally and a slowdown in booking volumes for the downgrade. Evercore ISI downgraded Caterpillar (CAT) to In Line from Outperform with a price target of $338, up from $321. The downgrade is not so much company specific as it is a call to take profits on the group, the firm tells investors in a research note. Argus downgraded Johnson Controls(JCI) to Hold from Buy. The firm sees the stock's current valuations as reasonable given the company's reduced growth outlook due to the recent cybersecurity attack.\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nSeaport Research initiated coverage of Booking Holdings(BKNG) with a Buy rating and $4,380 price target. The firm is positive on Booking's fundamentals saying the company is the clear leader in global online accommodations, with particular strength in Europe and Asia.  Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of BrightSpring Health (BTSG) with a Buy rating and $26 price target. The firm expects strong growth, emergence of medium-term upside drivers, acquisition execution and de-levering progress to be key drivers of the stock closing the valuation gap relative to peers. Jefferies, Wells Fargo, Leerink, BofA, UBS, and Morgan Stanley also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings, while Deutsche Bank initiated the stock with a Hold. Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of ArriVent Biopharma(AVBP) with a Buy rating and $27 price target. The firm anticipates clinical success of furmonertinib in a subset of non-small cell lung cancer. Citi and Jefferies also started coverage of the name with Buy-equivalent ratings. UBS initiated coverage of Morgan Stanley Direct Lending(MSDL) with a Buy rating and $23.50 price target. Over the next 12-18 months, the firm expects the company to generate attractive returns and avoid significant credit issues, assuming the economy avoids a recession. JPMorgan and Wells Fargo started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while RBC Capital initiated the stock with an Outperform. JMP Securities initiated coverage of Nuveen Churchill Direct Lending(NCDL) with a Market Perform rating. The firm believes there could be an opportunity for valuation multiple expansion over time, but says this will likely take some time to play out, assuming strong execution. UBS and Wells Fargo also started coverage of the name with Neutral-equivalent ratings, while Truist and BofA started the stock with Buy.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s Chief Operating Officer Jeff Williams is on a rare visit to Taiwan to celebrate the 50th anniversary of Foxconn, the company that helped build the iPhone empire by assembling those devices to exacting standards in factories across China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nLargest Covid Vaccine Study Yet Finds Links to Health Conditions Capital One to Buy Discover for $35 Billion in Year's Biggest Deal  Amazon Deserves to Be Called Out for Swindling Users A $6 Trillion Wall of Cash Is Holding Firm as Fed Delays Cuts Wall Street’s Moelis Bet Big on the Middle East. Now He’s Cashing In\n\nIn Taipei on Tuesday night, Williams was joined by Apple’s senior vice president of operations, Sabih Khan, as a guest of honor at a gala celebration, according to people familiar with the matter. Also present were SoftBank Group Corp. Chief Executive Officer Masayoshi Son and Arm Holdings Plc boss Rene Haas, the people said, asking not to be named as the event was private.\n\nIt was an uncommon trip for Williams, whose last public appearance in Taiwan was in 2017 for Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co.’s 30th anniversary celebration. The occasion was also a rare moment for Taiwan to host so many leaders from the global tech industry at a single event. Foreign executives often opt for low-key visits to Taiwan so as to avoid a reaction from China, which claims the island as part of its territory.\n\nWilliams is among Apple’s most senior executives under CEO Tim Cook, who hasn’t visited Taiwan in an official capacity in more than a decade of leading the company. Cook makes regular trips to China, which hosts Apple’s key production base and is one of the firm’s largest markets. But he’s mostly avoided Taiwan, and he last made a public appearance on the island in 2008 for Foxconn founder Terry Gou’s wedding.\n\nRepresentatives for Apple, SoftBank and Arm did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAlso known as Hon Hai Precision Industry Co., Foxconn is a mainstay in Apple’s production and assembly chain, helping to navigate challenges like the logistics and supply snarls caused by the pandemic. Apple has leaned on Foxconn and other Taiwanese partners more recently to shift some iPhone assembly to India, as it grapples with how to diversify its supply chain in the face of escalating US tech restrictions on China.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoftBank’s Son and Foxconn’s Gou have been longtime business partners. Foxconn helped assemble SoftBank’s humanoid robot Pepper, though that project eventually faltered.\n\nTaiwan’s Vice Premier Cheng Wen-tsan and Minister of Economic Affairs Wang Mei-hua joined Foxconn’s celebrations, with Chairman Young Liu hosting the event.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars Gene Therapy Makers Struggle to Find Patients for Miracle Cures Pursuing ‘American Dynamism,’ Andreessen Horowitz Ups Its Game in DC How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Tim Cook\n\nDrying out a wet phone in a bowl of uncooked rice is a time-tested hack that has seemingly rescued many a device.\n\nBut Apple has now told iPhone users to stop using the method to fix waterlogged handsets, warning that it could actually cause more damage.\n\nA guide to fixing soaked phones, newly published on Apple’s website, warns users: “Don’t put your iPhone in a bag of rice. Doing so could allow small particles of rice to damage your iPhone.”\n\nWhile the guidance flies in the face of folk wisdom, it appears to confirm tests that suggest rice is a poor way of absorbing moisture from a stricken phone.\n\nApple’s guidance also states that users should not try to dry out iPhones using a hairdryer, or by inserting absorbent items into ports.\n\nInstead, it says people should tap their phones with the charging port facing down and wait.\n\nUsing rice as a way to dry out phones is believed to have originated from advice to photographers seeking to keep their cameras dry in humid climates.\n\nHowever, it is widely understood to be a poor desiccant – a substance that absorbs moisture from other sources – compared to alternatives such as silica gel packets that electronic devices are often packaged with.\n\nThe rice trick is believed to have persisted because covering a phone in rice means owners are not attempting to charge phones – which is more likely to cause permanent damage to a wet device.\n\niPhones and other smartphones have become more water-resistant in recent years as materials improve.\n\nThe latest iPhones can survive for up to 30 minutes in up to six metres of water, according to Apple, as well as surviving spills from drinks.\n\nWater damage typically comes through the phone’s charging port, although iPhones now prevent charging if they detect liquids in the area.\n\nAny attempt to charge a wet phone will trigger an alert warning owners to wait for the device to dry out.",

        "title": "TSLA Stock Analysis: Is Tesla’s Astronomical Valuation a House of Cards?",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) remains the world’s most valuable car company. Despite the stock being down almost 20% so far this year, it entered trade on February 19 with a market cap of $637 billion. This is the starting point for my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nThat’s more than twice the value of Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM), which sits in second at $306 billion. The second most valuable U.S. car company, Ford Motor (NYSE:F), is worth $55 billion.\n\nBut how big is Tesla, really? Tesla sales last year came to $96 billion. Toyota had $247 billion. Ford had $176 billion. Tesla saw nearly $15 billion in net income, but Toyota had over $16 billion. (Ford had just $4 billion.)\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe question for today is, without Elon Musk, would Tesla still be worth a premium?\n\nTesla Strengths\n\nTesla earned its advantage over Toyota, and the rest of the industry, by building out the infrastructure for EV production and making it profitable.\n\nBut profitability is stalling. Auto revenue was no better in the fourth quarter, at $21 billion, than the year before. Services, including charges for the software running in Tesla cars, saved the quarter, adding 10% to total revenue.\n\nThis is the argument Tesla fans have always made, that it’s less a product company like Toyota and more a services business like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Services at Apple represent just 19% of revenue.\n\nTesla fans also love its battery business, which was worth $6 billion last year. Tesla has a huge battery plant in Nevada, but the Inflation Reduction Act means competitors are building their own plants. Tesla is also assembling batteries made by Chinese giant CATL, which is building a plant in Michigan for Ford. CATL is worth an estimated $100 billion.\n\nIt seems Tesla’s strengths are weakening.\n\nTesla Weaknesses\n\nTesla’s weaknesses are also strengthening.\n\nThe biggest weakness is its product line, which needs a complete refresh. The cars all look like Toyota’s Camry. The Camry will soon be hybrid-only, a power system American buyers prefer because the gas engine eliminates range anxiety.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis is where the market battle will be fought, with Toyota believing full electrics will never get more than 30% of the global market, due to lagging infrastructure.\n\nFord and General Motors (NYSE:GM) agree with Toyota. Today’s batteries are too heavy for the huge pick-ups on which American companies make their money. This is a key part of my TSLA stock analysis.\n\nToyota is the big threat, which is why its stock is up 59% over the last year, against a 4% loss for Tesla. Tesla’s supply chain is all-electric. The value of Toyota’s $198 billion in property, against Tesla’s $60 billion, might be discounted. By how much?\n\nThen there’s the Tesla Cybertruck, which looks like a giant failure.  Meanwhile, Toyota is rolling out an electric version of its Tacoma truck, Ford and GM are building hybrids, and sales of the Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) electric are slowing.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nI can see why Tesla is still the most valuable American car company. But 13 times more? I can also see why Tesla would be worth what Toyota is. But twice as much?\n\nThe difference between Toyota’s valuation and Tesla’s is Elon Musk. Musk isn’t worth $330 billion to me.\n\nToyota will be facing the same competitors two years from now that it’s facing today. Tesla, with its all-electric line-up, will also be facing BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) and a host of other Chinese names.\n\nThe name of the EV game in 2025 will be producing a $25,000 car. That’s a price a middle-income family can afford. That’s what I paid for my current car. Toyota meets it, with its hybrids. BYD will meet it, with electrics.\n\nTesla won’t meet it. Sell it.

        "content": "With its highly anticipated introduction in 2007, the iPhone was the revolutionary hardware device that catapulted Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) to global fame. This smartphone, which is arguably one of the most successful products in history for any business, made the tech giant a global cultural icon.\n\nEven today, the iPhone is Apple's biggest moneymaker, generating $69.7 billion of revenue in the latest fiscal quarter (Q1 2024 ended Dec. 30), or 58% of the company's total. There's no question that the business is still well-known for this product, as well as other devices like the MacBook, iPad, AirPods, and Watch.\n\nHowever, the sale of hardware pales in comparison to another burgeoning segment when it comes to profitability. Chart Caption: Data Source: Statista, Chart by The Motley Fool\n\nCreating Apple's powerful ecosystem\n\nRepresenting 19% of Apple's revenue in the latest fiscal quarter, services posted sales growth of 11.3% on a year-over-year basis, faster than the products division, where sales were essentially flat. Services consist of various things, like advertising, AppleCare, iCloud, App Store, Arcade, Fitness+, Music, News+, TV+. Card, and Pay.\n\nNot only has this segment expanded at a rapid clip in recent years, but it also carries a stellar gross margin of 72.8%, much higher than the hardware devices. This is due to these offerings being digital in nature, thus having low marginal costs.\n\nBesides driving growth and improved profitability for the enterprise, services support Apple's entire ecosystem strategy. On their own, the installed global base of 2.2 billion active hardware devices would be just like other consumer electronics products on the market, lacking pricing power and being commoditized.\n\nHowever, Apple's software and subscriptions make the products much more valuable. They drive stickiness and customer loyalty.\n\nWarren Buffett once suggested that if a person was offered $10,000 on the condition that they could never use an iPhone again, they'd likely decline that offer. This demonstrates the importance of software and services.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut at a current price-to-earnings ratio of 28.4, some investors might take a pause before buying Apple stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the11 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Now. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nMarkets that were overjoyed a few weeks ago are now wavering as latest data shows inflation remains sticky and the Fed might not be ready to begin cutting interest rates before the summer of 2024.  In this environment experts are recommending holding on to big name stocks or large-cap companies that can weather economic storms and unexpected events in the market. Small-cap investors who were getting ready to see a rally amid hopes of rate cuts are expected to have a difficult time in 2024 until there's clarity and certainty around the Fed's next plan of action. On the other hand, large-cap stocks are continuing to see traction. A Wall Street Journal report cited Brent Lium, portfolio manager at Crossmark Global Investments, who said:\n\n“When you get nervous, people tend to go to, and hold on to, the names that they know and think of as the biggest and the best.\"\n\nOn the other hand, long-term analysts believe sooner or later the Federal Reserve would begin cutting rates and earnings growth and economic strength will drive the S&P 500 higher near the end of 2024. Goldman Sachs recently increased its year-end target for the S&P 500 to 5,200, up from its previous estimate of 5,100. Goldman Sachs's David Kostin said he expects mega-cap stocks' earnings strengths, especially those of the Magnificent Seven group of stocks, to drive the S&P 500 profits in 2024.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey's database of over 900 hedge funds and their holdings and picked 11 large-cap stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. These are big name stocks highly popular among smart money investors in 2024.Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).\n\nStory continues Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Now\n\n11. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 117\n\nBerkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the best big name stocks to buy right now according to smart money investors. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 117 hedge funds out of the 933 funds in Insider Monkey's database had stakes in Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B). The biggest stake in Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) is owned by Michael Larson's Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation Trust which owns a $7.1 billion stake in Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B).\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B) recently posted its 13F filings for the fourth quarter of 2023. These filings show the firm dumped its entire stakes in DR Horton, Stoneco Ltd., Global Life and Markel Group.\n\n10. Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 129\n\nUber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) is in the spotlight after Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) announced its first ever share buyback program according to which it will repurchase up to $7 billion of its common stock.\n\nUber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) has also given a three-year outlook during its latest investor day. For the first quarter of 2024, Uber expects gross bookings in the range of $37 billion to $38.5 billion, with adjusted EBITDA projected to be between $1.26 billion and $1.34 billion.\n\nAs of the end of the last quarter of 2023, 129 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER). The biggest stakeholder of Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER) during this period was D. E. Shaw's D E Shaw which owns an $886 million stake in Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE:UBER).\n\nRiverPark Advisors made the following comment about Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER): UBER was the top contributor in the quarter following a better-than-expected 2Q23 earnings report and 3Q23 guidance. Gross bookings of $33.6 billion were up 16% year over year. Mobility gross bookings of $17 billion grew 25% over last year driven by a combination of product innovation and driver availability. Delivery gross bookings of $16 billion were up 12% from last year. 2Q Adjusted EBITDA of $916 million, up $552 million year over year, significantly beat Street estimates of $845 million and the company generated $1.1 billion of free cash flow. Management guided to continuing growth in 3Q Gross Bookings (17%-20% growth) and Adjusted EBITDA (of $975-1,025 million).\n\nUBER remains the undisputed global leader in ride sharing, with a greater than 50% share in every major region in which it operates. The company is also a leader in food delivery, where it is number one or two in the more than 25 countries in which it operates. Moreover, after a history of losses, the company is now profitable, delivering expanding margins and substantial free cash flow. We view UBER as more than just ride sharing and food delivery, but also as a global mobility platform with the ability to sell to its 130 million users (by comparison, Amazon Prime has 200 million members) and penetrate new markets of on-demand services, such as package and grocery delivery, travel, and worker staffing for shift work. Given its $4.3 billion of unrestricted cash and $4.4 billion of investments, the company’s enterprise value of $95 billion equates to just over 20x next year’s estimated free cash flow.”\n\n9. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nSalesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) has been making waves ever since the generative AI revolution began. Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) is integrating AI features with its CRM platform and other products and services.\n\nLast month, BofA analyst Brad Sills added the stock to his top picks for 2024 list. The analyst praised Salesforce Inc's (NYSE:CRM) installed base of over 150,000 customers and said Salesforce had a competitive moat and more runway to continue growing at 15% and more organically in the years to come.\n\nAs of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023, 131 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM), up from 122 funds in the previous quarter. This shows a spike in hedge fund sentiment for Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM).\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\n8. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 131\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) may be late to the AI party but it could become a formidable player in the industry as new reports suggest that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is getting ready to launch a generative AI tool for iOS developers. Citi in a latest note said Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) upcoming developer conference could act as an AI catalyst for the stock. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also reportedly working on launching new AI features for its next version of macOS, Apple Music and Spotlight search.\n\nA total of 131 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023. The most notable stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is owned by Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway which owns a $174 billion stake in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nMairs & Power Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“The Fund’s relative performance was negatively impacted by what we didn’t own as well. In particular, not holding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) for most of the year cost the Fund more than 300bps (basis points) of performance. Apple may be the best-known company in the world and its seemingly ubiquitous iPhone holds a dominant share of the global cell phone market. Apple is even more dominant among Millennials and Gen Zers, which should lead to even greater market share as these cohorts age. This loyal user base should pay huge dividends for shareholders as Apple continues to monetize this ecosystem, especially as the company delves deeper into services, payments, and AI. We initiated a position in Apple during the fourth quarter and await a more attractive entry point to add to our position.”\n\n7. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 141\n\nMastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) ranks seventh in our list of the best big name stocks to buy now. As of the end of the fourth quarter of 2023,  141 hedge funds out of the 933 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in the payments giant Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA).\n\nLast month Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) posted fourth quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $3.18, beating estimates by $0.10. Revenue in the quarter jumped 13% year over year to $6.5 billion, surpassing estimates by $20 million.\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) (7.21% weight in the Fund): Payment companies are data companies. As we discussed last quarter in our write up of Mastercard, merchants can generate significant value from analyzing payment data to better understand their customers. Mastercard has long built AI-based products to enhance payment security and provide merchants with rich data analytics. In December, they rolled out Muse, a new online shopping companion that merchants who utilize certain Mastercard services can install on their own websites.\n\nMuse seeks to replicate the instore experience of working with a salesclerk by allowing the customer to use natural language to browse products. Online shopping already works well if you know exactly what you are looking for, but Muse is striving to help customers find things to buy even when they aren’t sure what they are looking for.\n\nMastercard (7.21% weight in the Fund): In late October, Mastercard reported earnings that investors interpreted as pointing to a near term slowdown in payment growth. The stock fell 5.6% on the day. By the end of the next week, the stock had recovered its losses and went on to reach a new all time high on the last day of the year. But the 7.9% gain on the quarter slightly trailed the S&P 500.”\n\n6. Visa Inc (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 162\n\nVisa Inc (NYSE:V) last month posted fiscal Q1 results. While EPS beat estimates, the stock slipped as Visa Inc's (NYSE:V) payment volumes came in lower than expected. Visa Inc (NYSE:V) also increased its guidance for expense growth for fiscal 2024. Despite this, Visa Inc (NYSE:V) remains one of the top big name stocks to buy and hold according to smart money investors Visa Inc (NYSE:V) shares have gained about 26% over the past one year. With years of consistent dividend increases and a resilient business, retail and institutional investors prefer to buy and hold the stock during troubled times.\n\nA total of 162 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nIn its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\n\n“Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Now.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n13 Most Buzzing Stocks To Buy Now 13 Best Grocery Stocks To Buy Now 15 Best Affordable Stocks To Buy Now,\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best Big Name Stocks to Buy Right Nowis originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "The stock markets have been on a hot run for many months on the back of renewed enthusiasm due to rates and the continued run in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nUndoubtedly, last week’s consumer price index number was a bit of a setback. But, markets managed to move on from the disappointing (and a tad overheated) numbers the next day. Despite this market’s resilience, several stocks seem a bit expensive for their own good.\n\nSo, it remains unseen if the markets continue trending higher or take a breather at some point. The following Dow Jones stocks stand out as potential candidates to do some profit-taking or, at the very least, some subtle trimming ahead of Easter 2024. Let’s check out three Dow that appear lofty as markets look to make a run into overbought territory.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nIt pains me to put Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on a list of stocks to potentially look at trimming.\n\nBut, since running out of gas after briefly touching new highs at the end of 2023, few meaningful near-term catalysts could propel it above the $200 mark. Despite the rough start to 2024 and the handful of downgrades, AAPL is still off just 8% from its peak. Further, shares are still up nearly 20% over the past year. That’s a pretty good run for a firm that’s seen growth seriously stall in recent quarters.\n\nAdditionally, investors are longing for some sort of AI announcement, one that could continue to prove elusive in 2024. Further, Apple is trying to distance itself from controversies surrounding the most advanced generative AI products stealing headlines today. Undoubtedly, it’s hard to pull the curtain on even your most advanced generative AI offering. The Times recently filed suit against ChatGPT- and Sora-maker OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the use of its articles to train AI platforms.\n\nThough I think Apple will eventually have something big to deliver regarding AI, patience will be key. Why rush into a new technology before the full extent of the risks can be accessed?\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, Apple may play it cautiously on AI as other firms, like ChatGPT, look to take the risks that often accompany the awes of new technologies.\n\nThough I still love Apple (and am hanging onto shares), I’d rather wait for a bigger pullback before I’d consider buying more. For now, it stands out as more of a sell candidate for those looking to raise cash to put to work on timelier opportunities.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) IDEX stock: An electric tractor sits in a field on a sunny day with a wind turbine in the background.\n\nSource: Matthew Troke / Shutterstock.com\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) hit new all-time highs of over $320 per share recently, thanks in part to an incredible quarterly earnings result. How good were those earnings?\n\nThe firm achieved its “best year in our 98-year history,” according to CEO Jim Umpleby. That’s a quarter deserving of a round of applause. However, expectations have been raised. And given the cyclical nature of heavy-duty construction equipment, some may worry about a bust potentially lying on the other side of this boom.\n\nTiming a bust can be tricky, but I’m no fan of the risk/reward as the economy’s resilience is tested in 2024. For now, the company expects similar sales in the new year. But if the firm comes up short, there could be considerable downside.\n\nThough I don’t doubt Caterpillar’s ability to keep delivering, I think there’s too much optimism priced in right here. At 16.1 times trailing P/E, the industrial giant isn’t all too expensive. However, I’d be more comfortable getting in at much lower levels, perhaps closer to the $250 range.\n\nThe Travellers Companies (TRV) Red umbrella covering stacks of bills\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFinally, we have The Travellers Companies (NYSE:TRV). It also recently made a new all-time high on the back of an exceptional round of quarterly earnings. The company was firing on all cylinders from across the board, with core earnings and earnings per share numbers hitting quarterly records.\n\nCEO Alan Schnitzer views the AI opportunity as a profound way for the technology to give The Travelers Companies a jolt. The insurance company isn’t shying away from new trends in the AI scene. In fact, the firm has its own team seeking to harness the full power of AI. Though it’s unclear how AI tech can help improve underwriting, efficiencies, and other metrics, the firm’s willingness to invest in the technology is enough to deserve a premium to the peer group.\n\nHowever, at fresh new highs, with a P/E multiple (currently at 17.0 times trailing), that’s higher than the five-year historical average (of 13.9 times). I’d be more inclined to wait for shares to pull back a bit. Perhaps a better entry point will be in the cards over the next few months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds.\n\nThe US stock market's euphoria came crashing down recently when latest data showed inflation remains sticky and the soft landing scenario many had started to take as a given might not be easy to achieve. Ever since the inflation storm began, wise investors had been recommending piling into recession-proof, high-quality blue chip stocks that can weather economic volatility. While a single month's bad inflation numbers do not mean doom and gloom for the stock market, many analysts believe we are in for a long period of inflation and risks where low-quality stocks should be completely avoided. Russell Investments in its 2024 outlook report said that while recession was avoided in 2023, risks in 2024 are high because the consumer savings that protected Americans from recession last year are expected to be exhausted this year.\n\n\"Corporations and households built strong defenses against Fed tightening following the pandemic, accumulating large cash reserves and locking in low interest rates on 30-year mortgages and longer-term corporate bonds. These defenses, however, are beginning to crumble. Households will soon exhaust their excess savings, while significantly higher interest rates—which have become a constraint on new borrowing—will create refinancing issues. We think this cycle may be a case of this time is longer rather than this time is different with regards to the lagged impact of aggressive Fed tightening on the U.S. economy. Recession in 2024 might be avoided, but the risks are elevated.\"\n\nIn this environment it's important to see which blue chip stocks smart money investors are piling into.

Lilly’s stock continued to outperform driven by strong sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises, particularly after Novo Nordisk released its SELECT trial results showing a 20% relative risk reduction in overweight patients with cardiovascular disease and no prior history of diabetes.\n\nEli Lilly and Company is a global pharmaceutical company that discovers, develops, manufactures, and sells medicines in the categories of diabetes, oncology, neuroscience, and immunology, among other areas. Stock performance was strong due to strong third quarter sales of blockbuster diabetes medicine Mounjaro and ongoing enthusiasm surrounding the company’s obesity and diabetes franchises. We continue to think Lilly is well positioned to grow revenue and earnings at attractive rates through the end of the decade and beyond.\n\nWe own Eli Lilly and Company, which we believe will remain a leader in the GLP-1 medicine class with Mounjaro, Zepbound, and the company’s deep pipeline of next generation GLP-1 medicines.”\n\n11.

JPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 109\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co (NYSE:JPM) shares have gained about 21% over the past one year.

After a 31% For Vote on executive compensation in 2022, the Board will not be granting any special awards to Jamie Dimon or Daniel Pinto and if awarded to other Named Executive Officers, there will be a direct performance condition associated with the award. The Compensation Committee limited the cash percentage of Dimon and Pinto’s compensation.”\n\n9. Berkshire Hathaway Inc Class B (NYSE:BRK.B)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 116\n\nWarren Buffett's conglomerate Berkshire is one of the safest high-quality blue chip stocks one can buy in this market environment. Many call this stock equivalent of an ETF because of the company's diversification.\n\n8. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 134\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is undoubtedly one of the best blue chip stocks to buy and hold according to hedge funds. Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) products gain a lot of traction due to Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) innovation and brand name attraction. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is currently making waves with Apple Vision Pro, which the company calls spatial computer. Analysts are surprised to see the strong demand and attention the headset is getting all over the world.\n\nAfter Vision Pro, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is eyeing to launch a new kind of iPhone. The Information recently reported that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on foldable iPhones in various sizes.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\n7. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 140\n\nMastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) ranks seventh in our list of the best blue chip stocks to buy according to smart money investors. Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) has a dividend yield of about 0.57% as of February 8 while the company has upped its payouts consistently for over a decade now.\n\nA total of 140 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA). The biggest stake in Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA) is owned by Charles Akre's Akre Capital Management which owns a $2.3 billion stake in Mastercard Inc (NYSE:MA).\n\nEnsemble Capital Management stated the following regarding Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA) (7.21% weight in the Fund): Payment companies are data companies. As we discussed last quarter in our write up of Mastercard, merchants can generate significant value from analyzing payment data to better understand their customers. Mastercard has long built AI-based products to enhance payment security and provide merchants with rich data analytics. In December, they rolled out Muse, a new online shopping companion that merchants who utilize certain Mastercard services can install on their own websites.\n\nMuse seeks to replicate the instore experience of working with a salesclerk by allowing the customer to use natural language to browse products. Online shopping already works well if you know exactly what you are looking for, but Muse is striving to help customers find things to buy even when they aren’t sure what they are looking for.\n\nMastercard (7.21% weight in the Fund): In late October, Mastercard reported earnings that investors interpreted as pointing to a near term slowdown in payment growth. The stock fell 5.6% on the day. By the end of the next week, the stock had recovered its losses and went on to reach a new all time high on the last day of the year. But the 7.9% gain on the quarter slightly trailed the S&P 500.”\n\n6. Visa Inc (NYSE:V)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 167\n\nVisa Inc (NYSE:V) is one of the favorite stocks of smart money managers tracked by Insider Monkey.

Revenue in the period jumped 8.9% year over year to $8.6 billion, beating estimates by $50 million.\n\nOf the 910 hedge funds in Insider Monkey's database, 167 hedge funds had stakes in Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nIn its October 2023 investor letter, Lakehouse Capital stated the following regarding Visa Inc. (NYSE:V):\n\n“Visa Inc. (NYSE:V) reported a strong result with net revenue increasing 11% year-on-year to $8.6 billion and non-GAAP earnings per share increasing by 21% to $2.33. As has been the case for many years now, the scalable nature of the business allows for revenue growth to outpace its costs, which places the company in a good position to navigate through this inflationary period. The network continues to grow, with credentials and merchant locations up 7% and 17%, respectively. Cross-border travel-related spend also maintained its robust growth, increasing 26% year-on-year while Visa Direct reported 7.5 billion transactions, up 19% yearon-year, progressing on penetrating categories such as cross-border remittances. Altogether, we’re pleased with how the business is tracking and remain positive on Visa’s outlook.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see 5 Best Blue Chip Stocks To Invest In According to Hedge Funds.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years 10 Best Long-Term Tech Stocks To Buy 17 High Growth Non-Tech Stocks That Are Profitable\n\nDisclosure.

        "title": "Exit Now! 3 Tech Stocks to Sell in February 2024.",
        "content": "Tech stocks in the United States sustained a jaw-breaking rally in 2023, with the Nasdaq beating all other indices, accruing a more than 43% return. While stocks largely did not begin 2024 with a great start, the major indices have risen in the past few weeks. The Nasdaq has risen 6.2%, while the S&P 500 has risen 4.9%. With equities on the rise, there may be too many stocks sporting lofty evaluations.\n\nThe three tech stocks to sell below are either overvalued, have significant growth risks, or both.\n\nTech Stocks to Sell: Qualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs I have written before, Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) long-term share potential is definitely in jeopardy. There’s a growing competitive threat in China. In September of last year, Huawei—China’s telecom, cloud, and consumer electronics champion—released the Huawei Mate 60 Pro, which features a seven-nanometer system on a chip (SoC) designed and manufactured in China. Moreover, the wireless modem on the Huawei Mate 60 Pro also reached fast 5G speeds. Huawei phones are still apparently siphoning sales away from Apple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm also sells chips that go into modern vehicles. Due to higher interest rates and the slowing EV market, this segment will likely have limited short-term growth potential. Although QCOM’s shares are trading upward these days, investors shouldn’t get excited.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been struggling to spur revenue growth in recent years. The company’s fourth-quarter report for the fiscal year 2023 saw revenue decline by 1% Y/Y. This underscores that the mobile handset market is still at capacity.\n\nAnother reason investors should be wary of AAPL stock is the uncertainty of the Chinese market, which accounted for about 18.9% of Apple’s revenue at the end of its fiscal year 2023. Huawei’s launch of the Mate 60 Pro led many Chinese consumers to favor it over the new iPhone amidst geopolitical tensions.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Tim Cook was pleased to report that Apple’s Services revenue increased to an all-time high, unless Apple pursues a broad and competent diversification strategy, investors should not hope for strong share price appreciation.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) logo on a smartphone screen stock image. Tesla is an innovative company focused on producing sustainable electric vehicles and clean energy solutions\n\nSource: ssi77 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is undoubtedly one of the largest and most prominent players in the global electric vehicle market. The automaker has also been influential in creating the basic infrastructure for electric vehicle charging, ultimately tackling the EV market from different angles.\n\nThroughout 2023, Tesla defied skeptics and broke records. In particular, Tesla’s quarterly earnings have come in above analysts’ estimates, and the price-cut strategy the automaker began to pursue in the beginning year has increased quarterly deliveries while also placing pressure on gross margins. Tesla’s Q4’2023 financial figures also beat Wall Street’s estimates. Unfortunately, the EV maker’s CEO Elon Musk shared grim guidance for Tesla and its shareholders, citing interest rates and weak consumer demand.\n\nTesla is also facing growing competition from China’s BYD, which overtook Tesla as the largest seller of EVs in China for 2023. Elon Musk is clearly concerned with the rise of Chinese EVs. The Tesla CEO even said China’s EV players would “demolish” their Western counterparts unless trade barriers were implemented.\n\nThese events and a broad slowdown in the EV market make Tesla a sell. The company is trading at 58.9x forward earnings and looks pretty stretched in this volatile market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month",
        "content": "In this article, we list and discuss the 25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month. If you would like to skip our detailed discussion of the topic, you can go directly to 10 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month.\n\nOver the past three decades, the average retirement age in America has increased by 3 years, from 62 to 65 for men, and from 59 to 62 for women. According to the US Social Security Administration, the full normal retirement age for anyone born after 1960 is now 67. In other words, Americans are now working longer and retiring later than ever. On top of this, Republicans, one of the leading parties in the US, are pressurizing the current government to increase the full retirement age from 67 to 69. They argue that since life expectancy in the US has increased, the retirement age should be raised as well — it’s only \"logical\" that they should be allowed to work longer.\n\nAnother argument that Republicans put forth is that the government's social security funds are depleting. Nikki Haley, the Republican presidential candidate, says that in the next ten years, the social security funds will drop significantly. The 2022 Social Security Trustees report backs Haley’s claims as it finds that due to low inflow (income received through payroll taxes) and high outflow (monthly benefit paid to retirees by the state) retirees will only be able to receive full Social Security benefits till 2034.\n\nIf no legislative action is taken and Social Security Benefits are paid in full, after 2034, the trust funds would only be sufficient to pay 77% of full Social Security benefits.It’s an issue that demands immediate action and may be resolved if the government increases the retirement age. However, although increasing the retirement age will potentially save Social Security funds from complete depletion, potential retirees are expected to have mixed reactions.\n\nOn the one hand, retirees who want to work longer will be happy as an increase in retirement age will let them work more. On the other hand, retirees who pre-planned their retirement age and had everything aligned in their lives will feel lied to by the government. The latter holds more weightage; a large portion of expected retirees would not want to postpone their golden years into the 70s. Some retirees are also afraid of losing their flexible retirement option. Note that people aged 62 can currently opt for flexible retirement, but if the retirement age increases to 69 as the Republicans demand, the eligibility age for flexible retirement plans may also increase, resulting in reduced benefits for the retiree.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith the possibility of raising the retirement age on the table, the gravity and possible impact of the decision on millions of people in the US cannot be overlooked. According to the data posted by the US. Census Bureau in 2023, 77.5 million people in the US are over 60, which means 23.4% of the total population in the US will possibly retire in the next ten years.\n\nHowever, despite the retirement age closing in, the population seems to be less prepared with their plans for a comfortable retirement. According to a 2023 survey by CNBC, 56% of Americans said they were not on track or making enough money to retire comfortably. The surging commodity prices have made it even more difficult to plan your life ahead and live accordingly. Perhaps the high cost of living and unpreparedness for retirement are two of the main reasons why the average retirement age is increasing over time. An efficient way to tackle both these problems is switching your state and moving to one that’s less expensive than the one you currently live in (See: 25 Best US Cities Where You Can Retire on $2500 a Month).\n\nAt the same time, it’s important to note that the cost of living varies from state to state and city to city in the US. According to Insider Monkey's cost of living index, Hawaii is the most expensive state to live in 2024, with an annual cost of living of over $103,000. On the other hand, Mississippi takes the spot for the state with the lowest annual cost of living, around $50,000. Hawaii is an exceptionally expensive state to live in mainly because it’s an island state with limited land for agriculture and manufacturing. Therefore, the state heavily relies on imported consumer goods and food, which incurs shipping costs and makes the basic goods expensive.\n\nCommodity prices are not the only costs that have been fluctuating in the US; healthcare expenses have been on the rise for the past couple of decades as well. According to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services report, the US healthcare spending grew 4.1% in 2022, reaching $4.5 trillion or $13,493 per capita. Furthermore, from 2022- 2031, national healthcare expenditure will rise even more, with an average growth rate of 5.4%. As you age, you can expect to pay more for the same drug prescriptions and medical services compared to today. The same is the case with other commodities and services.\n\nPut simply, you have to keep inflation in mind and save more than you currently spend so you can cover your future living costs comfortably. Many prospective retirees in the U.S. rely on Social Security for retirement funds, but since that’s already running out, now is a good time to consider other retirement plans that will allow you to live your golden years comfortably and luxuriously. You may look into private retirement savings plans such as 401(k) or Individual Retirement Account (IRA), which are retirement savings accounts where you can save and invest without getting taxed. The 401(k) plan is given by most employers in America. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, it was the most common private retirement savings plan, with 34.6% of the individuals having it in 2020.\n\nTop Companies For Potential Retirees\n\nSome major companies with potentially prosperous IRAs are Berkshire Hathaway Inc (NYSE: BRK.B) and Axa SA (EPA: CS). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) is a holding company, aiming to cross the trillion-dollar mark and join the likes of Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT). Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) also has high stakes in some giant companies like Bank of America (NYSE: BAC), Chevron (NYSE: CVX), and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nSpeaking of investments, Legal & General Group PLC (LON: LGEN) is the UK’s leading financial service company with several investment plans, such as investments in stocks and pension pots. More importantly, Legal & General Group PLC (LON: LGEN) also has investment plans in retirement savings accounts for retirees and those approaching retirement. Legal & General Retirement America (LGRA) by Legal & General (LON: LGEN) was established in the US in 2015 and secured the retirement of over 27,000 annuitants in 2023.\n\nAging comes with an increased need for healthcare services. According to the American Psychology Association, approximately 92% of older people develop at least one chronic disease, and 77% suffer from two or more. If out-of-pocket costs for healthcare are not affordable, older adults are more likely to make significant compromises on their health. Fortunately, the U.S. is home to some of the top insurance companies. For example, the UnitedHealth Group Inc (NYSE: UNH) has several group Medicare Advantage plans catering to the unique needs of retirees. The AARP Medicare Supplement plans by UnitedHealthcare (NYSE: UNH) will cover expenses that are not covered by the federal government’s Original Medicare. UnitedHealthcare (NYSE: UNH) also allows retirees to transition to different Medicare plans through their exchange model if the current one doesn’t suit them.\n\nThat said, shifting states and relocating as you start to reach retirement age is perhaps one of the most efficient ways to save money and live comfortably during your golden years.\n\nWith that said, let's head over to the list of the best places in the US to retire on a budget of $5,000 a month. 25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month\n\n25 best places in the US to retire on $5000 a month\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile the list of 25 Best Places in the US to Retire on $5000 a Month, we have used several sources such as Yahoo Finance, Travel & Leisure, US News, and Nasdaq, to name a few. Next, using Best Places for cost of living data, we filtered out the cities having average rents for two-bedroom units more than $1,184 and requiring an average monthly budget of $3,932.\n\nWe then ranked the cities based on the sum of their average rent and monthly overall costs. We’ve also assigned scores to each place based on the crime index, healthcare, livability score as mentioned on the AARP Livability Index, economy, and weather comfort index score. Note that the AARP Livability Index scores each place out of 100, and the national average is 50. A high score indicates better livability. Places have been ranked in descending order from the highest expenses to the lowest.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 20 oldest companies in the world. If you would like to read about more companies, you can go to the 5 Oldest Companies In The World.\n\nBusiness and commerce have been integral to human civilization for a very long time. While older civilizations may be perceived as less advanced, they progressed in ways suitable for their respective times. The term \"Corporation\" finds its roots in the Latin term \"corpus,\" meaning a body of people. Records indicate that as early as the 4th century, Roman society recognized corporate entities with legal standing, allowing them to enter into contracts and seek legal remedies. Similar structures for businesses existed in other ancient civilizations, such as Europe, Japan, Britain, and India. Many cities had stock exchanges where investors could invest in shares and receive written proof of their ownership in specific companies.\n\nIn Western history, a few corporations stand out as particularly noteworthy, including the Dutch East India Company, the Hudson's Bay Company, and England's East India Company. The East India Company went on to rule the Indian Subcontinent for over a century. It was allegedly one of the largest companies in history, surpassing the scale of well-known contemporary corporations like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nJapan is known to have the highest number of oldest companies. It is reported that over 52,000 businesses in Japan are over 100 years old, making it the country with the highest number of 100-year-old companies in the world. Some well-known names in the country included Nintendo Co., Ltd (TYO:7974), founded in 1889; Suntory Beverage & Food Ltd (TYO: 2587), founded in 1899; and Kikkoman Corporation (TYO:2801), founded in 1917. Meanwhile, the oldest company in Europe is a winery. While these companies operate across various industries, their key to enduring challenges over time lies in their ability to adapt to changes over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis raises questions about the secrets to a business's longevity and how other enterprises can draw lessons from these entities. Understanding these lessons becomes important, especially considering the decline in the average lifespan of a business listed in the S&P 500 index - from 67 years in the 1920s to approximately a decade today. In recent years, economic upheavals and competition have brought about the downfall of many corporate giants, ranging from financial institutions like Silicon Valley Bank to renowned camera manufacturers such as Kodak.\n\nA key determinant for long-term survival is a commitment to innovation and continuous reinvention. A popular example is Nokia, which evolved from being a pulp manufacturer to entering the field of electricity and, eventually, mobile phones. At one point, Nokia's brand extended even to galoshes. Another illustrative case is Berkshire Hathaway, which was initially established as a textile mill in Rhode Island and later diversified its operations into a number of industries.\n\nHere's what Vltava Fund said about Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) in its Q4 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Entire books have been published on Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) transactions. One of the best that I can highly recommend is Adam Mead’s 2021 book, The Complete Financial History of Berkshire Hathaway. The book is excellent and detailed, but it, too, will need updating over time. In fact, Berkshire Hathaway writes another interesting chapter in its history every year. A chapter describing 2023 would be quite extensive. At the turn of the year, Berkshire completed its $11.6 billion acquisition of the insurer Alleghany Corporation. A little later, Berkshire increased its stake in Pilot Flying J to 80% and its holdings in five Japanese “sogo shosha” conglomerates to 8.5% (a total investment at current prices of about $20 billion). Through the course of the year, Berkshire also steadily increased its stake in Occidental Petroleum to 37% (including warrants). Berkshire Hathaway continues to be a very unique type of conglomerate whose investments generate huge amounts of cash and which can successfully reinvest that cash again and again over the long term. It is an almost perfect case of a snowball in the markets. Here is one interesting fact: we estimate that the intrinsic value of a single Berkshire share is currently growing at a rate of about $178 per day. When we bought the shares 12 years ago, this was less than $50 a day. The rate of growth is accelerating gradually and with minimal fluctuations. Moreover, Berkshire has additional decades of similar growth still ahead of it.” 20 Oldest Companies In The World\n\nFer Gregory/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 oldest companies in the world, we conducted a comprehensive analysis using reports from reputable websites such as Bloomberg and the Visual Capitalist.

        "title": "Biden and Trump want to rein in Big Tech. Their campaigns can't avoid using it.",
        "content": "Tech giants are often a target for derision in Washington. Presidential campaigns are nonetheless sending a lot of money their way.\n\nFederal Election Commission records now offer a complete accounting of how the campaigns spent money in 2023. The files show millions of dollars being funneled to Silicon Valley to pay for digital advertising — one of the most effective ways to reach voters.\n\nWhat the filings also make it clear is how the other services of the tech giants are also as inescapable for campaign operators as they are for Americans going about their day-to-day lives.\n\nTake the two likely nominees: President Joe Biden and former President Donald Trump. Donald Trump, Joe Biden, and the logos of Facebook and Twitter. (AP Photos) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTrump has sporadically brought up antitrust concerns over the years and has gone so far as to launch his own social media platform, Truth Social, to get around what he calls \"biased Big Tech.\" But that doesn't mean he's not advertising on Facebook (META) this campaign season or using Amazon (AMZN) to stock his campaign's offices.\n\nPresident Biden similarly sits atop an administration engaged in legal battles against Amazon, Google (GOOG), and Meta — with a suit against Apple (AAPL) likely not far behind. But his presidential campaign still regularly patronizes those same companies.\n\nBiden has launched antitrust efforts by saying consolidation in tech and elsewhere creates \"fewer options for workers and consumers alike.\" It's a conundrum apparently facing his campaign as well.\n\nPresidential candidates have also been reliant on Big Tech while simultaneously criticizing the companies in years past. The 2020 campaign notably featured candidates like Sen. Elizabeth Warren advertising a plan to break up these companies — on their own platforms.\n\nThe expensive world of digital advertising\n\nCollectively, the Biden and Trump campaigns spent at least $30 million on advertising efforts in 2023. Some of that money headed to linear television, but much clearly ended up on the books in Menlo Park, Calif., where Facebook is based, and Mountain View, Calif., the location of \"the GooglePlex.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPlenty of other corners of the business world — from airlines to restaurants to special-event organizers — come up repeatedly in the filings, but advertising represents the lion's share of the nearly $80 million in total campaign spending from Biden and Trump last year, according to FECrecords. Donald Trump's social media is seen on a phone screen with the Facebook logo in the background. (Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nThe question of exactly how much of those advertising budgets ends up in Big Tech's hands is somewhat harder to answer, with the money flowing through third parties.\n\nThe Trump campaign put at least $11.5 million in 2023 toward an array of outside firms for expenses categorized as as \"online advertising\" or \"placed media.\" Some have tried to track that money, with Bully Pulpit Interactive telling Axios last year it had traced hundreds of thousands to Facebook and Google ads within just the first few months of 2023.\n\nUpdated data wasn't immediately available, but the total spending almost surely grew over the course of the entire calendar year.\n\nThe Biden campaign has likewise sent millions to Democratic-aligned firms. A name that showed up frequently is Gambit Strategies. The firm is run by two former Biden aides and is focused on digital advertising touting \"unrivaled experience persuading and mobilizing voters online.\" The records show it collected over $8 million from the Biden campaign in 2023.\n\nRepresentatives for the Biden and Trump campaigns declined to offer Yahoo Finance a more detailed analysis of their spending habits beyond what has been publicly reported.\n\nThe spending towards Big Tech comes even after years of criticism from the two men atop these campaigns. In 2023, Trump called Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg a \"weirdo\" as he recounted their political differences. Biden often criticized Facebook and other platforms over how they handled COVID-19 misinformation, once saying the platforms were \"killing people.\"\n\nOffice supplies and Ubers\n\nThe filings show that below those top-line advertising numbers, campaigns spent liberally for a range of other technology services.\n\nBoth campaigns patronized Amazon, but for different reasons. The Biden campaign sent almost $60,000 to Amazon Web Services in 2023 to host its website. Trump's campaign spent as well, but in a different wing of CEO Andy Jassy's company, racking up over $30,000 in purchases of office supplies.\n\nBiden and Trump have had their run-ins with Amazon over the years.\n\nThe Federal Trade Commission under Biden — along with 17 states — has filed an antitrust lawsuit against the company charging the tech giant with using its \"monopoly power\" to inflate prices. Biden also engaged in a Twitter fight in 2022 with Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder and former CEO, over inflation and corporate taxes.\n\nTrump has also long feuded with Amazon and occasionally threatened antitrust action against the company when he was in office. \"People think it is a very antitrust situation,\" Trump said in 2018 of Amazon, Google, and Facebook.\n\nOther tech spending is perhaps more illuminating about the distinct cultures of the two campaigns.\n\nBiden's team appears to have spent a lot on Apple products. Over $170,000 was spent in 2023 at an Apple authorized service provider named \"Mac Business Solutions.\"\n\niPhone and MacBook purchases appear to be less numerous in Trump's filings, but the campaign nonetheless spent almost $9,000 directly with the company on purchases of \"office equipment.\"\n\nWhen campaign staffers need a ride, Trump's team proved much more likely to grab an Uber (UBER), with the ride-sharing company being expensed 10 times more often than Lyft (LYFT). Uber Eats also showed up frequently in the Trump filings.\n\nTeam Biden is much more mixed on this issue. Democratic aides split their fares between the two companies but slightly favored Lyft.\n\nNeither campaign seemingly had much in the way of direct contact with X, formerly known as Twitter. But Trump's operation paid $168 to Elon Musk's company, evidently for two premium subscriptions.\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Nearly 50% of Warren Buffett-Led Berkshire Hathaway's $367 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Only 1 Stock",
        "content": "I don't think many people question that Warren Buffett is one of the greatest investors ever. He continues to prove this, as one of his biggest investments clearly demonstrates.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway, the conglomerate Buffett heads up, first purchased shares in Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) in the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year to Feb. 14 of this year, the top FAANG stock has skyrocketed 599%. This gain crushes the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nLet's try to figure out what exactly about Apple, which today represents just under 46% of Berkshire's entire portfolio, first drew Buffett's attention. Then investors can decide if the stock is still a smart buy today.\n\nTraits of a winning investment\n\nIf you look through Berkshire's numerous holdings, you'll easily find businesses that have strong brands. But there might be no other company that has greater brand recognition than Apple. I'm sure this was the case eight years ago, too.\n\nApple sells some of the most in-demand hardware and software on the face of the planet. The beautiful designs and ease-of-use resonate with consumers. Buffett recognized this several years ago.\n\nHe probably also appreciated Apple's proven pricing power. The Oracle of Omaha has even said that the top indicator of a quality business is its ability to raise its prices. Apple's hardware devices are certainly at the premium end of the spectrum, but even with consistent price increases, consumer demand remains robust.\n\nInvestors would struggle to find companies that are in better financial shape than Apple. In fiscal 2015, the year right before Buffett first bought the stock, it reported an operating margin of 30% and generated $70 billion of free cash flow (FCF). Fast forward to fiscal 2023, and the operating margin has remained steady. Even better, the company produced $100 billion of FCF, and it currently sits on $65 billion of net cash.\n\nIt wasn't as if Buffett was making a speculative bet on an unknown technology company. There were clear signs that Apple was a superior enterprise back then. Its market capitalization at the start of 2016 was around $580 billion. So, the business definitely wasn't flying under the radar, either.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's why it's a shocker that during the first quarter of 2016, Apple's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio averaged a ridiculously low 10.6. The market was presenting Buffett with a rare buying opportunity, one that he took full advantage of and that resulted in huge gains.\n\nShould you buy Apple?\n\nApple has undoubtedly worked out as a fantastic investment, but is now a good time to buy the stock if you've been sitting on the sidelines? The characteristics I discussed above -- namely the strong brand, pricing power, and incredible profitability -- all hold true today. And I'm extremely confident that these factors will still be present a decade from now.\n\nBut there is one key difference between now and the time when Buffett first bought the stock. That's the valuation. Apple shares currently trade at a P/E multiple of 28.7. This is 37% higher than the stock's trailing-10-year average ratio, and it's in the stratosphere when compared to the valuation Buffett paid.\n\nI think investors need to be critical of the expensive valuation. It's safe to say that Apple doesn't have the same growth potential that it did when it was a much smaller company. In fact, revenue declined last fiscal year as many of its popular products reach a more mature stage of their lifecycles.\n\nI would be surprised if over the next five years, Apple shares outperformed the broader market. The steep P/E ratio creates a major headwind to produce strong returns going forward. So, it's best to wait for a better entry point.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Exit Now! 7 Blue-Chip Stocks to Sell in February 2024",
        "content": "Blue-chips, or shares in established companies with long track records of slow-and-steady growth, may make for great selections in a diversified, long-term portfolio. However, while there are many great blue-chip stocks to buy, there are plenty of blue-chip stocks to sell as well.\n\nIn some cases, there are blue-chips where while the long-term forecast remains favorable, in the near-term selling to take profit may be the best course of action. These are blue-chips that have performed extremely well, yet are at risk of a short-term reversal because of valuation and/or temporary headwinds.\n\nIn other cases, there are blue-chips where the near-term and long-term forecasts warrant a fast exit. These are blue-chips that, in the past, may have performed well, but have started to (and are at risk of continuing to) underperform.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe blue-chip stocks listed below fall into either of these categories. Most of these blue-chips to avoid are also Dow Jones Industrial Average components, except for one, which is a former Dow Jones component.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou may question why I would include “Magnificent Seven” component Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) on this list. However, despite the iPhone maker’s long-term strengths, near-term issues and valuation make it one of the blue-chips to sell.\n\nAAPL stock has pulled back since late last year, but further multiple compression may be justified. A slowdown in iPhone demand in China continues to drag down overall results.\n\nUnlike with other “Mag 7” stocks, boosted higher by the generative AI trend, Apple’s potential AI-related growth catalysts are arguably still at the “work-in-progress stage.”\n\nWith famed investors like Warren Buffett and George Soros either trimming (or like Soros’ investment firm, exiting completely) AAPL positions, consider following their lead, by taking profit. That said, with the possibility of AI catalysts beginning to play out down the road, you may want to keep an eye on AAPL, for re-entry at lower prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nBoeing (BA) Boeing (BA) passenger airplane with open exit door, passenger windows, cargo door, close up view of Boeing logo\n\nSource: vaalaa / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast month, I laid out the bear case for Boeing (NYSE:BA), citing the recent flight safety controversy with the aerospace giant’s 737 Max 9 passenger jets.\n\nThis headwind continues to affect the performance of shares, and is a key reason why BA is one of the blue-chip stocks to sell.\n\nStill, that’s not all. While BA stock has only partially recovered since tanking at the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, shares today trade at a valuation that fully prices-in a comeback that has yet to fully arrive. At current prices, Boeing trades for 58.9 times estimated 2024 earnings, and 25.2 times estimated 2025 earnings.\n\nThis comes even as Boeing CEO Dave Calhoun concedes that the company may have to “go slow to go fast,” by prioritizing putting quality/safety concerns to rest. This suggests BA could keep falling, before the rebound gets back on track.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) General Electric (GE stock) logo on headquarters building\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Electric (NYSE:GE) is the former Dow Jones component I hinted at above. GE today is no longer as large and diversified as it once was. This calls into question whether it should be made a Dow stock once again.\n\nAdmittedly, sentiment for the industrial conglomerate has improved considerably since getting kicked out of the Dow in 2018. Yet while GE stock has crushed it over the past year (up by 75%), now may be the time to hit the “sell” button.\n\nValuation is a problem as shares today trade for 32 times forward earnings. Similar to BA, GE is another aerospace play trading at a valuation that prices in a full post-Covid recovery as a near-certainty.\n\nAlso, GE’s upcoming spinoff of its last non-aerospace segment could lead to a post-spinoff sell-off, as I argued earlier this month. After a year of smooth sailing, these factors could mean turbulence ahead.\n\nIBM (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp until recently, I’d wager a considerable amount of investors would agree with me that IBM (NYSE:IBM) was one of the top blue-chip stocks to sell. In past years, a high dividend was not enough to counter weak growth and sideways price performance for the venerable tech stock.\n\nOver the past few months, however, the market’s view of IBM stock has become much more upbeat. Mostly, due to recent financial results that suggest this company is starting to materially benefit from the generative AI boom.\n\nBut while “AI mania” is why IBM has roared higher, it’s a good reason you should make IBM one of the blue-chips to sell. As I pointed out last month, one sell-side analyst (Jeffries’ Brent Thill) argues that the sluggishness of IBM’s legacy business could outweigh this AI growth. This in turn may cause the stock to become an underperformer once again.\n\nIntel (INTC) Close up of Intel (INTC) sign at entrance of The Intel Museum in Silicon Valley. Intel is an American multinational corporation and technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nPreviously, the market was taking a “show me” stance on tech blue-chip Intel‘s (NASDAQ:INTC) turnaround. The turnaround centered on its efforts to become a large-scale chip foundry, or third-party manufacturer for “fabless” chip designers.\n\nHowever, since last fall, investors have bid up INTC stock, betting on a comeback built around booming demand for AI chips. Back in December, the company unveiled its newest line of chips for the generative AI market. So then, why INTC a blue-chip to sell? For one, with the stock trading for 32.2 times earnings, ahead of AI chip sales really boosting the bottom line, this catalyst may be overly priced-in.\n\nFurthermore, as Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff pointed out earlier this month, recent developments cast doubt on whether Intel’s big bet on foundries will move the needle as much as the company anticipates.\n\n3M (MMM) 3M logo on top of a corporate building. MMM stock\n\nSource: JPstock / Shutterstock.com\n\n3M (NYSE:MMM) has long been one of the blue-chip stocks to sell. Over the past five years, shares in this industrial conglomerate have fallen by around 55.75%. Don’t blame this on sluggish growth but rather the fall-out from not one, but two multi-billion dollar lawsuits.\n\nEven as the company has finally settled this litigation, and despite the fact MMM stock now trades for only 9.6 times forward earnings, and sports a high dividend yield (6.54%), be sure to keep it in the “stocks to sell” category. For one, due to concerning earnings outlook for 2024.\n\nSecond, because of the still-elevated risk that this “dividend king” will have to implement a dividend cut. A dividend cut could help the stock in the long run, as a Seeking Alpha commentator recently argued. Still, at the onset it would likely have a materially negative impact on MMM’s price performance.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon (VZ) logo above the entrance to a Verizon store.\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) shares have been on a tear since mid-October. During this time frame, shares in the telecommunications giant have bounced back by around 34.4% off their 52-week low ($30.14 per share).\n\nBut whether you got in at this low, or even at higher prices, now may be the time to pull VZ stock from your blue-chip portfolio. Sure, Verizon may be cheap (at 8.8 times forward earnings), with a high dividend yield (6.55%) to boot. The company has also been reporting much stronger financial results.\n\nHowever, while cheap compared to stocks overall, VZ’s valuation is premium to that of peers like AT&T (NYSE:T). As Moffett Nathanson analyst Craig Moffett has argued, subscription price increases have been too big a factor in VZ’s recent stronger-than-expected growth. The company’s results could soon again disappoint, if high prices and competition lead to subscriber losses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement “America’s Top Trader” Issues A.I.

Spotify said this policy forced it to increase monthly subscriptions for its premium service from £9.99 ($12.60) a month to £12.99.\n\nAround the same time, Apple launched a competing music streaming service that cost £9.99 a month.\n\nThe fine over alleged breaches of EU competition law expected to be announced early next month, the FT reported.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: BoE's rate decisions risk prolonging recession, says ex-chief economist\n\nIf imposed, the fine would be one of the most substantial financial penalties the EU has imposed on a major technology company.\n\nEthereum (ETH-USD)\n\nEthereum price has hit over $2,900 as the cryptocurrency's co-founder Vitalik Buterin hinted at AI integration.\n\nIn a tweet, Buterin said he believes AI will revolutionise bug fixing, citing bugs in code as “Ethereum’s biggest technical risk pro” right now.\n\nOne application of AI that I am excited about is AI-assisted formal verification of code and bug finding.\r\n\r\nRight now ethereum's biggest technical risk probably is bugs in code, and anything that could significantly change the game on that would be amazing.\n\n— vitalik.eth (@VitalikButerin) February 19, 2024\n\nThe comments come as Ethereum closes in on implementing its long-awaited Dencun upgrade, which is currently slated for launch on 13 March.\n\nSantander (BNC.L)\n\nSantander has announced plans to pay shareholders €5.5bn (£4.7bn) after posting record profits last year amid surging interest rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe lender, which is owned by Spanish parent Banco Santander, plans to buy back nearly €1.5bn (£1.3bn) of its shares and pay a final cash dividend for 2023 of €0.095 per share.\n\nRead more: UK average house price rises by more than £3,000 in 2024\n\nSpain’s largest lender has received regulatory approval for the buyback that will be launched on Feb. 20, it said in a regulatory filing Monday.\n\nIt comes after the Spanish bank posted a record €11.1bn (£9.5bn) profit for 2023.\n\nCurrys (CURY.L)\n\nChinese online shopping giant JD.com (JD) has confirmed it has been exploring a takeover of Currys, raising the prospect of a bidding war after the electricals retailer on Saturday rejected a private equity approach.\n\nShares rocketed higher amid a potential bidding war.\n\nJD.com has held informal, exploratory talks in recent weeks with Currys, the Telegraph said.\n\nRead more: Stocks that are trending today\n\nThe move comes hours after it was revealed that the electrical goods retailer rejected a takeover approach from US investment firm Elliott.\n\nCurrys, which operates more than 800 stores globally and employs 28,000 people, said the offer valued the business at about £700m.

        "content": "Blue-chip stocks refer to stocks of large, well-established companies with a reputation for high-quality, reliable investments. They tend to be industry leaders in their sectors and have a large market capitalization in the billions of dollars. This led us to create our list of blue-chip stocks to buy and hold for the long haul.\n\nThe precise definition of blue-chip stocks can be subjective, though. However, blue-chip companies can offer general stability through consistent, steady performance without witnessing dramatic fluctuations in their share prices. They are overall better candidates to buy and hold for the long haul.\r\n\r\nThis makes blue-chip stocks ideal for investment strategies seeking to balance portfolios and mitigate volatility. It may be more pertinent to buy and hold now. This is especially true as the Federal Reserve (Fed) estimates a 61% recession probability within the next 12 months.\r\n\r\nWhether looking to diversify a portfolio, strive for stability, or simply have the appetite to avoid turbulence in light of the upcoming national elections, the following three blue-chip stocks represent an opportunity for steady returns in the long haul. They are well-suited as long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold:\n\nAPPLE (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s most profitable company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), enjoys a history of sustained growth and expectations for continued expansion going forward. Don’t just take our word for it. This was said by renowned investor Warren Buffett. It should be noted that he did modestly downsize his stake in the company recently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile shares retreated somewhat on disappointing sales from the Chinese market, Apple’s strong brand and financial position imply further potential. Nonetheless, Apple’s sales in China rebounded to more than $70 billion in 2021 and 2022 following covid. Accounting for around 20% of AAPL’s sales, China will remain critical for the company’s revenue and success.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28.6x, below the technology sector average of 31.6 times. The company boasts a market cap of 2.8 trillion and has beaten all analysts’ quarterly EPS expectations in 2023. Apple also offers a marginal dividend yield of 0.52%.\n\nAnheuser-Busch InBev  (BUD) Bud Light Beer 36 pack beer cans display at grocery store.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nBrewers are known for resisting economic downturns. This makes AB InBev (NYSE:BUD) an exciting choice for investors looking for long-term blue-chip stocks to buy and hold. As the largest in the United States and globally, AB InBev benefits from global consumer demand in the context of investment hedge even during economic turbulence.\n\nThe company involved themselves in a marketing controversy last year through its flagship Bud Light but has since normalized, leaving an opportunity for further shareholder gains. However, potential March strikes may put the stock in a better position to consider buying should BUD fail to negotiate contract terms with Teamsters successfully.\n\nAt a P/E ratio of 20.3x, below the industry average of 25.5 times, AB InBev also offers a forward dividend of 1.3%. Like AAPL, the company has also beaten all quarterly analysts’ EPS estimates in 2023.\n\nJohnson & Johnson (JNJ) A red Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) sign hangs inside in Moscow, Russia.\n\nSource: Alexander Tolstykh / Shutterstock.com\n\nJohnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ) is widely recognized as a leading global healthcare company. Having recently spun off its consumer products division in 2023 into Kenvue (NYSE:KVUE) in a deal involving $36 billion, JNJ can now focus its efforts on the healthcare sector.\n\nSpecifically, it can channel its expertise and resources into medical devices, diagnostics, and pharmaceutical research and development. Moreover, JNJ’s product pipeline contains more than 90 additional drug candidates currently progressing through clinical trials.\n\nIn addition to numerous well-known medications, JNJ’s diversification and financial strength support its 30x P/E ratio. The company also offers shareholders a healthy dividend yield of 3.1%, representing another opportunity for a long-term blue-chip stock to buy and hold.​\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will face a European Union fine close to €500 million ($539 million) over the regulator’s investigation into allegations it silenced music-streaming rivals, including Spotify Technology SA, on its platforms.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Keeps NY Empire Intact as Judge Rescinds Asset-Sale Order Record US Stock Rally Is Under Threat From a World in Turmoil Systemic Risk Concerns Grow Among Money Managers as Real Estate Woes Cause Turmoil Top Investors Share the Toughest Lessons They Had to Learn China Stocks Primed for Bullish Reopen After Upbeat Data\n\nThe penalty — Apple’s first ever from the bloc — will be set after the EU watchdog found that it fell foul of competition rules in thwarting rival music services from informing users that cheaper alternatives existed outside of its App Store, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nApple, when contacted for comment, referred to a previous statement, which said that the “App Store has helped Spotify become the top music streaming service across Europe.” The European Commission declined to comment. The Financial Times reported the fine earlier.\n\nThe EU’s investigation into Apple’s App Store was sparked by a complaint nearly four years ago from Spotify, which claimed it was forced to ramp up the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs associated with Apple’s alleged stranglehold on how the App Store operates.\n\nIn a closed-door meeting between EU officials and Apple in June last year, the tech firm told regulators it had already addressed any possible competition concerns arising from Spotify’s complaint.\n\nIn a separate probe, Apple is set to have its settlement proposal in the EU’s investigation into its tap-and-pay tech accepted, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nThe commission is poised to accept a 10-year offer from Apple to open up access to its coveted near-field communication chip on iPhones to rival digital wallets, after a market test received largely positive feedback, the people, who asked not to be identified because the matter is private, said.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s move to settle the case came after the EU watchdog earlier raised formal concerns that the company had restricted access to the technology, amounting to an alleged abuse of its market power.\n\nEU competition chief Margrethe Vestager has made it a core strategy to attempt to dismantle Big Tech’s dominance in the bloc. She’s slapped Alphabet Inc.’s Google with fines of more than €8 billion ($8.6 billion) and also ordered Apple to repay €13 billion in allegedly unfair tax breaks from Ireland.\n\nHer regulators are now readying for enforcement of the bloc’s flagship Digital Markets Act — set to come into play on March 7. The sweeping new rules are intended to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root.\n\nUnder the DMA, it will be illegal for the most powerful firms to favor their own services over those of rivals. They’ll be barred from combining personal data across their different services, prohibited from using data they collect from third-party merchants to compete against them, and will have to allow users to download apps from rivals platforms.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear ‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "After sales dipped 2.8% in its fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) was finally able to return to growth in the latest quarter as revenue increased 2.1%. The tech titan also reported a 13% jump in net income, showing once again how profitable of an enterprise this is.\n\nThrough the ups and downs, investors by and large have remained positive. The top FAANG stock has soared over 40% since the start of 2023 as investors have sought to ride the momentum of strong returns.\n\nOne notably positive number stood out -- 2.2 billion -- providing good reason to buy Apple shares. However, one critical metric should give investors pause. Here's what you need to know about the iPhone maker.\n\nAll across the globe\n\nShareholders and analysts undoubtedly focus on key figures like revenue, margins, free cash flow (FCF), and how well different products, such as the iPhone, MacBooks, and iPads, sold in any given period. These are certainly important numbers that can help one understand Apple's success.\n\nBut there's one data point that truly demonstrates the sheer dominance of this business. \"I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices,\" CEO Tim Cook said on the first-quarter 2024 earnings call. This figure was up from about 2 billion just six months ago. And it continues to rise with each passing quarter.\n\nNot only does this represent how successful and ubiquitous Apple has become, but it also indicates how powerful of an ecosystem the company has built. There are 2.2 billion devices out there all using Apple's various software and subscription solutions, which produce a very profitable (73% gross margin) revenue stream. And this division was able to grow sales at a faster clip than hardware in the latest fiscal quarter, which is an ongoing trend.\n\nInvestors looking to own stocks for the long haul should want the businesses to have durability. With its massive installed base that keeps getting larger, Apple fits the bill here. These are loyal customers who understand how great the products and services are.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis stickiness helps support Apple's powerful brand presence, which is likely a key reason why Warren Buffett, through his conglomerate Berkshire Hathaway, is such a big shareholder and fan of the company.\n\nHigh expectations\n\nThanks to Apple shares soaring 331% in the last five years and 867% in the last decade, this has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Additionally, the market fully understands Apple's favorable qualities and dominance.\n\nConsequently, the stock isn't cheap. It trades at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 29 today. Compared to the stock's trailing 10-year average P/E multiple of 20.9, this represents a sizable 38% premium.\n\nApple's loudest bulls might believe this valuation is justified. The huge and growing installed base I mentioned above is impressive. Moreover, Apple is incredibly profitable, reporting an average operating margin of 27.8% in the last 20 fiscal quarters. This business generated insane amounts of free cash flow in fiscal 2023, and currently has a net cash balance of $65 billion.\n\nHowever, I believe Apple's growth prospects going forward will be more limited. Consumers have less of a reason to upgrade their iPhones as frequently, mainly because innovations are becoming marginal at best. And unless Apple can introduce another truly revolutionary product, one big enough to move the needle financially, double-digit top-line gains are out of the question, in my opinion.\n\nThe elevated valuation implies high expectations from investors. And this could pressure potential returns over the next several years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "spotify app\n\nApple is facing a €500m (£427m) fine from the EU as part of a long-running row with Spotify over App Store pricing.\n\nBrussels is preparing to levy what would be its first competition fine for the iPhone maker, the Financial Times reported.\n\nThe decision follows a years-long European Commission probe into whether Apple abused its position in the market to drive up prices and block competition.\n\nApple has been accused of unfairly blocking apps that use its App Store from telling users about alternative ways to pay.\n\nThe EU investigation was launched after an official complaint from Spotify in 2019. The music streaming app claimed it had been forced to ramp up the price of its monthly subscriptions to cover costs associated with Apple’s App Store rules.\n\nApple takes a cut of 30pc of all purchases done through the App Store. Spotify said this policy forced it to increase monthly subscriptions for its premium service from £9.99 a month to £12.99.\n\nAround the same time, Apple launched a competing music streaming service that cost £9.99 a month.\n\nThe EU formally charged Apple with anti-competitive behaviour in 2021.\n\nIn an attempt to appease Brussels, Apple last month announced changes to its iOS mobile software, App Store and Safari browser that allowed companies to sign-post cheaper subscription options elsewhere. It said the changes “give developers choice”.\n\nSpotify branded the changes a “complete and total farce” at the time.\n\nBrussels is expected to rule that Apple’s actions were illegal next month, according to the FT, citing sources familiar with the investigation.\n\nThe European Commission declined to comment. Apple and Spotify were approached for comment.\n\nThe Commission could impose a fine of up to 10pc of Apple’s $385bn annual turnover if the company were found to have broken the law.\n\nApple has faced multiple battles over its App Store fees in recent years, including a high-profile legal spat with Fornite developer Epic Games. The iPhone maker largely prevailed in that case, though was ordered by a Californian court to make some changes to how its store operates.\n\nThe looming fine is also the latest attempt by Brussels to rein in the power of Big Tech. New rules set to come into effect in March will brand Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft so-called “digital gatekeepers”, meaning they will be forced to follow strict new competition rules.",

        "title": "The Smartest Dividend Stocks to Buy With $400 Right Now",
        "content": "Dividend stocks make a great addition to your portfolio in any market environment. During difficult times, they'll limit your losses, and during bull markets they'll add to your returns. And this recurrent income falls into your lap without you doing a thing -- what could be better than that?\n\nNow, today, let's imagine you have $400 to invest in these valuable stocks that tirelessly help you grow wealth year after year. Many stocks offer dividends -- so which ones should you choose?\n\nI often go for those that have a track record of increasing their payments, meaning you not only can count on collecting a payment this year, but you're likely to collect even more next year and every year down the road. And I also like growth stocks that pay dividends, because they offer the combination of top earnings growth and share performance potential with the stability of this annual passive income. Let's check out three of the smartest dividend stocks you can buy with $400 right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) makes the list of Dividend Kings, or companies that have raised their annual dividend for at least 50 consecutive years. This suggests dividend payments are important to Coca-Cola so it's likely to continue along this path. The company pays a dividend of $1.84 per share representing a dividend yield of 3.10%, surpassing the 1.47% dividend yield of the S&P 500.\n\nThe world's biggest non-alcoholic beverage maker also has what it takes financially to support potential dividend increases, with free cash flow of more than $9.7 billion at the close of last year -- that's up by more than $200 million from the previous year. And even as higher inflation weighed on the buying power of some customers, Coca-Cola still reported growth in revenue, global unit case volume, and earnings per share for the full year.\n\nCoca-Cola sells some of the world's most popular beverage brands, from its eponymous drink to Dasani water and Minute Maid juices, and this has kept customers coming back over time. The company hasn't finished gaining market share either -- quarter after quarter last year, the company won value share in the non-alcoholic ready-to-drink beverages market.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this means Coca-Cola is a great place to park part of your $400 for the long haul.\n\nAbbott Laboratories\n\nHealthcare giant Abbott Laboratories(NYSE: ABT) pays a dividend of $2.20 per share at a dividend yield of 1.96%, topping the yield of the S&P 500. Like Coca-Cola, the company is a Dividend King, meaning it has a track record of rewarding shareholders, and also like the beverage giant, this company has the financial strength to keep the policy going.\n\nThe healthcare powerhouse generates more than $4 billion in free cash flow and has increased earnings over the years. Abbott's four businesses -- medical devices, diagnostics, nutrition, and established pharmaceuticals -- offer the company a diversification that helps it excel.\n\nFor example, when covid testing was booming, diagnostics led revenue gains, but these days, with testing on the decline, the company's other businesses have compensated for weakness in diagnostics. Last year, all businesses except diagnostics posted double-digit sales increases. Abbott's medical devices unit, as in years prior to the pandemic, contributed the most to overall sales thanks to top-selling products like the FreeStyle Libre continuous glucose monitor -- and a regular flow of new product approvals could keep this trend going.\n\nSo you can count on Abbott for steady earnings increases over time, thanks to its diversification and passive income growth as well.\n\nApple\n\nOften, growth companies favor investing in their development over offering dividend payments -- so they aren't where you'll generally find passive income. But Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the exceptions.\n\nThe technology giant pays a dividend per share of 96 cents at a yield of 0.52%. The company doesn't have the lengthy dividend growth track record of the two companies I mentioned above, and its yield isn't the highest around -- but it does offer you the top combination of solid earnings growth potential and passive income. And that's a definite plus for your portfolio.\n\nOf course, with free cash flow of $106 billion, Apple clearly can afford to pay out a dividend every year -- and at the same time invest in the innovation that keeps its success story going. A recent report from IDC shows the company last year became the worldwide smartphone leader.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The European Union is close to hitting Apple Inc. with its first ever antitrust fine as well as a ban on App Store rules that the bloc believes thwart competition, according to the Financial Times.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Keeps NY Empire Intact as Judge Rescinds Asset-Sale Order Systemic Risk Concerns Grow Among Money Managers as Real Estate Woes Cause Turmoil Top Investors Share the Toughest Lessons They Had to Learn Record US Stock Rally Is Under Threat From a World in Turmoil UK, Allies Look to Arm Ukraine With AI-Enabled Swarm Drones\n\nThe fine of around €500 million ($539 million) is expected to be announced next month, the FT said, citing five sources it did not name. Apple could have been fined as much as 10% of its annual global sales.\n\nThe probe was sparked by a complaint in 2019 from Sweden’s Spotify Technology SA, which claimed it was forced to ramp up its monthly subscription price to cover costs associated with Apple’s alleged stranglehold on how the App Store operates. The European Commission homed in on Apple’s so-called anti-steering rules in a formal charge sheet in February 2023, saying the conditions were unnecessary and meant customers faced higher prices.\n\nIn early 2022, Apple began allowing Spotify and other music services to direct app users to the web to sign up for subscriptions. This bypasses Apple’s revenue cut of as much as 30% and gives consumers more pricing and subscription options. But Spotify hit back at Apple’s efforts, saying in June that the restrictions still existed and the changes were “just for show.”\n\nAside from attacking firms for their past abuses, the commission, the EU’s antitrust arm, has also pushed through sweeping new rules to head off competition violations by tech firms before they take root. The Digital Markets Act enters into full force in March 2024, and lays out a series of dos and don’ts.\n\nUnder the DMA, it will be illegal for the most powerful firms to favor their own services over those of rivals.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Paramount Became a Cautionary Tale of the Streaming Wars How Uber Beat the Skeptics and Became Profitable Today’s Satellite Boom Was Foretold in Busts of Yesteryear ‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "Is Arm Holdings the Next Nvidia After Smashing Earnings Estimates?",
        "content": "There is only one Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), the world's unequivocal leader in high-performance graphic processing units (GPUs) and data center hardware and software powering large swaths of the economy and the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). But several companies are also doing incredible things, like Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM).\n\nArm's stock is up over 100% in February (as of Feb. 12), as shown below, but many investors aren't familiar with the company. I'll discuss what Arm does, its financials, and its stock below.\n\nWhat does Arm Holdings do?\n\nFirst, here is what Arm does not do. Arm does not actually make any semiconductors (or \"chips\"). Arm sells the \"architecture\" for companies like Nvidia, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Qualcomm(NASDAQ: QCOM), Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Taiwan Semiconductor(NYSE: TSM), and Samsung(OTC: SSNL.F). The list goes on, but you get the idea. I can almost guarantee that you used an Arm-based product today because 99% of all smartphones have CPUs built with Arm technology. Here's how it works.\n\nArm designs the specifications for chips that are energy-efficient, high-powered, and meet its customers' specifications for the end market. The company buys the design from Arm (saving millions or billions on research and development) and pays Arm a license fee. Then, it pays Arm a royalty fee for each unit sold. As of Arm's most recent quarter, 280 billion units have shipped since its inception, including 7.7 billion in the quarter.\n\nBecause of the low-power, high-performance nature of Arm chips, Apple replaced Intel (NASDAQ: INTC) chips in its Macs with Arm-based chips, and Arm is used by Amazon Web Services (AWS)(NASDAQ: AMZN) server chips. Arm's superior technology is exciting investors as it increases its adoption, including in growing markets like Automotive.\n\nIs Arm Holdings stock a buy?\n\nArm stock is not without risks. The company receives 20% of its revenue from China. This creates geopolitical headaches. The industry is highly competitive, and Arm is exposed to economic slowdowns because it generates more than half of its sales from mobile phones and consumer electronics. But results are encouraging.\n\nStory continues\n\nTotal revenue was $824 million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, a 14% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Operating income was $338 million on an impressive 41% margin. Arm also has an enviable business model. Since it doesn't make the chips, its capital expenditures (equipment purchases) are very low, creating more free cash flow (FCF). Thirty cents of every revenue dollar went into the company's pocket last quarter.\n\nWhat really excited investors last quarter probably wasn't the 14% increase in sales, though. It was the $2.4 billion remaining performance obligation, as shown below. Source: Arm.\n\nRPO is similar to a backlog. It represents contracts signed that will produce revenue in future quarters. RPO was up 38% YOY last quarter, building on the significant jump in the fiscal second quarter. This is clear evidence of increased adoption of Arm technology.\n\nArm stock experienced a meteoric rise after third-quarter earnings, pushing the valuation metrics off the charts. Its price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios stand at 124 and 52, respectively. Compare this to high-flying Nvidia's 40 and 35, and you can see that Arm stock will probably return to Earth soon. Investors should be cautious about buying at this level while looking for a better entry point. Arm has a tremendous future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Arm Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Arm Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Arm Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could Alphabet Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has minted a lot of millionaires since its public debut (as Google) in 2004. If you had invested $20,000 in that historic IPO, your stake would have grown by 6,850% to $1.39 million today.\n\nHowever, investors who missed out on Alphabet's gains over the past 20 years might be wondering if it can still generate millionaire-making returns from here. Let's see if the tech giant could turn $20,000 into $1 million again over the next 20 years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAlphabet's business model and growth rates\n\nFrom 2003 to 2023, Alphabet's revenue rose at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 31% as its net income increased at a CAGR of 39%. That growth was driven by the expansion of Google's search engine and advertising network, its acquisition of YouTube in 2006, and the broadening of its ecosystem across the web browser, webmail, mobile software, and cloud infrastructure-as-a-service markets.\n\nAlphabet also expanded into nascent markets like driverless vehicles, digital healthcare, and the development of experimental drugs, but it still generates the lion's share of its revenue from Google's advertising ecosystem, which faces unpredictable macroeconomic, competitive, and regulatory headwinds.\n\nOver the past few years, Google's ad sales were affected by macroeconomic issues like inflation and rising interest rates, stiff competition from Meta's (NASDAQ: META) family of apps and ByteDance's TikTok, and government regulations aimed at limiting its access to people's personal data for crafting targeted ads. The pandemic also disrupted its ad sales throughout 2020.\n\nTo reduce its long-term dependence on ads, Google expanded its subscription-based services, Play Store, and hardware devices (which it categorized as its \"other\" revenue), and its cloud platform. But as the following table illustrates, the growth of its \"other\" segment was unpredictable and its cloud segment cooled off over the past few years. At the same time, its advertising growth decelerated, so its total revenue expansion slowed down.\n\nStory continues\n\nMetric 2019 2020 2021 2022 2023 Google advertising revenue growth 16% 9% 43% 7% 6% Google \"other\" revenue growth 21% 28% 29% 4% 19% Google Cloud revenue growth 53% 46% 47% 37% 26% Total revenue growth 18% 20% 41% 10% 9% EPS growth* 12% 19% 91% (19%) 27%\n\nData source: Alphabet. *Adjusted for a 20-for-1 stock split in 2022.\n\nOn the bright side, Alphabet's earnings per share (EPS) growth accelerated again in 2023 as it laid off people, reined in its spending on its \"moonshot\" projects, and spent $61.5 billion on stock buybacks.\n\nAlphabet faces unpredictable long-term headwinds\n\nGoogle's advertising business is now expanding much slower than Meta's, and it faces unpredictable long-term challenges. Independent adtech companies like The Trade Desk are driving advertisers to break free from Google and Meta, Amazon is beefing up its own marketplace ads, and generative AI platforms like ChatGPT could pull users away from its search engine.\n\nGoogle is upgrading its search capabilities with new AI features like its Bard chatbot and Gemini large language model, but it still seems to be trailing Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) in the AI race. The Redmond-based software giant gained an early-mover advantage by backing OpenAI and integrating the start-up's AI tools into its own services.\n\nGoogle also continues to pay Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) billions of dollars every year to remain the default search engine on iOS. If Apple ever switches over to another search engine like Microsoft's Bing (a change that it reportedly considered in the past), Google could abruptly lose a large chunk of its advertising revenue and the global search market.\n\nFinally, Google Cloud still ranks a distant third in the cloud platform market behind Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft Azure. Its growth rate is decelerating, and it won't offset the slower expansion of its ad business anytime soon.\n\nCould Alphabet turn $20,000 into $1 million again?\n\nAlphabet's stock looks reasonably valued today at 22 times forward earnings. Assuming its valuation holds steady, it would need to increase its EPS at a CAGR of 22% for 20 years to turn $20,000 into $1 million.\n\nThat might seem possible if it keeps cutting costs and buying back shares, but those strategies could lose their potency if its revenue growth continues to decelerate. If Alphabet fails to light a fire under its advertising and cloud businesses again, its valuation will likely contract, and it could be revalued as a slower-growth tech giant like Oracle.\n\nThat declining multiple -- along with the fact that a 50-bagger gain would boost Alphabet's market cap to a whopping $90 trillion -- will probably prevent this company from turning a $20,000 investment into $1 million over the next two decades. Alphabet could still generate impressive gains, but investors should temper their expectations as its core business matures.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Dividend Stocks That Could Pay You for Life",
        "content": "In the past 12 months, at least two prominent dividend stocks decreased their payouts. Last year, it was Medical Properties Trust, a healthcare-focused real estate investment trust, while pharmacy chain giant Walgreens Boots Alliance started 2024 with a similar move.\n\nThese dividend cuts highlight the importance of finding stocks whose businesses are strong enough to support dividend increases even in challenging times. Fortunately, such stocks exist: Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ), Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), and Visa(NYSE: V) are three great examples.\n\n1. Johnson & Johnson\n\nAs far as dividend track records go, it's hard to find many more impressive than Johnson & Johnson's. The company is on its 61st consecutive year of payout increases and the stock currently yields about 3%. That demonstrates a resilient and innovative business that can navigate challenging conditions, economic and otherwise, while constantly delivering strong financial results. And we can expect more of the same from Johnson & Johnson for many more years as the drugmaker's lineup features more than a dozen blockbusters.\n\nOnce those run out of patent exclusivity, J&J has a deep pipeline that will help it replace key medicines. The company also boasts a promising medtech division that develops products across several areas. Key growth opportunities here include its robotic-assisted surgery device, Ottava.\n\nJohnson & Johnson isn't without risks. The company faces several challenges, including a relatively new law in the U.S., the Inflation Reduction Act, that gave Medicare the power to negotiate drug prices. The result could be lower sales for the companies that make these medicines, including Johnson & Johnson.\n\nHowever, the drugmaker should be able to handle this issue by developing brand-new medicines that can escape this regulatory burden. Johnson & Johnson remains a top stock that will likely continue paying and raising its dividends for a long time.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is best known for the iPhone, but the company's billion-dollar franchise is no longer a source of significant revenue growth. That shouldn't be too much of a problem, though; Apple is adapting its business and still has excellent growth prospects. The company has an installed base of more than 2.2 billion devices whose owners are eager to buy services.\n\nApple's services segment offers a suite of products from music and video streaming to health-related subscriptions. Apple's services don't yet account for most of its revenue, but they have grown faster in recent years.\n\nThe company's services segment also carries much juicier margins. The result will be stronger net profits, even if that might take awhile. The point is that Apple's business is solid and should continue performing well for a long time.\n\nNot only does Apple have more than 2.2 billion people within its ecosystem, but the company's customers are incredibly loyal. Apple's brand name is one of the most valuable in the world and the tech giant's ecosystem is hard to leave unless consumers don't mind abandoning important features that don't carry over to other devices, or losing data.\n\nWhat about the dividend? Apple has increased its payouts by about 104% in the past decade, and still boasts a low cash payout ratio of only 14%. Although the stock yields under 1% right now, the company can raise its dividends substantially without worries. And that's precisely what it's likely to do over the long run.\n\n3. Visa\n\nEveryone knows the Visa brand: The company helps facilitate credit card transactions through its payment network. There are millions of such transactions every day, and Visa collects a fee every single time. The company has few direct competitors, partly thanks to its network effect. At this point, any business that doesn't accept Visa as a payment method is practically begging customers to stay away.\n\nAnd the more businesses are plugged into its network, the more consumers getting brand-new credit cards will be attracted to it. This dynamic has been going on for a while and is partly responsible for Visa's strong financial results. Despite millions of credit cards with its logo in circulation, Visa still has excellent growth prospects. The company will continue making money as long as card spending increases and people move away from cash and checks..\n\nThat's been an ongoing trend for years, but there's plenty of runway ahead. Visa sees a significant opportunity to digitize cash and check transactions, even in advanced economies like the U.S. So it hasn't reached a ceiling yet -- far from it.\n\nThe company's dividend record over the past decade has been fantastic. Visa has increased its payouts by an incredible 420% while its cash payout ratio remains conservative at about 20%. The stock currently yields under 1%.\n\nVisa's competitive advantage and long-term prospects point to further dividend growth, and that's why dividend investors can safely keep this stock in their portfolios for good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Johnson & Johnson right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Johnson & Johnson, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Johnson & Johnson wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "A lot of well-known companies have had to contend with slumping share prices in recent years. After years of strong and predictable gains, many companies have seen their stocks fall out of favor with investors.\n\nThis can be due to a number of factors. Slowing sales, dwindling profits, loss of market share, and failure to keep up with shifting tides can all lead to once mighty stocks falling on hard times. While many securities are still down for the count, some are getting up off the mat and look ready to fight their way back into the good graces of investors. After declining and then languishing for long periods, certain stocks seem to have finally bottomed and are marching higher once again.\n\nFor shareholders who held on and kept the faith, this is a moment of vindication. Yet for other investors, it’s a moment of opportunity. Let’s delve into three unloved stocks with promising catalysts to bring them back into investors’ favor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven Warren Buffett is selling Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock.\n\nThe famed investor just disclosed in a regulatory filing that his holding company Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) sold 10 million AAPL shares during the fourth quarter of last year. The sale made headlines as Buffett has long been Apple’s self-proclaimed biggest fan, and the company’s largest individual shareholder. Berkshire Hathaway currently holds a little more than 905 million shares of Apple worth $165 billion.\n\nWhile Apple continues to be Buffett’s biggest position, comprising nearly half (45%) of his stock portfolio, the sale late last year is further evidence of the poor sentiment surrounding AAPL stock. The ill will is reflected in the fact that Apple’s share price is down 2% year to date (YTD). Declining sales of its legacy devices, such as the iPhone, are the main reason the stock is down. However, there’s reason to believe Apple’s stock is ready to rise as the company introduces its Vision Pro augmented reality (AR) headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Vision Pro is Apple’s first entirely new device since the Apple Watch was introduced in 2015, and should help to boost the company’s finances and share price. Additionally, early reviews of the Vision Pro are positive.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) Disney logo on a store front. DIS stock.\n\nSource: chrisdorney / Shutterstock\n\nRecently, Walt Disney Co. (NYSE:DIS) delivered quarterly financial results that look to be getting the company and its stock out of the dog house with investors.\n\nShares of the Mouse House have risen 12% since the company issued its latest earnings print on Feb. 7. DIS stock is now up 23% on the year and trading at a 52-week high. It’s a big turnaround after the share price languished at a multi-year low for most of 2023.\n\nFurther, the reversal of fortune comes after Disney reported better-than-expected Q4 financial results. Also, it increased its dividend payment to shareholders by 50%. Starting this July, Disney will pay a semi-annual dividend to stockholders of 45 cents. That’s a whopping 50% higher than its current payout. Walt Disney reinstated its dividend late last year after suspending it in 2020 during the Covid-19 pandemic. If that weren’t enough, Disney also announced a new $3 billion stock buyback plan. Investors are loving it.\n\nGeneral Electric (GE) Company breakups: The General Electric GE logo on a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor 20 years, General Electric (NYSE:GE) was viewed as a value trap. From the late 1990s through to the pandemic in 2020, GE stock consistently slid downwards. It was so bad that in July 2021, the company executed a one-for-eight reverse stock split to artificially raise its share price in what was widely viewed as an act of desperation.\n\nMy, how things have changed! Currently, GE stock is up 18% on the year and has gained 75% in the last 12 months due to a remarkable turnaround at the industrial conglomerate.\n\nAt the end of January, General Electric reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat Wall Street forecasts across the board. Also, the company reported earnings per share (EPS) of $1.03, which was higher than the 91 cents consensus estimate of analysts. Revenue in Q4 rose 15% to $19.42 billion, beating forecasts of $17.67 billion. GE said the strong print was due to demand for parts and services at its jet engine business.\n\nMuch of the turnaround has come from the company separating its diverse business units. General Electric completed the separation of its healthcare business last year and plans to spin off its energy business into a separate company this April.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Sold Nearly $2 Billion Worth of Apple Last Quarter. Here's Why.",
        "content": "CEO Warren Buffett called Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) \"a better business than any we own\" at Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) annual shareholder meeting last May. The stock is, by far, the largest holding in Berkshire's portfolio, a sign of Buffett's conviction in the company. Yet the Oracle of Omaha decided to sell nearly $2 billion worth of Apple shares at the end of last year.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway held 10 million fewer Apple shares at the year's end than in September, according to the company's 13-F filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission. But investors shouldn't start worrying Buffett has soured on the tech titan. There's a clear explanation as to why Buffett sold some of his Apple stock. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nApple's not the only stock Buffett sold last year\n\nBuffett sold a lot of stocks in 2023. Through the first nine months of the year, Berkshire Hathaway sold $32.8 billion worth of stock (and bought just $9.1 billion).\n\nBuffett had plenty of good reasons for trimming some positions and exiting others entirely, but it's impossible to ignore the tax consequences of Buffett's sales.\n\nWhile Berkshire Hathaway reports deferred income taxes on the unrealized gains in its portfolio as a liability on its balance sheet, it doesn't actually have to pay those taxes until Buffett or one of the other investment managers at Berkshire sells shares and realizes a gain. As of the end of September, Berkshire's deferred tax liability was about $85 billion. It had $207 billion in net unrealized gains, and stock sales earlier in the year generated $5.4 billion in realized gains.\n\nBuffett continued selling in the fourth quarter. Two of the biggest sales were HP and Paramount Global.\n\nHe slashed 78% of Berkshire's remaining position in HP, a move Buffett started to make in the third quarter. That stock sale likely came with a hefty loss, as HP shares have declined in value since Buffett first established the position.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett cut one-third of Berkshire's position in Paramount. That represents another big loss from his initial stake established in 2022 when the stock traded above $30 per share.\n\nNeedless to say, Buffett's investments in these two companies didn't work out as expected. And he's not afraid to admit defeat when he's wrong or own up to a mistake. Plus, the sale of the two losing positions resulted in significant losses that can count against gains in Berkshire's portfolio.\n\nSo, in order to take advantage of the losses, Buffett looked to take gains on some of his winning positions. Apple is one of his biggest wins. So, it makes sense that he took just enough gains to offset the losses from other stock sales, resulting in a minimal net realized gain and a small tax bill as a consequence.\n\nDid Buffett make a mistake selling Apple?\n\nThis isn't the first time Buffett's sold shares of Apple at the end of the year.\n\nHe sold shares at the end of 2018, 2019, and 2020, very likely taking gains each time. The sales were done purely for tax purposes. But Buffett said the decision to sell Apple shares was \"probably a mistake\" during Berkshire's 2021 annual meeting. When he asked Vice Chairman Charlie Munger if he thought it was a mistake, too, he simply replied, \"Yes!\"\n\nBuffett looked to correct his error by buying more Apple shares in 2022 as stock prices declined. Still, he missed out on significant gains by selling Apple. Shares reached a new all-time high last year.\n\nBuffett may have just repeated his mistake. That said, last quarter's sale isn't nearly as big as his sale in 2020. The 10 million shares he sold represent about 1% of Berkshire's total position. If it does turn out to be a mistake, it'll be a much smaller one. What's more, Buffett has an opportunity to buy back those Apple shares at a lower price, after the company's stock dropped to start the year.\n\nApple shares currently offer relatively good value. They trade at 27.8 times analysts' consensus estimate for 2024 earnings and just 25.5 times expected earnings in 2025. While that's a premium to the overall market, Apple shares arguably deserve a premium thanks to the generous capital return program and the $100 billion per year the company generates in free cash flow.\n\nThe important lesson for investors is that there are many reasons an investment manager might sell a stock. It doesn't necessarily mean they no longer like the company or they think it's not a good value. And in the case of Buffett's take on Apple, he's betting about $165 billion it's a great investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) share prices are down about 5% on the year so far, and Wedbush analyst Dan Ives sees the drop as a buying opportunity.\n\nThe analyst recently maintained his buy rating on the stock and reiterated a $250 near-term price target. That target represents a 35% upside from the current share price of $183. His optimism reflects sales expectations for Apple's new Vision Pro headset, which the company describes in press releases as \"a revolutionary spatial computer that seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world.\"\n\nAnalysts expect the Vision Pro to hit 1 million unit sales in 2025\n\nAnalysts at Wedbush originally set the high price target last year on the expectation of strong sales of the iPhone 15. Sure enough, Apple reported better-than-expected revenue of $119 billion in the December-ending quarter, driven by iPhone.\n\nIves now sees Apple's Vision Pro headset -- the company's first major computing product since the Apple Watch -- as a growth catalyst that could provide upside to Apple's long-term earnings growth. His sales forecast is 600,000 units in 2024 with 1 million unit sales in 2025.\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan has the same forecast for 2025, and he raised his projection to 4 million units for 2026.\n\nIs Apple stock a buy?\n\nApple stock is not cheap, trading at a high forward price-to-earnings ratio of 28, and the Vision Pro may take a while to catch on with Apple's customers, especially given its high retail price tag of $3,499.\n\nHowever, Apple has a long history of delivering new products that people eventually can't live without but didn't think they wanted in the first place. This is a highly profitable business, with nearly $100 billion in annual free cash flow, and it got to this point by making calculated bets on what it thinks customers are going to love.

        "title": "A Golden Investment Opportunity: 1 Top Stock to Buy Before It Soars 40% to Hit $4 Trillion, According to a Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) remains a top technology stock at Wedbush Securities despite worrisome results in its China business. Analyst Dan Ives dismissed those concerns as noise and recently said Apple will become the first $4 trillion company by the end of 2024. That prediction implies 40% upside from its current market capitalization of $2.85 trillion.\n\nIves provided additional commentary in a note to clients: \"With roughly 240 million iPhones in the window of an upgrade opportunity globally now at play for iPhone 15, and services reaccelerating into [fiscal year 2024], we view this as a golden opportunity to own Apple for the next year.\"\n\nHere's what investors should know.\n\nApple worried investors with declining sales in China and a weak outlook\n\nApple reported better-than-expected financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024, which ended Dec. 30, 2023. Revenue rose 2% to $119.5 billion on a modest uptick in iPhone sales and more robust growth in services revenue. Management highlighted advertising, video, and cloud services as major contributors to that momentum.\n\nApple earns higher margins on services than hardware, so the company has become more profitable over time as its services business has scaled. That trend continued in the first quarter. Gross margin expanded 290 basis points and GAAP earnings jumped 16% to $2.18 per diluted share. Stock buybacks also contributed to rapid bottom-line growth.\n\nThe chart below provides a more detailed look at Apple's revenue growth in the first quarter. Chart by Author. Shown above is Apple's revenue across all five business segments in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended Dec. 30, 2023).\n\nDespite strong results, Apple shares slid about 4% following the report for two reasons. First, sales declined 13% in China, fueling concern that the company is losing share to domestic competitors like Huawei and Xiaomi. Jeffries analysts estimate that iPhone sales fell 30% in China during the first week of 2024. That is a pressing concern because China is Apple's third-largest market and represents one-sixth of total revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, while Apple did not provide formal guidance, management implied that revenue would fall about 5% in the second quarter. CFO Luca Maestri attributed that weak outlook to the absence of certain tailwinds. Specifically, Apple benefited from pent-up iPhone demand in the second quarter of last year because factory closures had previously limited production.\n\nApple is a consumer electronics leader with growth opportunities in services\n\nApple has a strong presence in several corners of the consumer electronics market. Its leadership in smartphones (as measured by revenue and shipments) is the foundation of its business. But the tech titan also enjoys a dominant position in the tablet and smartwatch markets, and it's one of the largest personal computer vendors. That success is built on brand authority and engineering expertise.\n\nSpecifically, Apple pairs premium hardware (including custom chips) with proprietary software and services to create a compelling user experience. And while the iPhone is the center of that ecosystem, adjacent products like Macs and AirPods make the ecosystem stickier. Those qualities grant Apple substantial pricing power. The average iPhone costs twice as much as the average Android smartphone, according to Insider Intelligence.\n\nThat pricing power allows Apple to invest heavily in research and development. The company recently launched its first mixed-reality device, the Apple Vision Pro, a product some pundits believe will eventually replace the iPad.\n\nApple's installed base surpassed 2.2 billion devices in the first quarter. The company monetizes those consumers once with the initial purchase, but it aims to monetize them continuously thereafter with its services business. For instance, Apple earns services revenue on App Store fees and related advertising, iCloud storage, and financial products like Apple Pay, among other subscription products.\n\nThe company has a strong position in a few of those categories. The Apple App Store leads the mobile application market in revenue; Apple is the fifth-fastest-growing digital advertising company in the U.S.; and Apple Pay is the most popular in-store mobile wallet among U.S. consumers.\n\nApple shares trade at an expensive valuation compared to big tech peers\n\nTo create shareholder value, Apple needs to maintain its strong position in smartphones and continue to grow its services business. The company must also stay current on nascent technologies like virtual reality and augmented reality. Products that incorporate those technologies could be the next big thing in consumer electronics. If Apple falls behind, it may be displaced in the same way the iPhone displaced products from Nokia and BlackBerry.\n\nWhether Apple reaches $4 trillion in 2024 is a coin toss. Investors interested in buying the stock should plan on holding it for three to five years at a minimum. Personally, I doubt Apple can deliver market-beating returns during that period. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings looks expensive compared to the long-term earnings growth of 9.4% annually that Wall Street expects.\n\nTaken together, those values produce a PEG ratio of 3.1 for Apple. For context, Alphabet has a PEG ratio of 1.5, Amazon sports a PEG ratio of 2.3, and Microsoft has a PEG ratio of 2.5. That means Apple is more expensive than its big tech peers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "People in most parts of the world have yet to get their hands on Apple's Vision Pro, the tech giant's first mixed-reality headset that launched exclusively in the US earlier this month. But in the southern Chinese tech hub of Shenzhen, sellers are already offering much cheaper alternatives.\n\nOne of them is the Vision SE, made by Shenzhen-based headset maker EmdoorVR. CEO Shi Qing said the company was hoping to leverage the interest around Apple's Vision Pro to survive a slowdown in the virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) industry.\n\n\"We did not want to miss the Apple Vision Pro opportunity, so we rode the wave and made something similar,\" he said.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world?

Yet, their functionality and prices are starkly different.\n\nA customer tests a Vision Pro headset at an Apple store in Palo Alto, California.

Demand was curtailed by macroeconomic pressures on both consumers and businesses, according to that report.\n\nIn China, Pico, the world's second-largest VR brand and a subsidiary of TikTok owner ByteDance, conducted at least two rounds of lay-offs last year, affecting hundreds of employees.

The company has shipped 200,000 units of its AX161 headset, an enterprise product with the same specifications as Vision SE, since its launch last year.\n\nVision SE is EmdoorVR's shot at the consumer segment, and the company is counting on Apple to pave the way.\n\nThe device's marketing and launch schedule follows closely that of the Californian giant: Vision SE hit the market in October, just months after Apple unveiled the Vision Pro in June. EmdoorVR then showcased its headset at CES, one of the world's leading consumer electronics expos, which took place in Las Vegas last month, right before the Vision Pro shipped on February 2.\n\nA person tried out a Meta Quest 3 headset at the Facebook owner's headquarters in Menlo Park, California.

Photo: AFP>\n\nApple's entry into the VR and AR market has already drawn the interest of Chinese app developers. DingTalk, the work collaboration platform run by e-commerce giant Alibaba Group Holding, recently launched a native app for the Vision Pro, allowing users to send messages and hold video meetings in a three-dimensional virtual environment.\n\nAlibaba is the owner of the South China Morning Post.\n\nShanghai-based online travel service provider Trip.com Group - which also operates Ctrip, Qunar and Skyscanner - has also introduced an app for the Vision Pro, letting users watch panoramic videos of travel destinations, such as Mount Everest and the Sahara.\n\nEmdoor's Shi said he saw the Apple Vision Pro as a major opportunity to educate the market and bring substantial changes to the content ecosystem and supply chain, which would eventually make similar headsets more popular and affordable.\n\nBut for now, his top goal is just to stay afloat after a challenging year.\n\n\"2023 has been tough for the VR industry, which saw tech giants downsize their investment and manpower in these projects,\" Shi said. \"My priority for my team is to survive and ship products.\"\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Top 20 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves",
        "content": "In this article, we will list the top 20 companies with the most cash reserves. If you want to skip our detailed discussion about cash hoarding by nonbanking US firms, go to 7 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves.\n\nA recent research by Harvard Business Review revealed that nonbanking US companies have increased their hoards of cash significantly post-pandemic. Traditionally, financial institutions such as banks keep large sums of cash in hand because they are in the business of lending money.\n\nIt does not make any apparent sense for nonbanking companies to hoard large piles of cash and collect only interest when cash could be invested for larger profits. According to the latest figures, the total cash reserves of the nonbanking US companies are a whopping $6.9 trillion, nearly equivalent to the GDPs of Germany and India combined. Today, cash represents $1 out of every $5 of total assets held by nonbanking US firms.\n\nAs we dig a little deeper, the reasons for keeping cash reserves become clearer. According to analysts, companies are hoarding cash because it helps them avoid premature failures that might decimate shareholder value. It allows them greater investment and operational flexibility. Economies around the world are increasingly becoming knowledge-based. The 'winner-take-all reward' model is quite prevalent in industries around the world. So, nonbanking firms are hoarding cash to utilize now-or-never opportunities.\n\nCash also provides a cushion to bridge the timing mismatch between cash generation and sudden cash needs. In simple terms, it gives the firms the flexibility to quickly capitalize on profitable opportunities. However, there is more to this story.\n\nMaintaining and building flexibility to capitalize on profitable opportunities is one side of the coin when it comes to hoarding cash. Higher cash reserves allow the companies to avoid taxes since they can only be collected on profits made by investments. The premise of investing cash in profitable investments rather than collecting only interest does not factor in the tax rate applied to those profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, it would only make sense for companies to invest rather than hoard cash if the investment is significantly net positive, including tax. Even if the investment is net positive after taxation but without a significant margin, it makes more sense for companies to keep the cash in hand for a small cost and utilize it when a one-of-a-kind opportunity arises. Then, there is also an exception of firms with subjective valuation. These firms might struggle to access capital quickly, and so keep a large proportion of their assets as cash in hand.\n\nIt is quite interesting to note that multinationals whose value is generated primarily by their intellectual property are hoarding cash. Research by the professors at Kellogg School of Management found that reserves of Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) accounted for 92% of cash reserves that they could document. Naturally, all of these are tech companies and are also part of our top tech companies list.\n\nAll three companies are extensively involved in research and development. In fact, last year  Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) held off increasing the salaries of its employees, citing investment in AI as one of the reasons. It is worth noting that two of these companies, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and  Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) are in competition with each other for the development of AI models. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) has invested heavily in Open AI, whereas Alphabet, Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has invested in Antropic. It is quite apparent that both companies see the AI revolution as one of a kind opportunity that they want to capitalize on.\n\nIn 2018,  Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) set an ambitious goal to reach a net cash neutral position where any cash in hand is balanced by its total debt. However, last year, the company took drastic steps to decrease the pile of idle cash it was sitting on. Apple, Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) returned much of the cash to shareholders in the form of share buybacks and dividends.\n\nIt is worth noting here that despite all of the cash hoarding by nonbanking US companies, the financial sector and banking institutions have the most cash. This is apparent in our list as an overwhelming majority are financial institutions.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at the top 20 companies with the most cash reserves.  Top 20 Companies With the Most Cash Reserves\n\nA bank teller in a full-service office, counting and organizing cash.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor our list of the top  20 companies with the most cash reserves, we researched online for companies with significant 'cash on hand' in their balance sheets.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer's Top 11Stock Picks This Week. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer's Top 5Stock Picks This Week.\n\nJim Cramer earlier this week talked about \"froth\" in the market which he believes could be a \"bummer\" albeit \"enjoyable\" at the same time. Cramer said that while the market has been up for 14 out of the last 15 weeks, many circles believe that is not a good development since too much enthusiasm in the market could be a telltale sign of future declines. Jim Cramer gave some examples of what he calls \"exuberance\" in the market. Cramer talked about Arm Holdings' huge stock price gains posted recently. Arm Holdings stock is up about 84% over the past one month. The stock is rising mostly on the back of the AI enthusiasm as investors believe the UK-based semiconductor company could see a huge demand for its chips just like Nvidia.\n\nCramer Talks About Market \"Froth\" and Lack of Discipline\n\nBut these gains are just too much for Cramer, who yelled \"give me a break\" when talking about Arm Holdings. Cramer said most of the people buying ARM have no idea what they are doing and said they \"just have no discipline.\"\n\nCramer also said that the NASDAQ is currently going through a \"parabolic rally\" and such rallies are \"never sustainable.\"\n\nGiven this pragmatic and realistic stance of Jim Cramer, it'd be interesting to see which stocks he's bullish on and recommends buying even during this market environment where \"froth\" is making it difficult for investors to evaluate companies realistically.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we watched several programs of Jim Cramer aired this week on CNBC and picked 10 stocks he's recommending investors to buy. Unlike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), which Jim Cramer often talks about during his programs, you will see some new names which Cramer is bullish on.\n\nStory continues Jim Cramer's Top Stock Picks This Week\n\n10. Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 15\n\nCramer was recently asked about his thoughts on Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM). He said while it's a tough call, he believes Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) \"is going higher.\"\n\n\"Buy some and then wait for it to come down.\"\n\nEarlier this month, Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) raised its full fiscal year profit as it reported Q3 results. Profit in the third quarter was ¥1.36 trillion, up from ¥727.9 billion in the same period in 2022.\n\nOut of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey, 15 hedge funds had stakes in Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM). The most significant stake in Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM) is owned by Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management which owns a $1.1 billion stake in Toyota Motor Corp (NYSE:TM). In addition to TM, hedge funds also like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\n9. Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 18\n\nInformation management and data center services company Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM) ranks ninth in our list of the top Jim Cramer stock picks this week. Jim Cramer was recently asked about this thoughts on Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM). Cramer said he always liked Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM) because it has a healthy dividend yield as well as posted strong growth in stock price (30%+ over the past one year). Cramer said:\n\n\"I reiterate that I like this stock.\"\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 18 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM). At the end of December 2023, Ken Griffin's Citadel Investment Group had a $139 million stake in Iron Mountain Inc (NYSE:IRM).\n\n8.

(NYSE:STZ)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 50\n\nJim Cramer was earlier this week asked about Anheuser-Busch Inbev SA (NYSE:BUD). Cramer said he likes the stock along with other beverage names like Molson Coors Beverage and Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ). However, Cramer also lamented that \"people don’t seem to like the beer companies.\"\n\nCramer recommended buying Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) and said his charitable trust also owns a position in Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ).\n\nLike Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), Jim Cramer is also bullish on Constellation Brands (STZ).\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 50 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ). The biggest stake in Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ) is owned by Israel Englander's Millennium Management which owns a $246 million stake in Constellation Brands, Inc. (NYSE:STZ).\n\nThe company talked about guidance during its Q3 earnings call:\n\n\"As we look towards the end of fiscal ’24, our guidance for enterprise comparable EPS, excluding Canopy equity and earnings remains unchanged at $12 to $12.20 underpinned by the following expectations. First, an unchanged 8% to 9% net sales growth outlook but a higher 7% to 8% operating income growth expectation for our Beer business. As stated in our prior calls this year and at our recent Investor Day event for our beer net sales, we continue to expect pricing to be between 1% to 2% and mid to high single-digit volume growth in fiscal ’24.\n\nAnd we still anticipate shipment volumes for the second half to account for approximately 45% of the full year total. Bill already addressed the drivers of the uplift in our beer operating income growth guidance but it’s also important to note that we still expect beer operating margin to be approximately 38% for the full year. Second, for our Wine & Spirits business, we now expect a decline of 7% to 9% in organic net sales and a decline of 6% to 8% in operating income, excluding the impact of the divested wine brands that are no longer part of our results. Bill also already addressed the drivers for these revisions. Third, from a corporate expense perspective, we now expect that to be approximately $260 million to $270 million for the full year which includes a slightly lower end to the range versus our prior expectation.\n\nAnd similarly, our interest expense expectations are now slightly lower at approximately $450 million. And last but not least, we continue to expect our comparable effective tax rate, excluding Canopy, to be approximately 19% and despite the additional $215 million of share repurchases executed in the third quarter, we also continue to anticipate weighted average diluted shares outstanding to be approximately $184 million. Beyond the P&L, for free cash flow, we expect to be in the range of $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion for fiscal ’24, reflective of $2.6 billion to $2.8 billion in operating cash flow and $1.2 billion to $1.3 billion of CapEx. In closing, we continue to deliver industry-leading results in our beer business and remain confident in our ability to achieve our stated EPS targets for this fiscal year despite incremental category headwinds affecting our Wine & Spirits business.\n\nAs we look further ahead, we remain excited about continuing opportunities to build shareholder value over the medium term, which we hope to achieve by capturing the substantial growth opportunities that exist for our Beer business, executing against our consistent, disciplined and balanced capital allocation priorities and delivering enhanced performance in Wine & Spirits, supported by the significant transformation that business has undergone and the actions that we are taking to improve this business.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClick to continue reading and see Jim Cramer’s Top 5 Stock Picks This Week.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\nJim Cramer’s 11 Latest Stock Picks Jim Cramer Says You Should Stay Away from These 10 Stocks Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "Introduction to the Transaction\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s Berkshire Hathaway has recently expanded its investment portfolio with the addition of Liberty Media Corp Junk (NASDAQ:LLYVK). On August 3, 2023, the firm made a significant move by acquiring 11,132,590 shares of the media conglomerate. This transaction showcases Buffett's continued interest in diversifying his holdings and his confidence in the media sector.\n\nProfile of the Guru: Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio), often referred to as \"The Oracle of Omaha,\" is a legendary figure in the investment world. As the Chairman of Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has transformed a modest textile company into a global insurance and investment powerhouse. His value investing strategy, influenced by mentor Benjamin Graham, emphasizes long-term growth, intrinsic value, and a strong margin of safety. Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio includes a diverse range of companies, with a particular focus on technology and financial services sectors. Warren Buffett Bolsters Portfolio with Liberty Media Corp Junk Acquisition\n\nOverview of Liberty Media Corp Junk\n\nLiberty Media Corp Junk, operating under the stock symbol LLYVK, is a diversified media company in the United States. Since its IPO on August 4, 2023, the company has been involved in the operations of Live Nation and other strategic media investments. Despite its recent entry into the market, Liberty Media Corp Junk has a market capitalization of $3.42 billion and a current stock price of $37.72. However, the company's financial metrics and stock performance indicators, including a GF Score of 18/100, suggest that it may face challenges ahead. Warren Buffett Bolsters Portfolio with Liberty Media Corp Junk Acquisition\n\nAnalysis of the Trade\n\nThe trade executed by Berkshire Hathaway on August 3, 2023, resulted in an addition of 10,802,069 shares, marking a significant increase in the firm's stake in Liberty Media Corp Junk. Notably, the trade impact on the portfolio and the trade price data are not available, which leaves some aspects of the transaction open to interpretation. The position data also indicates that, as of now, the stock does not represent a significant portion of Buffett's overall portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nSignificance of the Trade in Buffett's Portfolio\n\nWhile the exact trade impact is not disclosed, the acquisition of Liberty Media Corp Junk shares aligns with Berkshire Hathaway's investment strategy. The firm's portfolio is heavily weighted towards technology and financial services, and the addition of a media company could represent a strategic diversification move.

Despite these gains, the company's financial strength and profitability metrics are less than ideal, with low rankings in several key areas. The absence of a GF Value and related rankings indicates that the stock's intrinsic value cannot be evaluated at this time.\n\nOther Gurus' Interest in Liberty Media Corp Junk\n\nWarren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio) is not the only prominent investor with an interest in Liberty Media Corp Junk. Other notable investors, including Ron Baron (Trades, Portfolio), Seth Klarman (Trades, Portfolio), and Wallace Weitz (Trades, Portfolio), have also taken positions in the stock. This collective interest from multiple respected investors may signal underlying value or potential in the company's future performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nIn summary, Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s recent acquisition of Liberty Media Corp Junk shares is a strategic addition to Berkshire Hathaway's diverse portfolio. While the trade's impact is not fully disclosed, it reflects Buffett's investment philosophy of seeking long-term value. As the market continues to observe the performance of Liberty Media Corp Junk, value investors will be watching closely to see how this investment aligns with Berkshire Hathaway's successful track record.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "title": "My Top 3 Stock Candidates to Replace Tesla in the Magnificent 7",
        "content": "A year ago, we wouldn’t discuss replacing Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) as one of the Magnificent 7 stocks. However, losing 50% of its value since November, the drum beat gets louder to replace Elon Musk’s baby.\n\nIt’s gotten so bad for the billionaire and his electric vehicle company that Quartz asked its readers if Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) should replace Tesla in the Magnificent 7.\n\n“Tesla is in a bunch of trouble: Its latest-and-greatest product is a rusty truck that has trouble going uphill in the snow. Its losing EV market share in the U.S. CEO Elon Musk reportedly has a drug problem so bad his board member friends want him to go to rehab,” wrote Quartz contributor Melvin Backman.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHey, I’ve been on the Abercrombie bandwagon for a while now. In December, I suggested that ANF was an excellent long-term buy despite being up more than 200% in 2023. It’s got gross margins to die for.\n\nBut, seriously, you can’t possibly put a $6 billion market cap in the same league as an EV maker that generated $4.4 billion in free cash flow in 2023. They’re two completely different kettle of fish.\n\nTo be in the Magnificent 7, you should have a market cap of at least $500 billion. That leaves just six companies that qualify outside the Mag 7. Of those, just two are tech stocks.\n\nThese would be my three candidates to replace Tesla in the exclusive group.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A),(NYSE:BRK-B) has a market cap of $872.5 billion, $252 billion higher than Tesla.\n\nAnd even though Warren Buffett trimmed his stake in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the final quarter of 2023, it still makes up about 45% of the holding company’s portfolio. At the very least, that makes it an honorary tech business.\n\nIf you argue that Berkshire can’t qualify because it’s not growing fast enough, that holds some water, but it shouldn’t preclude it from being a candidate. Think of all of the billionaires that Warren Buffett has made over the years because people invested in his company.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn May 2019, Bloomberg published an article discussing how his company’s growth helped create at least seven billionaires, including the late Charlie Munger, Buffett’s long-time friend and Vice Chairman.\n\nI know several families whose lives have been greatly changed because their parents invested in Berkshire B shares when they first came out in 1996.\n\nI’m sure Buffett never gets tired of hearing these stories. It’s simply magnificent.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) has a market cap of $720.2 billion, $99 billion higher than Tesla.\n\nTheoretically, the Magnificent 7 shouldn’t just be technologically magnificent and contribute to society. I’m not suggesting that everything Tesla has done in renewable energy and automotive isn’t a contribution because it is.\n\nHowever, without healthcare companies like Eli Lilly developing life-saving drugs, many more people would have no life to appreciate.\n\nReading the story about Teddy Roosevelt’s wife and mother dying on Valentine’s Day, 1884, makes me think of the progress we’ve made regarding simple things such as sanitary living conditions. Roosevelt’s wife likely died of a strep infection, and his mother died from typhoid caused by contaminated food or water.\n\nOn Feb. 13, Jefferies analyst Akash Tewari raised his price target on LLY stock to $853, $39 higher than his previous target and 13% higher than where it’s currently trading. He maintained a Buy rating on the stock.\n\nThe analyst estimates the company’s orfoscerinib drug in clinical trials has potential peak annual sales of $14 billion, $3 billion higher than the consensus estimate.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nJPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) has a market cap of $519.7 billion, $101.2 billion less than Tesla. I’ve selected it because it’s over $500 billion, and Jamie Dimon’s a banking machine.\n\nOn Feb. 15, JPM stock hit an all-time high of $180.04. While that’s great news, you won’t get rich quickly owning the bank stock. Since 1984, its shares have gained 1,516%. That’s decent, made better by a 2.5% dividend yield, but it’s not a home run like Deere (NYSE:DE), which is up 6,726% over the same period.\n\nHowever, once interest rates move lower, Dimon and the company should be able to increase profits. Until then, get paid a dividend that yields 2.3%. Plus, analysts like its stock. Of the 26 that cover it, 19 rate it a Buy (73%), with a target price of $194, 8% higher than its current share price.\n\nIn 2023, JPMorgan had an interest income of $170.6 billion. Unfortunately, due to high interest rates, its interest expense was 48% of its interest income. In 2022, when rates were lower, its interest expense was 28% of its $92.8 billion interest income.\n\nWhen rates come down, it won’t have to work as hard to earn a higher margin on its loans, etc.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) surprised the stock market recently by announcing it would pay its first-ever quarterly dividend. The owner of Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp said the payout will be 50 cents per share, or $2 per share on an annual basis. That works out to a yield of about 0.4% at current prices. It’s not earth-shattering but leaves room for lots of future growth.\n\nThere was a time back in the 1990’s when very few tech stocks paid dividends. They were financing their growth and chose to plow their excess cash back into the business. Thirty years on and these are now more mature operations so you can find many tech companies paying dividends: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) all reward shareholders for owning the stock.\n\nMost tech companies still don’t pay dividends, but arguably many of them should. At the very least least they could afford to pay them. Here are three tech stocks that should follow Meta’s lead and initiate a dividend, but let’s see if they actually will.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Logo of Alphabet (GOOG) website displayed on the screen of the mobile device. alphabet logo visible on display of modern smartphone on white\n\nSource: turbaliska / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is one of the first tech stocks that springs to mind that could pay shareholders a dividend. It ended 2023 with over $110 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments on its balance sheet. The search giant also generated nearly $70 billion in free cash flow (FCF). Alphabet certainly has the financial wherewithal to initiate a payout but probably won’t.\n\nCurrently, Alphabet chooses to use much of its excess cash to buy back shares. Just last year it spent $61.5 billion on repurchasing shares, equivalent to 88% of its FCF. Many businesses think buying back stock is a better use of their cash profits than dividends. That’s because they can be a more tax-efficient way to return value to shareholders.\n\nAlthough President Biden began taxing companies 1% on the stocks they repurchased beginning in 2022 it hasn’t deterred companies from repurchasing shares. Now the president wants to quadruple the tax to 4%. However, investors tend to prefer dividends because it is a tangible symbol of a company’s success. It is cash they can reinvest in the business themselves if they choose. Nevertheless, Alphabet doesn’t look likely to scratch that itch anytime soon.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilarly, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is unlikely to begin paying shareholders either for owning its stock. Like Alphabet, the e-commerce giant can afford a dividend, after having $87 billion in liquid assets available and producing $32 billion in FCF last year. But unlike Alphabet, Amazon was not buying back its stock, instead choosing to reinvest in the business.\n\nThere are only a few things a company can do with its cash profits: pay dividends, buy back shares, pay down debt, engage in mergers and acquisitions or reinvest back into the business. Amazon is choosing to do the latter, spending virtually all of its profits across its varied businesses.\n\nAmazon is more than just e-commerce, it is also a cloud services company through Amazon Web Services. It also has physical retail stores, third-party marketplaces, digital advertising, streaming video and more. By putting its cash profits to work in each of these areas, it hopes to grow them into dominant forces, which it has in many instances.\n\nAmazon is the No. 1 destination for online sales and is the leading cloud service provider through AWS. Sometimes it fails spectacularly, like with its Fire Phone and Amazon Wallet. The key takeaway is Amazon is continually looking to grow and expand so it seems unlikely it will ever pay a dividend.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) Salesforce (CRM) company logo seen displayed on smart phone. Salesforce Layoffs 2023\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the surface customer relationship management specialist Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) does not have quite the same financial resources as either Alphabet or Amazon. It only has $12.5 billion in cash, equivalents, and short-term investments available to it. However, it did see a 19% increase over the past year of FCF, generating $6.3 billion in 2023.\n\nAlthough Salesforce could sustainably afford to pay a dividend, it instead chooses one of the other routes open to it for using its FCF: making acquisitions. Salesforce could be considered a serial acquirer, with significant acquisitions in the past few years. Notably, Slack was acquired for $27.7 billion in 2021, Tableau for $15.7 billion in 2019 and MuleSoft was bought the year before for $6.5 billion. Salesforce anticipates making many more acquisitions in the future.\n\nBecause M&A activity is part and parcel of Salesforce’s DNA and it uses up the bulk of its cash profits, little remains for dividends. The CRM specialist becomes another in a long list of tech stocks that could, and maybe should prioritize a dividend over the paths they’ve chosen. However, Salesforce seems unlikely to take that path, and investors shouldn’t hold their breath waiting.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) is working on a new artificial intelligence tool to help app developers work more efficiently, according to a report from Bloomberg. The tool would help Apple take on rival tech giant Microsoft (MSFT), which has its own platform, GitHub Copilot.\n\nYahoo Finance's Madison Mills and Rachelle Akuffo break down the story.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nMADISON MILLS: Time now for our stock to watch, focusing on Apple doubling down on AI, reportedly looking to compete the next-- and complete the next version of its programming software Xcode and release it to third party software makers as early as this year. And that's according to a scoop from \"Bloomberg News.\" We see that moving up, Apple, even though it was in the red after the close yesterday, Rachelle.\n\nAnd what's interesting to me about this, is it seems like Apple is betting on making money from the developer side, providing this code-driven software to folks who maybe want to use it to develop apps for the App Store. Meanwhile, you have Microsoft focusing more so on AI-driven technology that will be embedded in phones the consumers will use. So I'm curious to see which of those two strategies is going to be the most financially viable one, but certainly looking good for Apple in the trade so far this morning, which is up and beating Microsoft in the early trade.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: True. I think people were wondering what's going to be that next big push that we see from Apple in AI. We know that when OpenAI was pushing ahead, people were like, why aren't we hearing more from the Apple camp here? But yes, they're supposedly-- they're reportedly going to have been working on, for about a year, this software tool for app developers that will compete with Microsoft's GitHub Copilot, also ramping up development in-house, working on a tool to generate code for testing applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's something that they're still doing in-house. But it would coincide nicely with the new version of their flagship programming software Xcode, which is supposed to be coming out this year. Perhaps we will see it at the Developers Conference in June. Obviously, time ticking, June not that far away. But I think this might be that moment that people have been waiting for it to really see Apple step up in this space.\n\nMADISON MILLS: Right. It feels like Apple let's the other guys play in the playground for a little bit. And then they come out and say, well, now, we've got the thing that everyone's going to want. They tend to do that. And it works out for them. So to your point, we'll see in June if it does.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: That's true. We had mobile phones before the iPhone, and now, look.\n\nMADISON MILLS: Right. Exactly. Exactly. Look at that.",

        "content": "In the ever-changing world of technology, predicting the next Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has become an enthralling pursuit for investors and tech enthusiasts. This quest extends beyond the hunt for a firm with ground-breaking goods or a high market capitalization. It is about finding a visionary force poised to alter the technology industry. As we explore the enormous ocean of tech stocks, the excitement grows, with each challenger bringing its own unique combination of innovation and promise to the fore.\n\nThe attractiveness of technology equities stems from their portrayal of the cutting edge, the driving force behind our fast-changing environment.

TSLA stock\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) path is similar to the early days of the company that is now thought to be the next Apple. The company’s latest price changes show that it is in a great position in the market. This approach is similar to Apple’s ability to balance high value with what customers want. Also, Tesla’s creative events not only keep its community interested, but they also show off its huge network of Superchargers. It’s a smart way to show off tech skills, similar to how Apple’s environment works together so smoothly.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Tesla’s building projects in Mexico and smart agreements for materials show that the company is dedicated to both growth and ecology. These moves are in line with Apple’s goals of going global and using responsible suppliers. Putting Tesla on Morningstar’s “pick list” makes it even more appealing to investors, similar to how Apple rose in the eyes of investors.\n\nAdditionally, Tesla is still very focused on new ideas. Recent improvements in car technology and safety have set new standards for the industry. The release of a new Model 3 with cutting-edge features shows that Tesla is always trying to be the best. Tesla, like Apple, doesn’t just make goods; it shapes the direction of its business as well.\n\nShopify (SHOP) An image of a laptop showing clothes on the screen with the mouse hovering over a 'buy' button; surrounded by credit card, piggy bank, shopping bag, coffee.

Its stock value has recently gone up, which shows that investors are becoming more confident. Improvements to business tools show that Shopify is always trying to be the best. In addition, technical changes will make the software run better.\n\nIn terms of being environmentally friendly, Shopify’s promise to get rid of carbon emissions stands out. This project shows that it is committed to caring for the earth. Additionally, results from a Shopify poll put light on how customers act, providing businesses with useful information.\n\nFocusing on business-to-business (B2B) sales for 2024 is a big change for Shopify. This move shows that there may be ways to grow. Record sales between Black Friday and Cyber Monday also show how useful the platform is.\n\nShopify’s finances have been in good shape. Its sales went up 25% and its gross profit went up 36% in the third quarter. This result shows that Shopify is both operationally and financially stable.\n\nIn short, Shopify is making moves to become the leader in online shopping. It’s like software giants like Apple in that it cares about new ideas, the environment, and its own bottom line. This is a good sign for Shopify’s future.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Businessperson Shaking Hand With Digital Partner Over Futuristic Background, MnM stocks replacing the Magnificent 7.\n\nSource: Andrey_Popov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) stands out in a world full of new ideas, just like Apple did in its early days. It just finished its biggest Data, Apps, and AI event, where it showed off ground-breaking creative AI advances. These improvements make it possible for businesses to make apps on a scale never seen before. Also, Snowflake’s move into Snowpark Container Services is a major step forward.\n\nThe company demonstrates its commitment to cutting-edge technology by allowing developers to launch and handle creative AI and full-stack apps safely.\n\nAlso, Snowflake’s creation of a unique Large Language Model, which came about when it bought Applica, is a big deal. It makes it easier to get ideas from unorganized data, so you don’t need to know a lot about machine learning. Snowflake’s goal of making technology easy to use and life-changing fits with Apple’s philosophy of making technology available to everyone. Basically, Snowflake isn’t just getting better; it’s changing the way businesses use data, which makes it the next big thing in the tech world.\n\nOn the publication date, Faizan Farooque did not hold (directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Nvidia disclosed investments made in several emerging AI companies. (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia stock reversed falls seen on Thursday trade in premarket on Friday after it disclosed investments made in several emerging AI companies.

        "title": "Apple up against stiff competition in China as rivals race ahead with generative AI and foldable designs",
        "content": "The prospects for Apple, which led China's smartphone market at the end of 2023, remain cloudy amid the slow integration of artificial intelligence (AI) features within its iPhone and the current popularity of foldable phones in the country, say analysts.\n\nWith Chinese rivals gearing up to launch more high-end phones, Apple is developing prototypes for a clamshell, foldable iPhone, according to a report earlier this month by tech media outlet The Information citing an anonymous source.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the issue.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based firm did release an open source AI model called MLLM-Guided Image Editing (MGIE) earlier this month, which helps to edit photos based on text inputs by a user, according to a research paper on Github.\n\nAlthough more generative AI technologies are expected later this year with the release of iOS 18, the slower relative pace of Apple in generative AI innovation has raised concerns as rivals rush ahead with self-developed large language models (LLMs) and high-end foldable handsets.\n\n\"Apple will always ensure a favourable experience for its users even if it is not the first to bring new technology to its products,\" said Will Wong, senior research manager for client devices at IDC Asia-Pacific. \"But the impact of being late [with AI] will [affect] its image as a tech leader, especially since the [China] market needs more wow factors now.\"\n\nWong does not expect iPhone shipment growth to return to positive territory in China in 2024.\n\nThe stakes are high for Apple, which topped mainland China's smartphone market in the fourth quarter last year, according to IDC data. After a long period of stagnation, the Chinese market is also widely expected to return to growth in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite leading the market, Apple reported a nearly 13 per cent drop in revenue from Greater China in the December quarter, with sales rising in other regions.\n\nApple's weekly smartphone shipments in China have declined by 30 to 40 per cent in recent weeks, according to a recent blog post by Kuo Ming-chi, a TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate assessment of Apple's business. Kuo expected this downward trend to continue this year.\n\n\"The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market,\" Kuo wrote in the post.\n\nChina's smartphone market started off 2024 with Huawei Technologies returning to the No 1 spot for the first two weeks, according to Counterpoint data.\n\nHuawei fell from glory after the Shenzhen-based company was added to a US trade blacklist in May 2019, which crippled the firm's once-lucrative handset business. However, the surprise release last August of its Mate 60 Pro 5G smartphone - powered by a home-grown Kirin 9000S processor - has captured the imagination of Chinese consumers.\n\nSeparately, IDC data showed that Huawei returned to the top 5 on the mainland in the fourth quarter of last year with a 36.2 per cent jump in shipment volume.\n\n\"We expect Huawei to maintain its momentum and pose a challenge to Apple,\" said Wong. \"This will be mainly supported by Huawei's strong local brand name and potential to bring more innovative technology, such as foldable-related products, to consumers.\"\n\nIn the global premium smartphone market, where handsets are priced from US$600, Apple remained the \"undisputed leader\" last year with a dominant 71 per cent share, according to a Counterpoint report last month.\n\nStill, Apple's share of the segment fell from 75 per cent in 2022 amid the resurgence of Huawei on the mainland and gains by Samsung Electronics, according to the report.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the top 20 most valuable blockchain companies in 2024. If you want to skip our overview of the global blockchain industry, its current status, and the latest news, then you can take a look at the Top 5 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024.\n\nWith the first quarter of the 21st century about to be over, the Internet of today is vastly different from the one that had taken shape at the tail end of the dotcom era of the late 1990s and the early 2000s. Now, the Internet proliferates every aspect of life, whether it's transportation, work, entertainment, leisure, or even buying groceries. Additionally, two and a half decades after the start of the new century, a handful of players since the dotcom era have survived and now reign supreme in the stock market.\n\nThese bigwigs include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). However, 2024 is turning out to be a year that appears to be challenging the dominance of big technology as the market value of the semiconductor designer NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) has started to rival that of the world's biggest electronic commerce company Amazon and Alphabet, whose search engine reigns supreme in nearly every country in the world.\n\nThe significant transformation that the Internet has undergone over the course of the past decades also means that now, there are new technologies and industries that were un-thought of when Jeff Bezos first started delivering books. One such technology is blockchain, a secure ledger that gained popularity along with Bitcoin, the world's premier cryptocurrency. The emergence of blockchain technologies, companies, and stocks comes as technology permeates not only our daily lives but also the business operations of giants belonging to crucial industries such as financial services and logistics.\n\nA blockchain, for those out of the loop, is a collection of computers that store information. And since running a business requires storing copious amounts of information, it offers companies and management a secure ledge that is stored on multiple computers at the same time to ensure that even if one node of the network goes out of operation, the record integrity remains unaffected.\n\nStory continues\n\nNaturally, this utility that the blockchain industry has slowly grown to be worth quite a bit. For instance, as part of our coverage of 11 Most Promising Blockchain Stocks According to Analysts, we discovered several blockchain stocks that had impressive share price upside. The top three stocks in this list, which ranked the companies by the percentage upside of their average analyst share price targets as of mid December 2023, were Canaan Inc. (NASDAQ:CAN), Applied Digital Corporation (NASDAQ:APLD), and Cipher Mining Inc. (NASDAQ:CIFR). The share price upside percentage for these blockchain stocks all stood in either double or triple digits, indicating that when it comes to selecting blockchain stocks for investment purposes, at least analysts believe that they offer at least some potential.\n\nDelving deeper into the business operations of these top blockchain stocks, it appears that at least when it comes to the top of the food chain for investment recommendations, either companies that sell hardware for blockchain use or those that engage in Bitcoin mining reign supreme. Bitcoin and blockchains are closely tied to each other, since at its simplest level, a Bitcoin is simply a reward token to a miner given for computing resources spent powering up a blockchain network.\n\nThe next step in our analysis of the blockchain industry and the biggest blockchain companies is to see whether this trend also holds for the most valuable blockchain companies in the world in terms of market capitalization. Some of the most valuable companies, when it comes to either operating blockchains or offering software based products that use the technology are International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nThis is unsurprising since all these companies are leaders in the cloud computing space, and each of them offers blockchain based services as well. So while Microsoft is one of the biggest proponents of Web3, a 'new' internet that seeks to run on the blockchain, Alphabet's Google Cloud has been storing Bitcoin mining data for years and the firm itself has invested billions of dollars in the blockchain industry. Similarly, IBM is one of the biggest players in the blockchain industry since it offers companies the ability to build blockchain systems across a myriad of industries such as supply chain management and food product sourcing.\n\nAs a whole, now that Bitcoin has touched the coveted $1 trillion mark, the next Bitcoin halving is due soon to allow even more miners to profit in the industry, retail players are able to access Bitcoin through exchange traded funds, new areas such as decentralized finance (DeFi) capture the public attention, and GPU supply chain stabilizes in the wake of increased A.I. demand, the blockchain industry might be in for some favorable tailwinds in the coming months.\n\nSo, with these details in mind, let's take a look at the biggest blockchain companies in the world. Some notable names are International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IBM), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), and PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL). Top 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\nA cryptocurrency wallet on a modern touchscreen device displaying a graph of the company's assets.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the biggest blockchain companies in the world, we first made a list of the firms that either mine Bitcoin, offer data center space to Bitcoin or associated companies, or offer blockchain related services. Then, the firms were analyzed to see whether blockchain or blockchain related products and services represent their key business operations or if the industry would find it difficult to function if their products went off the market. This meant that while Microsoft and Amazon do offer these products, they were excluded since their core business operations focus on other industries; but, it also meant that a GPU firm made the cut. Finally, the remaining companies were ranked by their market capitalization and the biggest blockchain companies were as follows.\n\nTop 20 Most Valuable Blockchain Companies in 2024\n\n2o. Bit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT)\n\nLatest Market Capitalization: $326 million\n\nBit Digital, Inc. (NASDAQ:BTBT) is a Bitcoin mining company headquartered in New York City.

        "title": "Disney Stock (NYSE:DIS): The Ultimate Back Door Into the Metaverse",
        "content": "Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock has been gaining a bit of ground lately following its stellar quarterly earnings report. It wasn’t just the better-than-expected numbers but recent moves, including taking a $1.5 billion stake in Fortnite-maker Epic Games, that have me viewing Disney as a potential back door into the realm of the Metaverse.\n\nAs Disney’s top boss and CEO, Bob Iger, looks to bring the firm back to the top again, it’s hard not to be a raging bull on the stock. Combined with more activism from activist investor Nelson Peltz (he’s still pursuing board seats), looking to pressure for positive change, I couldn’t be more bullish on the stock as it looks to pivot.\n\nWith the stake in Epic Games, the recent sports streaming partnership with rival streamers, and news of Taylor Swift’s Eras tour coming to the Disney+ streaming platform, there hasn’t been this much to be excited about with regards to Disney in quite a while.\n\nFrom Eras to Sports Streaming, Disney May Have Its Eyes on the Metaverse\n\nIn many ways, Taylor Swift’s Eras could be the biggest non-Disney production to land on the platform since the firm brought Broadway hit sensation Hamilton just a few years ago. Though Eras could give consumers another reason to resume their Disney+ subscriptions, I view the biggest takeaway from the latest quarter (and commentary) as Disney’s ambition when it comes to the virtual realm.\n\nFurther, the streaming of concert tours represents a stark contrast to the content offered by other video streamers. Though concerts, plays, and recorded live experiences are fun to view through your television, I believe that they are best enjoyed in the realm of virtual reality.\n\nDisney’s openness to exploring the realm of virtual reality and spatial computing is nothing new. Remember when Bob Iger was on stage during the reveal of the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro? Iger saw the potential in Apple’s latest product, and his firm’s recent bets look like they’d translate into the realm of immersive worlds very nicely.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisney+ has been hot on Vision Pro’s tracks since day one, even as some of its peers, most notably Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) opted not to develop a native visionOS app in these early stages for Apple’s newest product. Personally, I think Netflix has a lot to lose if it doesn’t end up creating a slew of content for the new spatial medium, as Disney has. Of course, Netflix has deep enough pockets to play catch up at a later date, perhaps when headsets become more commonplace in the household.\n\nFor now, though, Disney has its sights set on the future. And for that reason, I prefer Disney over the likes of Netflix. In many ways, Disney seems to be on the right track, bringing must-see “experiences” like Eras to its platform. Imagine experiencing the content on a 100-foot screen on your Vision Pro headset. Such an experience will make like you’re almost a part of the action.\n\nDisney’s Comeback Could Be Fueled by Spatial Computing, Vision Pro\n\nIn the future, I’d look for Disney to invest more in spatial cameras for various productions — like those on the iPhone 15 Pro line — that can deliver “spatial” experiences that take the immersive factor to the next level. In its current state, the Vision Pro seems like a risky innovation to shrug off through the eyes of a prospective content creator. However, in a few years, it could become a must-have device as more content from Disney and others lands gradually.\n\nOver time, it’s certainly not hard to envision a flood of high-quality “spatial” content storming over to the Vision Pro, perhaps thanks in part to forward-thinking content creators like Disney. Apart from concerts, video games, and other experiences, Disney’s sports streaming push may be just the first step to achieving the holy grail of virtual court-side seats via spatial computers and VR headsets.\n\nIndeed, ESPN has been a drag on Disney’s business for quite some time. But in the realm of spatial computing and streaming, the ESPN acquisition may finally prove its worth. Even if spatial computing takes a couple more years to take off (the form factor remains a tad too bulky), I have to say I’m impressed with where Disney is headed. It looks to be strolling right into the Metaverse. And if virtual-reality headsets end up a success, I’d argue that Disney could have what it takes to fight back at Netflix at long last.\n\nIs DIS Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, DIS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 21 analyst ratings, there are 16 Buys, four Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average DIS stock price target is $115.50, implying upside potential of 2.7%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $82.00 per share to a high of $130.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line on DIS Stock\n\nIn many ways, Disney seems to be the ultimate metaverse content play, as it looks to become one of the bigger developers for so-called “killer” apps on the next generation of spatial computing products.\n\nFrom sports streaming to metaverse-like video games (think Epic’s Fortnite) and recorded concert experiences, Disney seems to be rolling the dice on the Metaverse. And it certainly could win in a big way as the field evolves. Indeed, Disney and Apple seem to be forming a symbiotic relationship as both look to unlock the full power of the immersive virtual worlds of tomorrow.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "Can you actually make money with environmental, social and governance (ESG) plays or so-called ethical stocks? Legacy interpretations imply that ethics and profits go together like water and oil. After all, motor racing leagues penalize corner-cutting antics; otherwise, everybody would attempt to secure an advantage.\n\nHowever, it may be a fallacy to assume that business ethics represent a barrier to profitability. To be fair, a short-term benefit may materialize from shirking morally upright practices. But in the long run, ESG stocks should outperform their less morally equipped counterparts. For one thing, it’s difficult to sustain customer loyalty if you’re constantly running afoul of basic principles.\n\nOn another level, it’s important for publicly traded enterprise especially to attract new investors. People are much more leery about investing in teams they don’t feel comfortable with. If a corporation earns a reputation for purely bottom-line thinking, prospective shareholders may think: could I be mistreated next? That’s why ethical stocks involve way more than just virtue signaling.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFinally, as a diverse cohort, Generation Z largely embraces ESG. Therefore, the below ESG stocks really just align with burgeoning realities.\n\nWaste Management (WM) person depositing a plastic water bottle in a yellow plastic recycling bin. The bin is in a line-up of several other blue and green bins.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/PhotoByToR\n\nSpecializing in its namesake practice, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) isn’t just a landfill operator. Instead, it’s one of the leaders in environmental sustainability with a focus toward waste reduction and renewable energy initiatives. For one thing, the company owns a vast network of recycling facilities. Further, under its Recycle Right program, Waste Management provides educational materials in helping individuals accelerate the process effectively.\n\nSecond, the company forwards a waste-gas-to-energy project. Per its website, the natural decomposition of organic waste in landfills produces gas. By using a network of wells to collect this gas, Waste Management converts it into renewable energy. By substituting this unique energy source for fossil fuels, this process reduces greenhouse gases, thus benefiting the community and the environment.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot surprisingly given the company’s permanent relevance, WM rates strongly for margins and consistent profitability. In addition, analysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a high-side target hitting $230. Therefore, it’s one of the top ethical stocks to consider.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother entry for “E” under ESG stocks, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) presents a logical case for the conscientious investor. Per its website, NextEra is one of the nation’s largest capital investors in renewable infrastructure. Commanding a presence in 49 states, the company is working toward securing America’s independence. Through its vast network of facilities – including solar and wind turbines – NEE features about 72 gigawatts (GW) of operating capacity.\n\nThrough its investments, more of the country’s energy infrastructure stems from clean and renewable sources. Further, NEE makes a strong case for ethical stocks that are also profitable thanks to the burgeoning core industry. Per Straits Research, the global renewable energy market size reached a valuation of $1.09 trillion last year. By 2032, this figure could expand to $2.45 trillion.\n\nTo be fair, rough economic conditions hurt NEE bad in the final months of 2023. However, analysts anticipate a recovery, pegging shares a moderate buy with a $69.60 average price target. Thus, it’s one of the ethical stocks to target.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving onto the “S” component of ESG stocks, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) offers an intriguing opportunity. I don’t think it’s an anecdote to say that most Americans love the open-warehouse-style big-box retailer. For a nominal fee, you can get 800-pound jars of mayonnaise and a lifetime supply of pasta. Well, not really but you get the idea. But where it really shines is how well Costco treats its employees.\n\nAs the company states on its website, the success of the business depends on the well-being of its employees. Of course, I think every company says something like that about themselves. The difference with Costco is that countless independent assessments back up the claim. In 2022, data from Glassdoor noted that the retailer’s employees rated the business a four out of five regarding worker satisfaction, well ahead of direct competitors.\n\nAnd while it’s not a blistering market performer, it’s a consistent winner. To no one’s shock, analysts rate COST stock a strong buy with a high-side target of $825. It’s easily one of the top ethical stocks.\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) Learnin' From Luckin, Starbucks Stock Heats Up a Strategy\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nA brand that needs no introduction, Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) helps fuel America – in a sense, quite literally. To get through the drudgery of the workday, millions of worker bees turn to caffeinated beverages. And with Starbucks located everywhere, it’s just too tempting to turn in for a quick (though expensive) pick-me-up.\n\nFundamentally, Starbucks also appeals to modern investors by emphasizing the “S” component of ESG stocks. In particular, the company proudly boasts of its ethical sourcing of its key ingredients, from coffee beans to tealeaves to cocoa. In addition, its manufactured goods – from the merchandise on its shelves to the furniture in its stores – involve ethical sourcing. Basically, the company talks the talk and walks the walk.\n\nAlso, I’d be remiss not to mention Starbucks’ youth empowerment, hunger relief, and inclusivity programs. The brand has been at the forefront of positive changes in society, making SBUX one of the top ethical stocks. And analysts love it, pegging shares a consensus strong buy.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational payment card services firm, Visa (NYSE:V) also needs no introduction. That’s mainly because there’s a good chance the card is in your wallet. According to a Forbes article in 2023, Visa represents the most carried card, printing a market share of 52.8%. So, it’s winning in the payment services department. It’s also waving the checkered flag in terms of ethical stocks.\n\nLots of folks love talking about the “E” and the “S” in ESG stocks. However, governance is also a major component of holistic ethics. Here, Visa’s corporate governance practices help promote long-term value and accountability to its shareholders. Part of this involves ensuring diversity and inclusion and not just in the workforce itself but in the upper echelons of leadership.\n\nIn this case, market forces help keep Visa honest. As a major blue chip, the company would get called out very quickly if it was ESG in name only. Lastly, analysts rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $303.74 average price target.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA multinational technology company, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) designs, develops and sells consumer electronics, computer software and online services. Like some of the other ethical stocks on this list, Apple products – along with its connected ecosystem – have become ubiquitous. As a result, the tech firm leverages tremendous influence. Better yet, it’s wielding its power responsibly.\n\nMaintaining high standards of governance, Apple focuses on a range of important issues. In June 2020, the company launched its Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, advancing opportunities for many people of color and Indigenous communities. To be fair, the company needs work regarding ensuring more opportunities become available for leadership roles. Increased scrutiny and public pressure may help in this regard.\n\nAlso, Apple implements a shareholder voting process focused on executive compensation. That’s one distinct mechanism to keep the company accountable to stakeholders. Overall, analysts peg shares a moderate buy with a $208.07 average price target. Notably, the high-side target hits $250, implying robust bullishness despite a soft start to 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt wasn’t that long ago that Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) seemed a rudderless enterprise, just skating by on its legacy software suite. Those days are long gone. Thanks to the tech giant’s big investments in artificial intelligence, it has steadily rocketed higher since the 2022 doldrums. Further, as AI becomes more ingrained into everyday life, Microsoft stands to be a massive winner.\n\nAnd when it comes to ethical stocks, the company may be the all-around champion. It’s really difficult to pin down MSFT stock as it belongs exclusively to one of the ESG components. For example, management set out ambitious environmental targets, most conspicuously being its aim to be carbon negative; that is, it will remove its historical emissions since its founding in 1975.\n\nIn addition, it’s a huge player in social equity, promoting directives focused on encouraging women to participate in technology. Finally, MSCI Ratings awarded Microsoft an AAA rating, the highest rating available to organizations. Unsurprisingly, analysts love MSFT, rating it a consensus strong buy with a $469.45 price target. It’s practically a no-brainer example of ESG stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc., racing to add more artificial intelligence capabilities, is nearing the completion of a critical new software tool for app developers that would step up competition with Microsoft Corp.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJapan Loses Its Spot as World's Third-Largest Economy as It Slips Into Recession Putin Steps Into US Race to Back ‘Old-Style’ Biden Over Trump Dozens of Banks Rapidly Piled Up Commercial Property Loans Hawaii Rightly Rejects Supreme Court’s Gun Nonsense Wall Street Looks Past Inflation Angst Before PPI: Markets Wrap\n\nThe company has been working on the tool for the last year as part of the next major version of Xcode, Apple’s flagship programming software. It has now expanded testing of the features internally and has ramped up development ahead of a plan to release it to third-party software makers as early as this year, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nThe new system will operate similarly to Microsoft’s GitHub Copilot and use artificial intelligence to predict and complete blocks of code, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans are private. That simplifies the programming process for software development, potentially saving time and money.\n\nApple is also exploring the use of AI to generate code for testing applications, an often tedious process. Currently, Apple is pushing some engineers to try these new AI features internally as part of a “dogfooding” effort — when a company uses its own products — to make sure they work properly before releasing them to outside developers.\n\nThe moves are part of a broader push into generative AI and large language models, the technology behind popular chatbots like ChatGPT. Apple is playing catch-up with tech peers in this burgeoning market, but has promised to discuss its plans for AI later this year. That announcement could come as soon as June, when the company holds its annual developers conference.\n\nApple shares, which had been down as much 1.5%, briefly turned positive on the news. They were little changed at the close Thursday, trading at $183.86. Microsoft fell less than 1% to $406.56.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on the plans.\n\nIt’s been an urgent undertaking. Craig Federighi, Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, has told his teams to develop as many new AI features as possible for this year’s operating system updates.\n\nHe’s also tasked his lieutenants with drumming up features that use the technology and has made top deputy Sebastien Marineau-Mes a point person for the effort. Apple executives demonstrated the AI functions to the board late last year, with Marineau-Mes conducting much of the presentation, the people said. The Xcode work is being overseen by another Federighi lieutenant, longtime software engineering vice president Andreas Wendker.\n\nRead More: Inside Apple’s Big Plan to Bring Generative AI to All Its Devices\n\nApple’s next iPhone and iPad software updates — iOS and iPadOS 18 — will include a slew of new AI features, according to the people. The company is planning to tout the software, codenamed Crystal, as one of the most significant updates in the 16-year history of the iPhone.\n\nIt’s also planning to bring some AI features to the next version of macOS, codenamed Glow. Still, Apple aims to take a gradual approach to AI development, with some enhancements not coming for years.\n\nThe company has explored other new AI features, including ones that would automate the creation of Apple Music playlists and make slideshows in its PowerPoint rival Keynote. Another feature under consideration is a revamped version of Spotlight, Apple’s systemwide search feature.\n\nThe new version would be able to toggle between specific features within apps and answer complex questions based on data trained from large language models. LLMs, the technology that powers AI tools, is developed by bombarding software with a torrent of data.\n\nEarly designs of the Spotlight overhaul include using LLMs to answer more complex questions and the ability to tap deeper into apps to launch specific functions. The current version of Spotlight is mostly limited to launching apps, making basic web searches and pulling up information like the weather and sports scores.\n\nRead More: Apple Tests ‘Apple GPT,’ Develops Generative AI Tools to Catch OpenAI\n\nTim Cook, Apple’s chief executive officer, said during his latest quarterly conference call that engineers “continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort” on the initiative.\n\nThe competition is mounting. In January, Samsung Electronics Co. launched a new Galaxy S24 smartphone line that weaves in Google AI features — offering a preview of sorts to what Apple is expected to do with the iPhone 16 later this year.\n\nThe company has also continued to hone its own LLMs to enhance Siri and services like AppleCare support. The company is looking to improve Siri’s ability to answer complex questions accurately, and the customer service teams are trying to speed up chat and phone support. Apple is also heavily invested in integrating AI into its health features.\n\n(Updates with share trading in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

        "content": "Investors should keep their ears to the ground for alluring chip stocks.\n\nPositive indicators point to growth in the semiconductor industry in 2024. Initial CHIPS Act funding released in late 2023 stands ready to stimulate the industry, and there’s always the growth potential AI brings to the table that’s worth considering. In particular, investors continue to hone in on the ability for companies to monetize their generative AI capabilities, something that could lead to surging chip demand for some time to come.\n\nOf course, not all chip stocks are created equal. And there are plenty of seasonal hurdles and inventory issues for companies to work through.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHowever, these semiconductor stocks are among the best picks in this sector right now. Let’s delve into the three companies that top the list of highest-potential chip stocks to buy right now.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains the leading chip company globally in terms of market capitalization. Recently, it surpassed Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) to become the world’s fourth-most valuable company. That’s no small feat.\n\nIn fact, a number of key catalysts drove Nvidia’s rise. Obviously, AI-related chip demand is top of mind for most investors. And, the company is planning a new business segment focusing on customized AI chips for cloud computing and AI to remain unbeatable. With an 80% market share in high-end AI chips, NVDA continues to rocket higher. Further, it appears to have plenty of rocket fuel remaining.\n\nThe company’s H100 and A100 chips provide versatile and high-performance AI processing power for clients. Notably, Nvidia has provided custom chip development for companies seeking tailored solutions. If the company’s clientele continues to demand more personalization, it could drive greater growth than expected.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is another key winner in the AI-related surge in the chip sector. The company’s 2024 revenue estimate has already improved, surging to around $3.5 billion from only $2 billion previously.\n\nWhile this is a small piece of the pie relative to Nvidia and other high-performance chip makers, it signals accelerated growth potential. Additionally, it exhibits strong early-stage market share in the AI realm.\n\nAlso, the company cited its enhanced AI positioning and anticipated share gains in the AI GPU market. Analyst Gus Richard predicts accelerated share gains in the AI GPU market, based on the company’s pricing and growth strategy long-term. This may be central to AMD’s recent rise.\n\nFurthermore, the company’s numbers have impressed, with AMD reporting an 11% increase in sales, surpassing estimates by $60 million. It set an ambitious target of $3.5 billion in data center revenue, a 75% jump from its initial $2 billion forecast. Data center revenue towered by 37% year over year (YOY) in the latest quarter, a quarterly increase of 43%.\n\nStrong CPU and data center GPU revenues contributed to this development. Also, AMD’s AI-focused MI300X GPU was introduced, which offers better speed, efficiency, and affordability.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading semiconductor maker Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) has a market cap of $472 billion and an average stock price of $120, as stated by Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe company serves as the primary supplier of microchips to giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). And, the $570 billion semiconductor market is expected to grow 12.2% CAGR through 2029. All indications point to Taiwan Semiconductor playing a major role in this space.\n\nTSM is a leading tech investment due to its steady annual earnings growth of more than 20%, which could go even higher given AI-driven demand. Despite a relatively low price-earnings ratio of around 23x, the company continued yo grow due to AI expansion.\n\nAs the world’s largest foundry, TSM serves major players like Nvidia and AMD, and its strategic location in a geopolitically significant country further bolsters its investment appeal.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nChatGPT IPO Could Shock the World, Make This Move Before the Announcement Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Meta Touts New Way for Small Advertisers to Avoid Apple Fees",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. released new guidelines for small businesses that advertise on Facebook and Instagram, aiming to help them get around fees imposed by Apple Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJapan Loses Its Spot as World's Third-Largest Economy as It Slips Into Recession Putin Steps Into US Race to Back ‘Old-Style’ Biden Over Trump Trump Eyes NATO Makeover, Hurried Peace in Ukraine If Elected Israel Quits Ceasefire Talks Over ‘Delusional’ Hamas Demands Dozens of Banks Rapidly Piled Up Commercial Property Loans\n\nMeta is advising the companies to buy ads through a web browser, rather than on Facebook or Instagram iOS apps, according to guidance released Thursday. That will help them avoid an Apple commission that Meta said would take effect this month.\n\nApple’s new policy requires advertisers to use its In-App Purchase feature whenever they pay to “boost” social media posts — a move that gives the content more exposure. Apple takes a cut of as much as 30% on app purchases in its iOS software, meaning that Meta will lose a portion of its ad revenue to the iPhone maker.\n\nThe policy change, first announced by Apple in 2022, ratcheted up tension between the tech giants, which have become two of Silicon Valley’s biggest adversaries in recent years. At the time, Meta accused the company of “undercutting others in the digital economy.” Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg has also frequently criticized Apple for wielding too much control over its App Store.\n\nApple said Thursday that treating boosts as an In-App Purchase is consistent with its longstanding approach to the App Store. The company said it spent more than a year discussing the boosting policy with Meta, giving them ample time to comply.\n\n“We have always required that purchases of digital goods and services within apps must use In-App Purchase,” Apple said in a statement. “Boosting, which allows an individual or organization to pay to increase the reach of a post or profile, is a digital service — so of course In-App Purchase is required. This has always been the case and there are many examples of apps that do it successfully.”\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook has been a vocal detractor of the privacy practices at Meta, which relies on user data to sell ads. Previous Apple changes have hit Meta in the pocketbook. In 2021, an iOS tweak that limited third-party data collection led to an estimated $10 billion loss in ad revenue for Meta.\n\nThe iPhone maker has drawn broader criticism for its policies, with companies like Spotify Technology SA and Fortnite maker Epic Games Inc. saying App Store rules are unfair. The company recently overhauled its approach in Europe to comply with new regional legislation, though those changes have brought further outcry.\n\nApple’s new policy takes effect in the US first, before rolling out to other countries later this year. The change will also require advertisers to pay for ads upfront when buying them through an iOS app. The change will largely affect Meta’s smaller advertisers, some of whom use boosted posts as their only form of advertising, Meta said.\n\n(Updates with response from Apple in fifth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\n‘Playing God’: This Labor Activist’s Relentless Emails Force Companies to Change What’s Really Behind Tesla’s Slowdown The US Will Face Blowback in the Middle East, No Matter What It’s Not Love Generating Those Dating Reality Shows.

        "title": "Should You Dump Apple Following Buffett? ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "In the fourth quarter of 2023, Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B) made adjustments to its holdings, notably trimming its flagship position in Apple. Berkshire sold about 1% of its Apple AAPL shares during this period, reducing its stake in the iPhone maker to 5.9%, valued at approximately $167 billion as of Wednesday, according to Dow Jones Market Data, as quoted on Wall Street Journal.\n\nNotably, Apple shares added only 3.6% in the past six months, while Berkshire shares added 11.3%. Investors should note that in previous years, Apple’s position within the Berkshire portfolio grew significantly, marking a substantial portion of its more than $300 billion stock portfolio.\n\nAs Apple's stock soared in the past few years, climbing 367% since the end of 2018 compared to the S&P 500's doubling, investors and market observers have been curious about what Buffett’s action with Applecould be now — grabbing more shares or dumping to book profits?\n\nBuffett had previously spoken highly of Apple, lauding it as a superior business compared to others within Berkshire's portfolio. But the latest move of trimming Berkshire’s Apple holdings suggests a strategic adjustment in its investment approach, reflecting portfolio diversification or profit-taking due to Apple’s latest rough patch.\n\nWhat Do Indicators Say About Apple’s Value Status?\n\nGoing by valuation metrics, the P/E (ttm) of AAPL is 28.7 times versus the industry average of 28.6 times. The forward P/E of AAPL is 28.1 times versus the industry score of 25.0 times. Though these measures point to a higher valuation of Apple than the industry, a higher P/E is not always a sign of worry. It shows investors’ confidence in a particular stock among the bunch.\n\nInvestors should note that the return-on-equity of Apple is 156%, moderately higher than the industry average of 135.0%. Plus, return-on-assets is marginally higher than the industry measures. The estimated 3-5-year EPS growth of Apple is now 12.7% versus the industry measure of 10.4%.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors should note that the AAPL stock has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). It has a Growth Score of A at the time of writing. The above-said numbers explain that Apple is not significantly overvalued at the current level. This could be because Apple’s run in the past one year has been pretty muted compared to most other “Magnificent Seven” stocks.\n\nFor example, Apple has risen 19.9% over the past year versus Microsoft’s 50.9% gains and Nvidia’s 239.2% surge. This could be because of Apple’s lesser exposure to Artificial Intelligence (AI) — the talk of the town — as compared to the other tech biggies.\n\nApple’s Price Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 26 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $207.75. The forecasts range from a low of $158.00 to a high of $250.00. The average price target represents an increase of 12.27% from the last closing price of $185.04.\n\nBroker Ratings on Apple\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.80 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 28 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.\n\nOf the 28 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 16 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 57.14% and 10.71% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\n\nAre ETFs Better Bets?\n\nInvestors intending to follow Warren Buffett but still having faith in Apple’s potential rally may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other companies’ stellar results. Several Apple ETFs have Microsoft in their kitty.\n\nBelow, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.\n\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW – AAPL takes the second spot with 17.90% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). Microsoft takes the second spot with about 17% exposure.\n\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 23.08% weight. The fund, which has a Zacks Rank #1, also has Microsoft (with 22.72% weight) in its basket.\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – AAPL occupies the first location with 23.08% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1. Microsoft takes about 22.72% weight while Nvidia takes about 4.31% weight.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Some of Wall Street’s biggest investors made new bets on technology giants in the fourth quarter, loading up on stakes in Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Alibaba (BABA) and Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK), however, did not. The conglomerate trimmed its holdings in Apple (AAPL) and HP (HPE) while adding to its stakes in oil giants Chevron (CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (OXY). There was at least one additional investment Berkshire kept confidential for now. Berkshire Hathaway Chairman Warren Buffett. REUTERS/Scott Morgan/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe details about these new bets made in the fourth quarter emerged this week in a series of filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Large institutional investors are required to make these disclosures on a quarterly basis, showing what they bought and sold.\n\nWhat the latest batch showed is that many piled into tech names at the end of 2023.\n\nA hedge fund run by Michael Burry — who famously shorted subprime mortgages during the 2008 financial crisis and became a central figure in Michael Lewis’s 2010 book \"The Big Short\" — added 35,000 shares of Alphabet and 30,000 shares of Amazon. That fund, Scion Capital, also boosted bets on Chinese e-commerce giants Alibaba and JD.com. Michael Burry of Scion Capital. (Photo by Jim Spellman/WireImage) (Jim Spellman via Getty Images)\n\nMany hedge funds also gravitated to the stock of Nvidia, the dominant artificial intelligence chipmaker.\n\nBridgewater Associates, the world’s biggest hedge fund firm, increased its stake in Nvidia by 458% as it added more than 220,000 shares.\n\nIt also increased its position in Alphabet by more than 465,000 shares, making it the fund’s 12th-largest position as of the end of December, and added a small stake in Apple.\n\nAnother hedge fund, AQR, increased its stake in Nvidia by 22%. But it trimmed its holdings in Apple and Microsoft, its two largest positions, by 5% and 4%. Apple CEO Tim Cook, right, talks with customers as Apple's Vision Pro headset is displayed at the Apple Fifth Avenue store in Manhattan. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nBerkshire sold just 1% of its holdings in Apple, or 10 million shares, leaving it with a huge stake of more than 950 million shares.\n\nApple has had a rough start to 2024 as it juggled downgrades to its stock price, major changes to its App Store policies, and a potential antitrust lawsuit that could target large swaths of its business. These challenges mounted as it launched the ambitious Vision Pro headset.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne other notable investor pared back its exposure to Apple in the fourth quarter: the Soros Fund.\n\nThe outfit started by billionaire investor George Soros and now run by his son closed out a short position and zeroed out of its underlying holdings in the tech giant.\n\nSome of these same investors made some notable bets on the banking industry, especially a regional lender that is currently under a lot of scrutiny: New York Community Bank (NYCB). A branch of the New York Community Bank in Yonkers, N.Y. REUTERS/Mike Segar/File Photo (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nThe Soros fund, AQR and Millennium Capital Management all increased their exposure to NYCB, which surprised Wall Street on Jan. 31 by slashing its dividend and reporting a net quarterly loss of $252 million.\n\nIt is not known what these funds did with their stakes between the end of the fourth quarter and now.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "Meet the Next Trillion-Dollar Companies: Our Top 7 Picks",
        "content": "Finding the next trillion-dollar companies isn’t easy, but it doesn’t have to be difficult. While tempting, avoid the urge to pick a handful of small-cap tech stocks or growth stocks that you think may be worth $1 trillion or more in the future. While tempting, and you may generate a substantial gain, finding the most viable next trillion-dollar companies should start with seeing which names are closest.\n\nCompanies worth more than a trillion dollars are household names – Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) at $2.85 trillion, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) at $3.01 trillion, you get the idea. But the companies further down the list, in the mid-$500 billion range, tend to be just as high-visibility. Unfortunately, though well-known, their potential as one of the next trillion-dollar companies tends to go overlooked.\n\nThese companies range between $536 billion and $856 billion – so, if any company can claim it’s on the path to becoming one of the next trillion-dollar companies, it’ll likely be one on this list.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) A close-up of a Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) office in Terra Haute, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), valued at $856 billion, is the closest to becoming a trillion-dollar company. Of course, having the trillion-dollar company Apple as a major component of the conglomerate’s stock holdings helps the cause, but Berkshire’s trillion-dollar potential doesn’t stop there. Warren Buffett, the value king and Oracle of Omaha, is well-known for this careful consideration and “fundamentals first” approach to investing alongside his late vice chairman, Charlie Munger.\n\nThat approach will likely become more popular as market volatility increases, further adding to Berkshire’s value. Investors nervous about tech concentration within the Magnificent 7 stocks are cycling into value stocks at a rapid rate, and Berkshire is an easy pick within the broader asset class. Investors can (safely) assume that Buffett and his team are executing high-level due diligence for each of the conglomerate’s direct investments and holdings, so owning Berkshire is a way to outsource value stock research effectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuying a piece of Berkshire today is opportune, too – experts expect bombshell news in this week’s earnings report that could bring it closer to trillion-dollar status.\n\nNext Trillion-Dollar Companies: Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is catching up to Berkshire in the race to be a trillion-dollar company, as the pharma stock is currently worth $705 billion. Recent developments in two key segments accelerated LLY’s journey, though, and there’s little sign the trends will slow.\n\nFirst, LLY’s weight loss drug Zepbound hit markets in November 2023 and rapidly exploded, generating $175.8 million in sales and on pace to become the best-selling drug ever. National market demand isn’t going anywhere, either, with one in three adults overweight and two in five classified as obese. Priced at $1,000 per month, Zepbound represents a source of recurring revenue with near-unlimited expansion potential to boost LLY’s bottom line.\n\nLLY’s second boom comes from a legacy drug, but one marking record sales of its own. Diabetes drug Mounjaro saw logistical chain shocks cut availability late last year, but increased pricing and steadied supply led to Mounjaro contributing as much as 25% to LLY’s top-line sales.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the sole international stock on our list of the next trillion-dollar companies, but that doesn’t make the $661 billion company any less competitive.\n\nThough not necessarily a household name like some of the other future trillion-dollar companies, TSMC is at the top of most analysts’ lists of innovative chipmakers. The company powers many of today’s electronics and remains a top U.S. supplier even as legislators try to push American semiconductor manufacturing forward, albeit slowly.\n\nTSMC also receives massive capital stakes from developed countries, like Japan, which committed a chunk of its $10 billion aid package to TSMC as part of a region-wide semiconductor development initiative. As long as AI trends hold steady, TSMC remains on track to hit a trillion-dollar valuation. The company’s financials, with little-to-no debt and a decent 40% net margin, are untouchable and support its bid to become a trillion-dollar company. TSM’s financial prudence has kept it stable throughout the past years’ turbulence, particularly if balanced against other emerging market stocks.\n\nNext Trillion-Dollar Companies: Tesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the only Magnificent 7 stock not worth $1 trillion, making it an easy bet to hit that valuation soon. Currently worth “just” $586 billion, most of Tesla’s market cap decline came from recent developments rather than long-term risks.\n\nTo be fair, Tesla’s market cap hit $1 trillion in 2021 and again in 2022, so Musk and his team are used to high valuations. The limiting factor preventing Tesla’s rise back to trillion-dollar status will, ultimately, be whether cost-cutting and lower margins hurt less than the new sales that lower prices generate.\n\nToday, Tesla is more than 50% below past highs as 2024 brings new waves of pressure onto its operational standing. Most notable, though, is a look at how analysts’ forward-looking estimates change over time. Specifically, projected earnings fell consistently after Musk bought Twitter and rebranded it to X. While other factors influence forecasts, Musk’s relative lack of attention to Tesla might be preventing the stock from reverting back to trillion-dollar status.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a direct supplier to the trillion-dollar company Apple, so it’s little surprise that the tech stock is positioned to join the club soon itself. Valued at $585 billion, AVGO stock more than doubled over the past year, and there’s little sign of slowing momentum. After closing a deal with VMware to expand its footprint, Broadcom is also diversifying and less reliant on companies like Apple (which currently contributes to about 20% of AVGO’s top-line sales). Note that, in the short-term, some transaction costs from the VMware merger might hurt – but that’s nothing compared to the long-term upside.\n\nArtificial intelligence is also driving AVGO higher, so as long as AI remains a tech staple, expect it to keep boosting AVGO’s bottom line. Last year, AI and related advances added $350 billion to Broadcom’s value. At the same time, UBS analysts are calling for continued AI enthusiasm regarding AVGO, with one expert raising his price target by more than $400 to $1,475 per share, which is nearly 20% higher than today’s pricing.\n\nNext Trillion-Dollar Companies: Visa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou may not expect a legacy firm like Visa (NYSE:V) to be among the next trillion-dollar companies, but Visa is unique in that it is still innovating in a mature market. Despite a range of startups and upstarts, Visa remains dominant in cashless payment processing, with about 20% of the global market under its control.\n\nBut that isn’t stopping Visa, as the future trillion-dollar company continues adapting to digital currencies and online transactions. Today, the company is targeting enterprise-level clients in a bid to make spending simple under corporate accounts. That’s particularly important as corporate credit makes up the largest percentage of overall revolving credit utilization and continues expanding. Consumer-focused payment processing makes our lives easier, but the real money is in B2B spending. That’s a fact Visa happily embraces and one that contributes to its race to trillion-dollar status.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe thesis supporting Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) becoming the next trillion-dollar company is similar to Eli Lilly’s, and, worth $536 billion, NVO isn’t too far behind. The world’s largest wealth fund agrees, saying recently that both Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly are on track to trillion-dollar status. And, like LLY, Novo Nordisk’s path is lined with weight loss drugs that are proving increasingly popular.\n\nThough supply issues put some pressure on NVO’s weight loss drug Wegovy, that doesn’t mean sales will slow financially. Instead, since Wegovy trends toward the discretionary side of therapeutic treatment, expect pricing to increase and meet reduced supply as demand climbs. Like LLY, that’ll boost NVO’s bottom-line numbers and prove profitable once logistics stabilize and prospective customers flood the manufacturer.\n\nWith as many as 15 million adults contributing to a $100 billion obesity treatment market by 2030, Novo Nordisk is well on its way to trillion-dollar status.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg’s Quest flex might end up backfiring on the Meta CEO",
        "content": "Hubris is said to come before the fall, and the swagger with which Mark Zuckerberg dunked on Apple’s $3,500 Vision Pro this week is giving critics an acute case of déjà vu.\n\nIn an Instagram post, the Meta founder on Tuesday dismissed the premium mixed reality headset as inferior to his own Quest 3 mixed reality headset both in price and performance, calling the latter the “better product, period”.\n\nBut Zuck's bravado is unflatteringly being compared to the overly hasty obituary for the iPhone written by rival Steve Ballmer when the revolutionary device first launched nearly 17 years ago.\n\n“There’s no chance that the iPhone is going to get any significant market share,” the ex-Microsoft CEO famously predicted in 2007 in a quote that has since aged very poorly.\n\nLike Zuckerberg, Ballmer primarily took issue with the price tag of the phone, ignoring the potential value it could offer consumers through a thriving digital app economy.\n\n“Five hundred dollars? Fully subsidized with a plan? I said that is the most expensive phone in the world!” Ballmer said in a separate interview. “And it doesn’t appeal to business customers, because it doesn’t have a keyboard—which makes it not a very good email machine.”\n\nThe \"Steve Ballmer iPhone video\" is 16 years old. Worth watching the full 2-minute clip. I actually think it got worse as the video went on. Ballmer implied a Motorola Q could do everything an iPhone can do for just $99. Sounds familiar?\r\npic.twitter.com/Rf2c7SmjA2\n\n— Neil Cybart (@neilcybart) February 14, 2024\n\nIn Zuckerberg's recent criticism of Apple's headset, the Meta founder similarly trashed everything from the Vision Pro's design to its comfort and practicality in addition to its cost, at seven times the price of his Quest 3.\n\n“Is Zuckerberg channeling Steve Ballmer by trying to diss Apple?” asked Glen Kacher, founder and chief investment officer at Palo Alto-based wealth manager Light Street Capital.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs the Quest closer to Nokia or Blackberry\n\nBallmer eventually went on to regret his lack of foresight, which he blamed on a deeply ingrained cultural hostility at the company towards expanding into the hardware space.\n\nLike watching a 2007 Nokia fan telling you iPhone is not that advanced because you can do the same with Symbian.\n\nHe could’ve just said nothing, taken the best things of visionOS, add eye tracking back and be a king. Now he’s got his own Ballmer iPhone video. Surprising misstep https://t.co/Z4Ac4sR0Pl\n\n— Tina Debove Nigro ᯅ (@tina__nigro) February 14, 2024\n\nAccording to the former Microsoft boss, senior management’s thinking at the time was very much anchored in the easily delineated business model that separated chips, system and software makers from personal computers. The company didn’t anticipate the shift towards end-to-end vertical integration that Apple popularized in the mobile space.\n\nThe comparison with Ballmer isn’t entirely accurate, though. While the Microsoft boss said his biggest mistake was limiting their focus to Windows Mobile rather than entering the handset business earlier with a true iPhone competitor, Zuckerberg’s problem is just the opposite: He already has the hardware—it's just not catching on.\n\nA closer analogy is the possibility that Meta’s Quest is the Nokia or Blackberry of mixed reality headsets, a mass market device that lacks enough compelling content and useful applications because it failed to keep pace with innovation in the tech industry.\n\nIt was only with this month’s arrival of the Apple Vision Pro that the technology suddenly gained broader pop culture prominence, in a blow to the Quest 3 that launched only four months earlier.\n\nZuckerberg did receive some moral support in response to his Ballmer-esque video, though.\n\n“He’s one of the most impressive CEOs there is,” wrote Kaushik Subramanian, a partner at early stage investor EQT Ventures, who once worked for the Meta founder. “Don’t bet against Zuck!”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

As of this writing, plenty of stocks outside of the “Magnificent Seven,” and outside of the tech sector, for that matter, have recently hit record highs.\n\nGiven that major indices, such as the S&P 500 and the Dow Jones Industrial Average, have hit new highs this month, this is not surprising. However, several stocks are continuing to hit new high watermarks, even as, in recent trading days, the broad market has pulled back, following the release of a hotter-than-expected inflation print.\n\nCompany-specific catalysts are helping these stocks reach new heights, even as another wave of macro uncertainty has potentially hit the stock market once again. The question now, however, is whether this strong performance can continue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo find out, let’s take a look at seven of these stocks hitting new highs, and see whether their latest moves are an invitation to buy, or a warning to sell.\n\nAbercrombie & Fitch (ANF) The front of an Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) location.\n\nSource: Paul McKinnon / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s an understatement to say that, over the past year, shares in apparel retailer Abercrombie & Fitch (NYSE:ANF) have been on fire. This stock has surged 276.3% during this time frame. In recent trading days, it has remarked on a sharply upward trajectory.\n\nImproved fiscal results have been the key factor driving ANF stock dramatically higher. While full year results aren’t expected until March 6, forecasts call for ANF’s earnings for fiscal year ending January 2024 to come in at $6.10 per share. For reference, ANF reported earnings of just 6 cents per share last fiscal year.\n\nStill, while Abercrombie & Fitch has been a profitable turnaround stock, it may be high time to cash out. As InvestorPlace’s Ian Bezek argued last month, it may not take much to cause operating performance to weaken again. This would likely cause a massive reversal for shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK.A,BRK.B) A Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A, BRK.B) sign sits out front of an office in Lafayette, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK.A,NYSE:BRK.B) is one of the stocks hitting new highs lately. Admittedly, it may not be 100% accurate to say that Berkshire, legendary investor Warren Buffett’s main investing vehicle, is a non-tech stock.\n\nAfter all, investing in BRK.B provides you indirect exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Berkshire owns a 5.8% stake in the iPhone maker, worth around $167.6 billion.\n\nThat represents nearly 20% of the holding company’s total market cap. As you likely know, Berkshire owns a smattering of companies across multiple sectors, as well as positions in numerous publicly-traded companies.\n\nSo, with BRK.B stock knocking it out of the park lately, is it time to buy? It depends. Though some (like this Seeking Alpha commentator) believe the stock can sustain its current premium to book value (around 65%), waiting for weakness may be a better move.\n\nDiamondback Energy (FANG) Diamondback Energy (FANG) logo on its website to represent oil stocks. FANG stock\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrude oil prices have only partially recovered recently, and natural gas prices have been trending sharply lower. However, that hasn’t stopped shares in oil & gas exploration and production company Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) from performing strongly lately.\n\nOf course, it’s been merger news, not energy prices, that have resulted in FANG stock climbing to a new all-time high this week.\n\nOn Feb. 12, Diamondback announced plans to acquire Endeavor Energy Resources, in a cash and stock deal. Including the value of Endeavor’s outstanding debt, this merger has a transaction value of around $26 billion.\n\nWall Street has reacted positively to this deal news. In large part, due to the perception that, by buying Endeavor, Diamondback is further strengthening its Permian Basin asset base.\n\nAs this deal could help FANG sustain high levels of profitability and its return of capital efforts (dividends and buybacks), more upside may lie ahead.\n\nInteractive Brokers Group (IBKR) close up of one hundred dollar bills\n\nSource: Ruslan Ivantsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased on recent trends, it’s not surprising that Interactive Brokers Group (NASDAQ:IBKR) have been performing particularly well lately.\n\nAs InvestorPlace’s Larry Ramer recently pointed out, the stock brokerage firm is benefitting from both high interest rates and the emergence of a new bull market.\n\nHigh interest rates are benefitting IBKR, as these have resulted in higher interest income on uninvested funds held in customer accounts. Increased stock market participation has resulted in Interactive Brokers’ monthly transaction volume. After becoming one stock hitting new highs, will IBKR stock keep climbing?\n\nCurrent trends may persist, as rates remain elevated, but investors still get back into “risk on” mode, in anticipation of lower rates down the road, creating further transaction volume growth. Last year, there was also talk of IBKR being an AI play. Further developments supporting an AI-related bull case for IBKR could also help shares keep trending higher.\n\nToyota Motor (TM) Toyota (TM) logo on the building of a dealership during daylight\n\nSource: josefkubes / Shutterstock.com\n\nEV stocks have been tumbling. Shares in U.S.-based incumbent automaker stocks have been moving higher, but shares in Japan-based global automotive giant Toyota Motor (NYSE:TM) have been performing especially well lately.\n\nHowever, don’t assume that the out-performance of TM stock will continue. As a Barron’s commentator recently argued, it’s possible that Toyota shares have performed well, simply because the company did not hype its EV pivot. U.S.-based automakers like Ford (NYSE:F) and General Motors (NYSE:GM) are suffering in the aftermath of the “EV bubble.”\n\nToyota’s earnings are expected to be flat during the upcoming fiscal year (ending March 2025). Unless further news about the company’s plug-in and battery electric vehicle production ramp-up efforts really excite the market, TM stock’s hot run (shares are up 60.6% over the past year) could soon end.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe phrase “trash is cash” has really held true lately, for Waste Management (NYSE:WM) a leader in the (what else) waste management industry. Shares are up 30.6% over the past year, and recently spiked after reporting strong quarterly results.\n\nWaste Management has become one stock hitting new highs. Several factors may explain why the market has become very bullish about WM stock.\n\nThese include the recession-resistant nature of its business, and the company’s continued steady earnings growth. However, as a result of this excitement, WM has become pricey.\n\nShares currently trade for 29 times forward earnings. That’s well above WM’s historic earnings multiple in the high-teens/low-20s.\n\nIf interest rates come down lower this year as expected, this valuation may be sustainable. If not, though, this stock could be at risk of experiencing a moderate de-rating to a lower valuation.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWeak outlook led to a post-earnings tanking for Walmart (NYSE:WMT) last November, but shares in the leading retailer just this week completed a recovery, hitting new all-time highs.\n\nThat said, what’s likely been driving this strong performance could be a warning sign to treat carefully.\n\nHow so? Next week, Walmart releases its earnings results for the quarter ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares have moved higher, to some extent, on the expectation that robust spending during the holiday season means an increased likelihood that the company will beat on earnings. However, if results (or updates to guidance) fail to wow the market, WMT stock could quickly give back its latest gains.\n\nThat’s not to say that Walmart will soon retreat back to the low $150s per share, but if you’ve been looking to enter a long-term position in the retailer, a much better entry point could soon emerge.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Niel, contributor for InvestorPlace.com, has been writing single-stock analysis for web-based publications since 2016.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Chinese technologystart-upRokid expects the release of Apple's Vision Pro mixed-reality (MR) headset to spur broader demand for more affordable and ergonomically designed wearable devices for augmented reality (AR) and virtual reality (VR) applications.\n\nThe Vision Pro, which Apple first rolled out in the United States earlier this month, will help the whole extended reality (XR) sector grow and generate greater consumer interest, while expanding the development of relevant software and content, according to Rokid founder and chief executive Misa Zhu Mingming.\n\n\"We're very happy that Apple got into the industry,\" Zhu told the South China Morning Post, referring to XR - also the catch-all term for AR, VR and MR technologies. \"This [initiative] will mobilise the whole developer ecosystem.\"\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nHe pointed out that there are already some developers who are making apps for both the Vision Pro and Rokid's AR glasses for consumers.\n\nRokid founder and chief executive Misa Zhu Mingming. Photo: SCMP alt=Rokid founder and chief executive Misa Zhu Mingming. Photo: SCMP>\n\nZhu's assessment of the XR industry after the Vision Pro's release shows how the stakes have increased for other companies to somehow match or even surpass the features and consumer appeal of Apple's first new product category since 2015.\n\nThe Rokid founder's analysis also echoes the remarks made last year by Denny Zhou Qinghui, founder and chairman of XR start-up Shanghai Graphic Design Information Co, who said the Vision Pro would unleash the potential of similar products and benefit smaller players in the industry.\n\nAfter another lacklustre year for AR and VR headset shipments in 2023, tech research firm IDC has forecast the market to rebound this year, growing 46.8 per cent year on year on the back of Apple's Vision Pro launch, new hardware from Meta Platforms and the growing presence of smaller companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market is expected to reach 30.3 million units globally by 2027, up from about 8.5 million last year, according to IDC.\n\nLaunched in 2023, Rokid's Max augmented reality glasses are compatible with video game consoles like Nintendo's Switch, Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Corp's Xbox Series X and Series S. Photo: Handout alt=Launched in 2023, Rokid's Max augmented reality glasses are compatible with video game consoles like Nintendo's Switch, Sony Interactive Entertainment's PlayStation 4, and Microsoft Corp's Xbox Series X and Series S. Photo: Handout>\n\nThe Vision Pro, which Apple markets as a \"spatial computer\", is an MR device that enables users to integrate digital media with the real world, while interacting with the system via motion gestures, eye tracking and speech recognition.\n\nAR devices, such as a number of high-end smartphones and Rokid's Max glasses, deliver an interactive experience by superimposing digital images in a real-world setting. By contrast, VR devices immerse users in a computer-generated virtual world.\n\nPrices for the Vision Pro, which weighs between 600 and 650 grams (21.2-22.9 ounces), start at US$3,499.\n\nBy comparison, Rokid's Max AR glasses, which weigh 75 grams, currently cost US$379 a pair, according to the company's website.\n\nA customer tries out Apple's Vision Pro headset at an Apple Store in Los Angeles, California, on the first day the mixed-reality headset went on sale on February 2, 2024.

Photo: Reuters>\n\n\"Rokid wants to popularise AR products,\" company chief Zhu said. \"We want to make products that people would not only like, but also have easy access to and could afford.\"\n\nWith the growing interest in XR gear, Zhu said Rokid aims to double unit sales of its AR devices to around 400,000 this year, from nearly 200,000 in 2023.\n\nIn January alone, Rokid saw sales surge for its Max glasses, the second-generation of its AR glasses for consumers, on the back of the attention brought by Apple to the XR industry, according to Zhu.\n\nHe said the company now has more than 2,200 developers making applications for its ecosystem. They have already launched more than 200 apps, from gaming to streaming and entertainment content, for Rokid's AR glasses.\n\nRokid last month said it raised 500 million yuan (US$70 million) from a group of investors led by the municipal government of Hefei, capital of eastern Anhui province.\n\nThe company - founded in 2014 in Hangzhou, capital of eastern Zhejiang province - also signed in the same month an investment and cooperation agreement with Hefei to set up its industrial metaverse headquarters, ecosystem hub and research and development centre in the city's New Station Hi-Tech Zone.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "The video streaming wars are still ongoing, even though much of the attention of investors has shifted toward another battle in the artificial intelligence (AI) universe. From a growth investors ‘ perspective, streaming stocks may no longer be the hottest place to bet on. Arguably, the streaming scene’s best days have gone bye-bye, with their pandemic lockdown tailwinds now comfortably behind us.\n\nWhile at-home entertainment isn’t as lucrative as during lockdown, it’s still an intriguing market rich with rewards for the firms striving to compete. At this juncture, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) can still rake in the dough in a far more mature streaming market.\n\nAs the battle for viewership looks to take it to the next level with intriguing new streaming concepts (think video game streaming and content optimized for mixed-reality headsets), I’d look for some of the shine to return to the streaming plays.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlthough there are plenty of streaming apps with so much incredible content to offer (and so little time to get through our lists of things to watch), Netflix continues to offer one of the best bangs for one’s buck in the entire entertainment scene.\n\nYou’re getting a boatload of value for your price, especially if you opt for the cheaper ad-supported plans. And suppose you’re a couch potato who consumes a lot of Netflix content (it’s really hard not to binge on some of their new reality shows). In that case, in my humble opinion, Netflix is almost uncancellable, regardless of the economic environment.\n\nWith a trove of content and a wider range of price tiers to meet consumers’ financial circumstances, Netflix remains one of the more affordable forms of high-quality entertainment on the market. In that regard, a Netflix subscription seems more like a consumer staple than a discretionary.\n\nWhether this warrants the stock’s premium multiple of over 46 times trailing price-to-earnings remains the big question mark for investors. Either way, Netflix remains the streamer to beat right now. The firm shows us there’s still economic profitability in streaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming a threat in the streaming market, especially following its decision to have its video streaming service Prime Video jump aboard the ad-based tier bandwagon. If you can’t get enough of the hit shows on the platform, an extra few bucks to get rid of the ads isn’t much of a deal-breaker. Fans of the service will be happy to pay a bit more if it means adding to Prime Video’s content budget.\n\nNot everybody will welcome ads and requests for a few more dollars, though. The dollars from monthly subscriptions do add up, and the financial impact can start to hurt, especially in these inflationary times.\n\nSome Prime subscribers grew pretty upset that Amazon would interrupt ad-free content just a few weeks ago. Some disgruntled consumers felt “deceived”, according to a recently proposed lawsuit that is reportedly seeking $5 million from the firm for the move.\n\nUndoubtedly, price hikes and ads won’t be well-received on the whole. As Amazon looks to pad its profits, it had better make things right with its loyal subscribers. Otherwise, they may just end up speaking with their wallets. Either way, Amazon seems to recognize the potential in its Prime Video service as it evolves to become more than just a “side-perk” of having a Prime subscription.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nFinally, we have Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a firm many may count “out” of the streaming wars. Though the content library at Apple TV+ has grown in recent years, the service continues to drag its feet relative to many peers. Recent price hikes will not help the service take market share away from its rivals.\n\nWith the growing number of praise for some of its programs (Ted Lasso, Severance and The Morning Show) Apple TV+ seems to be taking on more of a high-quality storytelling angle than some of its competitors, especially Netflix, which has a slew of hit reality shows (think Love in Blind) that’s been trending of late.\n\nYes, there’s not a ton of content on Apple TV+. All it really takes is one hit show. Ted Lasso seems to be that very show for many, to draw in new subscribers. The real battle lies in retaining them as competitors lure them over their platforms. Fortunately, I think Apple is on the right track, as it trickles intriguing original films into the content library to get users to stick around for a while longer.\n\nApple TV+ may not be the most exciting member of the streaming scene, but it’s certainly taking on a unique angle. Perhaps Apple could bring more immersive content like its Discover Dinosaurs to hook Vision Pro users to its platform.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Apple and Amazon.

In an Instagram Reel posted Tuesday evening, the social media CEO sized up Apple’s headset against Meta’s own Quest 3 and came to the conclusion that “the Quest is the better product, period.”\n\nZuckerberg’s post, which he largely filmed using the Quest 3, comes as Apple’s Vision Pro approaches its second week on the market. The $3,499 “spatial computer” quickly went viral as videos and photos of people using it bounced across social media.\n\nAll of the hype leading into the Vision Pro’s launch seemingly irked Zuckerberg, who has funneled billions into Meta’s efforts to take VR/AR headsets mainstream and jumpstart his vision for the metaverse, a series of interconnected online worlds.\n\nIn his review of the Vision Pro, Zuckerberg calls out a handful of differences between the devices, chief among them their prices. Apple’s Vision Pro is priced well beyond the average consumer electronics product. At $499, the Quest 3 isn’t exactly cheap, though it does come closer to what you’d spend on a modern game console or laptop than Apple’s offering. The Apple Vision Pro headset is displayed in a showroom on the Apple campus after its unveiling on June 5, 2023, in Cupertino, Calif. (Jeff Chiu/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nZuckerberg also needled the Vision Pro for requiring a wired external battery pack and said the Quest is more comfortable and has a wider field of view and brighter display.\n\n“I was surprised by how many tradeoffs [Apple] had to make to the quality of the device,” Zuckerberg said. “I’m pretty surprised that Quest is so much better for the vast majority of things that people use these headsets for.”\n\nZuckerberg also spoke to the broader ecosystems powering the headsets, touching on Apple’s closed-off operating system compared to Meta’s more open approach, saying he wants to see an open approach win out.\n\nFor what it's worth, I've used both the Quest 3 and Vision Pro and found the Vision Pro to be easier to navigate and quite comfortable. Its display was also a standout, offering impressive clarity compared to the Quest 3.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt makes sense for Zuckerberg to promote his product. But critiquing Apple’s Vision Pro is an unusual step among tech CEOs.\n\n“I think one of the reasons for anyone to do what he did is to keep up that hype, keep up that momentum, because this market surely needs that,” explained Gartner director and analyst Tuong Nguyen. “Keep people interested, and what better way to keep them interested than shots fired.”\n\nAccording to Nguyen, Zuckerberg’s battle with Apple is a good thing because it means increased competition, which should ultimately benefit consumers.\n\nIt’s also important to keep in mind that Apple could address Zuckerberg’s criticisms with the next version of the Vision Pro, explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\n“Let's come back in a year, let's come back in two years, and let's see how that story changes,” he said. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThis isn’t the first time Zuckerberg and Apple have butted heads. Heck, it’s not the first time the CEO has used his social platform to tangle with another Big Tech executive. You’ll recall the billionaire was previously set to fight Tesla CEO Elon Musk after the X owner challenged Zuckerberg to an MMA match in 2023.\n\nBut his disdain for Apple runs deeper than playground antics.\n\nApple kneecapped Meta’s ad business with the release of its App Tracking Transparency feature in 2021. The software update gave iPhone users the ability to keep apps from tracking their movement across the web and other apps, cutting into a key piece of Meta’s data stream, which helps power its advertising sales.\n\nMeta has also criticized Apple for its so-called walled garden-style operating system that gives the iPhone maker ultimate control over what kind of apps and software users can install on their devices.\n\nHowever Zuckerberg feels about Apple’s Vision Pro, though, the headset war will ultimately come down to device sales. And if the Vision Pro can beat the Quest 3 there, the CEO’s opinions won’t matter all that much.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance. He's been covering the tech industry since 2011.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg drags Apple’s new Vision Pro in Instagram video, claiming his Quest 3 headset is the ‘better product, period’",
        "content": "Mixed martial arts enthusiast Mark Zuckerberg is taking the gloves off, only this time instead of social media rival Elon Musk, he’s gunning for Tim Cook.\n\nIn a video post to his account on Meta’s Instagram, the company founder took his best shot at the Apple CEO’s new Vision Pro, after the mixed reality headset stole the thunder away from Zuckerberg’s $500 Quest 3 launched just four months prior.\n\n“I expected that Quest would be the better value for most people, since it’s really good and it’s seven times less expensive,” the Meta boss said on Tuesday after revealing he just tried out Cook’s $3,500 device.\n\n“But after using it, I don’t just think that Quest is the better value—I think that Quest is the better product, period.”\n\nZuckerberg, the fourth wealthiest entrepreneur in the world, just celebrated Meta’s single-day $200 billion gain in market value, the largest for any company on record, after posting stronger-than-expected Q4 results and news of its first-ever dividend.\n\nYet there was one blight in the earnings report: his company’s Reality Labs division responsible for Quest.\n\nNot only did it post a loss of nearly $4.7 billion, an all-time high for a single quarter, it crossed the staggering mark of $42 billion in cumulative red ink to date.\n\nInvestors have since been pleading with Meta to end the constant destruction of shareholder value.\n\nThat’s in part because virtual reality headsets have simply struggled to gain a broader audience, despite the efforts of Zuckerberg and rival Sony.\n\nUsers frequently complain the bulky contraptions prove uncomfortable to wear for long periods, trigger nauseating bouts of motion sickness and lack compelling content.\n\nI prefer this … pic.twitter.com/kYzNrXktjm\n\n— Robin Holland (@rnholl) February 4, 2024\n\nThe Quest 3 was supposed to address many of the shortcomings, including a slimmer design that is lighter in the front and a full-color passthrough so users can at all times navigate their physical environment with the headset on.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's Vison Pro has captured the imagination\n\nBut ever since Cook launched his VisionPro earlier this month, which the Apple CEO deliberately branded a “spatial computer” (rather than a mixed reality headset), sentiment has shifted considerably.\n\nThe internet lit up with all manner of pictures, videos and memes both praising Apple’s first all-new hardware device in years, as well as poking fun at those wearing it.\n\nFor once, though, people are at least talking about the technology.\n\n“Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created,” boasted Cook, claiming it would “redefine how we connect, create and explore.”\n\nIn Zuckerberg’s Instagram video—recorded using the Quest 3—the Meta CEO countered his device was in key aspects superior to Apple’s.\n\nNot only did he point out it came with precision handheld controllers and lacked cables that can be a nuisance, Zuckerberg claimed it was simply more comfortable.\n\n“I was surprised by how many trade-offs they had to make to the quality of the device, to the comfort and ergonomics,” he said. “Overall Quest is better for the vast majority of things that people use mixed reality for.”\n\nWhether Zuckerberg’s return salvo will land with consumers remains to be seen.\n\nBut if Apple begins to release sales figures for the Vision Pro, it could be good news for Meta investors as it might finally shame Meta into publishing more statistics around demand for the Quest 3.\n\nNeedless to say, there will be plenty of entertainment to come in what has been aptly dubbed the “Nerd Goggle Wars”.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Get Rich Quick With These 3 Augmented Reality Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "Augmented reality is admittedly in its infancy, but we can expect the sector to accelerate as recent innovations bring products to market and (ultimately) drive costs downward. Market value forecasts are a tricky metric to establish, but conservative estimates point to augmented reality being worth as much as $58 billion by 2028 while driving $38 billion in sales this year alone. This is an important consideration when investing in AR stocks.\n\nAs with any new and emergent tech, plenty of newcomers, upstarts, and startups are flooding the scene in a bid for investor attention. Of course, not all of these will come out on top. If you’re looking for augmented reality stocks, the best bet today is to stick with names you know – and these AR stocks are household names for a reason.\n\nSo here are three AR stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) An image of a building with the Apple logo on it, a pink sunset in the background\n\nSource: askarim / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is on track to hit a record-setting $4 trillion market cap next year, with much of its newfound acceleration coming from augmented reality. While not staggering, the company’s already sold as many as 200,000 Vision Pro headsets, which is no mean feat at a $3,499 price tag. We’ll likely see sales accelerate as early adopters prove the product’s capabilities and, eventually, unit costs drop.\n\nOf course, a going concern moving forward is that the Vision Pro could begin to cannibalize sales across Apple product lines, specifically tablets and iPads, sales of which are already on a downswing. Apple is at an inflection point: while they wait for Vision Pro sales to settle and stabilize, they’re also waiting to see whether the new hardware and augmented reality tech is a mere diversion or represents what the iPod did in the mid-2000s. Either way – Apple is easily the dominant augmented reality stock today and the best bet for a blue-chip inroad into the emerging market.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a close runner-up to Apple but may not stay in second place for long. In one major consumer review, Apple’s Vision Pro and Meta’s Quest Pro are neck-and-neck at four stars each – but the Quest Pro’s pricing is a fraction of Apple’s. This sets Meta up not as an inferior discount to Apple but as a cost leader able to innovate without brand-name bloat often associated with Apple. this makes it one of those AR stocks to consider.\n\nBeyond the Quest Pro, Zuckerberg and the team have something brewing under the surface that likely relates to its augmented reality initiatives. In mid-January, Zuckerberg revealed billions of dollars worth of spending on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) chips. While Meta’s AI initiatives doubtlessly contribute to the total, the company’s burgeoning “massive compute infrastructure” will just as likely service augmented reality platforms to boot – especially once integrated with AI.\n\nLike Apple, Meta is on the blue-chip side of augmented reality stocks, making it a safer bet to capture new trends as the sector develops.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An abstract illustration of an adult wearing an AR/VR headset.\n\nSource: Andrush via Shutterstock\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is one of today’s largest augmented reality manufacturers. As such, it likely won’t let new entrants or existing competitors take over its position. The company’s joint venture with Samsung and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) solidifies its industry-leading hardware role and could be the next big thing as augmented reality markets mature.\n\nThis partnership aims to create a comprehensive mixed-reality platform, leveraging Qualcomm’s technology, Samsung’s hardware, and Google’s investments in augmented reality tools. No specific product announcement has been announced. Still, analysts anticipate that the venture will produce a series of headsets that will introduce customers to new virtual reality experiences and generate significant revenue for Qualcomm.\n\nMeanwhile, QCOM continues to enhance its extensive range of virtual reality products, including headsets. The company’s Snapdragon processor equips its product line with the latest WiFi technology and eye-tracking capabilities, fostering innovation in the augmented reality space and establishing new industry standards for others to emulate.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights: Apple, Deckers Outdoor and Alphabet",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 14, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple AAPL, Deckers Outdoor DECK and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nThese 3 Companies Are Shattering Quarterly Records\n\nWe continue to navigate through earnings season, seeing plenty of quarterly prints delivered daily. The period has been primarily positive so far, underpinned by a notably strong performance from several of the Mag 7 members and the technology sector overall.\n\nSo far, we’ve gotten plenty of positive results, with several companies, including Apple, Deckers Outdoor and Alphabet posting quarterly records across different metrics. What was there to like in each respective release? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nDeckers Outdoor\n\nDeckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities.\n\nConcerning headline figures, DECK posted a 32% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 8.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 44% and 16%, respectively. Impressively, EPS of $15.11 and revenue of $1.6 million reflected quarterly records, driven by strength across its brands.\n\nNotably, the company’s UGG and HOKA brands were standout performers, with sales of each growing 15% and 22% from the year-ago period, respectively. Deckers provided bright guidance following the release, now expecting net sales of $4.15 billion and a gross margin of 54.5%.\n\nAnalysts took their earnings expectations higher following the release, with the $26.59 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 37% year-over-year growth.\n\nApple\n\nApple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion and record EPS of $2.18, reflecting growth rates of 2% and 16%, respectively. EPS wasn’t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Services results were primarily positive, it’s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate.\n\niPhone revenue positively surprised, reported at $69.7 billion and improving 6% from the year-ago period. Apple shares faced adverse price action following the release, particularly stemming from demand worries in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year.\n\nApple shares have slightly underperformed relative to the S&P 500 over the last year, adding 22% in value vs. a 24.4% gain. While the performance hasn’t been as robust as that of other members of the Mag 7, shares have been a safe haven for investors seeking business stability in a somewhat cloudy economic environment, particularly thanks to Apple’s cash-generating abilities.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet posted a 2.5% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate, reflecting the fourth consecutive period of exceeding bottom line expectations. Quarterly revenue totaled a mighty $86.3 billion, reflecting a quarterly record and growing 13% year-over-year.\n\nThere were several notable highlights from the release, including YouTube ad revenue growing 15% year-over-year and Google Cloud operating income of $864 million well above the loss of -$186 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGOOGL shares aren’t overly stretched regarding valuation, with the current 21.8X forward earnings multiple (F1) beneath the five-year median and comparing favorably to the Zacks Technology sector average of 27.4X.\n\nThe company’s earnings are forecasted to climb 16% in its current year (FY24) on 12% higher sales.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season continues chugging along, delivering us surprises daily. We’ve gotten through a fair amount of results so far, with over two-thirds of S&P 500 members already posting quarterly results.\n\nConcerning positivity, all three companies above broke quarterly records.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "The Best Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy With $3,000 Right Now",
        "content": "Got some extra cash you won't be needing anytime soon, but don't know what to do with it? Maybe you just don't have time to ferret out your portfolio's next pick? Whatever the case, there's a simple solution -- borrow an idea from one of the world's most proven investors, Warren Buffett. Or, more specifically, buy one of the names Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway already owns.\n\nHere's a rundown of three Buffett-approved picks Berkshire Hathaway is currently holding that would also be at home in most investors' portfolios.\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nTo say Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) is a well-known brand somehow seems like a serious understatement. It's a market-share leader, domestically as well as internationally. Indeed, now well over 100 years old, the company's become a cultural icon.\n\nIt's not just its namesake cola anymore, of course. The Coca-Cola Company is also parent to Dasani water, Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juice, Powerade sports drink, and Sprite just to name a few of its other beverage brands. This wide range of products is a big reason Coca-Cola's been able to maintain its revenue and earnings growth for so long even though the beverage marketplace is constantly evolving. (Namely, consumers are drinking less sugary soda and drinking more water and tea.) It's always got something to sell someone.\n\nMore important to investors, this steady flow of sales and profits is why the company's dividend history is nothing less than stellar. Not only has Coca-Cola been reliably paying dividends every year for decades, but it's also raised its dividend payment every year for the past 61 years. Only nine other companies in existence today boast a longer track record of annual dividend growth.\n\nDon't look for any dividend disruption anytime soon either. Aside from being one of the world's most memorable, loyalty-inspiring families of beverage brands, it's also earning more than enough to fund its current and future payouts. Only about two-thirds of its profits are paid out in the form of dividends. The difference provides a cushion against any fiscal turbulence and allows the company to reinvest in its relatively simple business's own growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple\n\nThere was a time when Berkshire Hathaway simply wouldn't have owned a stake in Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). See, for most of his stock-picking life, Buffett's steered clear of technology stocks, explaining he doesn't invest in companies he doesn't fully understand. That's why Berkshire's 2016 purchase of Apple shares came as such a surprise.\n\nEven more surprising is that Buffett has added to the trade in the meantime, as Apple's stock price has grown. The 915 million-share holding is not only about 5% of Apple itself, but now also accounts for roughly half of Berkshire Hathaway's stock portfolio. That's a lot by both measures.\n\nThe decision probably wasn't all Buffett's. Younger managers Todd Combs and Ted Weschler arguably better understand Apple's strengths and weaknesses, and as such were in a better position to suggest the pick.\n\nThat being said, it's not as if the position is misaligned with Buffett's usual stock-selection regimen, nor is it out of place within the Berkshire Hathaway portfolio. The company's business is actually quite easy to understand, for example -- Apple makes smartphones, and supports their sales by providing a robust ecosystem of apps that extract every ounce of functionality from the device.\n\nThere's another detail about Apple, however, that that arguably even better qualifies it as a Buffett pick. That is, it's a strong business with clear competitive advantages. Underscoring this claim are numbers from market research outfit Bionic, which reports 92.6% of iPhone users intend to buy another one in the future while only 74.6% of current Android smartphone users say they'll buy another Android phone when the time comes. Meanwhile, mobile app consultant Asymco's Horace Dediu says iPhone users spend on the order of 7 times more on apps and digital content than Android users do. That's a clear, significant edge.\n\nBank of America\n\nLast but not last, add Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) to your list of Warren Buffett stocks to consider if you've got a few extra thousand bucks to work with at this time. Berkshire Hathaway's holding a little over 1 billion shares of the megabank right now, making it the fund's second-biggest holding.\n\nBoring? A little. But that's kind of the point. Owning stocks as a form of entertainment can often work against you. Like Buffett, you want to hold stocks that dish out superior long-term rewards without a bunch of drama in the short run. BofA does exactly that.\n\nOK, there's been one exception to this reliable progress. That's the stock's sizable pullback in 2008 following the subprime mortgage meltdown.\n\nLike so many other banking stocks around that time, this one was riding high on a movement that would eventually -- and abruptly -- be undermined. In fact, Bank of America shares have yet to reclaim their 2006 high. That's mostly because abnormally low interest rates in the meantime have crimped lending's profit margin rates.\n\nThat collapse and the subsequent several years' worth of low interest rates are the exception to the norm, however. Things are easing back to normal now. And, having remembered the harsh lessons taught by 2008's mortgage market collapse, it's unlikely BofA is going to put itself in a similar situation again in the near future.\n\nThe real appeal to investors here, however, is the dividend. Bank of America shares' current dividend yield stands at a healthy 2.9%, based on a quarterly payment that's grown from $0.12 per share in 2017 (when the banking industry finally and fully shook off the impact of 2008's nightmare) to $0.24 per share now. That's a compound annual growth rate of more 9%, far outpacing inflation's growth during that stretch. And that doesn't even count the stock's price growth of 40% during that pandemic-mired turbulent period.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple’s Longest-Serving Designer to Depart Company, Adding to Exodus",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s longest-serving senior industrial designer is leaving the company, marking the near-complete turnover of a team once led by Jony Ive.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWall Street Caught Off Guard by ‘Sticky’ CPI Signs: Markets Wrap Musk Says Putin Can’t Lose in Ukraine, Opposes Senate Bill Putin Seeks Revenge on a World Order He Once Wanted to Join Standard Chartered Weighs Breaking Up Corporate, Investment Bank US Inflation Tops Forecasts in Blow to Fed Rate-Cut Hopes\n\nBart Andre, who joined Apple in 1992 alongside Ive, told colleagues this month that he is retiring, according to people familiar with the matter. Andre was one of the last remaining designers from the Ive era and helped create the aesthetic for Apple products released over the past three decades — even prior to Steve Jobs returning to the helm in the late 1990s.\n\nThe designer was known as one of Ive’s top lieutenants and helped run the team after former chief Evans Hankey, Ive’s successor, departed last year. He’s also known as one of the biggest holders of Apple patents.\n\n“His mark on Apple products is indelible — I see him every day in the details,” said Christopher Stringer, who used to work with Andre at Apple and now runs sound company Syng.\n\nThe departure is the latest in recent months for the group. Top designers Colin Burns, Shota Aoyagi and Peter Russell-Clarke all left around the end of last year. Multiple longtime designers on Apple’s software design team have also signaled they are planning to leave in the near future.\n\nBoth the industrial-design and user-interface groups are overseen by Jeff Williams, the company’s chief operating officer. He’s held that role since Ive’s departure in 2019 but took on direct management of the industrial-design team last year when Hankey left.\n\nHaving an operations person oversee a division dedicated to design and innovation has rankled some staff, according to the people close to the situation. There have also been cost-cutting measures that have added to the unrest, they said. Under Ive, the team embarked on exploratory projects that didn’t necessarily have an immediate payoff — something that’s been reined in.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nIve’s core design team was made up of about two dozen people for well over a decade. Around the time Ive left in 2019, an exodus began. Nearly all of the senior designers who reported directly to Ive have now left. Many of them joined LoveFrom, a design firm founded by Ive that worked with Apple until two years ago.\n\nThe industrial-design team has been replenished with new outside talent, but there are few longtime members remaining who worked under Ive and helped create hit products like the iPhone, iPad and Apple Watch. Richard Howarth, who serves as vice president of design, is a carryover from the Ive era, along with Molly Anderson and Duncan Kerr.\n\nSince Hankey’s departure, the most senior designers have led the team’s day-to-day operations, working alongside Williams. The operating chief was picked to manage the group, in part, so that he could better coordinate with the manufacturing team. There also was a lack of other viable options to replace Hankey.\n\nRead More: Apple’s Brain Drain Hinders Efforts to Pick Its Next Jony Ive\n\nThe Apple design team is tasked with devising the look and feel of devices and software, as well as developing new features and interfaces. That includes minute details like the sound of ringtones and alerts from an iPhone.\n\nThe group was central to the creation of the company’s last two product categories, the Apple Watch and Vision Pro. The watch’s design was spearheaded by Ive, who also helped craft the iMac, iPod and iPhone. Though the Vision Pro began development during his tenure, he left years before it was released.\n\n(Updates with more on team’s history starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAdobe’s Very Cautious Gambit to Inject AI Into Everything Can I Hire My Crush?

        "content": "Big-name tech stocks posted strong earnings to start the year. But, if you missed the boat on Meta (NASDAQ:META) or Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), don’t lose hope. These tech stocks to buy now have plenty of room to run, and, in some cases, short-term news is putting undue downward pressure on share prices – offering an ideal entry opportunity for long-term investors looking for the next big thing.\n\nRanging from artificial intelligence, cloud computing, satellites, and more, these tech stocks to buy now could make up the next Magnificent 7 as their respective markets mature and they continue expanding at their current pace.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) easily tops the list of top tech stocks to buy now after its recent earnings strength, but remember that the tech stock isn’t a one-trick pony. In fact, the most recent quarterly report is the company’s fifth consecutive profitable quarter, affirming its S&P 500 eligibility. Remember that the S&P methodology requires four consecutive profitable quartersplus profitability for the most recent quarter, though that parameter doesn’t apply to incumbents.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut, index inclusion aside, more bullish factors put Palantir at the top of the list of tech stocks to buy now. The biggest deal, and what drove bearish sentiment in the past, is Palantir’s accelerating commercial contract pipeline. In the past, concern centered around Palantir’s over-reliance on government contracting. That’s a valid consideration, but the company’s year-end commercial revenue grew 20% year-over-year (YoY), while government sales value climbed 14%. Though both top-line numbers point to strong momentum, commercial sales expansion points to Palantir successfully breaking free from its “defense stock” misconception.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Arista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nSome top analysts see Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) as the “next big thing” for artificial intelligence, but, thus far, it’s been eclipsed by other big-name tech stocks competing for investor attention. But that could change in 2024.\n\nAnalysts, including those at Citi, Morgan Stanley, Barclays, and more, rate Arista as a Buy based on future cloud sector expansion and AI opportunities. Specifically, Citi analyst Atif Malik said that Arita benefits from both the “generative AI megatrend” and broad “early AI-related opportunities.”\n\nThough the company hasn’t yet posted earnings, analyst forecasts trend toward the bullish side as well. Consensus estimates peg earnings per share at $1.70, or 20% higher YOY. The company’s last report beat expectations, with management painting a rosier-than-expected picture for Q4 and its end-of-year report. All eyes are on this tech stock to buy before its February 12th earnings call as AI investor sentiment cycles back to the “hard tech” side of the equation.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB) shares suffered thus far in 2024 after a convertible note offering spooked investors wary of dilution. But the company’s 20% drop likely won’t last long – making today’s pricing entry point ideal among small-cap tech stocks. Most already know that the company secured a $515 million contract to launch and service select space assets, but wider institutional attention has only recently accelerated.\n\nSpecifically, like Arista, Citi analysts are bullish on RocketLab. The rating and analysis side of the banking giant set a Buy rating for the stock with a $6.00 price target, or about 40% above today’s per-share pricing. Citi set the target based on a 3x multiple of the company’s current sales projection, indicating that the substantial government contract is just the beginning of an expanding sales cycle as the company matures and proves competitive with existing space stocks. Small-cap tech stocks tend to have the best long-term upside potential at the cost of higher volatility, so getting in with RocketLab today is a surefire way to capture a slice of a $1 trillion growing industry.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nI talked last year about the investment opportunity that the Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) and VMware merger represented from an equity arbitrage perspective. But, now that the deal is closed, there’s a tech stock opportunity in Broadcom now that VMware’s acquisition softens its reliance on Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nHistorically, Apple accounts for about 20% of Broadcom’s revenue based on its ongoing 5G and wireless component deal. Expanding into cloud computing massively increases Broadcom’s total addressable market. Broadcom expects VMware integration to healthily boost its bottom line, although the first year also must account for about $1 billion in transaction costs that will cut into early-stage profitability. Still, a short-term hurdle is a small price to pay for long-term synergies, and Broadcom’s current per-share pricing (which has bearish undertones) positions it as a tech stock ready to surge once management fully divests unused VMware segments and begins working in sync with its new sectors.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications.

ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) can’t stop its winning streak after announcing a new, secret deal with the U.S. government. While “announcing” and “secret” might seem counter to one another, the secretive nature of the deal surrounds what AST will provide and for how much. But swirling unknowns don’t impact the main message. Like RocketLab, the U.S. government throwing its hat in with ASTS is an important endorsement of the company’s viability and offerings. That endorsement rings especially loudly, considering ASTS is firmly in the pre-revenue stages, with its first widespread commercial launches planned for later this year.\n\nThe news comes, of course, on the heels of ASTS’ massive strategic funding deal that includes big-name investors like AT&T (NYSE:T) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL). That deal was soon followed by a dilutive share offering announcement, sending shares close to penny stock territory. But, with all the bullish tailwinds propelling this small-cap tech stock forward, expect big things in 2024 for ASTS.\n\nTech Stocks to Buy Now: SoFi Technologies (SOFI) SoFi Technologies, Inc logo with stock market chart background. is an American online personal finance company and online bank.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) seems to have finally found its spot between “pure” next-gen fintech and bigger-picture legacy banking. At the end of January, the cheap tech stock banked its first-ever profitable quarter at a slim two cents per share. But profit is profit, and the fact that SoFi successfully nailed its first in a “higher for longer” macroclimate means that the stock should surge as rates settle.\n\nUniquely, SoFi is now pivoting toward a wider range of offerings to cement its place as a one-stop financial services stock when coupled with its range of banking and borrowing solutions. SoFi recently announced that it now offers alternative investments within its investment platform, letting investors access otherwise off-limit assets like private credit and venture capital through managed funds.\n\nNot all are as bullish on SoFi’s future as recent developments would imply, though, as Morgan Stanley recently downgraded the stock based on “[SoFi] pricing in too much optimism on the path to 2026 profitability laid […] while staring in the face of a worsening top-line growth outlook for 2024.” But investors have plenty to justify optimism, and the tech stock is still priced to buy well below past highs.\n\nFabrinet (FN) Close-up Presentation of a New Generation Microchip.

Semiconductor stocks are in the news.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFabrinet (NYSE:FN), a small-cap semiconductor stock, is another tech stock positioned for massive upside in the coming years. The company counts Nvidia among its big-name client list, underscoring its long-term potential. Even as chipmakers battle for supremacy, Fabrinet’s focus on data transmission makes it a major supplier to the best-in-class semiconductor stocks. This helps shield it from company-specific risk while capturing the entire segment’s long-term upside.\n\nThough the company reported underwhelming earnings last week, management’s long-term outlook remains rosy. Executives project a slight bump for next quarter’s earnings, though its forecast remains slightly below past analyst expectations. Slowing growth in the short term means consolidation and accumulation opportunities for investors before tech stocks’ next leg up as the artificial intelligence and semiconductor sectors keep maturing.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "These 3 Companies Are Shattering Quarterly Records",
        "content": "We continue to navigate through earnings season, seeing plenty of quarterly prints delivered daily. The period has been primarily positive so far, underpinned by a notably strong performance from several of the Mag 7 members and the technology sector overall.\n\nSo far, we’ve gotten plenty of positive results, with several companies, including Apple AAPL, Decker’s Outdoor DECK, and Alphabet GOOGL posting quarterly records across different metrics. What was there to like in each respective release? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nDeckers Outdoor\n\nDeckers Outdoor, a current Zacks Rank #1 (Buy), is a leading designer, producer, and brand manager of innovative, niche footwear and accessories developed for outdoor sports and other lifestyle-related activities.\n\nConcerning headline figures, DECK posted a 32% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and reported sales 8.5% ahead of expectations, reflecting growth rates of 44% and 16%, respectively. Impressively, EPS of $15.11 and revenue of $1.6 million reflected quarterly records, driven by strength across its brands.\n\nBelow is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNotably, the company’s UGG and HOKA brands were standout performers, with sales of each growing 15% and 22% from the year-ago period, respectively. Deckers provided bright guidance following the release, now expecting net sales of $4.15 billion and a gross margin of 54.5%.\n\nAnalysts took their earnings expectations higher following the release, with the $26.59 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate for its current fiscal year suggesting 37% year-over-year growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple\n\nApple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion and record EPS of $2.18, reflecting growth rates of 2% and 16%, respectively. EPS wasn’t the only quarterly record, as Services revenue of $23.1 billion reached its highest mark yet and grew 11% year-over-year.\n\nWhile Services results were primarily positive, it’s worth noting that the reported figure modestly fell short of the Zacks Consensus estimate.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\niPhone revenue positively surprised, reported at $69.7 billion and improving 6% from the year-ago period. Apple shares faced adverse price action following the release, particularly stemming from demand worries in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year.\n\nApple shares have slightly underperformed relative to the S&P 500 over the last year, adding 22% in value vs. a 24.4% gain. While the performance hasn’t been as robust as that of other members of the Mag 7, shares have been a safe haven for investors seeking business stability in a somewhat cloudy economic environment, particularly thanks to Apple’s cash-generating abilities. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet posted a 2.5% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate, reflecting the fourth consecutive period of exceeding bottom line expectations. Quarterly revenue totaled a mighty $86.3 billion, reflecting a quarterly record and growing 13% year-over-year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThere were several notable highlights from the release, including YouTube ad revenue growing 15% year-over-year and Google Cloud operating income of $864 million well above the loss of -$186 million in the year-ago period.\n\nGOOGL shares aren’t overly stretched regarding valuation, with the current 21.8X forward earnings multiple (F1) beneath the five-year median and comparing favorably to the Zacks Technology sector average of 27.4X.\n\nThe company’s earnings are forecasted to climb 16% in its current year (FY24) on 12% higher sales. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season continues chugging along, delivering us surprises daily. We’ve gotten through a fair amount of results so far, with over two-thirds of S&P 500 members already posting quarterly results.\n\nConcerning positivity, all three companies above – Apple AAPL, Decker’s Outdoor DECK, and Alphabet GOOGL – broke quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "After struggling to find its footing following myriad questions about corporate direction, Disney (NYSE:DIS) fired back with a strong earnings performance, thus putting other entertainment stocks on notice. Still, that doesn’t mean investors should ignore alternatives to the House of Mouse.\n\nEarlier this month, the Magic Kingdom posted better-than-expected profits for its December quarter. Also, it provided earnings guidance for the September 2024 fiscal year that exceeded Wall Street’s estimates Even the company’s semi-annual dividend is getting a boost by 50%. In other words, there’s a lot to love here.\n\nNevertheless, Disney still faces long-term challenges. One of them centers on the future of the enterprise’s linear TV assets. It also produced some real stinkers in the box office, opening the door for alternative entertainment stocks. Factor in some risky moves – such as streaming live sports – and circumstances could get interesting.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo be sure, Disney is off to a great start this year, gaining over 20%. Still, for those who want to go a slightly different path, these are the alternative entertainment stocks to consider.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a consumer technology giant, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is synonymous with smart devices. However, it could start to move the needle within the ranks of compelling entertainment stocks. In contrast to other streaming platforms, Apple TV+ crafted an intriguing niche by focusing on original programming. Rather than live sports or network TV shows, users can instead find unique big-budget movies and award-winning series.\n\nIf you look at the offerings on tap, we’re not talking about straight-to-DVD (remember those?) junk. Nor are we talking about content that has jumped multiple sharks multiple times. No, these are compelling movies and programs with some of the biggest Hollywood A-listers.\n\nFurther, the advantage that Apple levers is that if anything else, it can always fall back on its core devices and service business units. However, I’m not really seeing how AAPL stock can fail here given the underlying connectivity ecosystem.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith shares off to a rough start, this juncture could be an ideal to consider Apple. Analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $208.07 average price target.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs an e-commerce powerhouse and an all-around tech stalwart, it’s difficult to bet against Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). From buying up businesses and expanding into multiple areas beyond supporting its core online marketplace, AMZN continues to impress investors. And it could give Disney a good run for its money as one of the rising entertainment stocks.\n\nFirst, you can’t overlook the convenience factor. I’d venture like most people, I’m logged into Amazon’s website all the time. On my downtime, when I want to buy something, I do so. Further, through Amazon Prime Video, I enjoy access to an enviable content library. We’re not just talking about U.S.-made movies and TV shows but international offerings as well.\n\nSecond, the company broadcasts several enticing series and original movies via Amazon Studios. Targeting an audience that enjoys grittier realistic content, the e-commerce firm has a winner on its hands. Analysts agree, pegging shares a unanimous strong buy with a $207.92 average price target, implying almost 21% growth potential.\n\nWarner Bros Discovery (WBD) The logo of the new Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) company on smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Jimmy Tudeschi / Shutterstock.com\n\nAn enterprise that I own through a spinoff by telecommunications giant AT&T (NYSE:T), Warner Bros Discovery (NASDAQ:WBD) represents the higher-risk, higher-reward component of alternative entertainment stocks. Since the start of the year, WBD stock fell almost 15%. And in the past 52 weeks, the equity dipped more than 33%. Since the spinoff, shareholders have been seeing almost nothing but red ink. I would know.\n\nHowever, it’s possible that we could see some daylight emerge. As a multinational mass media and entertainment conglomerate, Warner Bros offers top TV brands. These include CNN, TBS, TNT, HBO, along with the namesake brands Warner Bros and Discovery.\n\nIn addition, what makes WBD attractive as a candidate for top-tier entertainment stocks is the potential to deliver some hard-hitting content. To the ever-popular Shark Week series to the DC Comics unit, Warner Bros is no slouch. It just needs to find its footing.\n\nAnalysts are willing to give it a chance, rating shares a consensus moderate buy. Also, the average price target hits $14.23, implying almost 43% upside potential.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto held a LONG position in T and WBD. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nA former senior business analyst for Sony Electronics, Josh Enomoto has helped broker major contracts with Fortune Global 500 companies.

        "title": "15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 15 best strong buy stocks to invest in. If you want to skip our overview of analyst ratings and the finance industry, then you can take a look at the 5 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In.\n\nThe financial services industry is one of the biggest in the world, and just like oil, its smooth functioning is indispensable for global economic well being. A financial firm can be of several types and cater to the money needs and requirements of a wide variety of customers. The firms can range from small, regional, and mega banks, to credit services providers, savings and loan associations, multi billion dollar asset management funds, sharply managed hedge funds, and of course, investment management companies such as Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBroadly speaking, while the finance industry is involved in the business of managing money, it's investment banks and analysts who are responsible for shaping investor attention. They do this by preparing stock coverage reports and assigning ratings and price targets to publicly traded companies. The share price targets, ratings, earnings, revenue estimates, and notes are the primary ways through which analysts evaluate an equity. Their opinions are also some of the most reliable indicators of a share price's movements as every earnings cycle investor reacts to a publicly traded stock's revenue and EPS meeting or missing analyst estimates, Similarly, during any business day, a share price upgrade or downgrade by mega investment banks and behemoths such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS).\n\nAdditionally, just because these banks or others evaluate stocks doesn't mean that they don't get evaluated themselves. As long as they're publicly traded and are of sufficient size to justify expending resources on, the banks that analysts work for are evaluated by their peers as well with the only limitation being that analysts from, say, JPMorgan cannot write investment notes about their own bank.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince dozens of analysts cover big ticket names such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the most common way in which share price ratings or price targets are covered in the press is by averaging them. For instance, as part of our look at ten stocks with rising share price targets, Insider Monkey analyzed data for firms such as Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ:COST), Uber Technologies, Inc. (NYSE:UBER), and AbbVie Inc. (NYSE:ABBV), Insider Monkey used share price target averages ranging from 31 analysts for Costco, to 44 analysts covering Uber's shares. This is unsurprising as well, since analysts typically work for financial services firms that are classified as Sell Side.\n\nA sell side analyst works for a bank that manages money for clients that end up buying stocks. So, if there's a potential for a stock to attract significant investor funds, then a bank is incentivized to cover it and assign share ratings and share price targets. Therefore, the fact that more analysts cover Uber than Goldman is unsurprising. After all, Uber was one of the first movers in the ride hailing application space, and while its income statement struggled to come out of a 'high growth look' that focuses on revenue instead of profit, the firm is one of the leading players in industries with disruptive potential such as urban air mobility.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best strong buy stocks to invest in so that we can see which stocks with strong buy ratings are also favorites among hedge funds. Some notable stocks in this list are Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL), and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH). 15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\nA close-up of a hand, counting the money from the subscription fees of the Entertainment Communication Services company.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best strong buy stocks to invest in, we first made a list of the 30 most valuable stocks with a market capitalization greater than $300 million and share price upside greater than 50% that had Strong Buy ratings on average. Then, they were ranked by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares during Q3 2023, and the best strong buy stocks are as follows.\n\nFor these best strong buy stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n15 Best Strong Buy Stocks To Invest In\n\n15. Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKT)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27\n\nRocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKT) is a small biotechnology company developing treatments for genetic diseases. The firm's treatment for a treatment for a rare genetic disease that affects children is in the final stages of the FDA approval, providing a potential catalyst for the share price.\n\nInsider Monkey took a look at 910 hedge fund portfolios for last year's third quarter and found 27 Rocket Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (NASDAQ:RCKT) investors. Lee Ainslie's Maverick Capital was the firm's largest shareholder in our database due to its $115 million stake.\n\nJust like Valaris Limited (NYSE:VAL), Baidu, Inc. (NASDAQ:BIDU), and Lantheus Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:LNTH),  is a top Strong Buy stock that hedge funds are piling into.\n\n14. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 27\n\nUltragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE) is another small biotechnology firm focusing on helping people with genetic ailments. It is starting 2024 on a strong note and has seen progress in accessing European markets, clinical trials, and drug efficiency.\n\nFor their Q3 2023 shareholdings, 27 out of the 910 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had bought and owned the firm's shares. Ultragenyx Pharmaceutical Inc. (NASDAQ:RARE)'s biggest hedge fund investor is Panayotis Takis Sparaggis's Alkeon Capital Management as it owns a $69.2 million stake.\n\n13. Iridium Communications Inc. (NASDAQ:IRDM)\n\nNumber of Q3 2023 Hedge Fund Shareholders: 28\n\nIridium Communications Inc.

        "title": "Palantir Joined Amazon And Microsoft In Showing That AI Already Lived Up To The Hype",
        "content": "Although much of the AI buzz has been somewhat saved for the magnificent seven, which are Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META), Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), there are other companies successfully riding the wave. Last week, Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE: PLTR) reported its fourth quarter earnings and it topped estimates fueled by AI demand that continues to be unrelenting in the U.S.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Palantir reported revenue grew 20% YoY to $608.4 million, topping LSEG’s estimate of $602.4 million. Net income grew from $30.9 million, or 1 cent per share Palantir earned in 2022’s comparable quarter to $93.4 million, or 4 cents per share. Adjusted earnings of 8 cents were in line with LSEG’s estimate.\n\nHeavy Reliance On Government Deals Is No Longer An Issue\n\nPalantir reported its customer base grew 35% YoY to 497 customers it served during the fourth quarter, showing it is enjoying a surging demand in the private sector whose customer count rose 44% annually. Therefore, Palantir showed it is successfully building its business outside its legacy government sector. What’s even more impressive is that Palantir used a low-cost mechanism to get customers into its pipeline.\n\nCustomer Acquisition At Its Finest\n\nWhile Microsoft infused billions into OpenAI, with Amazon and Alphabet following suit by investing into Antrophic, Palantir tried to stand out with a unique lead generation strategy. By hosting almost 600 immersive seminars that it calls \"boot camps”, Palantir aimed to fuel interest in its AI platform as it gives attendees the opportunity to try out its software and understand the value of Palantir’s contribution in generative AI-drive use cases. In 2023 alone, Palantir successfully hosted over 500 of those boot camps with growth of its private sector software users showing they did a good job of luring them in.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir Operates In The Shadows Of Big Tech But It Won Its Place Fair And Square\n\nPalantir has delivered when it comes to profitability and it passed the test of consistency. Although its market cap of only $51 billion doesn’t place it in the basket tech mammoths like Microsoft, its latest jaw-dropping report had no shortage of impressive key performance indicators that sent its stock to the Moon as it rocketed by roughly 50% over the five trading days that followed its latest report. Like Microsoft and Amazon, Palantir showed what AI can do for business with expanding margins flowing to the bottom line, along with compounding cash flow.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "If You Invested $10,000 in Apple When Tim Cook Became CEO, This Is How Much You'd Have Today",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most influential companies in history.\n\nThe iPhone heralded the era of the mobile internet, and now, the Vision Pro may kick off the next major computing platform. Most of the credit for the company's success is usually given to co-founder and longtime CEO Steve Jobs. He led Apple through its most inventive period when it released the iPod, iPhone, and iPad in less than a decade, setting the stock on an incredible growth path that's lasted to this day.\n\nCurrent CEO Tim Cook took the helm in Aug. 2011, shortly before Jobs' death. Cook had previously served as Chief Operating Officer, running the company's sales operation and supply chain. While some were skeptical that Cook could fill Jobs' shoes, he's skillfully led Apple and its stock to new heights. Here's how the company has fared during his tenure. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe Tim Cook era\n\nIn 2011, the tech industry was much smaller than it is today. Smartphones were still relatively new, and the mobile economy was just developing.\n\nTrue to expectations, Apple's pace of innovation has slowed under Cook. Prior to the release of the Vision Pro earlier this month, the biggest products launched under his tenure have been accessories like the Apple Watch and AirPods.\n\nCook's biggest accomplishments have likely been the growth of the company's installed base of devices, which reached 2.2 billion in its most recent quarter, and the growth of the services business. Services generate significantly higher margins than Apple's devices, and annual services revenue exploded from $12.9 billion in fiscal 2012 to $85.2 billion in fiscal 2023. Revenue from this segment is largely driven by the App Store, or the 30% commission Apple takes on in-app payments, as well as offerings like Apple Pay and Apple Care insurance.\n\nThese achievements have largely been incremental: Improving each iteration of the iPhone enough to keep customers coming back for an upgrade, helping to grow the services business, and selling complementary devices like Apple Watches and Airpods.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, 2024 has set the stage for arguably the biggest risk the company has taken under Cook: the release of the Vision Pro. Though reviews have been mixed, most industry observers believe that if any company can crack the headset market, it's Apple.\n\nHow Apple stock has performued under Cook\n\nAs most investors know, Apple has been a big winner in the Cook era. AAPL Chart\n\nAs you can see, the stock has outperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin since Cook took over in Aug. 2011 -- up 1,270% (or 1,530% on a total return basis). That means an investor who bought $10,000 of Apple stock at the start of Cook's tenure would have $163,000 today after enjoying a compound annual return of 25%. An equal investment in the S&P 500 would be worth just $52,100 today.\n\nCan Apple keep winning?\n\nApple held the title of the world's most valuable company for most of the past several years, but it recently lost the crown to longtime rival Microsoft. Nonetheless, Apple is still in good shape to deliver solid profit growth as it grows services revenue, repurchases stock, and refreshes its device lineup.\n\nThe company dominates the consumer tech industry, and it's grown its share of the smartphone market in recent years.\n\nWhile the stock commands premium to the broad market with a price-to-earnings ratio of 29, Apple has proven itself time and again, and its core businesses look as strong as ever. Cook teased a generative AI announcement for later this year, which could be transformative for the company. And the Vision Pro, if successful, could reshape Cook's legacy as an innovator.\n\nMaintaining a pace of 25% average annual returns might be difficult, but the company is still well-positioned to outperform the market for the foreseeable future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at 11 stocks that might be splitting soon. If you want to skip our overview of what a stock split is and some recent stock market news, then you can take a look at the 5 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon.\n\nWhen it comes to keeping investors happy, publicly traded stock managers have several options at their disposal. When it comes to investor expectations, the management strategy depends on the kind of stock. For value stocks, i.e. companies that seek to deliver share price and business stability by targeting well established markets, investors typically hope for dividends and the ability to hedge losses and growth drops during turbulence. Similarly, for growth stocks, the primary driver is, well, growth - both for the earnings per share and the share price.\n\nOne way in which a company can keep its share price stable over the long run and insulate it against sentiment driven volatility is by doing a stock split. A split, if you're unaware, is when a firm divides its shares into more shares. So a one for two split simply means that one share trading for $10 is now worth two shares worth $5 each and so on. The primary motivation for a stock split is management's aim to make the shares more tradeable, particularly for retail investors since a stock split makes the shares more affordable. Additionally, a stock split also increases liquidity, which makes for an overall healthier trading environment.\n\nStock splits are quite common in the stock market and nearly every mega cap stock available for trading today has used them in its history. For instance, one of the most valuable companies in the world, the Cupertino, California consumer technology giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has gone through five stock splits in its history. The most recent Apple stock split came in 2020 as the world was reeling from the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Apple split a single share into four back then, and had the split not occurred and the shares had continued to appreciate by a similar percentage from then until now, then a single Apple share would currently be worth $744 right now. Apple's previous stock split before the 2020 split was a whopping 7 for 1 split in 2014, and cumulatively, as of February 2024, its shares have been divided into 168 components.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding on this, 2022 has been a busy year when it comes to mega cap stocks and stock splits. Big ticket names such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) have all undergone stock splits which came right when the Federal Reserve was making preparations for lift off when it came to jacking up interest rates. Alphabet and Amazon both announced massive 20 for 1 stock splits in 2022, which was understandable since their shares were trading north of as much as $1,000 by then. When the Federal Reserve raises interest rates, market liquidity dries up and investors, both retail and institutional, find it hard to acquire capital to pile into stocks. Therefore, a stock split, which reduces the share price, encourages trading as a unit of a stock is now worth less in absolute dollar terms and can be bought relatively easily. Additionally, record share price gains during the coronavirus pandemic that saw investors flock to technology stocks due to their potential to capitalize from lock downs induced trend also pushed their share prices quite high and management thought it was best to bring it back to comfortable levels by splitting the shares.\n\nFast forwarding to 2024, the year has borne some fruit when it comes to big companies and stock splits. The start of the year has seen the world's largest brick and mortar retailer Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) announce a stock split. Walmart's shares have reclaimed their all time high levels in 2024 after the firm beat analyst Q4 2023 earnings per share estimates and kept the foot on the pedal when it comes to growth by announcing new stores in its biggest market, the U.S. The firm also announced a three for one stock split that is set to go into effect into February 2024. At the heart of the decision is associate well being, argues Walmart, with its official release sharing that the decision is motivated by ensuring an affordable entry level share price for its Associate Stock Purchase Plan.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some stocks that are splitting soon. Some notable names are Booking Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:BKNG), Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT), and Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO). 11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon\n\nImage by moerschy from Pixabay\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the stocks that are splitting soon, we first made a list of all stocks that are going to split in February 2024, stocks trading above $1,000 and haven't split in decades, and large cap stocks with more than 100% share price gain over the past year. They were ranked by their market capitalization and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these stocks that may be splitting soon, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Stocks That May Be Splitting Soon\n\n11. The Cooper Companies, Inc.

        "content": "(Adds expert comment in pars 11 and 12, adds context on CODE position in final paragraphs)\n\nBy Foo Yun Chee, Bart H. Meijer and Martin Coulter\n\nBRUSSELS, Feb 13 (Reuters) - Apple has won an exemption for its iMessage and Microsoft for its Bing search engine from new EU tech rules after the companies convinced antitrust regulators their services are not gateways for businesses to reach end-users.\n\nThe European Union's Digital Markets Act (DMA), which takes effect in three weeks' time, requires Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet's Google, Amazon, Meta Platforms and ByteDance to allow third-party apps or app stores on their platforms and make it easier for people to switch to rivals.\n\nThe companies are also prohibited from favouring their services over rivals.\n\nFollowing a five-month investigation, the European Commission found iMessage, Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising \"did not qualify as gatekeeper services,\" the EU executive said in a statement.\n\nThe Commission said Apple's App Store, iOS operating system and Safari browser will continue to be classified as gatekeepers as will Microsoft's Linkedin social network and Windows operating system.\n\nIt made \"a thorough assessment of all arguments, taking into account input by relevant stakeholders\", the Commission said without providing details of the companies' arguments.\n\nApple had said iMessage usage is negligible, even on its devices, compared to rival messaging services in the EU and that iMessage is not an important channel for businesses to reach users in the bloc.\n\n\"Consumers today have access to a wide variety of messaging apps, and often use many at once, which reflects how easy it is to switch between them,\" an Apple spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft said that Bing, Edge and Microsoft Advertising operate as challengers in the market and are of relatively small scale, meaning they are not important gateways for business users.\n\n\"We will continue to engage with the Commission and industry at large to ensure Microsoft's other designated platforms comply fully with the DMA,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nStory continues\n\nLazar Radic, an antitrust expert at the International Center for Law and Economics, said: \"It is a good sign that the Commission has considered market realities, instead of just slapping the 'gatekeeper' label on iMessage because it fulfills certain quantitative thresholds.\n\n\"This suggests the Commission is capable of avoiding the temptation to over-regulate.\"\n\nHowever, the Coalition for Open Digital Ecosystems (CODE), whose members include Google, Meta Platforms and Qualcomm, disagreed with the Commission's decision to exempt services such as iMessage.\n\n\"Today’s surprising decision undermines the objectives of the DMA, as well as its potential to improve choice and contestability for all Europeans,\" it said in a statement.

        "title": "Alphabet Stock (NASDAQ:GOOGL): AI Innovation Warrants a Higher Multiple",
        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock has performed well but still hasn’t been the most magnificent of the so-called Magnificent Seven group over the past year. The artificial intelligence (AI) rally is still going strong into 2024, and though Alphabet has big AI innovation projects (perhaps better than some rivals), the stock still hasn’t been able to drive a great deal of multiple expansion in recent years.\n\nAt writing, shares of GOOGL go for a very reasonable 22.2 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E), making it not only the “cheapest” Magnificent Seven stock but also a name that’s not all too much pricier than where the stock normally trades. The modest valuation alone leaves me incredibly bullish on the stock as the company looks to put its foot on the gas with Gemini (formerly Bard).\n\nWith Google recently pulling the curtain on its Gemini Ultra paid tier, the firm is essentially following in the footsteps of ChatGPT-owner OpenAI. Heck, Gemini Ultra may appear to outperform ChatGPT-4 in certain measures. However, you can’t really dub either one as “better” for all uses, at least not yet.\n\nGemini is every bit as intriguing as it is capable. But is there something fundamentally wrong with the Alphabet story as it stays on the cutting edge of AI innovation, just like many of its peers?\n\nThere is one piece of hair on the GOOGL stock narrative. That lies in the high degree of uncertainty as to the fate of Google Search once AI potentially takes its place as the go-to “internet guru.” For now, it’s not yet known how many people will leave Google for greener pastures as new chatbots aim to grab a slice of share away from the previously untouchable search market.\n\nAI Is Both a Potential Disruptor and a Growth Lever for Google\n\nFor now, it’s probably a known fact that Google is leaning heavily on the strength of its search engine when it comes to sales and earnings. Given Google’s heavy reliance on Search, I guess you could say a bear-case scenario exists that would cause some to view the stock as a bit of a value trap.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, I think the GOOGL avoiders and skeptics are wrong to view the name as a value trap just because it’s the heavyweight champ in Search with everything to lose as consumer-facing AI gets smarter and faster by the day.\n\nIf anything, generative AI products on Google could make the whole experience of Googling that much better. If there’s a company that can disrupt Google search, it’s a Google-built AI chatbot.\n\nAdditionally, Google chatbots are backed by one of the most enviable search engines (and data sets) on the planet. AI chatbot hallucinations (AI just making things up) remain one of the biggest problems with AI these days. As AI models — especially those created by Google — pay more emphasis on citing sources (and the reliability of said sources), we could see more links make good use of trusted websites with a thumbs up from Google.\n\nKnowing who and what to trust is vital, especially in the age of AI, when some users may just believe their chatbots without source-checking.\n\nCould it be that a search-based LLM (large language model) is only as good as the search engine behind it? Possibly. Only time will tell if search-backed LLMs become more popular than their data-trained ones that lack access to the most up-to-date information. And with “edge AI” (on-device AI) on the horizon, it’s just too early to tell how things will pan out with AI models in the future.\n\nPersonally, I see the most utility in a search-focused AI chatbot or a search engine that has a chatbot sitting off to the side, ready to assist upon request.\n\nAlphabet’s Ability to Evolve Will be Put to the Test\n\nEven if Google Search is bound to take a hit in the coming years, I’m confident that Alphabet will be able to adapt as it looks to diversify its revenue stream with a handful of powerful AI products. Just as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was able to reinvent itself by shifting from the iPod (last generation’s top seller) to the iPhone, Alphabet will be able to move on from Google Search to what’s next as the industry tides shift.\n\nToday, Search represents a massive portion of the overall sales mix. But who knows what the breakdown will look like 10 years from now. My guess is that AI innovations will have grown into services that diversify the company beyond Search, perhaps putting it on the track of greater growth.\n\nSelf-driving vehicle services (think Waymo), AI-assisted drug discovery, generative AI search tailored for physicians, Google Cloud with AI, Gemini, and other intriguing technologies are essentially options capable of contributing to the earnings mix over time. Indeed, they could turn Alphabet into less of a search company and more of a disruptive AI company. With that said, I view Alphabet stock as one of the cheapest AI stocks in today’s overheated tech-driven market.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, GOOGL stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 37 analyst ratings, there are 29 Buys and eight Hold recommendations. The average GOOGL stock price target is $164.56, implying upside potential of 11.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $141.00 per share to a high of $180.00 per share.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nThough GOOGL stock has been red-hot, surging nearly 60% over the past year alone, it still seems lukewarm when compared to some of its Magnificent Seven rivals. Whether Alphabet stock heats up on the back of AI to the magnitude of its peers remains to be seen. In any case, GOOGL stands out as a stock with GARP (growth at a reasonable price) written all over it. And it looks like a great pick-up, even if we are long overdue for a market correction in the first half of the year.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "The S&P 500 closed above 5,000 for the first time on Friday, propelled by strong earnings from mega-cap technology companies. Now investors are focused on whether positive momentum can broaden out beyond the Magnificent Seven components.\n\nYahoo Finance Markets Reporter Josh Schafer breaks down the details.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Angel Smith\n\nVideo Transcript\n\n- The S&P 500 surging over 5,000 for the first time largely due to significant increases in a few massive tech names. But our stock market gains set to broaden in 2024. Here with the details is Yahoo Finance's Josh Schafer. We have heard this before. We've heard this question before.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: Yes. Everyone's been talking.\n\n- Are they going to broaden? Do we now.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: --for months, right?\n\n- Yeah.\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: One thing, though, guys that I did bring with us today is a little bit more evidence that shows why we might broaden. Because I think that's one thing that I know. I've gotten into many conversations with strategists about and I'm sure you guys have too is, OK, so we're going to broaden, well, one of my first questions is always, when are we going to see it in earnings? We have to see it in earnings at some point to prove what we probably see in price reaction and Bank of America was out with an interesting note today.\n\nPointing out the difference in Mag Seven earnings expectations versus the other 493 stocks in the S&P 500, and essentially pointing out, you can see here with your purple and blue lines, the purple line is the 493, the non Mag Seven stocks. The light blue line is the Mag Seven stocks. You can see in Q4 right now analyst projections are for the 493 to finally cross the Mag Seven and have higher year-over-year earnings growth.\n\nNow we could probably point to the fact that Mag Seven is going to have tough comps at that point in Q4 as far as your earnings growth goes. But we're seeing that gap really come closer together guys. And I think that's the big takeaway here. And B of A made the point that that might lead to some level of broadening or at least support that to see that. Because remember, we were looking at that one graph with big tech a couple of weeks ago before earnings, and it was just a massive dispersion.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo we're seeing that come away a little bit.\n\n- Yeah. When you talk to strategists, Josh, do they say, OK, well, if this rally is going to continue, it has to broaden?\n\nJOSH SCHAFER: It seems like that at some point. Yes. At some point, strategists argue we would have to see more than basically at this point you could argue. It's for stocks driving us higher. But I think the main thing that most strategists are pointing out is it's probably not going to happen tomorrow and it might not even happen this month, Josh. I think a lot of people are highlighting-- Bank of America specifically highlighting June.\n\nA lot of people are talking that area of time because what do we think we're going to see in May or June? Probably a little bit more certainty around the Fed. That's becoming the consensus call. When we talk about broadening now is we still think it's going to happen, but we need the Fed to get out of the way first. And then we might see that broadening happen.\n\nSo a lot of people do think, if we're going to go significantly higher than where we're at now with 5,000, maybe there is some sort of consolidation. We sell off a little bit. And then you move higher once we get the Fed out of the way, so to speak in a better understanding of where they're headed.\n\n- Out of the way. That's what we're watching for. Thank you, Josh. Appreciate it.",

        "title": "25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 25 largest economies in the world by 2040. To skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to see the 5 Largest Economies in the World by 2040.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook\n\nThe current scenario of the global economy doesn’t give us a clear picture of the near-term economic situation with certainty. The recent major events that led to global economic uncertainty began with the emergence of the COVID-19 pandemic, which was followed by worldwide lockdowns, supply chain distributions, international trade cut-offs, downsizing, and most importantly, a crisis in the global health sector. As we mentioned earlier, the economy seems to be in the recovery stage with global growth expected to remain steady at 3.1% in 2024 and 3.2% in 2025.\n\nAccording to research by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), the world’s fastest years of economic growth have likely already passed. Population growth is weakening, climate change, and increasing geopolitical risks, among other factors will impact the global economy. However, the emerging economies and major economies in Asia are directed to keep catching up to richer countries. According to the IMF'sGDP forecast for 2030, 16 Asian countries will be among the leading economies. China, India, Indonesia, and Japan will be among the top six economies by 2050 along with the US and Germany. As per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) 2075 forecast, China will be the leading economy with India in second place, the US in third place, and Indonesia in fourth. Nigeria and Pakistan will climb up the ranks to fifth and sixth place in 2075, respectively.\n\nThe global economy is forecasted to grow at an average of 2.8% annually between 2024 and 2029 and to gradually decline thereafter, as per The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). This shows a slow economic growth compared to an average growth rate of 3.6% for the 10 years before the global financial crisis and 3.2% in the decade before the COVID-19 pandemic. The reason for slow economic growth is due to the ebbing population growth rate. During the past 50 years, the global population has halved. According to UN projections, the world’s population is expected to increase by almost 2 billion in the next 30 years. This would mean that in 2050 the world’s population will reach 9.7 billion from the current population of 8 billion. The global population could peak at a forecasted 10.4 billion in the mid-2080s. Apart from the population, economists expect weakening productivity to be another key reason for slow GDP growth in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the slow economic growth worldwide, emerging economies will keep on growing more swiftly than developed economies. China is most likely to overtake the US by 2035, becoming the world’s largest economy. China, India, and Indonesia have outperformed Goldman Sachs economists’ forecasts from 2011, while Brazil, Russia, and Latin America have underperformed Goldman Sachs’ projections. According to The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) economists:\n\n“We expect that the weight of global GDP will shift (even) more towards Asia over the next 30 years.”\n\nCorporations: A Key Driver of Economic Growth\n\nCorporations are always a key element in driving the growth of an economy. The US is way ahead of most economies as far as the dominance of corporations is concerned around the world. Leading firms including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are key to the US economic progress. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are bigger than most economies, having a market capitalization of $2.92 trillion and $3.12 trillion, as of February 10.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big player in the tech sector. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported its earnings for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. The company posted earnings per share of $2.18, beating consensus estimates by $0.08 per share. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) made the following comments during its Q1 2024 earnings call:\n\n“We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.”\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global tech firm. On January 30, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced its earnings for the second quarter of fiscal 2024. The company reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million. The company continues to expand its cloud and AI network. Here are some of the comments from the Q2 2024 earnings call:\n\n“It was a record quarter driven by the continued strength of Microsoft Cloud, which surpassed $33 billion in revenue, up 24%. We’ve moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing AI across every layer of our tech stack, we are winning new customers and helping drive new benefits and productivity gains. Now I'll highlight examples of our momentum and progress starting with Azure. Azure again took share this quarter with our AI advantage. Azure offers the top performance for AI training and inference in the most diverse selection of AI accelerators, including the latest from AMD and NVIDIA, as well as our own first-party silicon Azure Maia. And with Azure AI, we provide access to the best selection of foundation and open-source models, including both LLM and SLMs, all integrated deeply with infrastructure, data, and tools on Azure.”\n\nNow, let’s take a look at the largest economies in the world by 2040.  25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040\n\n25 Largest Economies in the World by 2040\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have compiled the largest economies in the world by 2040 based on projections made by The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS). To check the room for subjectivity, we also referred to forecasts made by the IMF and PwC for the biggest economies in the world in 2028 and 2050, respectively. To rank the largest economies in the world by 2040, we used the forecasted real GDP for 2040 from The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc.’s (NYSE:GS) Global Economics Paper The Path to 2075. For the countries with similar forecasted real GDP in 2040, we used Population as a tie-breaker. We collected population data from the United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs Population Division.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Says Steve Jobs Once Called Him Asking For Advice On How To Invest Apple's Cash — Then He Completely Ignored The Advice",
        "content": "Warren Buffett shared a look into a conversation with Steve Jobs about Apple Inc.'s financial strategy during a 2012 appearance on CNBC’s “Squawk Box.”\n\nIn the \"Ask Warren\" segment, Buffett said, “It was an interesting conversation because I hadn’t talked to him in a long time. He said, ‘We’ve got all this cash. What should we do with it?’ So we went over the alternatives. It was kind of interesting.”\n\nThis dialogue between two titans of industry sheds light on the decision-making process at one of the world’s most valuable companies.\n\nJobs, known for his transformative role in making Apple a global technology leader, reached out to Buffett to seek advice on the company’s cash-management strategies. Buffett, a legendary investor and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway Inc., outlined the four primary options available for deploying cash: stock buybacks, dividends, acquisitions or holding onto it.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nFor many first-time buyers, a house is about 3 to 5 times your household annual income – Are you making enough? Are you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy.\n\nDespite Jobs’s acknowledgment that Apple’s stock was undervalued, indicating that buybacks could be a wise choice, he ultimately decided against taking any action, preferring to maintain the company’s cash reserves.\n\n“I went through the logic of each thing. He told me they would not have the chance to make big acquisitions that would require lots of money,\" Buffett said. \"And then I asked him the question, I said, ‘I would use it for buybacks if I thought my stock was undervalued.’ And I said, ‘How do you feel about that?’ The stock was 200-and-something. He said, ‘I think my stock is very undervalued.’ I said, ‘Well, what better to do with your money?’\"\n\nJobs liked having the cash and that was what he ultimately decided was his best option. Buffett added that Jobs interpreted their conversation as Buffett endorsing his decision to hold onto the cash. \"I later learned that he said I agreed with him to do nothing with the cash,\" Buffett said.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: The average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?\n\nThe conversation between Jobs and Buffett highlights a cautious approach to financial management, contrasting sharply with the actions taken by Jobs’s successor Tim Cook. Under Cook’s leadership, Apple has aggressively pursued stock buybacks, spending over $500 billion on them in the last decade. According to Business Insider, this expenditure surpasses the market capitalization of major corporations like Visa Inc., JPMorgan Chase & Co., and ExxonMobil Corp., underscoring the scale of Apple’s commitment to repurchasing its shares.\n\nApple’s buyback strategy has enhanced shareholder value and increased the stake of Berkshire Hathaway in the tech giant without additional investment. Berkshire Hathaway, owning nearly 6% of Apple, has seen its ownership stake grow as a result of these buybacks.\n\nBuffett has publicly supported Apple’s repurchase efforts, noting in his 2021 letter to shareholders the positive impact of the buybacks on both Berkshire’s holdings and Apple’s broader ecosystem.\n\n“Much of what the company retained was used to repurchase Apple shares, an act we applaud,” Buffett wrote. “Tim Cook, Apple’s brilliant CEO, quite properly regards users of Apple products as his first love, but all of his other constituencies benefit from Tim’s managerial touch as well.”\n\nWhile Jobs exhibited a preference for liquidity and financial flexibility, Cook has leveraged Apple’s financial strength to actively manage its capital structure, reinforcing the company’s position as a leader in the technology sector and delivering value to its shareholders and stakeholders alike.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCan you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved?

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 13 best metaverse stocks to buy now. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the metaverse, head directly to 5 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now.\n\nThe global metaverse market was valued at $98.7 billion in 2023, and it is anticipated to grow significantly, reaching $1,402.5 billion by 2032. IMARC Group predicts a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 34.29% during the forecast period of 2024-2032. Factors supporting this growth include advancements in virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), blockchain, and cloud computing. Additionally, increased user interest in immersive digital experiences, online gaming, social media platforms, enhanced internet connectivity, and a growing desire for personalized experiences contribute to the metaverse’s expansion. Tarik Chebib, Capital.com’s chief revenue officer, told Reuters:\n\n“The internet will end as we know it and the metaverse will totally reshape the global economy.”\n\nThe gaming industry, with its widespread use of alternative realities in games like Fortnite and Roblox, is poised to play a pivotal role in the metaverse, according to Tarik Chebib. Given the global user base of 3.2 billion gamers, there is substantial potential demand for the metaverse revolution. Furthermore, the gaming sector contributes valuable software expertise to serve as the foundation for metaverse development. The primary deficiency lies in hardware, as per Chebib, who emphasized the necessity for a streamlined solution that doesn't require users to wear bulky headsets for participation. The gaming sector is expected to be a significant beneficiary of the metaverse's growth, projected to represent around half of the market by 2024, totaling $400 billion. Major players in this domain include Epic Games, Roblox, and Microsoft, which strengthened its position with the acquisition of Activision Blizzard, creators of Call of Duty, for a historic $69 billion. Microsoft's leadership in the industry, particularly with titles like Minecraft, suggests a trend where other companies may follow suit. Chebib further commented:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Video games help us visualize what the metaverse could look like. Gaming companies are really interesting cases as they have already created worlds where people buy skins, avatars and collect different things.”\n\n2022 was expected to be the year of the metaverse, marked by Facebook's transformation to Meta in October 2021, reflecting Mark Zuckerberg’s enthusiasm for the potential of virtual and augmented reality. However, this did not materialize, and in 2023, the metaverse took a backseat to artificial intelligence. However, in 2024, there is potential for a metaverse resurgence in public attention as Apple launched its $3,500 Vision Pro headset, announced midway through 2023. Speculation suggests it could have a transformative impact on the metaverse similar to what the iPhone did for smartphones and the iPad did for portable tablet computing.\n\nSome of the best metaverse stocks to invest in include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe assessed the total holdings of the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSE:METV) and chose the top metaverse stocks based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  13 Best Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\nPhoto by David Dvořáček on Unsplash\n\nBest Metaverse Stocks To Buy Right Now\n\n13. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 78\n\nPayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a technology company facilitating digital payments globally for both merchants and consumers. On February 7, PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $1.48 and a revenue of $8 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.12 and $130 million, respectively. In the fourth quarter of 2023, the number of payment transactions rose by 13%, reaching 6.8 billion, while the total payment transactions for the fiscal year 2023 increased by 12% to 25 billion. Despite that, active accounts decreased 2% year-over-year, amounting to 426 million.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 78 hedge funds were bullish on PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Gavin Baker’s Atreides Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 4.17 million shares worth $244 million.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) also contributed less to portfolio performance than most holdings during the fourth quarter. The total payment volume handled by PayPal during its most recent quarter grew +15%, which helped drive healthy revenue growth and +20% earnings per share growth. Critically, the Company’s new management team has significant opportunity to drive more revenue and earnings growth across the massive, multi-trillion-dollar payments addressable market. PayPal’s rapidly growing payment processing brand, Braintree, represents one of those revenue growth opportunities, either by raising prices, as the Company had previously used a low-price strategy to establish a beachhead in this market, or by adding value-added services. PayPal’s branded checkout remains the largest volume and profit driver for the business, and we expect this to continue to track in-line with e-commerce growth in the near term, and eventually take share as the Company rolls out new features to its over +400 million users and +30 million merchants. We added to our position with the stock trading at just 10X forward earnings estimates during the quarter because there are many more long-term growth opportunities relative to most financial companies that trade for similar multiples and compared to technology companies that trade for much higher multiples.”\n\n12. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and supply of semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. On December 7, Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $11.06 and a revenue of $9.3 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.10 and $20 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 87 hedge funds were long Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), compared to 72 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.70 billion.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”\n\n11. The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 89\n\nThe Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) is a global entertainment company with three segments – Entertainment, Sports, and Experiences. On February 8, The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) declared a $0.45 per share semi-annual dividend, a 50% increase from the prior dividend of $0.30. The dividend is payable on July 25, to shareholders of record as of July 8.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 89 hedge funds were bullish on The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), compared to 92 funds in the preceding quarter. Nelson Peltz’s Trian Partners is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 32.8 million shares worth $2.66 billion.\n\nMadison Sustainable Equity Fund made the following comment about The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“During the quarter, we sold our positions in Bristol-Myers Squibb and The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS).  The Walt Disney Company is facing a difficult and uncertain transition in its core media business assets including the ESPN business and other linear media assets. These media assets are cash generative but face secular decline as consumers are cutting their expensive cable subscriptions and moving to alternative streaming options. This has resulted in a decline in operating profits for the media division. The media business has long-term fixed costs related to its sports broadcasting agreement with multiple sports leagues which will further pressure profits during this transition.”\n\n10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is engaged in the manufacturing, packaging, testing, and sale of integrated circuits and semiconductor devices globally. It is one of the top metaverse stocks to watch. On February 7, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) reported a revenue of approximately NT$215.79 billion for January, showing a 7.9% increase from January 2023 and a 22.4% rise from December. TSMC also recently announced plans to construct a second chip fabrication facility in Japan in collaboration with Sony, Denso, Toyota, and the Japanese government.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 107 hedge funds were bullish on Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), compared to 121 funds in the last quarter. Jean-Marie Eveillard’s First Eagle Investment Management is a significant position holder in the company, with a stake worth $780.3 million.\n\nWedgewood Partners stated the following regarding Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) was also a top contributor to performance. The Company began shipping chips that were fabricated using its industry-leading “N3″ node. Nearly all of the Company’s N3 capacity has been filled by high-end chip designers such as Apple, NVIDIA and even Intel. As high-performance computing, particularly related to AI in both data centers and edge devices, continues to build momentum, the Company will be a key supplier for many years to come. Despite the boom-and-bust cycle in demand seen for many semiconductors during Covid-19 and post-Covid-19, the Company should be able to post solid double-digit growth next year as inventories and end-market demand across most of its technology nodes get back to normal levels. The Company also maintains dominant market share in leading-edge nodes, which is in short supply, given the difficulties its competitors have had in scaling up EUV-based manufacturing. The Company has been able to secure higher prices because of this and can still generate excellent returns on elevated capital expenditures necessary for this scarce capacity. The Company is arguably one of a handful of the world’s most important and largest companies, but because the Company’s shares trade as an ADR (American Depositary Receipt) the shares are not part of the major stock market indices in the U.S. As a result, the shares are woefully under owned by U.S. investors (institutional and individual), particularly for a company that regularly generates cash flow return on invested capital in excess of +40%. Therefore, our growing position in these shares represent a significantly relatively overweight portfolio position versus our peers and benchmarks. We could not be more pleased by this anachronistic institutional imperative.”\n\n9. Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAlibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) offers technology infrastructure and marketing services to enable engagement between merchants, brands, and businesses with users and customers worldwide. It is one of the best metaverse stocks to buy. On February 7, Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) reported a Q3 non-GAAP EPADS of $2.67 and a revenue of $36.67 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.03 and $270 million, respectively. Alibaba announced that its board has authorized a $25 billion expansion of its stock buyback program until the end of March 2027. The company now has $35.3 billion remaining for share repurchases over the next three fiscal years.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were bullish on Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA), compared to 112 funds in the preceding quarter.\n\nL1 Long Short Fund made the following comment about Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) in its second quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alibaba Group Holding Limited (NYSE:BABA) (Long -18%) shares weakened in recent months as Chinese reopening strength faded and macro-economic data points began sequentially declining. Nevertheless, we believe the Chinese government will use consumption as a key lever to reinvigorate the economy post-COVID lockdowns. Alibaba remains a high-quality business with leading positions in both eCommerce and Public Cloud, and management is taking proactive steps to unlock shareholder value. It has announced plans to split into six major business groups – Cloud Intelligence, Taobao Tmall, Local Services, Global Digital, Cainiao Smart Logistics and Digital Media, and Entertainment Group. Each group will be managed independently, with a separate CEO and board, have the flexibility to raise external capital and potentially pursue separate IPOs. We believe this restructure will be a strong positive catalyst to unlock the sum-of-the-parts valuation upside in the company.”\n\n8. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. The company provides x86 microprocessors, graphics processing units, and other related products and services. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the best metaverse stocks to monitor.\n\nOn February 1, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) increased its guidance for artificial intelligence-related revenue, projecting $3.5 billion in sales for the current year, up from the previous estimate of $2 billion. Citi analyst Christopher Danely suggested that AMD might be intentionally underestimating the revenue and there are indications that the actual figures could exceed the projections. Danely estimates that AMD might generate $5 billion this year and $8 billion next year from the MI300, a product associated with artificial intelligence.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 110 hedge funds were long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), compared to 112 funds in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with 12.4 million shares worth $1.28 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n7. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) ranks 7th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. On December 18, Adobe and Figma jointly announced the cancellation of their $20 billion merger due to increasing regulatory challenges globally. The companies stated that they see no clear path to obtaining necessary approvals from the European Commission and the UK Competition and Markets Authority. In light of the terminated deal, Adobe will pay Figma the agreed-upon $1 billion termination fee. Following this development, Barclays upgraded Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock to Overweight, citing reduced concerns over dilution.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has shown an increased commitment to the metaverse with the recent announcement of its first mixed-reality headset, the Apple Vision Pro. The headset provides users with virtual and augmented reality experiences, offering a gateway to a version of the metaverse. It features Apple's metaverse-style operating system, VisionOS, emphasizing spatial computing. The launch signals Apple's strategic move into the extended reality (XR) landscape. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the best metaverse stocks to watch.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were long Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the last quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the leading stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares valued at $156.75 billion.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on our list of the best metaverse stocks to invest in.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026.

        "content": "Wall Street firms are taking picks on which tech giants will come out on top of the artificial intelligence landscape. Jefferies analysts foresee Meta Platforms (META) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) to dominate in consumer AI offerings, while Evercore ISI expects Apple (AAPL) and its devices to benefit the most from large language models.\n\nYahoo Finance Live discusses where these companies will see the biggest opportunities from AI integration and when it will become most apparent in earnings figures.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nBRAD SMITH: While artificial intelligence remains the talk of the town in 2024 after the boom in '23. As more companies expand AI investments, Wall Street is weighing in on who stands to benefit from the AI liftoff.\n\nJefferies shouting out Meta and Alphabet as best positioned to win the consumer AI opportunity. While Evercore ISI names Apple as an underappreciated artificial intelligence beneficiary here. Just a larger question of what artificial intelligence and generative AI consumers will flock into and who within, not just the software space, but also the hardware space, where it's extremely difficult to get that right out of the gate, where the early adopters will perhaps have a thought process or, at least, some type of praise that permeates even further into the condom-- the common consumer that's out there as well.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. Because when you think of perhaps adding generative AI on as something to add on that you don't already have versus the note that we saw from Evercore ISI analyst, Amit Daryanani, saying that the company isn't underappreciated AI beneficiary, but then really ties it to Siri. So something that you have-- millions of people who already have those phones in their pockets already use Siri. So really, a natural evolution there versus having to add ChatGPT onto something else that you're perhaps not familiar with.\n\nStory continues\n\nBRAD SMITH: Right. They said that. And in this Jefferies note, it was interesting, 89% of full-time office workers in the US have heard of ChatGPT. That's up from 52% in February of 2023. Now, the increased usage of AI tools-- they're also mentioning there that in tandem, it brings fear of AI job automation.\n\nWhat we've had a discussion about time and time again, whenever there is a job's day, and we're talking about when AI is going to show up in the productivity numbers, when generative AI is going to show up as a broader impact to the employment situation.\n\nWe're still a ways off from it, having a huge impact on either of those fronts. But it is a larger question of how many corporations are already starting to plan out, what resources look like, what spends on technology versus human resources also looks like to facilitate and unlock, perhaps, that next leg of productivity, and how many of us are working in tandem with some of that generative AI to complete menial tasks at the end of the day too.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: It's true. Because even though clearly a lot more people have heard of it in terms of how they use it in their work. I think a lot of people are still trying to figure that out, because it's one thing to have it sitting there, and then you're really not sure if it's something that you can use if you have permission to use it, how much of it you can use, the ethics around it.\n\nSo I think perhaps if there was a bit more clarity in how people could use it, and even how useful they find it, because usually, it's creatives or it's for some of these menial tasks. But if it's like mid-journey, something else, something creative-- but then when it comes to your everyday working life, where those guidelines are still not clear.\n\nBRAD SMITH: I think in marketing automation tools, it's one area. Easily, it could have a big impact. You think about all the different marketing automation campaigns. And I'm thinking of how this could impact a company in Oracle even and some of the subsidiaries that they have, or even in Salesforce, where as they had their AI Day last year, and we're talking about how it can help sales teams more efficiently craft an email that could be ready to go out.\n\nSo what type of jobs does that impact? How much quicker? Does it allow you to have that touch point and bring back in different points of contact that you've had with the customer?\n\nSo there's a bevy of different ways to think about how it could be implemented.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: Indeed. Still figuring all of that out, of course.",

        "title": "Meta's New Strategy Resembles Apple",
        "content": "After disappointing investors in 2022, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) delivered stellar returns in 2023 alongside the recovery of tech stocks. The company started 2024 on the right foot as well, handsomely beating Wall Street expectations for both earnings and revenue for the fourth quarter. Meta seems to be following in the footsteps of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), which is evident from its newfound interest in rewarding shareholders handsomely, not just with buybacks, but also with dividends. In a surprise move, the company announced a quarterly dividend of 50 cents per share, initiating a dividend program against all odds. The company also boosted its stock repurchase authorization by $50 billion to complement the dividend. Stellar fourth-quarter earnings coupled with the company's announcement of its first-ever dividend sent the stock 20% higher following the earnings report last week.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META.\n\nA closer evaluation of Meta's prospects reveals it is well-positioned to grow from here and is still reasonably valued despite a meaningful expansion in valuation multiples in the last 12 months.\n\nMargin expansion is a major bright spot\n\nFrom a high of 41% in 2019, Meta's operating margin reached a trough of 28.80% in 2022 with the company's aggressive investments in the metaverse failing to deliver the desired returns. Deteriorating operating margins forced the social media giant to take bold steps to improve its profitability in 2023, starting with the launch of a new campaign named Year of Efficiency. The company's operating margin ballooned to 36.30% in 2023 with it benefiting from several positive changes it implemented over the last 12 months. This is a positive sign as Meta is now moving forward as a more agile, leaner company that is capable of aggressively investing in artificial intelligence.\n\nMeta was among the many tech companies to focus on a lean business structure in 2023. The company ended the year with 67,317 employees compared to a total headcount of 86,482 in 2022. Despite a notable reduction in headcount, it performed exceptionally well across all of its business segments, including 16% year-over-year growth in revenue, 8% growth in family daily active people and a 28% increase in ad impressions. Meta's aggressive layoffs in the last 15 months have helped its operating performance, which is evident from the meaningful margin improvement reported for 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic investments to drive growth\n\nMeta's mass layoffs should not cloud the judgment of investors when it comes to evaluating its long-term prospects. Despite a focus on efficiency gains, the company has not lost its focus on strategic investments to ensure long-term growth.\n\nDuring the fourth-quarter earnings call, the company highlighted its commitment to deploying approximately 350,000 H100 chips to develop world-class computing infrastructure to penetrate the opportunities in the AI space. The massive computing power of the company will be used to improve Reels and develop AI capabilities to support the growth of Reels across Facebook and Instagram.\n\nThe company is also investing in custom silicon for specialized workloads to further accelerate the company's expansion as an AI-first social media giant. Last May, the company unveiled MTIA, Meta's first-generation AI inference accelerator, to handle content understanding, feeds and ads ranking more effectively.\n\nMeta's investments in AI will enable it to develop and deploy advanced AI services on its platforms in the future, potentially dealing a massive blow to its rivals who are still at the infant stages when it comes to deploying AI to improve ad performance and user retention.\n\nThe company is taking a long-term approach to AI development, spending millions of dollars every quarter on developing Llama models 5,6 and 7 to emerge as a leader in the generative AI space. These AI investments will directly impact revenue in several ways going forward.\n\nFirst, Meta is using AI to enhance its advertising platform. %he company has already launched Advantage+, a portfolio of solutions aimed at improving the return on investment of advertisers. This product suite allows advertisers to automate parts of the campaign creation process, including audience targeting, likely leading to efficiency gains. The company has also introduced text variation and image expansion features using generative AI to help marketers create high-quality advertisements to reach a global audience.\n\nSecond, Meta is leveraging AI to improve business messaging capabilities on WhatsApp Business. The company is testing AI-driven business support in chat to help business owners seamlessly conduct business through WhatsApp. According to management, click-to-message ads are continuing to grow and the potential integration of AI into business messaging should boost the revenue from this ad segment in the future.\n\nThird, Meta continues to heavily invest in Reality Labs, including investments in augmented rality and virtual reality product development, which should create new revenue streams in the long run. The company's VR headset, Oculus, is already bringing in revenue, but is still at an infant stage when it comes to unlocking the true potential of the mixed-reality headset space. With additional investments in AI supporting the introduction of groundbreaking features, Meta may emerge as a global leader in the AR/VR product space in the long run.\n\nOverall, Meta's strategic investments in AI should help its growth in the coming years.\n\nMeta has taken a leaf out of Apple's playbook\n\nJust over five years ago, Apple decided to pursue a net cash neutral goal when it started generating more than enough cash from operations to support investments and debt repayments. To achieve this objective, the company aggressively repurchased stock and paid dividends, rewarding long-term shareholders. For context, Apple spent an average of $37 billion per year on share repurchases between 2013 and 2018, but since then, it has spent $82 billion on stock buybacks per annum. Unlike Apple, Meta Platforms still enjoys a long runway for growth and the company is investing to expand. However, Meta also generates substantial operating cash flows ($71 billion in 2023) and the company only carries $18 billion in long-term debt. This strong financial position allows it to distribute wealth to shareholders, which is exactly what the company is doing today.\n\nApple's net income has grown at a compound annual rate of 10.25% between 2018 and 2023, but earnings per share grew at an annualized rate of 15.51% over the same period, aided by substantial buybacks that reduced the share count. Meta, on the other hand, is well-positioned to see strong net income growth, so aggressive buybacks will multiply earnings per share growth in the next few years. Strong earnings growth should support premium valuations.\n\nMeta, at a forward price-earnings ratio of 23.92, is expensively valued compared to its five-year average of 22.23. This premium valuation, however, seems justifiable given the company is in better shape than ever to grow profitably, aided by its continued dominance in the social media space and the narrowing losses of the Reality Labs division. Meta's buybacks will also play a major role in boosting earnings growth, thereby allowing the company to trade at higher stock prices without a further expansion in earnings multiples.\n\nInvestors will have to monitor a few key risks, including the company's exposure to China (approximately 10% of revenue in fourth-quarter 2023) and the regulatory challenges in North America and Europe.\n\nTakeaway\n\nMeta Platforms stock, even on the back of a 146% gain in the last 12 months, looks reasonably priced at a time when it is enjoying a noteworthy expansion in profit margins, which allows it to invest in its future while rewarding shareholders with dividends and buybacks. Some volatility is expected in the coming months if macroeconomic conditions in China threaten Meta's short-term profits, but in the long term, the company should thrive even if its China business faces a permanent decline.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "title": "Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported first-quarter 2024 results on Feb. 1. According to the press release, the company posted revenue of $119.6 billion, up 2% year over year, and earnings of $2.18 per share, up 16%. The company highlighted that its services revenue reached a new all-time record and earnings reached a new all-time high as well. The installed base of Apple's active devices surpassed 2.2 billion, reaching an all-time high across all product and geographic segments. Overall, first-quarter earnings were in line with expectations. However, the stock was down a little bit the next day.\n\nRevenue by sales category\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain\n\nThe company's services revenue grew 11.3% year over year. This is encouraging because it shows the growing power of Apple's iOS ecosystem. On the hardware side, both iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories saw sales decline during the quarter. IPad sales declined 25.3%. CEO Tim Cook's explanation for this year-over-year decline during the earnings call was a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue declined 11.3%. Again, the decline was also due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Macbook sales were up 1% year over year. Cook remarked that this increase was driven by the strength of Apple's latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales.\n\nApple's most important business is obviously the iPhone, which accounted for 58.3% of revenue for the quarter. IPhone revenue grew 6% year over year, which was slower than the overall growth of the global smartphone market but faster than its biggest competitor Samsung (XKRX:005930).\n\nAccording to preliminary data from the International Data Corp. Worldwide Quarterly Mobile Phone Tracker, global smartphone shipments declined 3.2% year over year to 1.17 billion units in 2023. The fourth quarter (4Q23) saw 8.5% year-over-year growth and 326.1 million shipments, higher than the forecast of 7.3% growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe iPhone's market share reached an all-time high and Apple surpassed Samsung to become the top player for the first time. Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain\n\nTrouble in China\n\nThe iPhone obviously had a great quarter, but there is one big ominous sign Apple's revenue in China declined by double digits during the quarter. Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain\n\nDuring the earnings call, the weaker performance in China was asked about a few times by various Wall Street analysts. Cook sounded optimistic about China in the long term, but it is almost guaranteed the iPhone will lose market share in China going forward because Huawei is back.\n\nHuawei's smartphone business was basically decimated after the U.S. sanctioned Huawai in 2019. According to Counterpoint Research Global Smartphone Tracker and Forecast, the company's market share declined from more than 30% to less than 6% in 2022. Huawei's Gain Is Apple's Pain\n\nWhen the U.S. sanctioned Huawei, it looked like it was game over as the company could not get the high-end chips it needed to produce its smartphones. However, after more than four years of sanctions, Huawei miraculously came back and announced its high-end 5G Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro smartphones at the end of August. The two devices immediately became best-sellers in China after launch. This had an immediate impact on the iPhone's market share in China.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint's latest report on the Chinese market, Huawei's \"shipments soared 41% year over year in the third quarter of 2023 as its newly launched Mate 60 series with Kirin SoC gained momentum immediately after the launch. Apple also experienced a slight year over year uptick in shipments driven by the newly launched iPhone 15 series, but the initial supply constraints impacted its overall performance. For the fourth quarter of 2023, Apple's iPhone shipments in China dropped 2%, while Huawei's shipments increased by 36.20%.\n\nClearly, Huawei is taking market share from Apple in China since the launch of Mate 60 and Mate 60 Pro. The challenge for Apple with Huawei's comeback is at least twofold. First of all, Huawei is very likely to continue to take market share from Apple in China in the foreseeable future. Second, Huawei might be able to take market share from Apple outside of China if its momentum can expand overseas. With Huawei's track record, I would not bet on Apple to maintain its worldwide market share going forward. If Apple cannot maintain its worldwide market share, then obviously Apple's fundamentals are likely to be impacted.\n\nSummary\n\nApple's overall first-quarter earnings were very satisfactory. However, its business declined in China, which is its third-largest geographic market, mostly due to Huawei's launch of new high-end products. If Huawei is successful in its future product launches, Apple's China and global businesses may be adversely impacted. Investors should keep an eye on Huawei.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "In the dynamic stock market realm, tech stocks to buy have consistently been the beacon leading the charge for all-time highs, underpinning the sector’s long-term growth potential. Despite the unsettling layoffs, this period harbors a silver lining for discerning investors. Historically, tech sector downturns have unveiled lucrative long-term buying opportunities, a trend likely to spill over into 2024. Layoffs, while often viewed through a grim lens, can efficiently catalyze a company’s evolution towards streamlined operations, heightened efficiencies, and a clear focus. For tech entities, this process is not just about slashing costs but enhancing value-added and per-capita effectiveness, setting the stage for sustainable success. Amidst this backdrop, certain tech stocks emerge as compelling investments, promising revitalized frameworks and potentially elevated valuations in the wake of downsizing.\n\nTech Stocks To Buy: Apple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nRelative % Below (52-Week High): 18.3%\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) recent journey through turbulent times, marked by dropping iPhone sales within the key Chinese market, has cast a shadow over its ubiquitous dominance. The fourth-quarter results showed a 13% dip in iPhone sales across China, exacerbating concerns among investors and stakeholders. Yet, it’s imperative to recognize that this setback is part of a broader narrative that doesn’t undermine Apple’s inherent value and many opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn dissecting Apple’s situation, it’s critical to acknowledge the resilience and adaptability that has become synonymous with its brand. Despite the slowdown in hardware sales, Apple’s services segment has emerged as a powerful counterbalance, demonstrating stellar growth and compensating for any perceived shortcomings in device sales. Furthermore, Apple’s capacity to exceed Wall Street’s top and bottom-line expectations amidst these challenges underscores its operational ability and market understanding. Furthermore, the introduction of Apple Vision Pro, hailed by Wedbush Securities analyst Daniel Ives as a potential “game-changer,” is poised to invigorate Apple’s product lineup. With an anticipated sale of 600,000 units in 2024, Apple Vision Pro is a testament to Apple’s innovative spirit.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta and Nvidia are part of Zacks Earnings Preview",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 12, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT, Meta META and Nvidia NVDA.\n\n5 Standout Features of Q4 Earnings Season\n\nThe overall picture that has emerged from the Q4 earnings season is one of stability and resilience as a whole, with key pockets starting to enjoy notable acceleration regarding growth momentum.\n\nEarnings aren’t great, but then again, no one expected corporate profitability to be great. The earnings naysayers have been relatively less vocal in their doom-and-gloom pronouncements lately. But the fear of an impending earnings cliff has been in the back of market participants’ minds. These results have likely eased many of those fears.\n\nWith quarterly results from about two-thirds of S&P 500 members already out through Friday, February 9th, here are the five key features these quarterly results have confirmed.\n\nFirst, the Q4 earnings and revenue growth pace represents an acceleration from what we have been seeing in recent quarters.\n\nThe absolute level of Q4 earnings and revenue growth isn’t much, and the improving trend may not seem like a big deal to some of you. But we nevertheless see this improving growth trend as significant and a sign of the things to come in the coming periods.\n\nFor the 338 S&P 500 members that have reported results through Friday, February 9th, total earnings and revenues are up +5.5% and +3.7% from the same period last year, respectively. Concerning the beats percentages, 80.5% of the companies have beaten EPS estimates, and 65% have beaten revenue estimates.\n\nSecond, companies are making good progress on the margins front.\n\nThe year-over-year change in net margins turned positive in 2023 Q3 after staying in negative territory for six consecutive quarters. This margins recovery is a key driver of earnings growth in the coming periods.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the sector level, Q4 net margins are above the year level for 9 of the 16 sectors, with the biggest gains at Tech, Consumer Discretionary, Retail, Industrial Products, Utilities, Finance and others.\n\nOn the negative side, Q4 margins are below the year-earlier level for 7 of the 16 Zacks sectors, with the biggest declines at the Medical, Autos, Energy and Transportation sectors.\n\nThird, the Tech sector is firmly back in the growth mode now, and the trend is expected to continue going forward.\n\nFor the 64.5% of Tech companies in the S&P 500 index that have reported Q4 results already, total earnings are up +21.5% on +6.4% higher revenues, with 86% beating EPS estimates and 72% beating revenue estimates.\n\nLooking at Q4 results for the sector as a whole, combining the results that have come out with estimates for the still-to-come companies, total Tech sector earnings are on track to be up +25.4% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe sector went through a period of post-Covid adjustment in 2022 and the first half of 2023 when it became a drag on the aggregate growth picture.\n\nPlease remember that Tech isn’t just any other sector, as it’s the biggest earnings contributor to the S&P 500 index. The sector is currently expected to bring in 28.5% of the index’s total earnings over the coming four-quarter period, with the second and third biggest contributors in Finance and Medical at 17.7% and 12.5%, respectively.\n\nWhat this means is that the Tech sector’s growth profile has a significant impact on the aggregate picture, both negative as well as positive. The Tech sector dragged down the aggregate growth picture in 2022 and the first half of 2023, now appearing ready to resume its historical positive growth role.\n\nPlease note that the Tech sector is instrumental in keeping the aggregate growth picture in positive territory in Q4. Of the reported results, the +5.5% earnings growth drops to a decline of -0.7% when Technology is excluded from the results.\n\nFourth, related to the Tech sector’s strong showing is the dominance of the so-called Magnificent 7 companies – Apple, Amazon, Google parent Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia and Tesla.\n\nEach of the Mag 7 companies relies on technological innovation to dominate its respective space. But strictly speaking, not all of them are in the Tech sector, as we at Zacks have Amazon as part of the Zacks Retail sector and Tesla as part of the Zacks Auto sector.\n\nNvidia will report its Q4 results on February 21st, but the rest of the Mag 7 members have already reported results. For Q4 as a whole for the group, combining the actuals that have come out for the six group members with estimates for Nvidia, total Mag 7 earnings are expected to be up +48.7% on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nThe Mag 7 companies are expected to bring in 20% of all S&P 500 earnings in 2024 and currently account for 29.5% of the index’s total market capitalization.\n\nPlease note that S&P 500 earnings growth for Q4 would be in negative territory had it not been for the heavy lifting from Mag 7: -3% vs. +5.4%.\n\nFive, the revisions trend has notably stabilized after appearing to turn substantially negative at the start of 2023 Q4.\n\nEstimates for 2024 Q1 and full-year 2024 are modestly coming down, with negative revisions from some sectors mostly getting offset by positive revisions from others.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Sector Back in Growth Mode\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nZacks.com provides investment resources and informs you of these resources, which you may choose to use in making your own investment decisions.

        "title": "1 FAANG Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "It's been a wild four years for Wall Street and investors. Since the green flag waved in January 2020, the three major stock indexes -- the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite -- have teetered back and forth between bear and bull markets in successive years. It's a solid reminder of just how unpredictable the stock market can be over short time frames.\n\nWhen volatility picks up is precisely when investors usually seek out the safety of time-tested, industry-leading outperformers. In other words, it's precisely why the FAANG stocks have crushed the broader market over the trailing decade. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe FAANG stocks bring well-defined competitive advantages to the table\n\nWhen I say \"FAANG stocks,\" I'm talking about:\n\nFacebook, which is now a subsidiary of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) Google, which is now a subsidiary of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG)\n\nWhat these five companies offer investors is seemingly insurmountable competitive advantages.\n\nMeta Platforms is the parent behind the world's top social media assets. Collectively, Facebook, WhatsApp, Instagram, and Facebook Messenger are four of the most downloaded apps globally and were responsible for luring nearly 4 billion monthly active users during the December-ended quarter. Apple has been a dominant domestic player in the smartphone arena since introducing the iPhone. It's also in the process of transforming itself into a services-focused company. The icing on the cake is that Apple's share repurchase program is unrivaled -- over $600 billion worth of buybacks since initiating a repurchase program in 2013. Amazon's e-commerce marketplace brought in nearly $0.40 of every $1 in U.S. online retail sales in 2022, according to an estimate from Insider Intelligence. Further, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's leading provider of cloud infrastructure services, with an estimated 31% share, per tech-analysis firm Canalys. Netflix is the domestic and international streaming share leader. Additionally, no streaming service has come remotely close to its expansive library of original content. Alphabet's Google was responsible for 91.5% of global internet search share in January. It's also the parent of streaming service YouTube, the second-most-visited social site behind Facebook; and Google Cloud, the No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider worldwide by market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these well-defined competitive edges, the outlook for each FAANG stock differs greatly. In February, one historically inexpensive FAANG stock stands head and shoulders above its peers as a phenomenal buy, while another highflier is set to face a mountain of potential headwinds.\n\nThe FAANG stock to buy hand over fist in February: Alphabet\n\nOut of the five longtime outperformers listed above, it's Google, YouTube, Google Cloud, and Waymo parent Alphabet that stands out as the smartest buy in the shortest month of the year.\n\nTo be fair, even the best stocks that look like no-brainer buys face potential headwinds. For Alphabet, the biggest concern is the likelihood that the U.S. will fall into a recession at some point this year. The Federal Reserve Bank of New York's leading recession probability indicator, along with an assortment of money-based metrics, suggest that a downturn is likely. Since Alphabet generates a majority of its revenue from advertising, the expectation would be for a slowdown in its growth and profits if a recession materializes.\n\nHowever, there are two sides to this coin -- and it most definitely favors investors who are patient. Even though recessions are a normal, inevitable part of the economic cycle, only three of the 12 downturns that have occurred since the end of World War II lasted 12 months. By comparison, almost every economic expansion since September 1945 has endured for multiple years. Ad-driven businesses with sustainable competitive advantages are perfectly positioned to thrive over long periods.\n\nGoogle's absolutely dominant position as the world's leading search engine isn't going to change anytime soon. It's been almost nine years since Google last held less than a 90% monthly share of worldwide search, based on data from GlobalStats. This suggests it'll have little issue maintaining exceptional pricing power and increasing its operating cash flow over time.\n\nBut most investors (including myself) are more excited about what Alphabet's ancillary operating segments have to offer. For instance, daily views of YouTube Shorts (short-form videos typically lasting less than a minute) have grown by more than a factor of eight since 2021. This should help YouTube's ad-pricing power and encourage users to sign up for high-margin subscriptions.\n\nPerhaps even more exciting is Alphabet's rapidly growing cloud segment. Following years of operating losses, Google Cloud delivered four consecutive quarters of operating profit in 2023. Not only is enterprise cloud spending still in its early innings, but the margins associated with cloud services are usually considerably higher than those associated with advertising. As Google Cloud grows into a larger share of net sales, expect Alphabet's operating cash flow to expand even faster.\n\nLastly, Alphabet is cheap. Its forward-year earnings multiple of 19 is lower than the benchmark S&P 500, while its multiple of 13.4x consensus cash flow in 2025 is roughly 26% below its average cash-flow multiple over the trailing five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe FAANG stock worth avoiding in February: Netflix\n\nAlthough the FAANG stocks have been virtually unstoppable for more than a decade, not all five components are worth buying. In February, the highflier worth avoiding is none other than streaming service Netflix.\n\nJust as Alphabet has headwinds as a stock to buy, Netflix has possible catalysts as a stock I'd suggest avoiding. The single biggest driver for Netflix is that its vast content library affords it substantial subscription pricing power. Historically, Netflix has lost very few customers when it's raised its monthly subscription prices. It also doesn't hurt that the company is offering more streaming options than ever, including the addition of an ad-supported tier.\n\nAdditionally, Netflix's cash flow needle is moving in the right direction. Netflix generated $6.9 billion in free cash flow (FCF) last year, more than quadrupling the $1.6 billion in FCF from 2022. Significant growth in cash flow has allowed Netflix to aggressively repurchase its stock -- 5.5 million shares bought back during the fourth quarter for roughly $2.5 billion. A reduced outstanding share count for steadily profitable companies can provide a lift to earnings per share (EPS).\n\nUnfortunately, it's not all good news for Netflix.\n\nThe obvious issue is that competition for streaming services has been heating up. Walt Disney, Paramount Global, and Warner Bros. Discovery have all quickly grown their respective subscriber bases. These are brand-name media companies that have traditionally had profitable legacy TV segments. In other words, they have plenty of capital to endure temporary losses as they build out their streaming segments.\n\nHowever, streaming losses for Netflix's competitors may not continue much longer. Disney anticipates its streaming segment will turn the corner to recurring profitability by the end of its current fiscal year (i.e., by the end of September 2024). Meanwhile, Paramount and Warner Bros. Discovery should see notably smaller losses from streaming in the new year as advertising revenue perks up, cost-cutting takes shape, and subscription prices increase.\n\nAnother reason to cast doubt on Netflix is the company's decision to approve a sizable $10 billion share repurchase program in October. Though buybacks are shareholder-friendly, large repurchase programs are typically reserved for mature businesses or those running out of innovative ideas. An acceleration of buybacks could signal that Netflix is struggling to find new and innovative ways to move the needle, which would be particularly worrisome given its valuation.\n\nLastly, there's the company's premium valuation.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "If you want to earn strong returns in the stock market, it can be advantageous to see what the best investors are buying. Warren Buffett certainly falls within that esteemed group. The Oracle of Omaha has generated fortune-building gains for Berkshire Hathaway's shareholders for nearly 60 years by investing in high-quality businesses with attractive long-term growth prospects.\n\nHere are two of Buffett's favorite stocks in Berkshire's $373 billion investment portfolio.\n\n1. Occidental Petroleum\n\nBuffett has been buying shares of Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY) aggressively over the past year. It's easy to see why. The oil and gas producer owns some of the most valuable acreage in the shale-rich Permian Basin. It's also a leader in the potentially multitrillion-dollar market for decarbonization solutions.\n\nBerkshire first invested in Occidental in 2019 as a part of a deal to help finance the latter's acquisition of Anadarko Petroleum. Buffett's investment conglomerate has purchased shares on multiple occasions since then. Berkshire now owns roughly 28% of Occidental's shares, currently valued at more than $14 billion, along with preferred shares and warrants that could allow it to boost its stake in the oil driller.\n\nBuffett is no doubt attracted to Occidental's prized assets in the Permian Basin. The company's operations in the oil- and gas-rich region, which spans from West Texas to southeast New Mexico, are well situated to supply the U.S. and international markets with dependable and cost-effective energy.\n\nCEO Vicki Hollub has also positioned Occidental to be a leader in the promising area of carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). The forward-thinking executive wants to help build a global network of direct air capture (DAC) facilities. DAC technology, which can remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, is expected to play a key role in enabling governments and businesses to achieve their net-zero emissions goals.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll told, carbon capture services could become a $4 trillion market by 2050, according to ExxonMobil. Occidental, in turn, believes that its carbon management operations could eventually eclipse its traditional oil and gas businesses.\n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Occidental, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is well-positioned to benefit from the long-term growth of massive global markets. With artificial intelligence (AI) set to boost the functionality of its popular devices, the tech titan's profits are poised to climb from their already stratospheric levels.\n\nBuffett is clearly a fan. Berkshire Hathaway owns roughly $170 billion worth of Apple stock -- more than five times as much as its second-largest position.\n\nBuffett appreciates Apple's fortress-like balance sheet and staggering profitability. With cash and investments of more than $170 billion as of Dec. 30, 2023, and net income of over $100 billion during the trailing 12 months, the iPhone maker displays an unparalleled level of financial fortitude.\n\nBuffett also understands the value of Apple's brand. People trust that -- unlike many other high-tech products -- Apple's devices simply work and are intuitive to use. And once someone buys one of the tech specialist's phones or computers, they tend to remain a loyal customer. These factors give the company a level of pricing power that its rivals do not possess, which helps Apple earn higher profit margins.\n\nMoreover, with over 2.2 billion devices in use worldwide, Apple has a huge base of customers who are eager to buy its latest products and services. That allows the company to enter new markets and quickly win sales despite charging premium prices. Investors are likely to see this trend play out once again with the tech giant's recent entrance into the augmented reality headset market following the launch of its innovative Apple Vision Pro device.\n\nApple could also be on the verge of an enormous iPhone upgrade cycle. In September, analysts at Morgan Stanley noted that after more consumers chose to wait longer to buy a new phone in 2023, the average iPhone replacement period stood at an all-time high of 4.4 years. With many of these phones nearing the end of their useful lives, there could be enormous pent-up demand for the iPhone 16 due out later this year.\n\nAdditionally, in January, Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan posited that forthcoming AI-powered features will boost iPhone sales in the coming years. Mohan expects the rising popularity of generative AI applications to drive demand for AI-enabled devices in 2024 and 2025, which should also help to support higher services revenue for Apple.\n\nWith these powerful growth drivers set to propel the tech leader's profit growth, Apple's stock is a solid buy today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nConventional thinking suggests that artificial intelligence is driving major disruption at large publicly traded companies.\n\nAnd you wouldn't be wrong in buying into that prevailing thought.\n\nWhy else does Nvidia's (NVDA) stock price refuse to go lower for any long stretch? The company's leading-edge generative AI chips are extremely in demand by deep-pocketed companies doing the global disruption.\n\nWhy are layoffs sweeping through Big Tech companies such as Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Amazon (AMZN)? Executives are resetting their cost structures to reinvest in AI, which they believe is needed to annihilate their less-nimble foes.\n\nBut there is way more disruption going on in corporate America than AI running amok and changing the standard ways of executing.\n\nIf you stick with the disruptors, you stand to build wealth over time. Conversely, if you fail to spot the disrupted, it's probably going to end badly for your portfolio, full stop.\n\nI would like you all to build wealth, not see it go up in smoke, so here are a few examples to use as a template when assessing your own portfolio for disruptors and those being disrupted:\n\nBig media\n\nMighty Disney (DIS) just reinforced the blurring lines in media consumption and why it's probably going to be a winner over time.\n\nLast Wednesday, in a stroke of genius, the company joined forces with Epic Games for a new digital ecosystem. Digital ecosystems are only likely to grow in importance in the years to come, and Disney realizes this. Why do you think Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) are all in on virtual and augmented reality? Disney's classic IP Mickey Mouse is seen at an outdoor square in Shanghai, China, on April 28, 2023. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (Future Publishing via Getty Images)\n\nWith this announcement, Disney likely has the folks at Electronic Arts (EA) shaking in their Madden cleats. Comcast (CMCSA) execs are probably wondering why they didn't pull the trigger on buying EA last year, as was speculated.\n\nStory continues\n\nCouple that with Disney's new streaming sports tie-up with Fox (FOXA) and Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD), and the company has laid the foundation for a decade of disrupting rivals in media.\n\nFor instance, what does this new streaming deal mean for Paramount (PARA), which has a lucrative NFL deal through 2032? You can learn more about this disruption in my Yahoo Finance Live interview with Paramount CEO Bob Bakish.\n\nBottom line: AI is not a huge factor in this big media disruption; it's just good old-fashioned structural industry changes.\n\nLegacy tech\n\nPayPal’s (PYPL) earnings this week reaffirmed the view among many on the Street that it’s a legacy tech company being seriously disrupted, and new CEO Alex Chriss has a tall order in front of him to get investors excited again.\n\nAs Evercore ISI analyst David Togut wrote: \"PayPal continues to confront the twin challenges of market share and customers loss in its branded PayPal wallet business and negative mix shift toward its high-growth, low-take-rate payments platform, Braintree.\"\n\nWho is PayPal being disrupted by? It may be Stripe, Visa (V), American Express (AXP), Apple Pay, and Google Pay. Yet, why are people blah on using PayPal and maybe even Venmo, and what does this all mean for PayPal investors who have endured a 28% stock price decline in the past year?\n\nBeats me, but it's all disruption that may get worse before it gets better for the storied payments giant.\n\nBottom line: PayPal's biggest issue also isn't an AI one.\n\nNew tech\n\nWhat an absolutely awful quarter and conference call for Snap (SNAP) and CEO Evan Spiegel this week.\n\nThe stock deserved to be hammered by 34% on Wednesday, as it's another earnings period in which Snap's executive team seems to be out to lunch on the mood among its investors.\n\nBut this disaster says a lot about the flywheel of power for Meta, TikTok, and even Elon Musk’s X, formerly known as Twitter. These three platforms are growing stronger every single day, while Snap appears to be heading down a path of irrelevancy amid intense disruption.\n\nFor instance, Meta is so back in its groove that it's handing out a dividend for the first time, whereas Snap is handing out pink slips again to 10% of its workforce.\n\nOne year from now, Snap's story is probably not going to be pretty as its rivals get more entrenched in their winning ways. Blame disruption.\n\nBottom line: There's a little bit of AI disruption in this case, but it's not the overwhelming factor. morning brief image\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 32 highest paying jobs with an associates degree. We have also discussed the current employability level of these degrees. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 10 Highest Paying Jobs with an Associates Degree.\n\nCurrent Job Market and Associate Degrees in 2024\n\nIn January 2024, the US economy added over 350,000 jobs, surpassing expectations, with an unemployment rate holding at 3.7% for two years, marking a historic streak. Under President Biden, 14.8 million jobs have been created, 3.1 million in 2023. Real GDP rose by 3.3% in Q4 2023. Average hourly wages increased by 0.6% monthly and 4.5% yearly, outpacing forecasts. Consumer spending exceeded expectations in November and December.\n\nAs far as associate degrees and their employability are concerned, employers often view associate degrees favorably, particularly in fields like nursing, engineering, and computer programming, where specialized skills are valued. Despite a median annual earning of $44,100 in 2020, $15,500 less than bachelor's degree holders, 28% of associate degree holders earn more than half of bachelor's degree holders. Additionally, industries like construction, manufacturing, and healthcare appreciate the practical training and quick entry into the workforce that associate degree holders offer.\n\nSpeaking of associate degrees, Butler University recently announced a groundbreaking initiative: a two-year, debt-free associate degree program aimed at assisting underserved students. With tuition costs for the 2023-2024 academic year reaching $44,990, this initiative offers students the opportunity to obtain a bachelor's degree from Butler University for $10,000 after completing their associate degree. Set to begin enrolling students for the Fall 2025 semester, the program targets individuals from marginalized backgrounds, including students of color, first-generation college students, and those from low-income households.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Are the Most Common Associate Degrees?\n\nTwo most common associate's degrees are the Associate of Arts (AA) and the Associate of Science (AS). The AA degree focuses on liberal arts and humanities subjects like English, history, and psychology, while the AS degree focuses on science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields such as biology, chemistry, and computer science.\n\nWith an Associate of Arts degree, one can pursue various entry-level roles such as administrative assistant, customer service representative, sales associate, office clerk, or social media assistant. However, many Associate of Arts degrees are considered useless. To read more about such degrees, see the most useless associate degrees if you want a high-paying job.\n\nChanging Nature of Hiring - Focus on Skill Building\n\nIt is worth mentioning that large companies such as Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) are increasingly turning to community colleges to meet their workforce needs, recognizing the value of associate degree programs in providing skilled workers.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is deeply invested in empowering its Puget Sound employees through upskilling programs. One notable initiative, Career Choice, has facilitated nearly 2,000 employees in earning degrees or refining skills. With a network of 16 local education partners and a national consortium, 64% of participants have utilized pre-paid tuition for college courses. The program's success is evident in its popularity, particularly in the technology pathway, which offers industry certifications in IT and cybersecurity. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) offers paid apprenticeships, with nearly 600 participants since 2017 and a commendable job-placement rate of almost 75%. Leadership development is also prioritized, exemplified by Catalyst, a program grooming recent graduates into area managers, and Leadership Liftoff for new managers.\n\nOne example of an employee joining Amazon.com, Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is Fidel Contreras joined the company without a college degree. Motivated by his family's immigrant background and the burden of student debt, Contreras enrolled in a technical learning program with AWS, kickstarting his career in tech at 18. Through hard work and curiosity, Contreras rose to lead a team at AWS.\n\nWith a growing focus on skills, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has rolled out updated professional training and certifications tailored to meet the increasing demand for skilled IT support and management personnel. With the workforce's growing reliance on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) products like Mac, iPhone, and iPad, the need for proficient IT professionals is at an all-time high. The revamped online courses, including Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Device Support and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Deployment and Management, offer a self-paced learning environment, empowering individuals to pursue high-paying IT careers.\n\nThese courses are priced at $149 per exam and culminate in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) certifications that enhance candidates' marketability in job searches. Notably, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has partnered with educational institutions and organizations like the Mac Admins Foundation to ensure accessibility and affordability, offering scholarships, prep courses, and vouchers. 32 Highest Paying Jobs with an Associates Degree\n\nAn experienced technician inspecting a diesel particulate air filter in a clean technology factory.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo list the highest paying jobs with an associate degree, we identified high-paying jobs that do not require a formal bachelor’s degree and usually require an associate degree while also paying around or more than the national average salary of $59,428 annually.

        "title": "3 Stocks That Turned $1,000 Into 1 Million (or More)",
        "content": "The stock market is one of the best ways to build lasting wealth. That's because over time, the broad S&P 500 has averaged about a 10% yearly return.\n\nBut if we look back at history, we'll find some businesses that have crushed the market, turning small investments into seven-figure sums.\n\nHere's a closer look at Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), Costco (NASDAQ: COST), and Home Depot (NYSE: HD), three magnificent consumer stocks that turned $1,000 into more than $1 million.\n\n1. Apple\n\nFirst on this list is the world's most valuable brand. Apple has been a leader when it comes to selling some of the most popular electronics products out there. And this has propelled the FAANG stock 191,000% in the last roughly 43 years, turning $1,000 into $1.9 million today, including dividends.\n\nWhile the iPhone still brings in more than half of the revenue, the business is finding success with other devices, like the MacBook, AirPods, and Watch. Combined, hardware made up 81% of total sales in the fiscal 2024 first quarter.\n\nBut the software and services division is rapidly ascending to become a more important business driver. Offerings include things like Apple Card, Pay, Music, TV+, iCloud, and advertising. Revenue here was up 11%, higher than the company total. With a gross margin exceeding 70%, services can boost Apple's profitability over time.\n\nInvestors hoping for similar returns from this business over the next several decades should probably temper expectations. Apple's massive revenue base is struggling to grow at a high rate. Sales dipped 2.8% in fiscal 2023, indicating a mature enterprise.\n\nAnd the current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 29.3 is very expensive, at least based on the average valuation of the last 10 years. This can also limit forward returns.\n\n2. Costco\n\nWith trailing-12-month sales of $241 billion, Costco is the world's third-biggest retailer. It operates hundreds of warehouses across the globe, offering shoppers high-quality merchandise at extremely low prices. This business model hasn't changed over the decades.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Costco sounds like a boring company, the returns are exciting. The retail stock is up 123,000% in the last 49 years, including dividends. Even in recent years, shares have crushed the broader market. Gains are buoyed by special one-time payouts, like the $15 dividend announced in December.\n\nWhat separates Costco from a typical retailer is its successful membership model. Consumers must pay annual fees for the right to shop at a warehouse, providing a high-margin and recurring revenue stream. Membership sales were up 8.2% in the last quarter, with a worldwide renewal rate of over 90%.\n\nLike Apple, Costco isn't a cheap stock by any means, trading at a P/E multiple of 49.4. This is 47% higher than its trailing-10-year average. Even though there is meaningful growth potential, with management planning to open new stores at a healthy clip, a move that will certainly push up earnings figures, it's not a smart idea to buy the stock today.\n\n3. Home Depot\n\nAnother top retailer that turned $1,000 into more than $1 million is Home Depot (NYSE: HD). The home improvement giant's stock has been an even bigger historical winner than Apple or Costco, which you might not expect. Since 1981, Home Depot shares have turned a $1,000 initial capital outlay into a whopping $29.9 million today (including dividends).\n\nSimilarly to Costco, Home Depot's business hasn't changed much over time. The company sells various tools and supplies through its large stores to do-it-yourself (DIY) and professional customers looking to spruce up their homes. It's a boring business, but the financial results are excellent.\n\nHome Depot's operating margin and return on invested capital have averaged 14.2% and 34%, respectively, over the past decade. These metrics are better than the company's key rival, Lowe's. Home Depot's focus on driving efficiencies in its stores by investing in omnichannel capabilities and bolstering the supply chain has helped those metrics.\n\nThe business is dealing with a bit of a slowdown following strong demand trends during the pandemic. But industry tailwinds favor solid long-term growth. With shares trading at a reasonable P/E ratio of 23.3, investors might want to take a look at the stock.\n\nWhile it's not likely these three companies can repeat their past performances in the future, they are industry leaders that continue to dominate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Home Depot right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Home Depot, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Home Depot wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) made headlines last week with its most significant product launch in almost a decade. On Feb. 2, the company released the Apple Vision Pro, a virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR) headset, or \"spatial computer\" as Apple describes it.\n\nThe new product is equipped with the same chip powering its MacBook Air, allowing the Vision Pro to perform everyday computing tasks such as web browsing, word processing, video editing, and various entertainment tasks. AAPL Research and Development Expense (% of Annual Revenues) Chart\n\nIt remains to be seen how successful the headset will be, but this chart shows Apple is currently dedicating about 8% of its annual revenue to research and development. The last time that figure was higher, the tech firm was gearing up to launch the first iPhone. So whatever the company is cooking up now could mean big things for Apple over the next decade.\n\nAlthough the company has encountered some challenges over the last year, its significant cash reserves and potent brand make me confident in its long-term success.\n\nHere's why it's not too late to buy Apple stock.\n\nNavigating tricky market conditions\n\nApple hasn't had it easy over the last year. In 2023, macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company, leading to four consecutive quarters of revenue declines.\n\nThe streak was finally broken in Apple's latest quarter, with revenue rising 2% year over year to $120 billion in the first quarter of 2024. The company beat Wall Street forecasts by more than $1 billion.\n\nHowever, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business, with its stock down 3% year-to-date. Smartphone sales rose 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. The East Asian country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening business from Apple's third-largest market. China accounts for about 17% of the company's revenue.\n\nSales in China look unlikely to improve soon or perhaps ever with the rise of rivals like Xiaomi and Huawei. However, growth in other regions could offset losses in China over the long term while the company also gradually reshapes its business to rely less on the iPhone. In Q1 2024, product sales in Europe, Apple's second-largest market, posted revenue growth of 10% year over year. Meanwhile, sales in Japan soared 15%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, despite recent hurdles, Apple's free cash flow climbed 10% to about $107 billion in the last year, indicating slowing Chinese sales aren't having the detrimental effect that the company's stock dip would have you think. Additionally, it shows the firm has the funds to overcome current headwinds and keep investing in other high-growth areas of tech.\n\nApple has a solid outlook, but the stock could require patience\n\nApple's research and development hit just under $8 billion last quarter. It's unclear what the tech firm's roadmap looks like for the next decade. However, market trends and the launch of its Vision Pro headset suggest it will include journeying further into artificial intelligence (AI), VR/AR, and digital services. Consistent growth in these sectors could allow Apple to lean less on product sales and, more importantly, the iPhone over the long term.\n\nThe AI market on its own is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 37% through 2030, which would see it exceed $1 trillion. Meanwhile, data from Fortune Business Insights shows the VR market will grow at a CAGR of 31% in the same period. Apple's brand loyalty and substantial cash reserves make it well-positioned to see major gains from both industries.\n\nAdditionally, digital services are gradually becoming Apple's best-performing business, and could overtake the iPhone. Services include income from the App Store and subscription platforms like Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud. The digital business is Apple's second-highest-earning segment, accounting for about 20% of the company's revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, services growth has outperformed the iPhone for more than a year, with revenue for the segment rising by 11% year over year in Q1 2024 compared to the iPhone's 6%.\n\nIt will take time for Apple's investments to pay off and be reflected in its stock price. However, now could be an excellent time to make a long-term investment in Apple's business. Its stock offers significantly more value than some of its rivals, indicating it is lower risk than other \"Big Tech\" stocks. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart shows Apple's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free cash flow are considerably lower than those of Microsoft and Amazon. Apple's lower figures for both metrics suggest its stock is trading at a far better value.\n\nAlongside expanding positions in AI, VR/AR, and digital services, Apple's stock is a screaming buy for long-term-minded investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Apple's iconic Super Bowl ad still resonates 4 decades later",
        "content": "Once upon a time, believe it or not, no one particularly looked forward to Super Bowl ads.\n\nThat all changed when Washington faced Los Angeles on Jan. 22, 1984, in Tampa, Fla. Those who tuned in to the big game on CBS — and hadn’t fled to the kitchen for snacks — may have been intrigued by something completely different.\n\nIn between ads for Gillette Foamy Gel and Northwestern Mutual insurance, a dystopian scene appeared on their TV sets: A line of men wearing faded gray apparel marched mindlessly into a theater, where a bespectacled face, “Big Brother,” addressed them on a massive screen.\n\nExtolling the virtues of groupthink, Big Brother celebrated an imminent victory, free from “pests of any contradictory true thoughts.”\n\nThen, the camera cut to a striking blond athlete running in slow motion.\n\nWearing a white tank top and red athletic shorts — and played by British discus thrower and actress Anya Rajah (then Anya Major) — she strode into the theater, with guards in close pursuit. She spun and, with a shout, hurled a sledgehammer at Big Brother’s face. As the screen exploded, large text appeared along with a voice narrating, “On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you’ll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'”\n\nHappy 40th to one of the greatest ads, Super Bowl or otherwise, of all time.\n\nCreated by the ad agency Chiat/Day and Apple (AAPL), “1984” elevated Super Bowl ads to a whole new level. Today, tech historians, ad pros, and techies alike all look back at the commercial not only as a seminal moment in the democratization of personal computing and Super Bowl advertisements, but as a work of art containing themes that still resonate today.\n\nThough Rob Schwartz, an advertising industry leader who ran Chiat/Day from January 2015 to April 2021, was not at the agency when the ad was created, he still still remembers feeling inspired by it when it aired. “It marked the first time that the commercials in the Super Bowl were going to be something else to watch besides the game itself. This marked the moment,” he told Yahoo Finance recently.\n\nStory continues\n\n“It was,” he added, “the first time where the audience went, ‘Wait, wait, wait, don't go to the bathroom. Let's stay and watch a few commercials before the game comes back.'\"\n\nBut Apple, the Super Bowl aside, was in need of a boost.\n\nIBM = Big Brother?\n\nIn the early 1980s, the company had established itself as a promising tech business with products like the Apple II.In an attempt to make personal computers more accessible, it had then developed the Lisa,named after Steve Jobs’ daughter. Though innovative, the computer had sold poorly, especially compared to IBM’s (IBM) PC, which was released in 1981. Meanwhile, Apple had begun working on the Macintosh, which was meant to accelerate the adoption of the personal computer by the masses.\n\n“Apple came into 1984 being walloped by IBM in the personal computing market, and needing a new big hit … the company had bet it all on the Macintosh, spending huge on its R&D, building a new state-of-the-art factory for it,” said Margaret O'Mara, the Scott and Dorothy Bullitt chair of American History at the University of Washington.\n\nBut then arose the question of how to advertise the revolutionary new product. Steve Hayden, now 76, then a copywriter at Chiat/Day, still remembers receiving the assignment from Steve Jobs directly. The young tech visionary reportedly wanted to “stop the world in its tracks” and entrusted the L.A.-based firm with the job.

(Cap Carpenter/MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images) (MediaNews Group/The Mercury News via Getty Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlong with art director Brent Thomas, Hayden began brainstorming. He rifled through old ad concepts he had worked on in San Francisco and found one with the headline \"Why 1984 won't be like '1984,'\" a line Hayden attributed to fellow Chiat/Day copywriter Gary Gussick. At first, Hayden and Thomas toyed with a comical conception of 1984 “like the Jetsons.” But the ad’s director, a well-known talent by the name of Ridley Scott, had a better idea.\n\n“He came and looked at our initial board … he brought in this wonderful coffee table book about the making of Metropolis,the movie, and the dramatic huge machines and the interface between humans and these kinds of overwhelming technologies,” Hayden explained. “And so the art direction took a really sharp turn at that point to meet that vision.”\n\nThe advertising experts had already come up with the Big Brother character and Scott insisted that they introduce another, a heroine who would contrast starkly with the all-male cast and \"break the spell,\" Hayden said.\n\nA new age\n\nThe heroine symbolized more than simple rebellion against Big Brother. As historian O’Mara pointed out, the ad aired during the height of the Cold War and year of the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. “I think it's telling that she's dressed as a track athlete and dressed as if she's running for the United States,\" she said. Those who tuned into the big game saw arguably the greatest Super Bowl ad of all time: Washington vs. Los Angeles, Jan. 22, 1984, at Tampa Stadium in Tampa, Fla. (Focus on Sport/Getty Images) (Focus On Sport via Getty Images)\n\nThe heroine also represented the Macintosh. While computers had previously been monopolized by experts — think mainframes and IBM —the Macintosh offered a revolutionary user interface that made personal computers accessible to the mass market.\n\n“She was supposed to represent freedom and the dawning of a new age, and therefore, Macintosh,” Hayden said.\n\nAdded Chiat/Day’s Schwartz: “You have to remember that this was a time when computers were only used for business … When she throws that sledgehammer, she is all of us … and she represents all of us trying to destroy any kind of tyranny or dictatorship, even if it's just a dictator for a day, we don't want that. We want to be free. And I think the power of that is the reason why people talk about it, 40 years later.”\n\nBut there were some naysayers within the company. Apple's board of directors hated it and almost stopped it from airing. Meanwhile, Hayden himself felt unsure about his work. “I had my own concerns that it might be too foreign in structure and content for an American audience,” he said. “It didn't match the traditional advertising forms.”\n\nBut Jean-Louis Gassée, now 79, who was then running Apple France, still recallsthe first time he saw the ad at a 1983meeting to prepare for the January launch of the Macintosh. “We had never seen advertising like this ... it was absolutely stunning. And then the lights went up a little bit and from the top of the theater machinery, a Mac came down on a wire, and halfway through the descent it [was amplified by microphones],” he told Yahoo Finance. “So we could hear what became the highly recognizable “bong” of the Mac starting. There was this hysteria in the room.”\n\nThough Hayden and the rest of his team at Chiat/Day had never specifically intended “Big Brother” to represent IBM, Jobs quickly adopted that framing. After showing the ad, Jobs gave a “fiery” anti-IBM speech, “saying that the Macintosh would change the world,” according to Gassée. “It was easy at the time to superimpose the Big Brother and the big IBM images.” Insisted on a new character: director Ridley Scott. (Mario Anzuoni/REUTERS) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nHolding up\n\nIt is actually stunning to watch the ad today and see how it still holds up. Only this time, you can imagine Big Brother appearing on your screen as Tesla’s (TSLA) Elon Musk, Meta’s (META) Mark Zuckerberg, and the developers of ChatGPT and other artificial intelligence products.\n\nAt least Jean-Louis Gassée sees it that way. He asserted that the ad is still relevant as we grapple with the likes of AI and user privacy in the world of Facebook and X. It serves as “a good way to remind us of the necessary fight between established powers and upstarts.”\n\nHe added: “I think the ad presents two views of technology. One that is Big Brother-like, oppressive, and one which is the Macintosh, a way to break through the domination of Big Brother technology.” he said. “So this ad in 1983, 1984, presented a view of the conflict between usages of technology. I think that that conflict is still alive.”\n\nEnjoy the Super Bowl.\n\nDylan Croll is a Yahoo Finance reporter.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 12 best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. If you want to skip our discussion on the stock market and NASDAQ’s performance, head over to 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nIn December 2023, the performance of the 106 tracked indexes was predominantly positive, with only five finishing in negative territory. The average return for all indexes was 7.1%, following a strong performance in November. The NASDAQ-100 recorded a 5.5% gain, bringing its year-to-date performance to 53.8% on a price return basis as of January 5, 2024. The best-performing index was the Nasdaq Dorsey Wright Healthcare Technical Leaders, up by 17.8%, while the Credit Suisse Nasdaq WTI Crude Oil FLOWS 106 TR was the worst performer, declining by 4.2%. Notably, there was strength across different areas, with significant gains in Nasdaq Thematic Tech Indexes, Nasdaq Thematic ESG Indexes, and Nasdaq Green Economy Indexes (up 8-9% on average), while Nasdaq Crypto Indexes all posted double-digit gains.\n\nThe market rally that began in early November continued, driven by positive economic data indicating easing inflation, leading to expectations of earlier-than-expected monetary policy adjustments by the Federal Reserve. This marked a significant shift from the August-October downturn when concerns about higher Treasury yields, decreased consumer confidence, and a new geopolitical conflict in the Middle East weighed on investors. While major technology firms continued to show strong gains at the year's end, the market rally expanded across different sectors that had underperformed in 2023, including small caps, biotech/healthcare, clean energy, and financials. In 2024, investor sentiment appears cautiously optimistic, with the notion of a soft landing gaining momentum and the technology sector well-positioned for growth due to the increasing adoption of AI.\n\nThe trend of growth outperforming value made a strong comeback, with a significant shift in relative performance between these two broad categories occurring three out of the last four years. In 2023, large-cap growth surpassed value by over 31 percentage points, ranking second only to the margin of over 35 percentage points observed in 2020. This contrasts with 2022, where value outperformed growth by more than 21 percentage points, marking its second-best relative performance since 1978. The ratio of growth to value (RLG / RLV) hit its lowest point in the first week of January 2023 and, by mid-November, came within 1% of the record highs previously established in August 2020 and December 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite persistent macroeconomic concerns affecting demand and consumer sentiment, earnings in the fourth quarter of 2023 are surpassing expectations significantly, according to CNBC. Factors contributing to better bottom lines include reduced input costs, a focus on cost controls and efficiencies, and lowered expectations. LSEG, formerly Refinitiv, is now witnessing an almost 8% increase in earnings growth for this season, surpassing the 4.7% forecasted just three weeks prior, before major banks released results. Presently, 80% of S&P 500 earnings have exceeded estimates, slightly above the usual trend, with earnings exceeding expectations by more than 6%, though not reaching the 7% to 8% upside seen in the previous two quarters. Despite strong fourth-quarter results, there is a lack of positive momentum in forward-looking indicators, as first-quarter and full-year 2024 earnings estimates have decreased since January 1, with many companies offering cautious guidance in this earnings season.\n\nTo benefit from the growth momentum in the market, some of the best stocks to pick up in 2024 include Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe chose the top stocks listed on the NASDAQ exchange based on overall hedge fund sentiment toward each stock. We have assessed the hedge fund sentiment from Insider Monkey’s database of 910 elite hedge funds tracked as of the end of the third quarter of 2023. The list is arranged in ascending order of the number of hedge fund holders in each firm. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here).  12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024\n\nPhoto by Pascal Bernardon on Unsplash\n\nBest NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024\n\n12. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 87\n\nBroadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is a global semiconductor company specializing in the design and development of complex digital and mixed-signal semiconductor devices. It operates in two segments – Semiconductor Solutions and Infrastructure Software. Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) has projected a 2024 outlook with anticipated revenue of $50 billion and EBITDA margins of 60%. The company acknowledged some cyclical challenges in its broadband and storage semiconductor businesses but anticipates strength in the latter part of the year. Despite expected headwinds in the first half of 2024, investment advisory firm Summit Insights Group upgraded Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock to Buy on December 8, expressing confidence that the company will likely outperform its outlook for 2024.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), with 2 million shares worth $1.70 billion. Overall, 87 hedge funds were bullish on the stock.\n\nIn addition to Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to monitor.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n“While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.”\n\n11. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 90\n\nMicron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is a global company engaged in the design, development, manufacturing, and sale of memory and storage products. The company operates through four segments – Compute and Networking Business Unit, Mobile Business Unit, Embedded Business Unit, and Storage Business Unit. Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy.\n\nJ.P. Morgan analyst Harlan Sur, with an Overweight rating, raised the price target on the stock to $105 from $90 on December 21. He emphasized the significance of high-bandwidth memory products, anticipating them to be a substantial revenue driver in 2024, driven by increased demand for memory in AI projects.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 90 hedge funds were bullish on Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU), compared to 86 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Griffin’s Citadel Investment Group is the leading position holder in the company, with 8.10 million shares worth $551.6 million.\n\nHere is what Claret Asset Management has to say about Micron Technology, Inc. (NASDAQ:MU) in its Q3 2022 investor letter:\n\n“Inflation is still higher than interest rates… not an incentive to save for most people. Either inflation must come down or interest rates have to go up further. Or both. And probably both. Now that they are taking the punch bowl away and the party is over, what happens next? For whatever reason, the stock market seems to always precede the economic reality: Micron reached a high of $98.45 on January 5th, 2022 and is trading at $50.00 today.”\n\n10. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks for 2024. On January 23, Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) reported a Q4 GAAP EPS of $2.11, falling short of Wall Street estimates by $0.11. Revenue for the period increased 12.5% year-over-year to $8.83 billion, topping market expectations by $120 million. The global streaming paid memberships increased by 13.12 million to 260.28 million. Netflix revealed Q1 2024 guidance, indicating anticipated revenue of $9.24 billion compared to the consensus estimate of $9.26 billion, and projected earnings per share (EPS) of $4.49 as opposed to the consensus estimate of $4.14.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 102 hedge funds were bullish on Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), compared to 114 funds in the preceding quarter. Boykin Curry’s Eagle Capital Management is one of the biggest stakeholders of the company, with 2.5 million shares worth over $970 million.\n\nPolen Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”\n\n9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is a global semiconductor company operating in the Data Center, Client, Gaming, and Embedded segments. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has increased its CPU microprocessor market share to 18.4% in the fourth quarter, marking a gain of 73 basis points, according to data from Mercury Research cited by investment firm Citi. Citi holds a Buy rating on AMD as of February 7.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) was part of 110 hedge fund portfolios, compared to 112 in the prior quarter. Philippe Laffont’s Coatue Management is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $1.28 billion.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management stated the following regarding Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\n8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a global software company operating in three segments – Digital Media, Digital Experience, and Publishing and Advertising. It is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to buy in 2024. On December 13, Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported a Q4 non-GAAP EPS of $4.27 and a revenue of $5.05 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.13 and $30 million, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 112 hedge funds were bullish on Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), compared to 109 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher’s Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 4.5 million shares worth $2.3 billion.\n\nHere is what Polen Global Growth has to say about Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Both Alphabet and Adobe’s businesses continue to perform well. With respect to Adobe, the most recent quarter delivered more of the same with constant currency revenue growing 13%, margin expansion, and over 2% of shares outstanding repurchased for non-GAAP earnings growth of over 20%. We believe its approach to GenAI through Firefly, which guarantees safe content because it trains on Adobe Stock, will continue to be attractive to enterprises. The counter to GenAI, and something we are keeping an eye on with Alphabet and Adobe, is that it requires heavy investment. While both businesses can leverage their scale and manage costs in other areas, we expect the investment in future growth through GenAI will weigh on company-wide margins over the near term.”\n\n7. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 7th on our list of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in 2024. On February 1, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported a FQ1 GAAP EPS of $2.18 and a revenue of $119.6 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.07 and $1.34 billion, respectively. Apple also declared a $0.24 per share quarterly dividend, in line with previous. The dividend is payable on February 15, to shareholders of record on February 12.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 134 hedge funds were bullish on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), compared to 135 funds in the preceding quarter. Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is the largest stakeholder of the company, with 915.5 million shares worth $156.75 billion.\n\nBireme Capital stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\n6. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 163\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the best NASDAQ stocks to invest in. On January 30, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported its fourth quarter results. The GAAP earnings per share came in at $1.64 and the revenue stood at $86.31 billion, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $0.04 and $1.04 billion, respectively.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has reintroduced its AI chatbot, now named Gemini, as a subscription service with different tiers, following a model similar to OpenAI's ChatGPT. The service, ranging from a free version to the premium Ultra 1.0 model priced at $19.99 per month, can perform complex tasks such as coding, creative collaboration, and logical reasoning.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s third quarter database, 163 hedge funds were long Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), compared to 152 funds in the prior quarter. Harris Associates is a prominent stakeholder of the company, with a position worth $3 billion.\n\nLike Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), hedge funds are piling into Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nThe FPA Crescent Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its fourth quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) continued going from strength to strength during 2023 despite concerns that competition may infringe on the company’s dominant position in Search. Thus far, Alphabet has continued to hold its own, and we look forward to seeing how the company incorporates further AI developments across the Alphabet ecosystem. Lastly, we are hopeful that the impending arrival of a new CFO will bring a renewed focus on efficiency – an area where we believe Alphabet has ample room for improvement.”\n\nClick to continue reading and 5 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\nTop 12 Oil and Gas Stocks To Invest In According To Hedge Funds 10 Best Fintech Stocks To Buy In 2024 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\nDisclosure: None. 12 Best NASDAQ Stocks To Buy In 2024 is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 11 best FAANG stocks to invest in. To skip our detailed analysis of the tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nFrom FAANG to the Magnificent 7 and Beyond\n\nThe technology sector has been on a steady rise for quite a while now, and the most obvious answer to the industry's propulsion to greater and greater heights is the ongoing obsession with Artificial Intelligence (AI). Many within the AI space today are large tech companies, such as the FAANG names. These days, however, a new moniker has been on the rise to identify the best tech companies of the day: the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe original cohort of tech names to keep an eye on included Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) (formerly known as Facebook), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), all coming together to form the FAANG group. Today, these companies are challenged by several others in the market, particularly semiconductor giant NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA). NVIDIA isn't alone either, and so the original list of FAANG stocks has had to accommodate the rise of new and old mega-tech companies bolstered by the emergence of AI.\n\nRegardless of what you call these companies or who joins these new exciting groups, the fact remains that the tech sector has been abuzz with news of innovations, rising investments, and higher profitability. At the end of the day, it's starting to look like tech companies really are starting to rule the world.\n\nThe Three AI Amigos\n\nOn February 8, Gene Munster, the managing partner of Deepwater Asset Management, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss recent trends in the tech sector and the rise of FAANG stocks, particularly Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Here's what he had to say:\n\n\"They have the biggest upside potential relative to where expectations are... these three, I think, are largely unappreciated. I just wanna start with Meta. I think it's the biggest AI opportunity that's misunderstood. Most investors understand that Meta is using AI to improve ad campaigns, ad attribution... but there is a significant underappreciated lever that could take this into a whole different atmosphere. This theory comes from Deepwater's Doug Clinton. He believes that ultimately, they will monetize Llama. Llama is an opensource model. The other foundation models, Claude, and ChatGPT, and Gemini, they're all closed. Llama has 30 million downloads. If they monetize this, they will likely announce a cloud infrastructure... that is a whole new shift, and new benefit to Meta.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the rise of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, Munster said the following:\n\n\"Apple's gonna come out with their own foundation model likely in June, and they're gonna allow this to do personalized AI. This is really gonna capture 20% of the world's interest, and they can charge $10 a month for this.\"\n\nMost investors have been overlooking Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the AI space, but Munster thinks the company is on its way to benefitting from a new opportunity.\n\nBiden Administration's Investment in Chips\n\nIn an additional boost for the tech sector, the Biden Administration has announced a $5 billion investment in chips, a move that is bound to uplift the semiconductor industry. On February 9, Ronnie Chatterji, professor at Duke University and former White House Chips Coordinator, joined CNBC's \"Squawk Box\" to discuss this move. He noted that this move signals a partnership between the public and private sectors to ensure that the US continues to lead \"in the current generation of chips\" alongside the \"next generation.\" The investment is thus being welcomed overwhelmingly and may signal greater things for semiconductor companies in 2024.\n\nWith the current situation being so overwhelmingly in favor of tech companies, we have compiled a list of the best FAANG stocks to buy now. These include some of the top American tech stocks to buy apart from the original FAANG stocks. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\nA technician at a workstation, preparing and calibrating a sensor for automotive microcontrollers.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe compiled our list of the best FAANG stocks to invest in by consulting Insider Monkey's hedge fund data for the third quarter and selecting major tech companies with the highest number of hedge fund investors. They are ranked based on the number of hedge funds holding stakes in them, from the lowest to the highest number. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\nBest FAANG Stocks To Invest In\n\n11. Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 102\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the original FAANG names. It is a streaming company that operates a popular online streaming platform by the name of Netflix. The company is based in Los Gatos, California.\n\nDZ Bank analyst Markus Leistner upgraded shares of Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) from Hold to Buy and placed a $600 price target on the stock on January 25.\n\nNetflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) was found in the 13F holdings of 102 hedge funds at the end of the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $7.8 billion.\n\nPolen Capital mentioned Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX), ServiceNow, and Salesforce.\n\nDuring Netflix’s pandemic grow-over issues in 2022, the market seemed to believe there was little revenue or free cash flow growth left to be had for this business. The pandemic had pulled forward user growth, and the company then disclosed that there were over 100 million households that were using Netflix but not paying for it by borrowing a paid user’s account. After we assessed this information, better understood how the company could monetize shared passwords, and realized the win-win for Netflix and consumers from introducing an ad-supported subscription tier, we meaningfully added to our position in Netflix in the summer of 2022. We saw a clear path to much better monetization of an already robust and differentiated platform with a continued commitment to improved content spend efficiency and free cash flow growth.\n\nFast forward to today, Netflix has made meaningful progress on monetizing shared passwords and laying the foundation for consumer choice, although the ramp in advertising tier subscribers remains in the beginning stages. The low-hanging fruit may already have been picked on password sharing efforts, but our research shows there should be long tails of revenue and free cash flow growth. In our opinion, Netflix remains the most advantaged and profitable streaming service with opportunities to continue adding subscribers and raising prices as it demonstrates more value to consumers over time. Over the longer term, we also expect significant advertising revenue. That said, the market finally seems to have appreciated some of this. As a result, we trimmed our position from approximately 8% of the Portfolio to approximately 5% in the fourth quarter.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) is among the best FAANG stocks to buy now.\n\n10. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 107\n\nAn Overweight rating was maintained on shares of Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) by Simon Coles at Barclays on January 19. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $110 to $125.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is an information technology company. The company manufactures and sells integrated circuits and other semiconductor devices. It is based in Taiwan.\n\nWe saw 107 hedge funds long Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.7 billion.\n\nFisher Asset Management was the most prominent shareholder in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) at the end of the third quarter, holding 31.1 million shares in the company.\n\nHere's what Wedgewood Partners said about Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n9. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nThere were 110 hedge funds long Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in the third quarter, with a total stake value of $9.2 billion.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is another semiconductor company on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. The company is based in Santa Clara, California, and offers graphics processing units, chipsets, and embedded processors, among more.\n\nToshiya Hari, an analyst at Goldman Sachs, maintains a Buy rating on shares of Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) as of February 1. The analyst also raised the firm's price target on the stock from $157 to $180.\n\n8. Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 112\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE), holding 4.6 million shares in the company.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software company based in San Jose, California, and is one of the most attractive stocks on our list of the best FAANG stocks to buy. It offers products such as the Document Cloud, a unified cloud-based document services platform, and the Creative Cloud, a subscription service providing access to creative products.\n\nAs of January 2, Piper Sandler's Brent Bracelin holds an Overweight rating on shares of Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE). The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $650 to $705.\n\nAdobe Inc. (NASDAQ:ADBE) was seen in the portfolios of 112 hedge funds in the third quarter. Their total stake value in the company was $8.2 billion.\n\n7. salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 122\n\nBased in San Francisco, California, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is an application software company. It offers Customer Relationship Management (CRM) technology.\n\nAt the end of the third quarter, salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) had 122 hedge funds long its stock, with a total stake value of $10.5 billion.\n\nAn Outperform rating was maintained on salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) on January 23 by Rob Oliver at Baird. The analyst also raised his price target on the stock from $300 to $310.\n\nPolen Capital said the following about salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“In the fourth quarter, the top relative and absolute contributors to the Portfolio’s performance were Netflix, ServiceNow, and Salesforce, Inc. (NYSE:CRM).\n\nSalesforce has continued to grow its revenues at what we see as a healthy rate despite market concerns about the impact of the weaker macroeconomy on its business and penetration rates in its core CRM offering. Even its most mature and largest offerings, Sales Cloud and Service Cloud, are still growing revenue at double-digit rates. In addition, management realized that their cost structure, especially in salespeople, had gotten too bloated. Over the past year and a half, the company has run a much more streamlined expense structure that has led to strong operating margin expansion and earnings growth. Importantly, we do not feel Salesforce has cut into its innovation or sales muscle through these cost cuts but has eliminated unnecessary excess fat from the organization.”\n\nLike Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), salesforce.com, inc. (NYSE:CRM) is one of the top FAANG+ stocks to invest in today.\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 134\n\nHolding 54.9 million shares in the company, Fisher Asset Management was the largest shareholder in Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) at the end of the third quarter.\n\nSamik Chatterjee at JP Morgan maintains an Overweight rating on Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) alongside a $215 price target as of February 2.\n\nApple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a big tech company and one of the best FAANG stocks on our list. It is based in Cupertino, California, and is well known for its flagship iPhone, iPad, and Mac products.\n\nOur hedge fund data for the third quarter shows 134 hedge funds holding stakes in Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL). Their total stake value in the company was $179 billion.\n\nBireme Capital mentioned Apple Inc.  (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“We also shorted Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in Q3. At our average price of around $190 per share, Apple traded at 30x peak earnings and a $2.8 trillion market cap. While Apple is indeed a magnificent company, this valuation is simply too rich for a business with a substantial cyclical component. The company is projected to grow revenue at a mere 4% rate between 2022 and 2026. We think the total return on Apple stock will be lower than the market, and especially our long positions, over the next few years.”\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts Hedge Fund Manager Charles Paquelet’s Top 10 Tech Stock Picks 10 Best Tech Stocks for the Next 5 Years\n\nDisclosure: None. 11 Best FAANG Stocks To Invest In is originally published by Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Is the Next Trillion-Dollar Stock",
        "content": "With all the hoopla about the top tech stocks that have market valuations above $1 trillion, it’s easy to overlook the fact that the next company to cross the 1 and 12 zeroes milestone is likely to be one that is decidedly NOT a Magnificent 7 Nasdaq darling.\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) is now valued at more than $860 billion, a record high. So, the Oracle of Omaha’s conglomerate only needs to climb about 16% from current levels to top $1 trillion.\n\nBerkshire, the parent company of Geico, Dairy Queen, the Burlington Northern Santa Fe railroad, and numerous other insurers, consumer companies and industrial firms, has performed well thanks in particular to a boom in its insurance business. The company’s operating earnings rose nearly 20% in the first nine months of 2023, to just under $29 billion. The solid results are certainly one reason why Berkshire’s stock (trading just under $400 for one of the B shares and at nearly $600,000 for one of the A shares that never split) is up about 10% this year and nearly 30% over the past 12 months,\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut many investors own Berkshire… and follow Buffett’s every word… because of the company’s investing prowess. Buffett, along with lieutenants Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, runs a massive portfolio that owns shares of many notable blue chips. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is by far the largest position in the Berkshire mix, accounting for nearly half of the portfolio’s assets. So even though the famously tech-shy Buffett likes to portray himself as a bit of a folksy Luddite, Berkshire has profited from the success of the iPhone, Apple’s many subscription services and potentially the new Vision Pro headset.\n\nIn other words, Apple’s rise to a nearly $3 trillion market cap is one of the factors behind Berkshire’s push toward $1 trillion. But it’s not the only member of the Magnificent 7 that Buffett owns. Berkshire also has a small stake in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). And for all the talk about how Berkshire avoids tech, it even has a tiny position in cloud software firm Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).\n\nStory continues\n\nBuffett Takes Berkshire to $1 Trillion in Classic Style\n\nMake no mistake though. Berkshire isn’t turning into the next Ark Invest. Buffett is no Cathie Wood. The rest of the portfolio is dominated by classic consumer plays such as Buffett’s beloved Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) and Kraft Heinz (NASDAQ:KHC), oil giants Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) and big financial firms Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) and American Express (NYSE:AXP).\n\nBerkshire’s AmEx stake, which makes up more than 8.5% of the portfolio, is another key factor behind Berkshire’s success. AmEx shares are trading near a record high, as wealthy consumers continue to spend with their credit and debit cards. In addition, Berkshire owns smaller stakes in Visa (NYSE:V) and Mastercard (NYSE:MA), which are also trading near all-time highs, as well as a small position in Capital One (NYSE:COF).\n\nWhat else is in Buffett’s wallet? We’ll find out on Feb. 14 when the company is required to disclose its portfolio holdings for the fourth quarter. Consider it a Valentine’s Day present from Buffett to you.\n\nAs of this writing, Paul R.

        "content": "The S&P 500 has never been higher, closing above the 5,000 level for the first time ever as improving corporate earnings and better-than-expected economic data fuel investor optimism.\n\nThat optimism got an extra push Friday after revised data showed consumer inflation moderated at the end of last year, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.\n\nHowever, strategists caution the upward move is heavily tied to just a handful of companies.\n\n\"Technology is really important, as you know. Look at Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia make up 18% of the S&P 500, and the total is about 30% and it's actually more today than it was the peak in 2000 when we had that tech bubble burst,\" Crossmark Global Investments CEO Bob Doll said during an interview with FOX Business.\n\nARM CEO TALKS GROWTH AS STOCK ROCKETS\n\nAPPLE STORE IN CALIFORNIA DECIMATED BY MASKED THIEF\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nTo Doll's point, Microsoft displaced Apple as the world's largest company as its market cap moved above $3 trillion on Friday, compared to the iPhone maker's $2.9 trillion, as tracked by Dow Jones Market Data Group.

        "content": "The Nasdaq 100 is a stock market index comprised of the largest non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange. Many investors refer to it as an index of the 100 largest technology companies in America.\n\nOwing to its make-up, the Nasdaq 100 tends to outperform other stock market indexes such as the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500. It also tends to do better than the broader Nasdaq index that includes more than 2,500 stocks. Owing to its concentration in the largest and most profitable tech stocks, the Nasdaq 100 can be a great exchange-traded fund (ETF) to own.\n\nYet despite its outperformance, the Nasdaq 100 is not infallible. There are several stocks in the index that have been beaten down in recent years and trade at low share prices and cheap valuations. Here are the three most undervalued Nasdaq 100 stocks to buy in February 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) just got knocked 11% lower after the financial technology and payments company issued weak forward guidance. The guidance overshadowed the fact that PayPal reported much better-than-expected fourth-quarter financial results, posting earnings per share (EPS) of $1.48 compared to $1.36 that was expected on Wall Street. Revenue in the quarter came in at $8.03 billion, beating analysts’ estimates of $7.87 billion.\n\nUnfortunately, PayPal provided disappointing guidance, sending its stock lower as a result. The company said that it anticipates full-year earnings of $5.10 a share, which is below the $5.48 that analysts had expected. The latest earnings report comes after PayPal announced plans to layoff 9% of its workforce to help reduce costs. PayPal faces growing competition for its payment service from technology giants such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nPYPL stock is now down 28% over the last 12 months and trading at just 14 times future earnings estimates, which is rock bottom for a tech stock of its size.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Trade Desk (TTD) The logo for The Trade Desk is displayed on a smart phone.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) also got clobbered after the company’s last earnings print. TTD stock fell 25% after the advertising technology firm issued revenue guidance that fell short of Wall Street estimates. While the company’s Q3 2023 financial results beat forecasts, they too were overshadowed by subpar guidance. The Trade Desk forecast revenue in the fourth quarter of last year of $580 million, which was below the $610 million expected among analysts.\n\nManagement said that the advertising market was hurt last year by strikes in the U.S. automotive sector and entertainment industry. The Trade Desk’s technology helps companies reach potential customers across the internet with targeted advertisements. While the outlook for the final months of last year was grim, there is expected to be a rebound in online ads this year with the presidential election getting into full-swing.\n\nTTD stock has slumped 13% in the last six months, but the shares could stage a recovery when the company reports its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 15.\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor a microchip and semiconductor stock, Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) has had a tough go of it. TXN stock is down nearly 10% in the last 12 months, including a 5% decline so far in 2024. Compare that to a 60% gain in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) over the past year. Despite designing the chips and semiconductors that go into products ranging from motor vehicles to consumer electronics, Texas Instruments and its stock continue to lag the market.\n\nTXN stock has been slumping ever since the company issued tepid forward guidance that left analysts and investors feeling underwhelmed. Texas Instruments said that it anticipates $3.45 billion to $3.75 billion in revenue for the current first quarter of 2024, and 96 cents to $1.16 in EPS. Analysts had a consensus Q1 forecast of $4.05 billion in revenue and $1.40 a share in profit. Management said that demand remains weak and that customers will reduce their microchip inventories over the coming year.\n\nWhile the current situation with TXN stock is disappointing, the shares currently trade at 22 times future earnings estimates, which is about as low as a person is likely to find in a chip stock these days. Texas Instruments also pays a quarterly dividend of $1.30 per share, giving the stock a strong yield of 3.25%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in AAPL.

        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock closed at $188.08 at the end of trading on February 8. In the preceding 52 weeks, the stock price has fluctuated from $143.90 to $199.62.\n\nOn February 1, Apple reported its first quarter earnings results for the quarter ending December 30, 2023. The Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows showed payments for dividends and dividend equivalents of $3.825 billion, up from $3.768 billion in the same period in 2022.\n\nBased on its current quarterly dividend of $0.24 per share, the annualized dividend for Apple is $0.96 per share. Using the stock price at the close on February 8, its dividend yield is about 0.51%.\n\nHow Can You Earn $500 Per Month As An Apple Investor?\n\nIf you have an earnings target of $500 per month or $6,000 annually from Apple's dividends, your investment value needs to be $1,176,471 which is 6,255 shares at $188.08 each. But if you reduce your earnings target to $100 per month, your investment value drops to $235,294 or 1,251 shares.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nCollecting passive income from real estate just got a whole lot simpler. A new real estate fund backed by Dara Khosrowshahi gives you instant access to a diversified portfolio of rental properties, and you only need $100 to get started. How to earn $500 Per Month In Passive Income Through Real Estate Without Becoming A Landlord\n\nHow to calculate your estimated value of investments using dividend yields: To calculate an estimated investment value, you need two critical variables — the desired annual earnings target ($6,000 or $1,200) and the dividend yield of the stock (0.51% in this case). So, $6,000 / 0.0051 = $1,176,471 to generate an income of $500 per month, and $1,200 / 0.0051 = $235,294 for $100 per month.\n\nTo calculate the dividend yield, you need to divide the annual dividend payments by the stock’s current price. It is important to note that a company's dividend yield may change over time. This is because of the fluctuations in stock prices and changes in dividend policies on a rolling basis. Assuming that the stock price does not fluctuate or the capital appreciation is not factored into the calculations, the dividend value and its yield are positively correlated.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, assume a stock that pays $2 as an annual dividend is priced at $50. Its dividend yield would be $2 / $50 = 4%. If the stock price rises to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2 / $60). A drop in stock price to $40 will have an inverse effect and increase the dividend yield to 5% ($2 / $40).\n\nDisclaimer: This calculation is according to the price per share on Feb. 8 using an annualized dividend. The price of Apple stock at the end of trading on Feb. 8 was $188.08.\n\nRead Next:\n\nCommercial real estate has historically outperformed the stock market, but few investors have the capital or resources needed to invest in this asset class.

        "title": "A top exec at Kim Kardashian’s new private equity fund once made it her mission to persuade Apple’s Tim Cook not to hire her. It didn’t work",
        "content": "Angela Ahrendts may have played one of the toughest games of hard-to-get ever with Apple CEO Tim Cook. In 2014 when Ahrendts was CEO of London-based luxury retail brand Burberry, Cook tried to persuade her several times to head up retail at the Cupertino, Calif.–based tech giant.\n\nAhrendts was steadfast in convincing Cook that she wasn’t the right fit for the job.\n\n“I’m absolutely not a techie,” she told Cook, according to a 2016 interview at the Fortune Most Powerful Women Summit. “I’m actually not even a great retailer.” But Cook didn’t take the bait, telling her that the company had plenty of tech-focused employees and had “the most productive stores in the world.”\n\nWhat Apple didn’t have, though, was Ahrendts’s attention to community and ability to humanize a company that had become one of the world’s most profitable. It was a 2011 TED Talk that Ahrendts had given that really caught Cook’s attention—one that was focused on the idea of human energy. Her thesis was that the more technologically advanced our society becomes, the more we need to go back to the basic fundamentals of human communication.\n\n“Trust just takes all the barriers away,” Ahrendts said. “I think it’s the same in a personal relationship or in a small business or a huge business.”\n\nThis wisdom that Ahrendts has preached since 2011 is what got her noticed by leaders and celebrities alike. It’s what got her from a small town in Indiana to heading up Apple retail as a senior vice president—and now serving as a senior operating adviser at Kim Kardashian’s new private equity fund, SKKY Partners. It’s those soft skills—like earnest communication and building trust—that can make non-techies attractive to the biggest players in the industry and encourage leaders to look beyond just a résumé.\n\nFor Ahrendts, it wasn’t the clout of the position or even the brand name of the company that made her eventually give in to Cook. It was the promise of being able to build something new and community-focused for a brand that she saw as having a major impact on the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom small-town living to Apple exec\n\nAhrendts comes from humble beginnings. She was born and raised in New Palestine, Ind., with a population of just over 2,000, and was one of six children in her family. She played tennis, swam, and did gymnastics—and had her first job as a server. She studied at Ball State University before stints at Donna Karan International (DKNY), Liz Claiborne, and Burberry.\n\nWhen Ahrendts became CEO of Burberry in 2006, she was featured on Fortune’s magazine cover holding an iPad—a symbol showing the company’s commitment to equipping sales representatives with the technology they needed when working with consumers. Little did she know, though, that she’d eventually become one of the top executives at the company that created the very device that made Burberry so successful.\n\n“We turned the company around because of Apple—because of all that their technology enabled us to do all over the world,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts said that she had “the greatest job in the world,” even to Cook when he first started trying to recruit her to join Apple. She also couldn’t imagine leaving London, where she and her family had been living for almost a decade. But that started to change during a visit back to the States for the holidays.\n\nApple caught wind that Ahrendts would be home for the holidays and offered to fly her out and meet with her again.\n\n“I again admired everything he was doing at Apple, so I did [go], but my mission was to talk him out of me,” Ahrendts said. At the time, Ahrendts still turned Cook down, but an email exchange later on is what locked her into a future with the company.\n\nAfter receiving an email from Cook following her visit, Ahrendts sent a “gracious” and “humble” email letting him down—but with one caveat. If Apple would ever consider integrating its retail stores with its online business model, then she’d consider it.\n\n“At Burberry, we did everything digital first,” she said. “I wanted to make sure that they did something even greater [where the company] played a more important role in the community.” That alone sparked Cook’s interest, and led to Apple’s great retail redesign after she finally took the job in 2014.\n\nSuccess at Apple\n\nWith a focus on community, Apple introduced more programming at its stores for adults and children alike, educating them in things like photography and tech features they wouldn’t otherwise be able to learn. She heralded change at Apple retail stores, which she refers to as “town squares” where the consumer experience is less about selling them a product and more about helping the customer discover all of the potential that they—and their devices—have. She was also behind the brand’s illustrious gold watch launch and can be thanked for shorter lines at the Apple store owing to her focus on online retail.\n\nAfter a successful run with Apple, Ahrendts stepped down in 2019 and served on the boards of Airbnb, Ralph Lauren, and WPP. But in October 2023, she took on her new role as a senior operating adviser at Kardashian’s private equity firm SKKY Partners, which was formed with PE industry veteran Jay Sammons. As of October, SKKY (which started in early 2023) had yet to close a deal, but “Ahrendts’s expertise may help the firm make that all-important choice of its first deal,” Emma Hinchliffe, author of Fortune’s The Broadsheet newsletter, wrote.\n\nIn terms of advice for young women pursuing a path to leadership, her biggest advice is to be confident in what you know—and what you don’t know.\n\n“It’s so easy along the way to become incredibly insecure about everything you don’t know,” she said in the 2016 interview. “Be your best self.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "History shows stocks will still go up even if the 'Magnificent 7' lose steam",
        "content": "The S&P 500 (^GSPC) is creeping near 5,000 for the first time ever. And once again, the stocks leading it higher are the biggest members of the benchmark average.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Meta (META), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia (NVDA) have produced a nearly 20% return to start the year, per analysis from Yahoo Finance's Jared Blikre. The returns from these four stocks alone account for roughly 69% of the S&P 500's gain this year.\n\nBut not all of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks are off to a strong start. Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), and Tesla (TSLA) are having a choppier start to the year. For some on Wall Street, this has become a concern as a shrinking number of stocks are leading the major average higher.\n\nFortunately for investors, even if top stocks are peaking, the marketshould probably still go up.\n\nA recent analysis from BMO Capital Markets chief investment strategist Brian Belski showed that even when the top stocks driving an outsized part of the market action fall off, returns over the next year for the index historicallyhave been quite good.\n\nA chart from Belski shows that since 1992,on average, the S&P 500 has risen 14.3% in the year following a peak in contribution from the top 10 stocks in the benchmark average. The only time the S&P 500 delivered a negative return in the next year was in 2001 amid the fallout from the tech bubble.\n\n\"While some investors may be concerned that the market is likely to struggle without these stocks leading the way, our analysis shows that the S&P 500 has performed just fine following peaks in relative performance of the 10 largest stocks,\" Belski wrote in a note to clients on Tuesday.\n\nGoldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider pointed out that while the degree to which topstocks are dragging the major index higher is currently abnormally high, the idea that a few winners lead the S&P 500 gains isn't a new concept. In fact, Snider argued, in the long run it's been a typical feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"That's part of why the S&P 500 or the US equity market broadly has been so strong over the years. ... New companies grow, and they become larger weights in the index, and they drag the market higher with them,\" the analyst told Yahoo Finance. \"And eventually, there will be disruptors and new technologies that emerge and new businesses that emerge. And those will become larger. And then, it will be their turn to drag the market higher.\"\n\nFor the S&P to hit new records without significant contributions from the Magnificent Seven, there would need to be a broadening out in the market, where other lagging sectors begin to pick up steam. This has been seen recently in areas such as large-cap Healthcare (XLV), which is up 17% from its October lows, and the Financial Select Sector ETF (XLF), which is up 24% from October lows.\n\nWith 70% of S&P 500 companies topping analysts' earnings per share forecasts in the fourth quarter, above the historical average of 63%, Bank of America US and Canada equity strategist Ohsung Kwon pointed to the increased breadth in earnings growth as a positive catalyst moving forward.\n\n\"You're seeing [an] even higher percentage [of] companies posting positive earnings this quarter than last quarter,\" Kwon told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday. \"So actually, earnings breadth is improving as well, and that's a positive cycle for equities.\"\n\nSnider thinks this broadening out is the most likely scenario this year once investors feel more confident in the Federal Reserve's interest rate-cutting path.\n\n\"As investors stop worrying so much about exactly when the Fed will start to cut rates, I think we'll see a lot of these companies outside of the Magnificent Seven have pretty strong earnings growth, and that will cause them to do pretty well in turn,\" Snider said.

        "title": "‘A Kodak déjà vu’: Apple’s Vision Pro is yet to find its killer app–and it could spell trouble for Tim Cook’s risky bet",
        "content": "Apple has started shipping its Apple Vision Pro, its take on a headset that combines Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR).\n\nWhile the product is an amazing technical tour de force, I believe the product-market fit of this first iteration is a swing and a miss.\n\nI’ve watched other world-class consumer product companies make the same mistakes over and over again:\n\nCome up with amazing hardware that creates entirely new capabilities. Forecast demand based on volumes of their previous consumer products. Confuse consumers by defining a new category without a frame of reference. Discover that the hardware doesn’t match the needs of their existing customer base. Work hard and spend a lot of money on trying to push sales on their existing customers. Revenue woefully falls short of forecast. Marketing and capital expenses (new factory, high research and development expense) were predicated on consumer-scale sales. The new product is burning a ton of cash. Ignore or fail to understand adjacent niche industrial markets that would have rushed to buy the product if the company had developed niche-specific demos and outreach. Eventually, pivot to the niche markets that are excited about the product. The niche markets make for great beachhead markets but are too small to match the inflated forecasts and the built-in burn rates of consumer-scale sales. After multiple market pivots and changes in leadership, abandon the product.\n\nA Kodak déjà vu\n\nI lived through the equivalent of this when Kodak (remember them?) launched a product in 1990 called PhotoCD. Kodak wanted consumers to put their film photos on their home CDROM drives and then display them on their televisions. You dropped off your film at a film processor and instead of just getting physical prints of your pictures they would scan the film and burn them onto a Compact Disc. You’d go home with a Compact Disc with your pictures on it.\n\nI got a preview of PhotoCD when I was the head of marketing at SuperMac, a supplier of hardware and software for graphics professionals. The moment I saw the product I knew every one of my professional graphics customers (ad agencies, freelancers, photo studios, etc.) would want to use it. In fact, they would have paid a premium for it. I was floored when Kodak told me they were launching PhotoCD as a consumer product.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem was that in 1990, consumers did not have CDROM drives to display the pictures. At the time, even most personal computers lacked them. Meanwhile, every graphics professional did own a CDROM drive but most didn’t own a high-resolution film scanner. They would have been the perfect launch customers for PhotoCD. To this day, I remember being lectured by a senior Kodak executive, “Steve you don’t get it, we’re experts at selling to consumers. We’ll sell them the CDROM drives as well.”\n\nExcept the Kodak CDROM drives were the size of professional audio equipment and depending on the model, cost $600 to $1000 in today’s dollars. And when consumer CDROM drives became available they couldn’t play the PhotoCD disks as they were encoded in a proprietary Kodak standard to lock you into their drives!\n\nThe result? PhotoCD failed miserably as a consumer product. Subsequent pivots to professional graphics users (a segment they knew well) came too late, as low-cost scanners and non-proprietary standards (JPEG) prevailed.\n\nGetting it right\n\nSimilarly, Apple is trying to push Vision Pro onto their existing consumer customers. All the demos and existing applications are tailored to the consumer market.\n\nAdditionally, Apple did not create demos for how the Vision Pro could be used in new markets where users would jump at the opportunity to buy a Vision Pro. For example, the internet is rife with proof of demand in an adjacent mass market: helping millions of homeowners repair things around their property.\n\nThere is also proven demand for Industrial applications outside of the consumer space. Every company that has complex machinery has been experimenting with AR for years. Imagine car repair with a Vision Pro AR tutorial. Or jet engine maintenance. Or the entire gamut of complex machinery. All of these would have been great Vision Pro demos for training and repair. It’s hard to understand why Apple ignored these easy wins.\n\nApple’s entry into new markets by creating new product categories–iPods, iPads, iPhones–is unprecedented in the history of modern corporations. $300 billion (75% of their revenue) is from non-computer hardware. In addition, they’ve created an entirely new $85+ billion subscription business model with the App Store, iTunes, Apple Care, Apple Pay, Apple Cash, Apple Arcade, Apple Music, and Apple TV.\n\nIt’s hard to remember, but the first versions of these products launched with serious limitations that follow-on versions remedied. The first version of the iPhone only ran Apple software, it had no app store. It was a closed system. It had no copy-and-paste function, and couldn’t record video, among other limitations. The original Apple Watch was positioned as a fashion accessory. It wasn’t until later that Apple realized the Watch's killer apps were fitness and health. Fixing the technical flaws while finding the right markets took time and commitment.\n\nThe same will likely be true for the Vision Pro. Apple’s model is to provide the hardware and then let their developer community come up with the kind of applications. However, all of the applications on this first release are in their current markets (entertainment, music, etc.). None of these are killer apps for the product.\n\nApple marketers will realize that adjacent spaces they are less familiar with will provide the first \"got to have it\" beachhead markets. Newer iterations will ride the technology wave of lighter and cheaper versions.\n\nApple’s CEO Tim Cook has made a personal bet on the Vision Pro. More than any other company, they have sufficient resources (cash on hand and engineering talent) to pivot–and ensure the Vision Pro’s product-market fit in the real markets that need it. Here’s to hoping they find it.\n\nSteve Blank is an adjunct professor at Stanford and co-founder of the Gordian Knot Center for National Security Innovation.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nThe markets are starting to realize just how hawkish the Fed is–and reckoning with higher-for-longer interest rates Working fathers are the new target of microaggressions–and they are worried they could be getting ‘daddy tracked’ WEF president: ‘It’s time to revitalize trade—and reverse the trend of Slowbalization’ The anti-DEI movement has gone from fringe to mainstream.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nA rising tide might lift all boats, but the resurgence in the ad market is flowing mostly to the giants.\n\nThe companies that measure their market cap in the trillions are the ones reaping the rewards of the advertising rebound of 2024, leaving much of the legacy media and even tech's smaller players out of the comeback story.\n\nThis year Google and Meta, the top two in the digital ads market, are expected to haul in more than $140 billion, according to forecasts by Intelligence Insider. The duo is on track to once again claim nearly half of all digital ads revenue. Even as brands spend their way out of a multiyear ad slump, it's mega enterprises who will be feasting while mostly everyone else claws for scraps.\n\nInvestors pummeled Snap this week for posting merely 5% revenue growth, the latest example of Wall Street punishing anything that doesn't look like Zuckerbergian conquest. Meta set the bar for expansion. The social media king catapulted its advertising revenue 24% higher, more than doubling the pace of rival Google's 11%. Wall Street dinged Google for that too.\n\nWhere ad dollars flow underscores the selectiveness of the recovery. Amazon last week reported its ads business swelled 27% year over year. While the company sits in third place in the digital ads market, Amazon is poised to gobble even greater share. It's in the early stages of converting an untapped Prime Video streaming service into an ad platform with a massive, built-in audience. Watch it on Amazon then buy it on Amazon.\n\nOverall, worldwide digital ad spending is projected to increase 13.2% this year, the data shows, compared to traditional media ad growth of 2.4%.\n\nThe other major players expected to amplify their ads business are following a similar playbook of platform economics, capturing the eyeballs of enormous online ecosystems: Walmart and TikTok.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs if it couldn't get any harder to run with Big Tech, the same companies that upended the ads business through search and social media are deploying their huge cash piles to invest in new AI tools. They stand to rejigger markets and the attention economy further in their favor.\n\nEven Disney (DIS), fresh off a significant earnings beat, a dividend boost, and a burst of flashy announcements, still struggles with the baggage of a legacy media business. Its linear networks segment fell 12% compared to the same period last year, the company reported Wednesday, while the unit's operating income fell 7%.\n\nFox's (FOX) ad revenue, which makes up nearly half of the company's total sales, tumbled 20% in the December quarter versus the year prior, it disclosed earlier this week.\n\nAnd while other media names are scheduled to report later this month, including Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) and Paramount (PARA), it's likely their ad-reliant finances, without Bob Iger's streaming head start and dealmaking pizzazz, will reveal more of the same. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "64% of Warren Buffett's $371 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in Just 3 Stocks",
        "content": "For almost 60 years, the Oracle of Omaha has been dazzling Wall Street. I'm talking about Berkshire Hathaway's (NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett. Since taking over as CEO in the mid-1960s, he has overseen a greater than 4,760,000% gain in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A). A seven-digit return is certainly going to get a money manager noticed -- and for good reason.\n\nWhat makes Warren Buffett such a hero for everyday investors is his willingness to share his insights on the U.S. economy and investing. Lengthy books have been written that discuss some of his favorite investing philosophies, such as buying stakes in brand-name businesses with sustainable moats and holding these positions for lengthy periods. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nHowever, the factor that isn't given nearly enough credit for Berkshire Hathaway's long-term success is portfolio concentration. Warren Buffett and his top investing aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, strongly believe in putting the lion's share of Berkshire's capital to work in their top ideas. And if these top ideas generate sizable returns, Berkshire Hathaway's stock is likely headed even higher.\n\nDespite Berkshire having stakes in 49 stocks, as of Sept. 30, 2023, 64% of the invested assets ($236.1 billion) Warren Buffett oversees in Berkshire Hathaway's $371 billion portfolio are being put to work in just three brand-name companies.\n\nApple: $170.2 billion (45.9% of invested assets)\n\nAny question of whether or not the Oracle of Omaha and his team favor portfolio concentration is made crystal clear by tech stockApple(NASDAQ: AAPL), which accounts for nearly 46% of Berkshire's invested assets. This Apple stake amounts to 20% of Berkshire Hathaway's market cap, which means the health of Apple and its stock very much matters to Berkshire Hathaway's investors.\n\nThe three factors that are likely most responsible for luring Warren Buffett, Todd Combs, and Ted Weschler into such an outsized position in Apple are its brand, its ongoing innovation, and its market-leading capital-return program.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn most annual brand rankings, Apple comes out on top. It has an exceptionally loyal customer base that allows the company to generate highly predictable operating cash flow. Predictability is rare in the tech sector, which is one of the reasons Apple has so consistently outperformed.\n\nBerkshire's investment team is likely also enamored with Apple's innovation. It's been the undisputed leader in U.S. smartphone market share for years and was on the cutting edge of innovation when it introduced the iPad in 2010.\n\nBeyond the company's physical product innovation, investors are witnessing CEO Tim Cook transform Apple into a services-focused business. A subscription-driven platform will not only enhance customer loyalty and Apple's operating margin over time, but it'll also help smooth out the sales fluctuations that tend to occur during major iPhone upgrade/replacement cycles.\n\nBut for Warren Buffett, Apple's capital-return program might be the top selling point. On top of returning around $15 billion annually to shareholders via dividends, Apple has repurchased more than $600 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013. Buffett loves buybacks because they increase Berkshire's ownership stake without him or his team lifting a finger.\n\nBank of America: $34.6 billion (9.3% of invested assets)\n\nAlthough it sits a long way behind Apple, money-center giant Bank of America(NYSE: BAC) is Berkshire Hathaway's second-largest holding at $34.6 billion in market value.\n\nOut of the 11 sectors of the stock market, there's none Warren Buffett is more knowledgeable about than financials. Within financials, bank stocks are the real area of focus.\n\nInterestingly enough, the reason the Oracle of Omaha and his aides have bet big on companies like BofA is because they're cyclical. This is to say that Bank of America is going to succeed and struggle in lockstep with the U.S. economy.\n\nEven though recessions are a normal and inevitable part of the economic cycle, they don't last very long. Instead of trying to foolishly guess when these downturns will occur, Buffett and his investing squad have angled Berkshire's $371 billion portfolio to take advantage of long-winded expansions. In Bank of America's case, it's able to steadily grow its loan and lease portfolio over time.\n\nWhat really separates Bank of America from countless other publicly traded banks is that it's the most interest-rate sensitive among U.S. money-center banks. Since March 2022, the most aggressive rate-hiking cycle in four decades has added billions of dollars in quarterly net interest income to BofA's bottom line.\n\nFurthermore, Bank of America is enjoying the tangible reward of investing in technology. The company's digitization efforts have increased the percentage of households banking online or via mobile app to 75%, as of Dec. 31, 2023. Digital transactions are considerably cheaper than in-person interactions for banks, which should be a positive for BofA's long-term operating efficiency.\n\nLet's not forget that the Oracle of Omaha also loves a good value. Bank of America stock is trading for less than 10X forward-year earnings and can be purchased for right around its book value. Image source: American Express.\n\nAmerican Express: $31.3 billion (8.4% of invested assets)\n\nThe third stock that, along with Apple and Bank of America, collectively makes up 64% of the $371 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services provider American Express(NYSE: AXP). \"AmEx,\" as the company is more commonly known, has been a continuous holding by Berkshire since 1991.\n\nTo reiterate, Warren Buffett loves financial stocks and cyclical businesses. Even though there have been 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II, only three of these downturns managed to hit the 12-month mark, and none surpassed 18 months. Disproportionately long periods of expansion have allowed credit-services companies like American Express to thrive.\n\nThe primary reason AmEx has been such a great investment for so long is its ability to benefit from both sides of a transaction. On one hand, it's the No. 3 payment processor by credit card network purchase volume in the U.S. (i.e., the largest market for consumption in the world). This means it's generating a healthy amount in fees from merchants by facilitating transactions.\n\nHowever, American Express is also a lender. Its cardholders are paying interest on their carried credit card balances, along with (possible) annual fees to be a cardholder. During long periods of economic growth, double-dipping can be quite fruitful for the company's bottom line.\n\nAnother reason AmEx outperforms is the clientele it tends to attract. American Express has always had a knack for luring high-earning cardholders.\n\nAlthough high earners aren't perfect, they're far less likely than the average consumer to alter their buying habits or fail to pay their bills during a modest economic contraction. In other words, the well-to-do are helping AmEx successfully navigate potentially challenging economic climates.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that American Express has quietly turned into a mammoth dividend stock for Berkshire Hathaway. AmEx recently announced plans to increase its base annual payout to the equivalent of $2.80 per share. Though this represents a mere 1.36% nominal yield, based on where shares closed on Feb. 2, a $2.80 annual dividend is a 33% yield to Berkshire's cost basis of roughly $8.49 per AmEx share.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is on pace to generate around $6 billion in dividend income this year, with AmEx certainly doing its part.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock has been really struggling to break through to a new all-time high. Undoubtedly, Apple seems to have been outshined by its peers in the Magnificent Seven, but there exist catalysts that could help power a much-awaited rally, perhaps to the Street-high price target of $250 per share.\n\nIndeed, Apple stock seems to be quite the battleground between the bulls and the bears, especially lately. The bears would point to weak growth and stagnation in iPhone demand in the Chinese market. Meanwhile, the bulls have a strong argument that the high-margin Services segment continues to swell and that looming products could easily drive growth rates much higher.\n\nPersonally, I’m siding with the bull camp. Though bearish arguments are quite sound, I do believe they’re too backward-looking. Sure, the iPhone 15 Pro Max could have had much better sales had the Chinese economy not been in a massive slump. And the recent drama revolving around Apple Watches being pulled from shelves has taken a subtle jab to the wearables segment.\n\nApple Vision Pro Will be a Bigger Deal in the Future\n\nThough the recent quarter wasn’t bad, it certainly left much to be desired. Nonetheless, with the Vision Pro selling quite reasonably well, look for the new spatial computing device to become a bigger part of the Apple revenue pie each and every year.\n\nThough the Vision Pro probably won’t surpass iPhone sales in the next three to five years, I think it could give the Mac segment a good run for its money. This is especially true if Apple’s innovators can reduce the size and power requirements of the device (a smaller form factor with no detached battery would certainly help the device become more than just a “niche product”).\n\nThough it’ll take time for sales in Vision Pro to march higher, I believe that advancements on the software side could act as a driver on the share price in the near-to-medium term. We’re likely more than a year away from the next iteration of Apple’s spatial computer. However, 2024 could see some significant software improvements (especially when it comes to AI) until then.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether we’re talking about more sophisticated updates to visionOS (the Vision Pro’s operating system) or a growing number of apps (perhaps some of them will be so-called “killer” apps?), the enthusiasm surrounding the product has the potential to grow at an exponential rate from here.\n\nIn the meantime, I think the Vision Pro’s App Store (there were 600 apps on day one of the release) library is looking quite robust. As more developers get their hands on the visionOS tools, I’d look for the number of apps and games to surge into year’s end. That alone could make the Vision Pro a massive driver of the stock as investors anticipate greater sales in the future in response to the rapidly advancing software ecosystem.\n\nWWDC 2024 May be That Much-Awaited AI Reveal\n\nFollowing the release of Apple’s latest results, CEO Tim Cook teased analysts, hinting that generative AI products will be coming later in the year. It’s no mystery that Apple has been investing “tremendous time and effort” (as per Tim Cook) into AI integration. And though it would have been nice to have some more specifics from Cook, like a specific date and features, I believe the AI premium that many Magnificent Seven stocks now command will be commanded by Apple once its new AI innovations are finally unveiled.\n\nMark Gurman of Bloomberg thinks iOS 18 (the next update to iPhone’s operating system that could be a highlight of this year’s WWDC) could represent the “biggest” update in its history, thanks in part to AI. We can only speculate at this point, but I think he’s right on the money. More details on the update may very well help drive the stock above $200, perhaps toward the $250 Street-high target currently held by Wedbush analyst Daniel Ives.\n\nIves sees the Vision Pro as Apple’s “first major push” into the realm of AI. If he’s right, other analysts on Wall Street may find themselves racing to upgrade their targets to prices more in line (or maybe exceeding) that of Ives’.\n\nUndoubtedly, ChatGPT-like Siri Updates and a potential AI App Store could propel Apple stock from an AI underdog to one of the top contenders, perhaps even a leader. This is especially likely given that a vast majority of Apple’s “golden” installed base will actively use such technologies if they are featured as part of iOS 18.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, AAPL stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. Out of 26 analyst ratings, there are 17 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell recommendation. The average AAPL stock price target is $208.07, implying upside potential of 10.5%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $158.00 per share to a high of $250.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nIt’s easy to be less-than-upbeat on Apple stock as the iPhone maker’s sales growth and shares stall. That said, if you look to Apple’s near future, it’s clear that selling AAPL stock right here could prove to be a mistake, especially if Ives’ predictions come true.\n\nFor now, I’d look to WWDC 2024 and Vision Pro news as potential catalysts to help drive shares higher on the year. Could 2024 be Apple’s year of AI? I think it could be.\n\nDisclosure",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 most respected countries in Asia. We have also looked at the ongoing and predicted economic growth of the Asian market. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, head straight to the 5 Most Respected Countries in Asia.\n\nGlobally, the IMF projects a resilient growth rate of 3.1% for 2024 which is consistent with the previous year, although still below the historical average. Notably, inflation is expected to decline from 6.8% in 2023 to 4.4% in 2025. Turning to Asia, the region is on track to contribute two-thirds to global growth in 2024, with upward revisions in growth estimates for both 2023 (4.7%) and 2024 (4.5%), driven by factors such as policy stimulus and a supportive external environment.\n\nHowever, regional variations persist, as Japan's growth is slowing from 2% in 2023 to about 1% in 2024, while India maintains strong growth at 6.5% in both 2024 and 2025. The inflation outlook in Asia is generally positive, with average inflation in the region falling from 3.8% in 2022 to 2.6% in 2023. China is facing concerns about deflation as it recorded inflation of only 0.3% in 2023, while Japan is expected to experience a slowdown but remain above the 2% inflation target until 2025.\n\nSouth Asia's economic trajectory, outlined in the World Bank's latest update, reveals a noteworthy growth rate of just under 6 percent, outpacing other regions. However, despite this positive trend, achieving high-income status within a generation remains a formidable challenge. The region's average potential growth hovers around 5 percent, falling short of the necessary 8 percent or higher required for rapid convergence with high-income countries by 2050. Private investment, a critical driver for such acceleration, has been uneven across South Asian nations, with some experiencing negative or stagnant growth while others, like India and Bangladesh, have witnessed robust expansion, albeit with potential challenges in sustaining public investment growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, fiscal vulnerabilities persist, as all South Asian countries grapple with persistently large fiscal deficits, resulting in accelerated government debt burdens since 2010. Additionally, the region stands as the most vulnerable among Emerging Market and Developing Economies (EMDE) to climate risks, with a significant population exposed to natural disasters in the past decade. Addressing these challenges demands a multifaceted approach, including fostering private investment, fortifying fiscal positions, and developing resilience to climate risks for sustained and cleaner growth in South Asia.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)  is strategically expanding its presence in emerging markets, with the recent launch of an online store in Vietnam following the opening of physical shops in India. As growth in developed markets, including China, slows down, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to tap into the potential of Southeast Asian economies like Vietnam, India, and Indonesia. CEO Tim Cook highlighted the company's success in these markets, achieving all-time records in countries such as Mexico, Indonesia, and India. Analysts predict that over the coming years, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will increasingly focus on countries like Indonesia, Malaysia, and India, which are poised to become major contributors to Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s  global market share.\n\nThe move into Southeast Asia is also part of a broader trend among global businesses, as the region's rising middle class presents a lucrative market opportunity. However, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) may face challenges due to the high price points of its products in less developed economies. While the company currently operates its own stores in more developed regional economies like Thailand and Singapore, it has yet to establish a physical presence in countries like Indonesia. Despite potential hurdles, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) aims to replicate its success in China by employing different pricing strategies to attract customers and build a loyal user base in Southeast Asia. 15 Most Respected Countries in Asia\n\nvernon-raineil-cenzon-JZ7OowQQVgg-unsplash\n\nOur Methodology\n\nThe Human Development Index (HDI) 2021 measures a country's well-being through factors like education, life expectancy, and income. On the other hand, respect for human rights, assessed by the Human Rights Index (V-Dem 2023), complements HDI by focusing on civil liberties and political freedoms. A country fostering both indices shows a balanced approach as it ensures citizens lead dignified lives with access to essential resources, education, and health, while also upholding fundamental rights. This synergy reflects a society where individuals thrive not only economically but also within a framework of justice and fairness, earning global respect for valuing both human development and rights.\n\nHence, to list the most respected countries in Asia, we relied on the Human Development Index as well as the Human Rights Index for Asian countries. We averaged both indices to obtain an average index score. The list is now presented in ascending order.\n\nHere is a list of the most respected countries in Asia\n\n15. United Arab Emirates\n\nHuman Development Index: 0.911\n\nHuman Rights Index: 0.35\n\nAverage Index: 0.631\n\nIn 2022, UAE had a GDP per capita of $53,708.

        "title": "Why did Tim Cook’s pay package hold up in court while Elon’s failed?",
        "content": "Just a week after Elon Musk’s $55 billion Tesla payday was struck down by a Delaware judge, a New York court dismissed a challenge to Apple CEO Tim Cook’s compensation package, which clocked in at under $100 million. Some coincidence.\n\nAt face value, the two cases seem to have a lot in common. Both were shareholder suits waged against some of the highest-paid superstar tech CEOs in the world. And both were filed amid a backdrop of increased public scrutiny over executive compensation in recent years, which is near all-time highs across S&P 500 companies.\n\nBut for all their similarities, from a legal standpoint the two cases are apples and oranges—and Cook was always going to stand a better chance of holding on to his paycheck.\n\nElon Musk’s $55 billion compensation package at Tesla made headlines last month after Delaware chancellor Kathaleen McCormick ruled in favor of a shareholder who argued that Tesla was paying its CEO an unfairly high amount with the moonshot grant. Plaintiff Richard Tornetta argued that because Musk wields so much power at Tesla and maintains close relationships with his board members, the supposedly independent board of directors’ vote approving his massive pay scheme was anything but.\n\n“Chancellor McCormick found that the process for setting Elon Musk’s pay was essentially controlled by Elon Musk,” said Tulane University law professor Ann M. Lipton in an interview with Fortune. “The board didn’t engage in any kind of pushback or real bargaining.”\n\nIn response, Musk has threatened to relocate Tesla from Delaware (where almost 70% of Fortune 500 companies are incorporated) to Texas, where a more favorable political climate could leave him less exposed to these types of challenges.\n\nWhile the Musk case was focused on a broad, more abstract legal question related to the Tesla board of directors’ degree of independence, the Cook case resolved yesterday was much simpler.\n\n“The question before Delaware [in the Musk case] was simply, ‘Was the pay substantively unfair?’ whereas the question in the Tim Cook case was solely, ‘Was the proxy statement misleading?’” said Lipton.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Teamsters’ pension fund sued Apple last year, arguing that the company had misled investors by misrepresenting Cook’s 2021 and 2022 pay in its proxy statements and paying him more than it had initially proposed.\n\nBecause Cook and other Apple executives are primarily paid in equity known as RSUs, the company enlists financial models to estimate what Cook’s actual pay will be for shareholders’ approval each year.\n\n(For CEOs, being compensated primarily with stock isn’t uncommon. Mark Zuckerberg famously earns just $1 in annual salary, but he’s made billions through Meta stock grants included in his compensation package. The Economic Policy Institute found in a report last year that stock-related pay accounts for over 80% of CEO compensation.)\n\nThe pension fund that sued Cook argued that Apple misrepresented its CEO’s actual compensation package by downplaying the value of his equity. Cook and other Apple executives netted over $90 million in compensation for 2021 and 2022, higher than the $77.5 million estimate the company initially asked shareholders to vote on for approval.\n\n(Both of those figures are well below Cook’s current annual compensation; at his own request, the Apple CEO took a 40% pay cut last year. That change was approved by shareholders and the Apple board’s compensation committee, which counts former Vice President Al Gore as one of its members.)\n\nThe plaintiffs claimed that Apple used an unusual financial model to artificially deflate Cook’s pay estimate, and also buried the compensation tables in a drab, gray section of the proxy statement, where shareholders would be less likely to notice it before casting their Say-on-Pay votes. The court didn’t buy it.\n\n“What happened with Tim Cook is very common in public companies,” said Marc Hodak, partner at executive compensation consultancy Farient Advisors. “They award performance shares based on the face value of the stock. And each of those performance share units has a market value that’s higher than the face value stock at the time of grant.”\n\nOne key difference between the two cases was the size of the contested pay package. Musk’s $55 billion award from Tesla was part of the largest compensation plan in corporate history. While Cook’s $100 million annual pay is by no means a small sum, it’s on par with his peers. In fact, Apple uses a group of its competitors, including Meta, Netflix, Visa, and Cisco, to benchmark its executives’ compensation. (Notably, it added Tesla to that peer group last year.)\n\n“I don’t have any question that the size and scale of [Musk’s] pay package was a driver, both in terms of the litigation and the decision that we saw,” said Hodak. “[$55 billion] is automatically going to attract an unusual amount of scrutiny.”\n\nTaken together, these two cases do seem to hint at a broader trend toward greater scrutiny of bloated CEO pay—but Lipton advised against reading the tea leaves prematurely.\n\n“Elon Musk is beating this drum that everyone should leave Delaware, to suggest that somehow this is a trend,” said Lipton. “I think this is an Elon Musk problem. That Tim Cook thing, it was a different law. It was a different argument.”\n\nRepresentatives from Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Alphabet’s Gemini AI rollout reveals the battle lines of the coming chatbot wars",
        "content": "Andrew “Boz” Bosworth, Meta’s chief technology officer, once said that “the best product doesn’t always win. The one everyone uses does.”\n\nIt might seem strange to start a story about Alphabet with a quote from a Meta exec, but I couldn’t help thinking about Boz’s line while hearing Google execs preview their plans for today’s big public rollout of the company’s Gemini AI services. These allow people to interact with a chatbot powered by its Gemini models, as well as use generative AI features powered by the models in Google Docs, Gmail, and other Google Workspace products.\n\nGoogle likes to tout the most capable version of Gemini, which it calls Gemini Ultra 1.0, as the world’s most powerful AI model. It's true that Gemini is compatible with many different kinds of media: It can work with images, video, audio, and text better, and do so better than any other model. And according to self-reported results on more than two dozen benchmark tests, Gemini Ultra is marginally superior to OpenAI’s GPT-4 across a lot of language and reasoning tasks.\n\nChirag Dekate, vice president and analyst at tech analytics firm Gartner, says that a lot of people mistakenly see Gemini as Google still trying to play catch-up with OpenAI and Microsoft, which had a head start with ChatGPT and GPT-4 powered Microsoft products such as Bing Chat and its Copilot tools in Word and PowerPoint.\n\nWhat people are missing, Dekate says, is that with Gemini’s multimodal capabilities, Google has leapfrogged the competition. And that Google has some advantages that its competitors will find hard to match. One is YouTube, whose vast video archive is a ready source of video training data that few other companies have and that Microsoft and OpenAI certainly can’t match.\n\nAnother, according to Dekate, is Google is finally showing that its in-house AI “model generation” factory—powered by the merger of its two AI research labs DeepMind and Google Brain and the tying of the new combined Google DeepMind closer to product development teams—can churn out powerful new AI models fast, which may mean it will now be able to stay ahead, or at least not fall behind again.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut what was clear from Google’s Gemini launch is that they are not counting on performance alone to win the AI chatbot wars. This is going to be a battle fought largely over three factors that have little to do with the AI models themselves: distribution, pricing, and business model.\n\nGoogle knows where it has a strategic advantage over its rivals at Microsoft and OpenAI, and leaned heavily on them in the Gemini rollout. Among its biggest advantages is Android. Google has entrée to 3.6 billion Android users globally. And it’s planning to make it super convenient for them to use Gemini as their preferred chatbot and AI assistant. Starting today, users in the U.S. will be able to make Gemini their go-to voice-based digital assistant on their phones, replacing the old Google Assistant. (They can also use it through an app if they prefer; iOS users must access it less conveniently through the Google app.) It will be rolling out this capability in select parts of Asia, supporting English, Korean, and Japanese soon.\n\nThis is a distribution channel that Microsoft can’t match, so Google is wise to focus on it.\n\nThe fact that iOS users cannot easily make Gemini their preferred voice assistant also shows how Apple’s “walled garden” approach to iOS continues to serve as a moat. In this case, it has bought Apple time to play catch-up and ditch the current version of Siri for an LLM-powered chatbot of Apple’s own making that can match GPT-4 and Gemini. Apple is, according to reporting from Bloomberg, working its own “Apple GPT” models that are designed to rival OpenAI’s and Google’s generative AI offerings.\n\nGoogle is also hoping that people who want to access Gemini Ultra will be willing to pay $20 a month for it as part of a Google One subscription that will also let users use Gemini-powered features in Google Workspace products, such as Google Docs and Sheets.\n\nThis is pricey, but it is the same amount OpenAI charges for ChatGPT Plus subscribers, without the integration into office productivity tools, and $10 less than Microsoft charges users who want to access GPT-4 powered generative AI in Microsoft 365 products. Plus, Google One subscribers will get 2 TB of storage. Google is hoping this bundling of Gemini with other products will tip consumers toward subscribing to its AI services instead of OpenAI’s or Microsoft’s.\n\nA lot of enterprise customers of Workspace or Microsoft 365 will probably pay to access the generative AI features. But it’s unclear how many consumers are willing to pay this kind of money. They certainly won’t subscribe to more than one such AI chatbot. And there is also the question of whether they will want to use a different AI chatbot on their personal devices than the brand they use at work. A lot of people may want to use the same AI model they are accustomed to for both work and personal tasks.\n\nFresh off quarterly earnings in which Alphabet showed its subscription businesses are finally starting to show some real growth, the company is eager to double down on the business model. This is in part to quiet investor concerns that generative AI ultimately kills Google’s largely ad-driven search business.\n\nSubscriptions make a lot of sense for AI services. People want to know when they ask their AI chatbot which new running shoes they should buy, the responses are based on what the bot knows about their personal preferences, weekly mileage, and weak knees—not what Nike paid to have its shoes mentioned first by the chatbot. The best way to align the interest of the companies building the bots and consumers is with a subscription model.\n\nBut the irony here may be that Big Tech is falling in love with AI subscriptions, just as the streaming companies are falling out of love with their subscriptions because they’ve hit the limits of consumer wallets. This may foretell a brutal reckoning down the road for the premium chatbot services, too.\n\nStreaming was a business where product differentiation mattered. That’s why Netflix and Amazon and Apple and Disney spent billions on exclusive content. And that differentiation resulted in consumers feeling torn—they wanted to watch both The Queen’s Gambit and Ted Lasso. So, for a time, people were willing to pay for both Netflix and Apple TV.\n\nBut here the tech companies are spending billions essentially to ensure there’s almost no product differentiation. Dekate’s comments about Gemini’s multimodal capabilities aside, the top AI chatbots all offer fairly similar capabilities.\n\nSo the winner here is going to come down to distribution and price. And while Google’s opening moves in that regard look solid, they are a bit conservative. Google’s biggest weakness is its innovator’s dilemma. It has a huge ad business to defend, and most of the moves it makes with AI chatbots and personal assistants potentially cannibalize it. On the other hand, it has a huge ad business that could subsidize a cut-price AI offering. If I were Sundar Pichai, CEO of Google parent Alphabet, I’d be thinking hard about dropping Gemini’s $20 per month price tag and coming in even lower, at $15 per month or even less.\n\nAs Dekate points out, another advantage Google has is that it runs all of its AI applications on its own bespoke hardware, TPUs. That means it can potentially control its computing costs better than Microsoft, which is primarily reliant on Nvidia’s expensive and energy-hungry chips to run its AI services, or OpenAI, which runs its services on Microsoft’s cloud too. That, in turn, should allow Alphabet to run its AI offerings with higher operating margins.\n\nOne thing is clear: The AI chatbot wars are just getting started.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- House Oversight Chair James Comer ratcheted up pressure on the Biden administration to force TikTok Inc. to register as a foreign agent, a move that would place new scrutiny on the social media company’s ties to the Chinese government.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China Ukraine’s Army Chief Replaced After Rift With Zelenskiy Epstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings Claim Einhorn Says Markets ‘Fundamentally Broken’ By Passive, Quant Investing Citadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley’s Block-Trading Leaks\n\n“The risks in failing to do so are high, especially at a time when many Americans, particularly young people, seek and trust social media content on tech platforms as primary sources of information, counsel, and comfort,” Comer wrote in a letter Thursday to Attorney General Merrick Garland.\n\nComer, whose effort has bipartisan backing, said there’s mounting evidence that TikTok, owned by ByteDance Ltd., is used to advance China’s agenda. The Biden administration, he added, has acknowledged those concerns by banning TikTok on federal employees’ government-owned devices.\n\nTikTok has denied these claims and said it operates independently from the Chinese government.\n\nThe panel is also investigating AJ+, which is owned by Qatar-based company Al Jazeera.\n\nNeither company immediately responded to a request for comment. A Justice Department spokesperson confirmed receipt of Comer’s letter, but would not comment on its claims or other content.\n\nRegistration under the Foreign Agents Registration Act requires disclosures from people or companies that may be engaging in propaganda activities for or on behalf of foreign governments, parties or other institutions.\n\nComer also noted reports that the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States has demanded, on national security grounds, that TikTok’s Chinese owners sell their shares in the company; that the US military prohibited members from using TikTok on government-issued devices, signaling security risk concerns; and that the Biden administration has since extended the ban to all federal employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn his letter, Comer demanded documents by Feb. 22 related to TikTok’s or Al Jazeera’s FARA registration status, and any communications about how DOJ decides whether to sue or prosecute for failure to register.\n\n--With assistance from Emily Birnbaum.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jack Dorsey’s Plan to Get Elon Musk to Save Twitter Went South OpenAI’s Secret Weapon Is Sam Altman’s 33-Year-Old Lieutenant Inside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred Anymore\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "Amid recent market volatility, certain growth stocks gained favor, but many deserving businesses remain overlooked. As 2024 becomes more welcoming for bullish investors, most investors also seek fresh opportunities in different stocks. Smart stocks that can outperform in times of uncertainty may trade at a higher premium, and are increasingly in higher demand.\n\nIn recent years, the stock market has been facing much uncertainty. However, the S&P 500 surged roughly 20% over the past year. Long-term investors may expect a bumpy ride, but while uncertainties loom, consistent investment in robust businesses shows potential growth. Such investments allow one to capitalize on market highs and leverage downturns for additional investments.\n\nAlthough past performance doesn’t guarantee future success, resilient companies with solid use cases and a broad competitive advantage tend to thrive over time, contributing to a robust and diversified portfolio.  Here are three of the best industry-graded stocks that deserve a spot in your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nAchieving 9% global same-store sales growth, McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is truly the fast food behemoth investors should never miss out on. The company boasts profitability and a record-high diluted earnings per share of $11.56. While the company’s 2024 outlook is less-than-positive with some analysts downgrading the company’s profitability on its claims of becoming more affordable, growth can still be possible over time if volumes rise as a result. Thus, many investors anticipate McDonald’s growth rate slowing to the low-single-digit level, and a flat operating profit margin in the coming year.\n\nThat said, McDonald’s moat around its core brand and global presence remains unchallenged. I have another company in the same industry on this list, for the same reason. Fast food sales tend to remain robust in times of trouble. As consumers look to trade down in their dining preferences, McDonald’s could conceivably see a larger share of wallet in the overall dining sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nRenowned for pricing power, McDonald’s maintains a solid global market presence, and remains a buy in my books.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nEven with looming inflation and economic struggles, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B) is in a strategic and optimistic position. Boasting over $150 billion in cash, $341.1 billion in securities, the Warren Buffett-led giant stands out as a defensive conglomerate with growth potential. Buffett’s long-term approach emphasizes capital preservation, making it a prudent choice in downturns. With ample liquidity, Berkshire is poised to seize opportunities in a major correction.\n\nMoreover, the company’s endurance an strength are evident in its growth. The company is poised to succeed in the coming years as it showcased impressive revenue growth, from $162 to $302 billion over the past two years. With substantial investments in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Japanese firms, and others, the stock attracts value and momentum investors. As Berkshire pursues a long-term strategy, it is a value-conscious option amid tech uncertainties.\n\nRestaurant Brands (QSR) a tray of food from popeyes\n\nSource: Tony Prato / Shutterstock.com\n\nPrioritized for growth, this other fast food chain stock Restaurant Brands (NYSE:QSR) is also wasting no time in seizing new opportunities worldwide. With about 30,375 worldwide restaurants, major efforts are starting to pay massive dividends. The company has begun evaluating master franchisees and joint ventures. In Q3 2023, 250 new restaurants opened, fostering a 4.2% year-over-year increase in the overall count.\n\nRestaurant Brands emphasize service improvement through training, operations, reimagining, and appealing menus for enhanced guest satisfaction, driving comparable sales. Core platforms, menu balance, delivery expansion, promotions, breakfast focus, and product launches fueled traffic and revenue growth. Additionally, the company prioritized digital sales, with a 40% year-over-year increase in Q3 2023, driven by kiosks and delivery, reflecting vital digitalization and Tim Hortons’ growth. Optimism surrounds international digital sales growth with diverse service modes.\n\nRestaurant Brands International CEO, Josh Kobza, recently announced the acquisition of Carrols Restaurant Group, aiming for long-term, high-return investments. While solving a crucial issue adds a $750 million debt for Restaurant Brands, this deal hasn’t come without investor scrutiny. That said, if Restaurant Brands’ management team executes smoothly, the remodeling strategy could pay off big-time over the long-term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years.

        "title": "Steve Jobs Didn't Think He Needed To Shower Because He Only Ate Fruit — But His Body Odor Had Him Banished To The Night Shift When Colleagues Complained About The Smell",
        "content": "Steve Jobs, the iconic figure behind Apple Inc., was known for his eccentric lifestyle choices. He lived on his terms, distinct from societal norms.\n\nJobs had a diet that significantly influenced his personal and professional life. His dietary habits included fasting for days, followed by consuming simple leafy vegetables and water. He was known for spending weeks eating the same type of food, such as apples or carrot salads, and then abruptly stopping or going on a fast.\n\nDuring a period of following a fruitarian diet, Jobs reportedly visited an apple orchard and the experience inspired the company name Apple. He considered the name to be \"fun, spirited and not intimidating,\" a sentiment Apple Co-Founder Steve Wozniak shared. They ultimately decided on this name for their company.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nDid you know StartEngine Private is your portal to investing in venture-backed businesses without spending millions? Join the ranks of investors like Bill Gates and Mark Cuban by tapping into early-stage startups. Get the inside scoop on this innovative startup here.\n\nJobs's fruit-based diet resulted in another theory that he was very wrong about.\n\nWalter Isaacson's biography of Jobs indicates that Jobs felt showers were unnecessary for someone who ate a clean, fruit-based diet. He also believed there was no need for deodorant. This led to some issues at Atari Corp., where his colleagues were disturbed by his body odor, resulting in Jobs being moved to the night shift.\n\nIt wasn't just at Atari. Former Apple CEO Mike Markkula informed Isaacson that he and the team insisted Jobs take showers before allowing him to participate in meetings.\n\nJobs's disregard for conventional hygiene practices, as noted in his biography, was not the only quirk of his habits. He was also known for his constant nail-biting, a habit that might be seen as an outlet for the intense pressure and stress that came with his position as a leading innovator in the tech industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nTrending: Cheddar was acquired for $200 million yielding a return of 370.37% for its investors. This startup aims to replicate and potentially surpass this success.\n\nThe most visually defining aspect of Jobs's habits was his iconic uniform: a black turtleneck, blue jeans and New Balance sneakers. This choice was influenced by his visit to Japan in the 1980s, where he was inspired by the concept of a uniform after seeing Sony's employees.\n\nInitially, Jobs attempted to introduce a uniform at Apple, but after facing rejection, he adopted his own uniform, designed by Issey Miyake. Jobs kept over a hundred black turtlenecks, which cost $175 at the time, simplifying his daily choices and creating an iconic image that became synonymous with his brand.\n\nJobs's habits, from his unusual approach to hygiene to his constant nail-biting and adoption of a minimalist uniform, paint the picture of a man who was not only a technological visionary but also a person with idiosyncrasies.\n\nThese habits underline the principle that innovation and genius often come with unconventional traits. Jobs's legacy in technology is unparalleled, yet his quirks offer a more nuanced understanding of the man behind the Apple brand, highlighting the complexities that can exist behind a public persona.\n\nRead Next:\n\nThis startup is accepting investors for as little as 25 cents – what’s the catch?

        "title": "Apple's Holiday Quarter Broke Years-Long Streak Of Revenue Declines But China Slowdown Overshadowed Even Its Record Service Revenue",
        "content": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) reported its fourth earnings last week. Although slumping demand for smartphones didn’t bring down its earnings, weak demand in China overshadowed its first sales growth in a year that came as a result of record service revenue. In addition, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) dethroned Apple as the world’s most valuable company in January as it hit the $3 trillion market capitalization while Apple’s slipped below this milestone. Microsoft also reported its strongest profit growth in more than two years as it continues to infuse AI across its business and offerings.\n\nFourth Quarter Highlights\n\nApple posted revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, topping Wall Street expectations of $117.91 billion. Apple also reported record earnings per share of $2.18, also topping $2.11 that analysts had predicted. Net income rose 13% to $34 billion.\n\nNet iPhone sales grew almost 6% YoY to $69.7 billion while global iPad sales dropped to $7 billion, down from $9 billion reported for 2022’s comparable quarter.\n\nWhile sales in Europe and Japan rose, revenue in China slumped 13% YoY to $20.8 billion. Demand in China has slowed more than expected in response to rising competition from Huawei as well as Beijing restriction on its products. According to Counterpoint Research, overall China smartphone sales grew 6.6% and although Apple maintained its leadership with 20.2% market share, its sales dropped 9% while Huawei experienced a sales rise of as much as 71%.\n\nBut the services segment that houses its App Store, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple TV, continues to be a rising star as its revenue grew 11% YoY to 23.1 billion.\n\nThe iPhone might no longer be the best indicator of Apple’s health...\n\nServices were undoubtedly the star of the latest quarterly report that came one day after Apple’s biggest product launch in about a decade- the Vision Pro headset. Priced at $3,499, Apple spent an estimated $100 billion to develop this product it hopes to become the must-have piece of home electronics. More importantly, this product is the ultimate opportunity for Tim Cook to make his own Apple legacy.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Apple splurged on its AppleTV+ content and it has scored it as many as 13 Academy Award nominations, with ten of them being for the Killers of The Flower Moon. But, this is kind of expected as Apple built its biggest movie industry bet with the all-time-great director, screenwriter and producer, Mr. Martin Scorsese.\n\nApple posted strong numbers and it showed that services continue to grow and become a bigger part of the tech giant’s business, but China is a lingering concern. In response to this slowdown in China, Apple even offered a rare discount for its latest iPhone in January. Cook also confirmed that generative AI software features are coming on Apple’s iOS and other platforms later this year, which is only to be expected considering that Microsoft, Google and Samsung’s latest figures were fueled by such enhancements. But considering that Apple is known for being secretive about its next moves, Cook’s confirmation and tease could mean that Apple’s AI plans are ambitious, to say the least. After all, there’s nothing artificial about AI and generative AI’s business potential nor the the latest figures that Microsoft and Google posted, and this is just the beginning of a new era that is in the making.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we will be navigating through the 25 largest economies in the world in 2024. If you wish to skip our detailed analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Largest Economies in the World in 2024.\n\n2023: An Uncertain Year for the Global Economy\n\n2023 was the year when the global economy witnessed an uneven recovery from the aftereffects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the war in Ukraine. Overall, the economic activity was unable to return to pre-pandemic levels in the emerging market and developing economies. Tightening monetary policies against inflation also played a primary role in limiting a global economic rebound. According to the projectionsreported by the IMF in October 2023, advanced economies were to experience an economic slowdown in 2023. It was also forecasted that the growth for emerging markets and developing economies would decline modestly.\n\nLet’s analyze how the world’s leading economies such as the United States, China, and India faced economic uncertainty in 2023. The United States performed better than expected due to the resilience shown by its labor market and housing market. Although the Federal Reserve continued to engage in interest rate hikes, unemployment was only 3.7% during the third quarter of 2023. Homeowners were also capable of sustaining their net worth amid high home prices.\n\nChina, the world’s second-largest economy, was referred to as a burden to global economic growth in 2023. On December 29, 2023, CNNreported that various challenges restrict progress for China. The slowdown effect on the overall economy in 2023 resulted from the strong lockdowns imposed on Beijing during the pandemic’s outbreak. Due to the rising scrutiny, foreign direct investment in China experienced a strong decline during the third quarter of 2023. Other limiting factors include a property crisis and high unemployment rates among the youth. Another economic issue relates to demographics such as the declining fertility rates which could reduce the labor supply and increase the debt burden for the country in the future. Against the structural problems in the economy, the Chinese government appears to be hopeful for the economy to rebound.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring a challenging global economic environment, India has emerged as a resilient power which contributed 16% to the world’s growth in 2023. On January 15, the World Economic Forumreported that India is all set to become the world’s third-largest economy over the next five years. Between 2022 and 2023, the country was successful in achieving the second-highest growth rate among other G20 nations. Apart from fostering innovation and technology, India has also been investing in public infrastructure.\n\nGlobal Economic Outlook for 2024\n\nAsreported by the International Monetary Fund, global economic growth which was estimated at 3.1% in 2023 is expected to remain at 3.1% in 2024. Although this projected growth is higher than the last forecast made in October 2023, it is still lower than the historical annual average of 3.8%.\n\nRegional Forecast for Economies in 2024\n\nFor advanced economies, the IMF has projected that their economic growth will drop from 1.6% in 2023 to 1.5% in 2024 before slightly going up to 1.8% in 2025. In the case of the United States, growth has been forecasted to drop from 2.5% in 2023 to 2.1% in 2024. Simultaneously, the euro area is expected to experience a recovery in its growth rate. This recovery will be backed up by circumstances such as real income growth, reduced inflation, and stronger household consumption due to the subsiding effects of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, a conflict that broke out almost two years ago. Due to the diminishing effects of high energy prices, the United Kingdom will also be witnessing a modest rise in its economic growth in 2024.\n\nFor the emerging market and developing economies, growth will continue to remain at 4.1% in 2024 before it climbs higher in 2025. In Asia, India and China serve to be the leading global powers. Backed up by its domestic demand, the economic growth of India will remain resilient.On the other hand,China’s growth has been projected at 4.6% in 2024 which exceeds the previously forecasted growth rate due to a higher government spending for tackling natural calamities, and a stronger than expected growth in 2023.Emerging and developing Europe is also expected to improve its economic growth from 2.7% in 2023 to 2.8% in 2024.\n\nUnited States: A Powerful Economic and Business Hub\n\nBeing an advanced economy, the United States hosts some of the most valuable companies worldwide. Some of the companies thriving in the US and internationally include Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Let's take a look at what these companies have been up to.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) strives to enhance customer experience and foster economic growth using generative AI. On February 8, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reported that it has joined the U.S. Artificial Intelligence Safety Institute Consortium. This collaboration is focused on developing and deploying safe and responsible AI. The firm will also be contributing $5 million to the National Institute of Standards and Technology which has established the consortium, to ultimately help organizations gauge the safety of their foundation models.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) builds upon innovation to cater to a global digital audience. On February 7, the company reported that it has updated the Microsoft Copilot by improving the overall experience with the use of AI and introducing new suggested prompts and image creation capabilities. Microsoft Copilot has created more than 5 billion chats and 5 billion images up till now. Images generated can also be customized using inline editing. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) also plans to launch Designer GPT inside Copilot which will be offering a canvas for visualizing ideas.\n\nAs of 2024, Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) installed base of active devices has exceeded 2.2 billion globally. On February 1, the company reported strong financial results for the first quarter of fiscal 2024. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported earnings per share of $2.18, beating EPS estimate by $0.08. The company's revenue for the quarter amounted to $119.58 billion, up 2.07% year-over-year and ahead of revenue consensus by $1.31 billion.\n\nWith this context, let's take a look at the 25 largest economies in the world in 2024. 25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024\n\n25 Largest Economies in the World in 2024\n\nOur Methodology:\n\nIn order to compile a list of the 25 largest economies in the world in 2024, we sourced data from the IMF.

        "title": "Big Tech’s $140 Billion Cash Haul Points to Shareholder Returns",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech is bringing in more cash than ever before, priming the group to return money to shareholders and potentially adding fuel to a rally that’s already sent most of the group into record territory.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nA 99% Bond Wipeout Hands Hedge Funds a Harsh Lesson on China Epstein Contacted Staley for Years at Barclays Using Go-Between, Court Filings Claim Ukraine’s Army Chief Leaves After Rift With Zelenskiy Citadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley’s Block-Trading Leaks Xi’s Markets Shakeup Surprised Insiders, Showing Alarm Over Rout\n\nThe five biggest technology companies that have reported earnings so far — Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. — generated a record $139.5 billion of combined cash from operations in the quarter that ended on Dec. 31, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nInvestors can “expect excess free cash flow to largely be returned to shareholders given these companies already possess strong balance sheets and high net cash positions,” said Angelo Zino, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research. “Greater focus on capital returns will help contribute to shareholder value over time and is better than holding onto excess cash on the balance sheet.”\n\nOnly Apple, Microsoft and now Meta have dividend plans in this group. While having cash in the bank is a good position to be in, investors appreciate when companies invest any excess money for better opportunities or return it to shareholders.\n\nIn some ways, it has become more challenging for the firms to spend it. Amazon last month abandoned a $1.4 billion purchase of Roomba maker iRobot Corp. after clashing with European Union regulators. Microsoft eventually completed its $69 billion acquisition of video game maker Activision Blizzard, but only after two-years of trans-Atlantic scrutiny that threatened to scupper the deal.\n\nBuybacks on the other hand are seen as a way to return profits to investors while reducing the number of shares outstanding — theoretically increasing the value of the remaining stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nSuch moves enable firms to demonstrate that they are profitable, well-performing and believe their shares are still undervalued. “The confidence signaled by the payment or increase of a dividend can be a powerful boost to sentiment,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\nRead More: Meta’s $197 Billion Surge Is Biggest in Stock-Market History\n\nMeta showed what aggressive capital returns can do when it initiated a quarterly dividend and earmarked $50 billion in funds for share repurchases. Aided by a stronger than expected sales forecast, its stock on Friday saw the biggest single-day market value gain in market history.\n\n“You rewind 10 years ago when a tech company starts giving a dividend — it’s usually the beginning of the end of growth,” Gene Munster, co-founder and managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said in an interview. But Meta’s dividend came alongside continued investments signaling “they believe they can achieve growth in AI and Reality Labs by doing this themselves,” he said, referring to the unit building the firm’s version of the metaverse.\n\nStill, there are also reasons for investor caution, notes AJ Bell’s Mould, citing how buybacks can be used to juice earnings per share figures by reducing share count, for example.\n\nBig Tech has spent about $186 billion on buybacks over the last 12 months, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. While Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Meta have consistently spent billions in buying back stock, Amazon has been a notable hold out recently.\n\nThe e-commerce giant is one of the most obvious candidates to increase its capital returns. It generated a record $42.5 billion in cash in the fourth quarter but didn’t repurchase any shares and doesn’t pay a dividend. Its cash and cash equivalents are at about $87 billion, just shy of a 2021 record.\n\n“Stock buybacks are more likely to be the norm to boost EPS,” said Ted Mortonson, technology desk sector strategist at Baird. “In the ‘new GenAI’ world, paying a dividend will not be a signal of growth deceleration.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nArm Holdings Plc jumps as much as 41% on Thursday, its biggest intraday rise on record, after the chip designer’s third-quarter results surged past expectations, allowing the company to boost its full-year forecast. The stock also touched a fresh intraday record of $108.35.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nSoftBank Group Corp. swung to its first profit after four quarters of losses and sketched out how it will reposition its strategy around artificial intelligence and its prized asset, Arm Holdings Plc.\n\nChip designer Arm was headed for its biggest gain since the stock debuted in New York last year after issuing a surprisingly bullish earnings forecast, showing its push beyond smartphones is helping fuel growth. Apple Inc.’s limited release of the Vision Pro headset is fostering a resale market that’s pricing the device far beyond its $3,500 starting price. South Korean prosecutors are appealing a Seoul court ruling that cleared Samsung Electronics Co. Executive Chairman Jay Y. Lee of all charges including stock-price manipulation and accounting fraud.

        "title": "2 Explosive Growth Stocks to Buy in 2024",
        "content": "Choosing the right stocks for your portfolio takes time, patience, and effort. You need to understand and identify your investment goals as well as life goals. While the plans you have for retirement, for example, might change with time, you need to have an idea of why you're investing and what you want to invest in.\n\nYou should understand the level of risk you're comfortable with and choose companies you know well and are willing to hold for at least five years in your portfolio. You should also make sure you're putting cash into quality businesses that have durable competitive advantages and compelling financials, or a path to stable financial growth.\n\nIf you're looking for explosive growth stocks to buy now and hold for the long run, here are two companies to scoop up as 2024 begins.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is a name that needs no introduction, and while growth rates may not be what they were several years ago given the ongoing changes in discretionary consumer spending, this is a business that continues to pack a powerful punch in a wide range of market environments. Not only does the company control an incredible 25% share of the smartphone market -- more than any other competitor -- but it also just reported another quarter of record business milestones.\n\nAs of Apple's fiscal 2024 first quarter, ended Dec. 30, 2023, it had more than 2.2 billion active devices installed for customers worldwide. That figure represented a new record for the business. Apple's net sales and profits in the first quarter were driven primarily by iPhone sales and a new sales milestone in the company's services segment.\n\nWhile Apple is known for its hardware devices -- the latest addition being its just-launched Vision Pro headset that runs for a cool $3,500 -- the company's subscription-based services division is slowly but surely accounting for more and more of its overall growth. That segment includes products like Apple Music, Apple TV+, Apple News+, Apple Fitness+, app purchases from the iTunes store, and advertising revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the first quarter of fiscal 2024, Apple reported net sales of about $120 billion, up 2% from one year ago, and net income of $34 billion, a 13% year-over-year bump. Of that net sales total, $70 billion came from iPhone sales while $23 billion was attributable to its services segment. In other words, those two segments combined comprised more than three-quarters of Apple's net sales in the three-month period.\n\nApple also reported earnings per share (EPS) of $2.18, up 16% from one year ago and a new company record. Plus, the company has been an extremely reliable dividend payer through the years. Despite the stock having a yield of 1%, Apple has raised its payout by approximately 120% over the past decade.\n\nApple's dominance of the smartphone market, its broad collection of other market-leading hardware products, and continued adoption of its asset-light subscription-based services are enabling robust performance on both the top and bottom lines. If you're looking for a stock to buy, hold, and keep adding to through the years, Apple seems like a no-brainer contender for your buy list.\n\n2. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) may not be as familiar to some investors as companies like Amazon, Shopify, or Etsy. However, this e-commerce giant has an impressive lineup of businesses and the balance sheet to match. The company is the largest e-commerce entity and most visited online marketplace in Latin America. MercadoLibre's online platform habitually receives about half a billion visitors per month, and accounts for more than one-fifth of all retail sales that occur in region.\n\nThe Latin American e-commerce market has historically been very underpenetrated, primarily due to varying degrees of technological connectivity throughout the region and troublesome logistics options. However, the region is quickly catching up to the advent of e-commerce.\n\nThe total addressable market opportunity is booming as adoption of online retail explodes and cross-border sales rise from merchants in the region. For example, one Morgan Stanley study estimated that the Latin American e-commerce market would hit a valuation of $200 billion by 2025.\n\nMercadoLibre doesn't just operate the region's top e-commerce platform. Other businesses include a leading fintech platform with a variety of offerings including credit card and consumer loan products, its own logistics network, advertising services, and more. Mercado Pago, its payment processing platform, generates almost as payment volume offline as it does online.\n\nYears ago, MercadoLibre recognized that in a heavily cash-based society, plenty of merchants in brick-and-mortar stores needed a more optimized way to process payments for customers. The company launched mobile point-of-sale (POS) devices nearly a decade ago, and business has exploded since that time.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, MercadoLibre reported gross merchandise volume of more than $11 billion, a 60% increase from the year prior. Net revenue for the three-month period totaled just shy of $4 billion, a 70% surge from one year ago. The company's credit portfolio increased 23% year over year to $3.4 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, online total payment volume totaled $47 billion, while offline total payment volume hit $35 billion. Those two figures represented year-over-year hikes of 121% and 145%, respectively. These numbers are phenomenal in any market environment, particularly one where economic conditions are strained globally.\n\nImportantly, MercadoLibre is gaining more and more control over the entire customer journey from purchase to delivery, with its logistics network handling 94.2% of deliveries in the third quarter of 2023. The shares are up 50% from a year ago, but it's not too late for investors who wish to benefit from its long-term potential.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Adds Apple declines to comment, earlier comment in paragraph 5)\n\nMADRID, Feb 8 (Reuters) - Spain's high court has suspended 194 million euros ($209 million) in fines imposed on Amazon and Apple by the local antitrust watchdog in July, pending an appeal by the tech giants, an Amazon spokesperson said on Thursday.\n\nCNMC, as the watchdog is known, fined Amazon and Apple for colluding to prevent dealers other than Amazon from selling Apple wares on Amazon's websites in Spain.\n\nApple was fined 143.6 million euros and Amazon 50.5 million euros and both companies at the time said they would appeal.\n\nThe court decision to suspend the payment is part of the appeal process, the Amazon spokesperson said.\n\nAmazon said in July that as a result of the deal with Apple, the number of discounts on Apple devices on Amazon's websites increased, while Apple said the deal was intended to protect customers from fake devices.\n\nThe suspension of the fine does not anticipate the court will rule in favour or against the tech giants.\n\nAn Apple spokesperson declined to comment on Thursday.\n\nCNMC said a contract signed by the two companies in October 2018 granting Amazon the status of authorised Apple dealer on its websites in Spain included anti-competitive clauses that prevented more than 90% of the existing retailers from selling Apple wares on Amazon's market place.\n\nFollowing these contracts, Amazon also reduced the capacity of retailers in the European Union based outside Spain to access Spanish customers, and restricted the advertising Apple's competitors were allowed to place on its website when users searched for Apple products, the regulator said.\n\nA similar case was opened in Italy against the two companies but was eventually dropped.\n\n($1 = 0.9275 euros) (Reporting by Inti Landauro; Editing by Sonali Paul, Kirsten Donovan)",

Listen, earnings season rolls on, after the bell today. Disney, PayPal, just interested to get your thoughts on what you make of earnings season so far. You've seen about 70%, I think you have companies beat expectations. That is above the historical average, but what have been your big takeaways?\n\n- Yeah, earnings actually have been generally pretty good. I think investors are happy to see that we're out of this-- the earnings recession and the slump that we saw there, but we're still in an environment, to me, that is these haves and have nots, and that's something that-- a thesis that I've been talking about for some time, is that there's a select group of companies, some of this is the Magnificent Seven, and there's others in other sectors that are winners.\n\nAnd then the have nots are these losers. So for stock pickers or people looking to stay, let's take some risk and move back into areas that either had done well a few years ago, it's been challenged and we're seeing that in earnings season. Look at the bifurcation between Meta and Snap. You can choose, really, two companies in any sector and say, who's done it right and who's done it well? And really what investors are focusing here, is on that efficiency, right?\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's kind of a sad thing to say, but companies that have embarked on layoffs are actually being rewarded by the market because it's improving their profit margins and the like. So to me, it's not clear that it's all clear on the earnings side, but we are seeing some companies really put up some strong numbers.\n\n- Although Snap is one that's cutting and maybe the market thinks it's not cutting it up. We've been sort of playing a fun parlor game that seems to be happening in the market right now, which is, is the Magnificent Seven still the Magnificent Seven and what's the new Fang or Mag Seven, or whatever you want to call it? Or, is it still just the Mag Seven?\n\n- Yeah, it's interesting. So it was FANG, then FANGM. And then more recently, Magnificent Seven. Now we're hearing Sensational Six, or keeping--\n\n- Dynamic Duo, I've heard that one.\n\n- Right? It's like, you know, now people are saying keep the Magnificent Seven because we kind of like it and then maybe swap out Tesla. But what's fascinating to me is, I actually went back and looked through time, Magnificent Seven as a term didn't exist in 2013. But I went back to Meta's IPO to measure this and if you look at the divergence, the average range between the best performing and the worst performing name out of the Magnificent Seven, there are some years where it's over-- on a rolling 12 month basis-- over 1,000%.\n\nNow some of that is Tesla's outsized gains. But also remember, Meta was in a huge slump for some time. There's been times where people have counted out Apple. So I'm not ready to give up at all on the Magnificent Seven, even including Tesla. Of course, time will tell, but these companies on average-- at least compared to the other 493, are showing high top line revenue growth, high strong margin growth. And in a market, which has this uncertainty, whether it's from commercial real estate or other areas, that's where investors are saying, hey, it's not so bad what I want to sell stocks. But if I'm going to buy, I'm going to stick to the mega caps.",

        "content": "In this article, we discuss 10 best augmented reality stocks under $5. If you want to skip our detailed discussion on the augmented reality industry, head directly to 5 Best Augmented Reality Stocks Under $5.\n\nAugmented reality technology is found in broad applications within entertainment, training, brand engagement, augmented surgeries, virtual tours, and quality control, among others. Small and medium-sized enterprises are increasingly adopting this technology to improve customer experiences and stay competitive in the market. Industries such as manufacturing, healthcare, retail, gaming, education, and automotive are actively embracing AR for training, maintenance, assistance, and monitoring purposes. The augmented reality market is expected to grow due to increased smartphone adoption and app integration, according to Fortune Business Insights. Moreover, key market players collaborating with 5G providers to address latency issues are anticipated to drive market growth. For example, in May 2022, Telstra Group Limited (ASX:TLS), an Australian telecommunications company, partnered with Google and Accenture to create a 5G-powered augmented reality experience at Melbourne’s Marvel Stadium. Such collaborations among major tech providers are likely to enhance the potential of AR in diverse innovative and immersive applications.\n\nThe AR market was valued at $42.20 billion in 2022 and is forecasted to reach $1.11 trillion by 2030, exhibiting a 50.7% compound annual growth rate. In 2022, the North American augmented reality market was valued at $13.72 billion. Key industry players like PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), QUALCOMM Incorporated (NASDAQ:QCOM), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) offer different AR solutions. For instance, PTC Inc. (NASDAQ:PTC) provides products like Vuforia AR, Vuforia Studio, Vuforia Expert Capture, Vuforia Instruct, and Vuforia Spatial Toolbox, while Google LLC offers ARCore, an AR platform featuring cloud anchors, environmental HDR, and depth for digital objects.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn 2023, we witnessed the launch of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)’s Meta Quest 3 and Meta Quest Pro, alongside Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s premium VR device, targeted either as a creative tool or a luxury item due to its high price. This year might unveil Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s anticipated AR glasses. Different devices, like the Apple Glasses and Meta Quest Pro, will strive to offer unique experiences. Some will emphasize a sophisticated high-end encounter, while others will prioritize lightweight and simplicity, understanding that current headset sizes and weights deter adoption for many users. Online platforms enabling remote teamwork will evolve in 2024, aiming for increased immersion and practicality. Despite the popularity of remote work, certain aspects of in-person communication are challenging to replicate. Collaborative mixed reality tools are expected to utilize VR and AR more extensively, capturing and expressing the subtle nuances of interaction that are difficult to convey through video calls.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s Tim Cook unveiled the \"Vision Pro,\" an augmented reality headset, during the WWDC event in June 2023. According to Cook, it represents a new kind of computer that enhances user experience through the most natural and intuitive methods. He likened its significance to the introduction of previous Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) products, suggesting that just as the Mac brought personal computing and the iPhone brought mobile computing, the Vision Pro will introduce us to spatial computing. The Vision Pro marks Apple's entry into a significant new product category, the first since 2015. Priced at $3,499, this headset seamlessly combines virtual and augmented reality. Historically, this market has been somewhat specialized, with Meta holding a dominant position. However, Apple aims to leverage advanced technology and its renowned marketing skills to elevate this sector. During the launch event at Apple's New York store, CEO Tim Cook highlighted the device's impressive interface, describing it as a \"magical way to control\" the headset. The Vision Pro utilizes eye movement and hand gestures for navigation, offering users immersive experiences. Cook draws parallels between the Vision Pro's debut and the launches of other iconic Apple devices, such as the Mac, iPod, and iPhone, emphasizing that it now stands among the groundbreaking products in Apple's history.\n\nNew entrants are creating a buzz in the augmented reality space. For example, Xreal, a maker of augmented reality glasses, is in the process of raising $60 million in funding, bringing its total funding to over $300 million and valuing the company at more than $1 billion. The CEO, Chi Xu, aims to stay ahead of competitors like Apple, Meta Platforms, and Google in the augmented reality space. Xreal, a Chinese startup, holds approximately 4% of the overall mixed reality market, with a significant presence in the AR-only devices sector. The funds will support the production of 2 million devices next year, with a target of going public in the United States within the next two years. The company anticipates generating $100 million to $150 million in revenue in 2024 and between $200 million and $300 million in 2025.\n\nAlthough the augmented reality market is dominated by tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), we discuss AR stocks under $5 in this article.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe used a stock screener and filtered out augmented reality stocks that were under or close to $5 as of February 6.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in February 2024",
        "content": "Technology is one of the fastest-growing sectors in the stock market. With implications like generative AI and quantum computing having implications in sectors ranging from retail to healthcare, it is no wonder that investors are always looking for the next big disruptive tech company to invest in. Of course, despite the explosive growth and popularity of AI, it can be difficult to pinpoint a good investment due to this sector’s recent surge in valuation. With so many companies hitting all-time highs and beating sector median P/E ratio valuations, many investors have become hesitant to enter an already overvalued market. This has led to this list of undervalued tech stocks to buy.\n\nFurthermore, with so many complex parts in the tech industry such as learning how semiconductors work, understanding cloud software, to a range of other sectors, it can be difficult for even the most intelligent investors to find promising companies amidst walls of complex terminology and information. As such, in this article, we aim to examine this industry more deeply and highlight three undervalued tech stocks with great potential going forward.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a company that works on internet services and technology innovations to make people’s lives easier and more connected. The stock is up over 40% in the past year with an average 1-year Yahoo Finance analyst price target of $160.46, far above the current share price of around $144.93.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company is planning on expanding GFiber, its business related to Wi-Fi and internet connectivity. As such, it is expanding out to investors and has recently signed deals to bring its services to 25 additional cities and therefore grow its customer base. This makes it one of those undervalued tech stocks to buy.\n\nWith a forward PEG ratio of 1.29x compared to the sector median of 1.65x, Alphabet stands relatively undervalued compared to its competitors when we consider its earnings growth potential over the next year. Analysts expect EPS to grow at over 16% for next year which showcases the company’s growth prospects. As this well-known tech giant recovers from its dropoff early last year, investors should all consider scooping a few Alphabet shares before this stock’s valuation loses its attractiveness.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META) is a company that focuses on social media and technology, offering platforms where people can communicate online. The stock is up over 140% in the past year with an average 1-year Yahoo Finance analyst price target of $475.96, far above the current share price of around $450.\n\nThe company recently had an earnings report on February 1 of this year and reported an EPS of $5.33, which beat expectations by $0.36. With a revenue of $40.11 billion, it also beat revenue expectations by over $940 million. This highlights how even with concerns over Zuckerberg’s MMA fighting, the company is still more than thriving.\n\nTaking a look at its valuation, Meta has a PEG ratio of 0.44x compared to the sector median of 0.86x. Thus, Meta is relatively undervalued compared to its competitors when we consider its earnings growth potential. With EPS expected to grow at over 34% next year, the company has explosive potential to continue growing with the AI boom into 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) is the largest semiconductor manufacturer and plays a vital role throughout the tech industry. It is the backbone of the semiconductor manufacturing industry, making chips for some of the largest companies such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Currently, it has a market cap of $472 billion. Yahoo Finance analysts project a one-year range of $100-$133, with an average price of $120.\r\n\r\nThe semiconductor industry is valued at around $570 billion and is projected to grow at a CAGR of 12.2% until 2029. One of the main ways TSMC intends to capitalize on this growth is by expanding its foundries throughout the globe. Its plans to develop sites in both Arizona and Germany marks its first ventures outside Asia.\n\nTSMC currently has a P/E ratio of around 23.1x, mostly aligning with industry standards. While this valuation may not be the most undervalued, given TSMC’s continued average earnings growth of around 23.6% and its rapid stock increase driven by demand from AI, this valuation puts Taiwan Semiconductor as an exception tech pick for this month.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "2 Unstoppable Stocks to Buy and Hold for 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The stock market has produced considerable returns for many investors over the years, and it's never too early or too late to plan for a better financial future. The types of stocks you buy and even your risk tolerance may change throughout your investing journey, but it's always a good time to hold quality businesses that are poised to deliver long-term meaningful growth.\n\nWhether you're a new or experienced investor, you don't want to overlook the following two names as you construct your basket of winning stocks.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has delivered a total return of roughly 350% over the trailing five years, thanks to its continued dividend increases and solid share-price performance. To give you an idea of just how fantastic that number is, the S&P 500 has delivered a total return of 100% in that same time frame.\n\nEconomic headwinds come and go. While there's no denying that shifts in consumer spending are impacting most growth-oriented businesses -- and tech giants are no exception -- Apple continues to maintain a significant moat. Its smartphone business is the leading driver of this moat and continued growth. This is despite recent weakness in sales of some other hardware products, as well as a slowdown in sales in its third-largest market, China, due to increased competition in the region.\n\nSmartphone sales accounted for $70 billion of Apple's total net sales of $120 billion in the first quarter of its fiscal 2024, which the company reported on Feb. 1. The other major needle-mover for Apple right now is its services segment, which revolves around its collection of subscription-based offerings. Services net sales totaled $23 billion for the quarter, a noteworthy 11% bump from one year ago.\n\nApple doesn't individually report advertising sales -- they're included in its overall services segment. However, the company's advertising potential across its family of apps and through the App Store is a still heavily untapped secret weapon. According to a study by Statista, advertising sales could bring in over $6 billion in revenue for the company in 2024 alone, which is still a fraction of its overall revenue but far from insignificant.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe growing balance between the asset-heavy and asset-light components of Apple's business and the fact that subscription-related sales are growing at such a rapid clip is noteworthy. Services segment sales were about three times higher than either Mac or iPad sales in the recent quarter. While consumers may be more hesitant to shell out hundreds or thousands of dollars to purchase a brand-new iPad or Mac right now, paying an additional subscription fee for music, news, or streaming entertainment is a more palatable expense.\n\nApple may be one of the most well-known names in tech, and its history of innovation and continued expansion in all market environments has made it a mainstay for many investors. The company is also well-positioned for near-term bumps in the road with $173 billion in cash and investments on hand. This stock looks like a worthy addition to any well-diversified portfolio in 2024 and beyond.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has had to contend with a difficult environment in the last few years, but its focus on operational efficiency and profitability is paying off. The full-year 2023 was fantastic for the business on multiple fronts. It saw robust earnings and cash flow, as well as favorable growth across its core businesses.\n\nIn 2023, net sales jumped 12% year over year to $575 billion, while net income reversed from a net loss of $2.7 billion in 2022 to a whopping gain of $30 billion of net income. Looking back beyond year-over-year comparisons, Amazon's net sales and net income in 2023 represented respective growth rates of 105% and 150% from 2019.\n\nRight now, the company's cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is the most notable driver of profitability. Of Amazon's total operating income of $37 billion in 2023, $25 billion was derived from AWS. Trailing-12-month operating cash flow rose 82% to $85 billion, while free cash flow for that period hit $37 billion.\n\nConcerns about discretionary consumer spending remain front and center. Amazon reported that customers purchased over 1 billion products on its e-commerce platform from its deal-driven Black Friday and Cyber Monday events. Millions of new customers added Prime memberships to their accounts in 2023. And customers bought more goods on Amazon in the 2023 holiday season than any previous year on record.\n\nOnline-store sales contributed $232 billion to Amazon's net sales total for full-year 2023, while fees derived from third-party seller services added $140 billion to the top line. E-commerce is still the largest driver of top-line growth for Amazon, followed by AWS, advertising services, and subscription-based services.\n\nAmazon is incorporating artificial intelligence (AI) solutions into many of its properties, from improving product listings on its flagship e-commerce platform to driving better advertising decisions to its AWS offerings. For example, Mitsubishi UFJ Financial Group, Inc. signed a multiyear agreement with AWS, part of which will involve deploying generative AI application builder Amazon Bedrock across over 100 new-use cases for its financial services business. Similarly, biopharmaceutical giant Amgen plans to build upon its existing partnership with the company and use Amazon SageMaker, a cloud-based machine-learning platform, to streamline the drug development process.\n\nThere's a lot to like about Amazon's flagship and newer streams of business growth. Investors might find that it's an opportune time to capitalize on that long-term potential before shares move higher.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The EU is throwing its weight around the business world",
        "content": "The European Union is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data, social media content, and the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers. And it has readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe actions are raising the stakes for how companies operate both inside and outside the EU. Just last month, EU opposition to a union of two American tech companies — Amazon (AMZN) and robot vacuum maker iRobot (IRBT) — was enough for the firms to call off their $1.4 billion merger.

(AP Photo/Michael Sohn, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nResistance from the EU was also enough to persuade Silicon Valley-based Photoshop maker Adobe to give up on plans to acquire San Francisco-based web-based design platform Figma and motivate US biotech giant Illumina to sell off a cancer-screening company called Grail.\n\nBig companies in the US and across the globe now face a critical decision: Do they adjust the way they make products and provide services to the EU’s more aggressive laws, or bet that more lenient regulations will take hold in other countries where they operate?\n\n'The Brussels effect'\n\nSome giant companies that operate globally aren’t willing to take the chance of tiptoeing around the EU, which remains the world’s third-largest economy and is home to roughly 450 million people.\n\n\"We've seen businesses say, ‘I'm going to build my products, my widgets, my service, to align with the most restrictive guidelines and not have different jurisdictional approaches,'\" Jordan Fischer, a lecturer on cross-border information governance at the University of California Berkeley and partner at Constangy.\n\nThis pressure to adopt the EU’s version of business compliance even outside its jurisdiction is growing, though isn't new. It's known as \"the Brussels effect,\" a term coined in 2012 by Columbia Law School professor Anu Bradfordto to describe how the EU's aggressive legislation exerts “unprecedented and deeply underestimated global power.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBrussels, in Belgium, is considered the unofficial capital of the EU.

(Bosca78 via Getty Images)\n\n\"Companies with customers, or hopes of future business, in the EU decide to comply with the regulations in order to be able to continue selling into the EU, and interacting with potential EU consumers,\" said Meredith Kolsky Lewis, director of cross-border legal studies at University at Buffalo School of Law.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US.\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell even though that industrial union had received approval in the US. In 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions. GE Chairman and CEO John Welch, left, and Honeywell Chairman and CEO Michael Bonsignore, right, shake hands during a press conference in 2000 where GE agreed to acquire Honeywell. The firms eventually called off the deal due to EU opposition.

The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations of companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) , Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT), and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\n\"Where regulation like the GDPR has the biggest effect — it's actually outside of Europe, in countries in the developing world,\" said Charles Kenny, an economist and senior fellow at the Washington think tank Center for Global Development.\n\n“And I think that's sad. I think it's something that European rule makers and regulators tend not to take into account.\"\n\nIn response to tech regulations that include GDPR, which Kenny said made no exceptions for startups, a group of African Union nations formed an alliance to advocate for rules more friendly to entrepreneurs in poor nations like Sierra Leone and Ghana.\n\n\"It's not a big problem for the Googles of the world, or the Facebooks of the world, to comply. It is a big problem for small tech startups,\" Kenny said, adding that he agrees that certain levels of regulation are needed.\n\n\"I worry the same might happen with these AI regulations.\"\n\nThe EU does intend to apply new legal restraints around artificial intelligence this year after EU members last week signaled their agreement on the world’s first comprehensive legislation to regulate AI.\n\nThe new rules will focus on uses of AI technology and classify how heavily they are regulated depending on how risky the application is, with facial recognition and certain medical innovations requiring approval before being made available to customers.\n\nFederal laws specific to AI don’t exist yet in the US, and it’s unknown whether that will happen.\n\nThe combination of the added tech regulations from the EU and confusion within the US as to its own intentions means more uncertainty and further complexity for global businesses, Lewis said.\n\nDespite the hard line that the EU has taken with its tech laws, Fischer said there is reason for companies to hope that the EU and the US will come into greater alignment. She pointed to a framework concluded with the US this year known as the Trade and Technology Council.\n\n\"I think that makes a lot of companies breathe a little bit easier. Not easy. But easier,\" Fischer said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Apple’s Vision Pro Headset Is Being Resold for $5,000 Overseas",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s limited release of the Vision Pro headset is fostering a resale market that’s pricing the device far beyond its $3,500 starting price.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCitadel Among Hedge Funds That Got Morgan Stanley’s Block-Trading Leaks Tesla Asks Which Jobs Are Critical, Stoking Layoff Fears China Replaces Top Markets Regulator as Xi Tries to End Rout Haley Loses Nevada Primary to ‘None of These Candidates’ Option US Commercial Real Estate Contagion Is Now Moving to Europe\n\nOn Japan’s Mercari marketplace, the base 256GB model sold for ¥800,000 ($5,400), sellers on China’s Taobao are asking 36,000 yuan ($5,000) and there’s one seller on Singapore’s Lazada seeking S$8,500 ($6,300) for the device. In Hong Kong’s bustling Mong Kok, an electronics importer specializing in getting gadgets early asks for HK$35,800 ($4,580), with the price shifting on a daily basis. His advice: best to wait.\n\nCupertino, California-based Apple put the Vision Pro on sale in a limited number of stores in the US at the start of this month, with an elaborate setup and customization process for each buyer. The company wants to ensure an optimal first experience with its virtual reality goggles — which it dubs a spatial computer, owing to the hand gestures used to control it.\n\nQuestions remain about how big the consumer market is for so-called extended reality (XR) devices, and especially ones with a price like the Vision Pro’s. But the gadget’s early exclusivity is pushing prices up.\n\n“Our observations indicate inflated prices on unofficial channels, reaching up to 40,000 yuan for Vision Pro units,” Counterpoint Research analyst Ivan Lam said. “However, these purchases likely represent a limited supply, originating from outside markets and deviating from typical consumer behavior.”\n\nThe drive to acquire an early unit of the new device comes from various sources, IDC analyst Bryan Ma said. Beyond dedicated Apple fans, overseas software developers as well as industry players and rivals will want to get hands-on experience quickly to figure out their next steps, according to Ma.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s main rival in the space is Meta Platforms Inc., the leader in VR with its Quest goggles. While the Quest is not in the same price class as the Vision Pro, there is an incumbent there: Finland’s Varjo Technologies Oy. Set up by former Nokia engineers, Varjo has a long list of enterprise customers for its XR glasses, which cost upward of $3,990 and are used for tasks like pilot training and industrial design visualiation.\n\n--With assistance from Gao Yuan and Takashi Mochizuki.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nInside a Private Jet Club Where Everything Went Wrong The Story Elon Musk Doesn’t Want to Talk About Layoffs Show That Tech Jobs Aren’t Sacred Anymore HSBC’s New ‘Wise Killer’ App Vies for FX Customers Why China Is Limping Into the Year of the Dragon\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed a lawsuit accusing Apple of overpaying Chief Executive Tim Cook and other top executives by tens of millions of dollars by miscalculating the value of performance-based stock awards.\n\nU.S. District Judge Jennifer Rochon in Manhattan said the iPhone maker described its pay methods in detailed compensation tables in its 2023 proxy statement, \"precisely\" as securities laws and U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission rules require.\n\nRochon also found no proof that Apple's board of directors acted improperly in awarding pay, and said the plaintiff, a pension fund affiliated with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, did not give the board enough time to consider its objections before suing.\n\nLawyers for the pension fund did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nThe plaintiff said Apple in 2021 and 2022 awarded a respective $92.7 million and $94 million of performance-based restricted stock units to Cook and four other executives, though its compensation committee intended to award just $77.5 million each year.\n\nIt attributed the alleged error to the committee's improper calculation of the RSUs' fair values at the time of the grants, and said it misled shareholders who would be casting advisory votes on executive compensation, known as \"say-on-pay.\"\n\nCook's compensation totaled about $99 million in both 2021 and 2022, including more than $82 million of stock awards each year, Apple proxy filings show.\n\nHis total pay declined to $63.2 million for 2023. The four other Apple executives were each awarded more than $26 million in each of the three years.\n\nThe case is International Brotherhood of Teamsters, Garage Employees Local 272 Labor Management Pension Fund v Apple Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 23-01867.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Stephen Coates)",

        "title": "Will Apple launch a foldable iPhone?",
        "content": "According to a new report from The Information, Apple (AAPL) has two new active prototypes of foldable phones in the works. Whether or not those prototypes will ever make it to market, however, is up for debate.\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley breaks down the latest development for Apple and what it could mean for the company moving forward.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Nicholas Jacobino\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Is Apple finally planning to introduce a flip iPhone? According to a new report by the information, Apple has at least two active prototypes of foldable phones. Yahoo Finance's Dan Howley joins us now with more. So active prototypes, what does that mean?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: It means a few things. It means that they are interested in this kind of technology. It's something that other competitors have out there. We have Samsung and Google with flip phones right now.\n\nThere's a bunch in China. And I think that's really where the kind of interest lies, especially for Apple. You're seeing more consumers in China pick up foldable phones.\n\nThey're advanced. They have better capabilities. They're also pretty darn cool, right? I mean, I've used them a couple of times and they're fun. So I think what Apple is trying to do here is kind of what Apple does, keep up with the Joneses as far as what's popular and then add its own spin on it, provide its own capabilities.\n\nThe big thing here, though, is it's a prototype, it does not mean that one is coming. Apple, like every other company, develops prototypes and then shelves them forever. They go in that little box from-- was it \"Raiders of the Lost Ark,\" I think, and just sits in a warehouse somewhere forever. So it doesn't necessarily mean we're going to get one, but the prospect it's looking a little more promising. Though according to this report, it wouldn't happen anytime in the next year or so.\n\nStory continues\n\nJOSH LIPTON: And some people, they might be asking, what could they do with a flip phone that they couldn't do with this?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Right, so that's a good idea-- a good question. The idea is that this is a large phone, right? Where's my iPhone? I have the 15 Pro Max, so it's a big boy--\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: --kind of chunky. The idea would be, OK, well, I don't want this big screen or I want a bigger screen than this. I can just fold it in half and then just drop it in my pocket and there you go.\n\nWith Samsung, they have the Z Flip and the Z Fold. The Z Flip-- this right here is the Z Fold where it kind of opens like a book. The Z Flip is one that opens like a clam-shell.\n\nAnd so the clam-shell design, I'm going to be honest, is awesome. I love it. You can like unfold it halfway, and then let it sit on its own and prop itself up, and then take selfies.\n\nIt's also incredible to slap that thing shut when you're ending a phone call, even if you're not mad at someone, just to be feel like you're like--\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Satisfying finality of ending the call.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Bam!\n\nJULIE HYMAN: So Dan, obviously, you have had experience with it. For viewers who are not familiar, Dan went to South Korea, got to see how the flip phone was made, got to test it out. How is that thing selling for Samsung?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: For Samsung they're selling surprisingly well. They are more expensive than most phones, right? So the Z Fold is the most expensive. That's the Fold right there.\n\nThe Flip is less expensive, around $1,000 . I believe the Fold is $1,800, around there. So it's a spicy meatball as, I guess, someone would say.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Yes, you just did.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: I have to say, I was on the train yesterday and I was watching a show on my regular sized iPhone. And the guy next to me pulled out like an iPad or something and I thought, huh, that would be nice to watch something on a bigger screen, but I don't want to carry around the iPad.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, there you go.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: And that's the exact point there.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: That's it.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: So I mean you get the bigger screen, you get the better styling, because it does look really nice. And there's more functionality to it. So I think if Apple can do it, they will. I just don't think they're going to release something that's frankly kind of bulky when it's folded up like Samsung's devices.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, you can see it though, higher price, medium margins, China.\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I mean, that's the big thing, I think, is for them is for China.\n\nJOSH LIPTON: Yeah, makes sense. Dan, thank you, as always, for joining us.",

        "title": "7 Stocks to Buy to Outperform ‘The Magnificent Seven’",
        "content": "You’ve likely heard a lot about the “Magnificent Seven” stocks lately. These companies included in this group are: Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Meta (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This group of Big Tech elite companies have been trouncing the broader market over the past year with their strong returns.\n\nBut there are still great opportunities to find stocks that can outperform these heavyweights. Don’t get me wrong – the Magnificent Seven should form the core of most growth stock portfolios. However, by digging deeper, smaller yet rapidly-growing companies in high-potential sectors could supercharge your investment returns.\n\nMy aim isn’t to uncover “the next Amazon” or predict which small caps will reach trillion-dollar valuations. Instead, I look for quality businesses with vast addressable markets, durable competitive advantages, and the ability to compound earnings substantially over long periods. The seven stocks revealed here check all those boxes.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFTAI Aviation (FTAI) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nFTAI Aviation’s (NASDAQ:FTAI) performance has been nothing short of remarkable lately. This high-flyer has skyrocketed 143% over the past 12 months, with momentum only accelerating as of late. Just take a look at the company’s five-year return – up a whopping 348%!\n\nNow, stocks posting triple-digit gains tend to make me cautious, wondering whether their share price is getting detached from financial realities. However, one glance at FTAI Aviation’s financial statements shows this is no house of cards.\n\nFTAI owns and manages commercial aircraft engines, focusing on the widely-used CFM56 models. The company also invests in other aviation assets and aerospace products, churning out strong cash flows with room for earnings growth. Revenue in Q3 2023 hit $291.1 million, a 26.4% year-over-year increase. Meanwhile, net income landed at $41.3 million, representing fat profit margins of 14.2%. To put it bluntly, this is a much more profitable enterprise than 85% of its business services peers.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, the good times look set to continue. Consensus estimates call for 50% annual earnings per share growth over the next two years, with the stock trading at a forward price-earnings ratio of 26-times 2024 estimates. It’s not exactly cheap, but you’re paying up for quality. And at 4.5-times expected 2024 revenue, I don’t think the company’s valuation is outrageous by any means.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) AI stocks an intelligent robot figure representing ai stocks, investing for the next decade. Artificial Intelligence Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) has been an absolute superstar, too. Shares have gone vertical over the past few weeks, riding the mounting hype around artificial intelligence. There’s no denying Super Micro has made all the right moves to capitalize on this mega trend. However, with the company’s stock price detached from its fundamentals, we could see significant downside if AI mania cools off.\n\nLet’s take a sober look at the numbers. SMCI stock currently changes hands at roughly 30-times forward earnings and 2.2-times expected FY2024 sales. That’s pretty rich for a company projected to grow revenue at a 20% annual clip moving forward. Still, profits should expand even faster, given what was reported in Super Micro’s blowout Q4 report. The company trounced earnings per share estimates by 8.3% and beat the revenue consensus by 12.5%. Indeed, those are strong results by any measure. Plus, it should be noted that semiconductor companies trade at much steeper premiums. This valuation isn’t out of the ordinary in its industry.\n\nIf AI hype continues gaining momentum, SMCI stock has ample room to grow into its lofty valuation. But with this stock seemingly priced to perfection, one slight disappointment could spell trouble. Consider me cautiously optimistic here. I like what Super Micro is building.\n\nSurgePays (SURG) undervalued fintech stocks A concept image of a hand reaching toward the word \"Fintech,\" which is surrounded by icons representing money and growth. Fintech Stock Bargains, fintech stock\n\nSource: Wright Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor an under-the-radar pick, allow me to highlight SurgePays (NASDAQ:SURG). This tiny company has somehow flown completely beneath Wall Street’s radar, meaning hardly any analysts provide coverage on the company. But once you peek under the hood, I think you’ll agree that SurgePays has intriguing potential.\n\nSurgePays offers a suite of financial and telecom products catering to underbanked and underserved groups across the United States. The company’s core product is a fintech platform empowering retail clerks to handle transactions like prepaid wireless plans, gift cards, and debit services at the point of sale. It’s a win-win arrangement – partner stores profit on each transaction while providing valuable services to customers. SurgePays also utilizes federal subsidies to supply tablet devices and cellular broadband to income-eligible households.\n\nRight now, SurgePays sports a market cap equal to annual revenue. Shares trade at just 4.7-times forward earnings, despite just $5.5 million of debt against $12.7 million of cash in the coffers. This year, SurgePays acquired ClearLine Mobile in a $15 million deal funded by a recent equity offering. Growth is the name of the game, and I applaud the recent move to scoop up a fast-growing target while SURG stock itself remains attractively-priced.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) semiconductor stocks Close-up electronic circuit board. technology style concept. representing semiconductor stocks. top semiconductor stocks to buy now. chip stocks to sell\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) has been an absolute star player in the broader semiconductor space. As a leading electronic design automation (EDA) outfit, Synopsys provides mission-critical tools and services that chipmakers rely on to design and manufacture advanced semiconductors. With the industry running on all cylinders, it’s no surprise SNPS stock has lit up the scoreboard.\n\nIn Q3, Synopsys grew revenue to over $1.6 billion, a 24.5% year-over-year surge. Meanwhile, its net margins approached 22%, powering 83% profit growth over the same period last year. This level of expansion is tremendously impressive. Due to this tremendous performance, SNPS shares have tacked on 55% over the past 52 weeks.\n\nAs a long-term partner enabling Nvidia’s innovations, Synopsys has also benefited handsomely from the GPU giant’s success. The bottom line is that Synopsys is significantly more profitable than 95% of industry peers. At 42-times forward earnings, the valuation gives me minimal pause, considering the quality of this business. So long as AI and next-gen chips drive multi-year growth runways, I expect SNPS stock to continue compounding at an enviable clip.\n\nTransDigm Group (TDG) a jet takes off on a clear runway.\n\nSource: m.photo / Shutterstock.com\n\nTransDigm Group (NYSE:TDG) is a leading designer and producer of highly-engineered aircraft components and systems. Through its 48 subsidiaries, TransDigm boasts an impressive portfolio serving both commercial and military aircraft manufacturers.\n\nI love seeing the profit engine firing on all cylinders here. TransDigm reported a 22.4% net margin last quarter, handily besting more than 90% of aerospace and defense peers. Zooming out further, the company’s three-year annualized earnings per share growth rate comes in at nearly 40% (excluding non-recurring items). And if we just look at the past year, earnings per share growth excluding these items came in hot at a blistering 63.5%.\n\nRevenue rose 21% in 2023, supported by 27% growth in the high-margin aftermarket commercial segment. TransDigm continues to benefit from the ongoing recovery in global air travel. Shares trade at 35-times forward earnings, which I’m perfectly comfortable paying for durable earnings growth in the high single-digits. Additionally, the company’s 4Q report was superb, with TransDigm beating estimates across the board on revenue, EBITDA, and EPS. Plus, management announced a special $2 billion dividend on top of upbeat 2024 guidance. Sign me up!\n\nAxon Enterprise (AXON) A drone being used by soldiers.\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nAxon Enterprise (NASDAQ:AXON) is undoubtedly pricy by traditional valuation standards. Shares trade hands at 67-times forward earnings and 12.4-times expected 2023 sales. But I believe the TASER maker’s entrenched position supplying non-lethal weapons to global law enforcement agencies warrants a premium.\n\nExpected to deliver 30%+ revenue growth this year alongside 76% bottom line expansion, Axon is firing on all cylinders. The company continues rolling out innovative technologies like body cameras, records management software, drone solutions, and training to become the premier public safety tech provider.\n\nWith elections nearing, we could see rising tensions on the streets. Axon would likely benefit from a tough-on-crime stance from future administrations. The recent Fusus acquisition and new body camera line for commercial markets should also boost the company’s total addressable market (TAM) by more than $20 billion. So, while this stock’s sticker price gives me a moment’s pause, I remain firmly bullish on Axon’s long-term outlook.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen I look at e-commerce and fintech growth exposure overseas, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) remains high on my buy list. Dubbed the “Amazon of Latin America,” MercadoLibre operates online marketplaces spanning 18 countries and serving more than 148 million users.\n\nDespite torrid growth, MercadoLibre’s balance sheet has surprisingly little debt with a 0.6-times net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. This financial strength provides ample dry powder for continued growth. Consensus estimates call for 35% annualized earnings per share growth over the next decade, which would result in a profitability boost of 13x from 2023 to 2032.\n\nSo, while shares trade at a meaty 77-times forward earnings today, I believe that the multiple on MELI stock could actually prove conservative given MercadoLibre’s vast runway. As Latin America’s middle class expands, the adoption of e-commerce and digital payments should accelerate. With market leadership secured, MercadoLibre remains my top pick to capitalize on this multi-year tailwind.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Stocks such as Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) and Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) have been among the worst performers. And while investors should steer clear of those stinkers, there are a few blue-chip names worth buying on the dip. Here are seven Dow stocks to buy on the dip: February 2024.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn the lead-up to its recent fourth-quarter earnings, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock fell from a 52-week high. Its market cap dropped below $3 trillion. And it lost the title of the world’s most valuable publicly traded company to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Unfortunately, Apple slipped even more after the Q4 results showed a 13% decline in iPhone sales across China. The good news is much of the hand-wringing is overdone, and there are still good reasons to buy Apple shares.\n\nWhile it is true that sales of Apple’s electronic devices such as its iPhone, iPad, and MacBook computer have slowed, the services side of the company has more than made up for any shortfall. In addition, Apple still beat Wall Street’s expectations on the top and bottom lines with its Q4 print. Revenue rose in the quarter, breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of declines.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple is one of the top Dow stocks to buy before it resumes its growth trajectory.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's restaurant in Thailand.\n\nSource: Tama2u / Shutterstock\n\nAnother one of the top Dow stocks to buy on dips is McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). After the quick-service restaurant chain reported mixed financial results, the stock slipped. However, McDonald’s fourth-quarter results were strong. For example, MCD reported fourth-quarter earnings per share (EPS) of $2.95, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.82. Sales increased 8% year over year, with total revenue coming in at $6.41 billion, which was a little less than the $6.45 billion forecast by analysts.\n\nMcDonald’s blamed the revenue miss on the escalating conflict in the Middle East, which has hurt its global sales. Outside the Middle East, all other global markets, including China, reported positive same-store sales growth. Domestic same-store sales at McDonald’s rose 4.3%, in line with Wall Street forecasts. MCD stock is down 4% on the year and ripe for the picking.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext up on this list of top Dow stocks to buy is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). While the tech giant’s results managed to beat expectations on Wall Street, they didn’t blow away estimates. Plus, there was very little mention of artificial intelligence (AI) to be found in its report. This appears to have left investors feeling underwhelmed, which led to a pullback in the MSFT stock. However, investors should buy the dip.\n\nWhile Microsoft is only now starting to monetize AI, the company continues to demonstrate strong growth in its cloud-computing unit, with revenue from its Intelligent Cloud segment rising 20% from a year earlier to $25.88 billion. During Q4 2023, Microsoft closed its $68 billion acquisition of video game publisher Activision Blizzard, its largest deal ever. The company has also announced custom cloud microchips and started selling a $30 monthly Copilot AI add-on with its software bundles.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) logo on gas station sign with \"diesel\" and \"food mart\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nU.S. oil giant Chevron (NYSE:CVX) has seen its stock fall 10% over the last 12 months as earnings have been eroded by a decline in crude prices. After posting record profits in 2022 when crude oil was trading above $100 a barrel, Chevron has had to contend with a steady decline over the last year. However, there are still reasons to buy CVX stock. These include a dividend payment that the company just increased by 8%, taking the yield on the stock to 4.28%.\n\nChevron now pays out a strong quarterly dividend of $1.63 per share. Despite its profit in 2023 declining by 40%, the company still returned a record $23.60 billion to shareholders by paying out $11.30 billion in dividends and buying back $14.90 billion of its own stock. And although crude oil is currently trading around $73.50 per barrel, Chevron still managed to produce a record 3.1 million oil-equivalent barrels per day last year as the company boosted its capital expenditures.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile it hasn’t been immune to the bank stock downturn, shares of JPMorgan Chase (NYSE: JPM) have fared better than most of its peers. Over the past year, JPM stock has gained 23%, including a 2% increase so far in 2024. The world’s biggest lender with $4 trillion of assets under management has proven to be more immune to high-interest rates than smaller banks.\n\nWhile JPMorgan reported mixed Q4 2023 financial results, the print was due to a $3 billion fee it was forced to pay related to the government’s seizure of failed regional lenders. However, despite the fee it paid to the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, JPMorgan is still viewed as having come out of last year’s regional banking crisis as a winner. It acquired First Republic, a midsized lender to wealthy families, amid the collapse of several regional lenders across the U.S. First Republic is already having a positive impact on JPMorgan Chase’s earnings, according to the bank.\n\nNike (NKE) A stack of red Nike (NKE) shoe boxes.\n\nSource: mimohe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSneaker giant Nike (NYSE:NKE) has been one of the worst-performing Dow components over the last few years. Over the last year, for example, the stock plummeted about 20%. Not helping, its share price plunged 12% in a single day in December after its sales guidance for 2024 was lowered. The good news is that Nike’s stock looks to have bottomed right around $100 per share. Each time the share price dips below that level, it quickly regains its footing.\n\nPatient investors who take a position in NKE stock now are likely to be rewarded with future gains coming off the current bottom. And while Nike’s most recent earnings print was mixed, it contained some encouraging data. For example, the company’s gross margin rose for the first time in 18 months and reached 44.6%; inventories declined 14%; and sales in China, an important market for the company, rose 10.1%, which was the fastest pace of growth since May 2023.\n\nIt will likely take time to recover, but Nike is a Dow stock to buy on the dip.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhile Visa (NYSE:V) has been volatile, investors might want to buy one of the dips. After all, the company just reported Q4 2023 financial results that beat analysts’ forecasts across the board. It also issued upbeat guidance as consumer spending remains resilient in the face of inflation and high-interest rates. It also posted EPS of $2.41, which topped Wall Street estimates of $2.34.\n\nRevenue in Q4 2023 totaled $8.60 billion, up 9% from a year earlier and ahead of forecasts that called for $8.50 billion in sales.\n\nLooking ahead, Visa said that it expects revenue growth in the current first quarter of 2024 in the “upper-mid to high-single digits” and profit growth in the “high-teens.” Visa said its payment volumes, which cover the year-end holiday shopping season, rose 8% in Q4 2023, while cross-border volumes increased 16%. The company’s total transactions in Q4 rose nearly 10% to $57.50 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in AAPL and MSFT.

        "title": "3 Chip Stocks You Should Still Be Buying Despite Intel’s Disappointing Guidance",
        "content": "When Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) reported earnings two weeks ago, it sent semiconductor shares reeling. A weak outlook due to stronger-than-usual seasonal headwinds and inventory issues sent shivers through the sector. But don’t worry — chip stocks to buy are leading the market again.\n\nHowever, as Intel’s earnings show, not all semiconductor stocks are created equally. The chipmaker will continue to lead the market in PC CPUs for years to come but it will be playing catch up to other tech companies as artificial intelligence (AI) continues moving towards center stage.\n\nBelow are three chip stocks to buy that won’t be left behind. These companies will come into their own as the industry moves forward.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of those chip stocks to buy, as it reported earnings after Intel, to help convince investors that the market was not all doom and gloom. Although its Q1 guidance was nothing earth-shattering and fell short of expectations in some respects, where it counted the chipmaker was on point.\n\nAMD expects $3.5 billion in data center revenue in 2024, a 75% increase from its previous outlook of over $2 billion. In the December quarter, the chipmaker’s data center revenue jumped 38% from last year but was 43% higher than the prior quarter. It secured record revenue in CPU and data center GPU, which even exceeded management’s expectations. That was driven higher by the release of its new AI chip, the MI300X GPU, which is seeing quick uptake by customers.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices is naturally second to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which has dominated the market. However, Advanced Micro Devices’ new chip could steal a chunk of business away from Nvidia. It’s reportedly faster and more efficient than its rival’s H100 chip and was expected to be sold at a discount as well.\n\nInvestors should expect AMD’s data center business to continue rising at a smart clip in the years to come. There will be periods when there’s a lull. Any weakness in the stock price is an opportunity to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nMobile chip stock Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is the next chip stock investors should be buying despite Intel’s weakness. It has a massive 80% share of the Ethernet switch market and is the major supplier for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) smartphone chips. The tech giant recently signed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement for Broadcom’s 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. Apple represents 20% of the chipmaker’s revenue.\n\nThe big driver now and for the foreseeable future will be AI chips. Broadcom said generative AI represented close to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter or 20% of total semiconductor revenue. Its AI accelerators from hyperscalers should drive networking revenue 30% higher in 2024. Now that it has completed its VMWare acquisition, software will be a future accelerator of its own.\n\nBroadcom’s excellent operating margins help it generate significant cash flows. Last year it generated $17.6 billion in free cash flow. VMWare has it forecasting even greater cash flow growth going forward. That led the chipmaker to hike its dividend 14% to $5.25 per share. The payout yields 1.7% annually.\n\nWith AI spending rising and possibly growing exponentially, look for Broadcom to reap a large share of that money.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nExpect Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) to continue its leading performance amongst Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Android phones. While even management expected segment sales to be soft, demand for Android phones in China showed surprising strength. It suggests a recovery is underway. That bodes well for long-term growth for the chipmaker as revenue for the business was up 23% year-over-year. It also improved 16% sequentially.\n\nApple and Samsung each account for more than 10% of Qualcomm’s revenue. Analysts thought the iPhone upgrade cycle was over but it appears it’s on the next leg higher. Apple just had a record fourth quarter for sales in China where the iPhone gained market share, as well as record sales in India. There is robust growth elsewhere around the world too.\n\nAlthough Samsung lost the crown of the world’s biggest phone seller to Apple, it bodes well for Qualcomm no matter who is on top. Because it owns the essential patents used in mobile handsets it should continue enjoying a steady stream of royalty income. Qualcomm is another chip stock to buy for long term wealth creation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Big Tech’s earnings season is in full swing, and though AI chip giant Nvidia (NVDA) won’t report its results until Feb. 21, there are plenty of insights to glean already. Chief among them is that AI continues to push a huge portion of the conversation for corporate earnings and that fundamental business practices are still important.\n\nSo far, Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Amazon (AMZN), AMD (AMD), Apple (AAPL), Intel (INTC), Meta (META), and Microsoft (MSFT) have largely posted solid reports, but not every company is seeing positive stock moves.\n\nShares of Apple and Google parent Alphabet fell after they reported disappointing sales in their China and advertising businesses, respectively, while shares of Intel and AMD were hammered on lower-than-expected outlooks for the current quarter.\n\nAmazon, Meta, and Microsoft, meanwhile, are riding high thanks to big moves in their most important business segments, including consumer sales, advertising, and the cloud.\n\nAnd while it might not seem like it, there are some common threads running through the stock market’s reaction to these earnings reports. From AI investments to advertising and regional sales, Big Tech’s latest earnings have laid out some valuable lessons.\n\nAI is still king\n\nIf you need more proof that Wall Street’s obsession with AI is still going strong, look no further than how many companies talked up the technology during their earnings calls. Microsoft said its AI offerings added a 6% revenue boost to its Azure cloud business, up from a 3% contribution in the prior quarter, and 1% in the quarter before that. That might not sound like a huge amount, but it allows Microsoft to illustrate that its AI moves are beginning to pay off.\n\nUBS analyst Karl Keirstead wrote in an investor note following the company’s earnings that the quarter-over-quarter increase in AI’s growth is proof Azure is seeing a “flow-through of AI demand”’ and a return on capital expenditures. China troubles: Apple CEO Tim Cook in New York City, (REUTERS/Brendan McDermid) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives, meanwhile, said that Microsoft’s AI-powered Copilots are drawing plenty of interest from enterprise customers. Microsoft’s Copilots are essentially AI-powered apps and include Copilot for Microsoft 365 and the Windows Copilot, which now comes installed on Windows 11 computers.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Copilot conversions appear to be exploding across the MSFT ecosystem as the AI Revolution has begun with partners/customers lining up for the Copilot deployments,” Ives wrote in a note.\n\nMicrosoft wasn’t the only company to call out AI. Amazon debuted its new Rufus generative AI shopping bot just ahead of earnings, helping the company better illustrate how generative AI fits into its consumer offerings.\n\nAlphabet CEO Sundar Pichai also brought up his company’s AI investments at the top of its earnings call, laying out how the technology is being integrated into Google Search, while Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg hit on that company’s AI moves and investments.\n\n“If we succeed, everyone who uses our services will have a world-class AI assistant to help get things done, every creator will have an AI that their community can engage with, every business will have an AI that their customers can interact with to buy goods and get support, and every developer will have a state-of-the-art open-source model to build with,” Zuckerberg said during his company’s earnings call. World-class AI assistants? Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg. (Photo: REUTERS/Carlos Barria) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIntel and AMD, meanwhile, discussed their AI chips and the momentum they’re seeing in the space. Finally, Apple’s Tim Cook revealed that the company is diving deeper into AI with generative AI investments.\n\n“We’ve got some things that we are incredibly excited about that we will be [showing] later this year,” Cook said during the call.\n\n\"I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with [generative] AI and AI,\" he later added in response to an analyst's question.\n\nWe’ll likely learn more about Apple’s AI moves during its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in June. Investors hope the technology will provide a boost to iPhone sales by adding new features that get customers itching to upgrade.\n\nThere’s no replacement for fundamentals\n\nWhile AI continues to drive much of the conversation around Big Tech earnings, this season also taught us that business fundamentals are still key to driving share prices on Wall Street.\n\nAlphabet and Apple proved that the hard way.\n\nWhile both companies beat analysts’ expectations on the top and bottom lines, they also missed anticipated revenue in specific business segments. Alphabet fell short on ad revenue in the quarter, posting $65.5 billion versus expectations of $65.8 billion. Alphabet shares dropped following the news.

        "title": "Apple and Google received panicked letters from a Scottish council after their GPS kept sending vehicles down a flight of steps",
        "content": "We’ve all had that moment where we realized we need to be wary of GPS. You track down a highly recommended restaurant on Google Maps only to find it moved location a couple of weeks ago. Or you take an Apple Maps-approved shortcut straight into a dead end. On rare occasions, you might even find yourself unwittingly bareling down a flight of Edinburgh steps.\n\nThat last one might sound like hyperbole, but it’s an issue a surprising number of drivers in the capital of Scotland found themselves in over' the last couple of months.\n\nThe issue became widespread enough that the City of Edinburgh council was forced to get in touch with Apple and Google to ask the tech giants to update their GPS, short for Global Positioning System, after out-of-date maps left multiple drivers stranded in a stairway beside a pub.\n\nDrivers get a surprise\n\nThe council installed steps on the city's Greenside Lane and blocked the road off from traffic as part of street design guidance that sought to make the street similar to others in the city, including those linking to the famous Royal Mile.\n\nHowever, those updates weren’t reflected in Apple Maps or Google Maps, which continued to direct drivers down the path.\n\nReports began to emerge last month that the issue was leading to cars getting stuck on the steps beside the Theatre Royal Pub, with the Metroreporting that a Toyota Prius and SUV were known victims of the mix-up.\n\nTry going down Greenside Lane! [Clue: Don’t] pic.twitter.com/iwAQVEzK68\n\n— Kiddy (@BellsdykeBairn) December 29, 2023\n\nAmused residents have taken to social media to publicize a trend that was at risk of becoming endemic, and also appears to have affected heavy-duty transit vans and delivery vehicles.\n\nOne of those unfortunate people, an unnamed delivery driver, told BBC Scotland: \"I was just following the sat-nav. I always remember I used to come down this way. I followed it and just got stuck.”\n\nStory continues\n\n\"I had no idea there was a step there, I used to come down this way. I am a bit embarrassed about it.\"\n\nIt's happened again! Greenside Lane this afternoon. . . .#Edinburghpic.twitter.com/ziht7lpqhi\n\n— Alan Wilson (@AlanWilson_SP) January 18, 2024\n\nLetters to Google and Apple\n\nIn a paper published last week, the council said it had been made aware the change had led vehicles to careen into the steps.\n\nA representative for the City of Edinburgh told Fortune that Google had updated its GPS to reflect that Greenside Lane was no longer suitable for cars, while Apple had been asked to make a correction.\n\nFortune has approached Apple for comment.\n\nAn experiment carried out by Fortune using both Google Maps and Apple Maps shows drivers are no longer directed down Greenside Lane. A representative for Google confirmed to Fortune that it had updated its map as soon as it was made aware of the change.\n\nWhile it waited to confirm the maps had been updated, the council installed a temporary barrier to prevent further accidents from happening.\n\nCouncillor Scott Arthur, the city’s transport and environment convener, said: “The footpath in this area is incredibly busy, so these incidents are really concerning.\n\n“While we would expect drivers to use common sense in a situation like this, we are going to install temporary barriers this week to prevent it happening again.\n\n“Sat Nav is an incredibly useful tool, but it’s no substitute for common sense. Cars and trucks don’t go down steps.”\n\nBe wary of GPS\n\nGPS, or as Brits call it, “sat-nav” (short for satellite navigation), has improved by leaps and bounds since it was first popularized among consumers as an in-car attachment.\n\nAccording to Google, the map is updated constantly or, to quote its maps group: “literally, every second of every day!\" The group appears to use a \"Swiss cheese model\" of risk management, where layered defenses minimize the possibility of a notable error occurring.\n\n“We’re constantly collecting new information about the world, whether from satellite imagery and Street View cars, or Google Maps users and local business owners, and using that information to update the map.”\n\nBut smaller updates, including the placement of a few steps, are much harder for satellites to pick up on a map, and updates may slip through the net.\n\nOn this occasion, it seems Google and Apple’s various avenues for updating the map fell short in Edinburgh.\n\nThe accidents in Scotland's capital, which didn’t lead to any reported injuries, offer a sobering reminder of the limits of modern-day technology, particularly as drivers begin to embrace the autonomous driving.\n\nAnd the incident serves as a reminder, next time you’re directed down a side street, to make sure to double-check what’s really there.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "7 Timeless Tech Stocks to Buy and Never Let Go",
        "content": "As we enter February 2024, it’s a good time to reevaluate our portfolios and ensure we’re positioned for long-term growth. Tech stocks have been some of the best performers over the past two decades, with massive shifts towards AI, cloud computing, and quantum computing propelling future gains. While I often cover intriguing under-the-radar names, today I want to discuss seven timeless tech stocks that should form the enduring core of your portfolio.\n\nMany of us get distracted chasing the latest hot tech stock, but making emotional snap decisions often leads us astray. Instead, I recommend taking a deep breath and focusing on tech stalwarts with proven track records, dominant market positions, and secular growth trends that will drive revenue growth for years to come. These stocks may lack sky-high glamor but offer resilience and steady gains that outweigh short-term hype. Let’s take a look!\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs we kick off 2024, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of my highest conviction long-term holds. This tech titan has been firing on all cylinders under Satya Nadella’s leadership, which is evidenced by its meteoric rise to become the world’s most valuable company. If you look at Microsoft’s stock chart over the past decade, it paints a picture of outstanding compound growth that I expect to continue flowing in shareholders’ brokerage accounts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMicrosoft struck gold by funding OpenAI, providing immense leverage over ChatGPT and other coveted AI models set to penetrate the mainstream. Cloud computing has also fueled tremendous growth lately, with no signs of slowing as enterprises rapidly migrate more workloads to Azure. Microsoft also wields additional leverage in nascent quantum computing, aggressive gaming pursuits, and flourishing subscription services. This diversified tech giant consistently makes the right moves to drive revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite steep gains, Microsoft still trades at a reasonable 36.5-times earnings. I think that’s a cheap valuation, relative to its quality and growth prospects. For a dominant firm generating $62 billion in quarterly sales and 18% year-over-year growth, I believe this multiple remains attractive for long-horizon investors. Indeed, MSFT stock deserves a premium valuation given its expanding moat and history of adapting to industry shifts decade after decade.\n\nIn short, Microsoft checks all the boxes: visionary leadership, AI/cloud secular trends, reasonable valuation, fortress balance sheet, and a demonstrated capacity to penetrate new markets. That’s why I urge accumulating MSFT stock hand over fist if you have a 10-20-year investment horizon.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been largely overlooked amid the AI hype cycle, but don’t sleep on this cash cow. Despite recent lackluster stock returns compared to big tech peers, GOOG stock has still rallied 22.5% annually over the past decade. Google’s Bard debacle also overshadowed that YouTube monetization is hitting its long-awaited stride.\n\nAfter decades of patience with YouTube’s ad potential, Alphabet is finally squeezing money from its neglected golden goose. Blocking ad blockers and adding more premium features like enhanced bitrate has allowed Google to pull all the right profitability leverage. Notably, these levers are being pulled while Alphabet enjoys unrivaled competitive moats around YouTube and Search. These platforms drive significant profit margins and serve billions of users each month. Sustainable double-digit growth is likely for years to come.\n\nToday, the company’s revenue sits at $307.4 billion, up 10% year over year. With YouTube pitching in $9.2 billion last quarter alone, Google has barely scratched the surface of maximizing this asset. Its latest Gemini AI upgrade also aims to challenge OpenAI’s model in capability. Even if inferior, don’t underestimate Google’s ability to monetize AI with its wealth of data and domains.\n\nFor a dominant firm increasing sales 10%+ annually, GOOG stock’s valuation multiple of 21-times forward earnings seems reasonable, given its history of over-delivering. This is a buy-and-hold-forever stock if I’ve ever seen one.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpeaking of underappreciated monetization efforts, Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has executed a phenomenal turnaround since the pandemic lows. After subscriber declines and fears it would stay permanently impaired, Netflix made savvy strategic moves that reinvigorated growth and turbocharged its earnings power over the past year.\n\nIt turns out those pandemic pull-forwards masked Netflix’s secular shift toward pricing power. Successfully cracking down on rampant password sharing, hiking subscription fees, and attracting wealthier customers have allowed impressive gains since my bullish call in November 2022. Additionally, Netflix is adding subscribers at a healthy clip, now that the dead weight has fallen off.\n\nWith market-leading originals fueling must-have exclusivity and no viable competitors at scale, I believe Netflix enjoys immense latitude to drive further average revenue per user gains in Western markets. There’s still a long runway left for growth in emerging countries, even if a recession temporarily cools subscription momentum.\n\nI estimate Netflix will expand operating margins back to 25% within a few years from 16% currently, fueling 20%+ annual earnings per share growth for the foreseeable future. The market has turned too bearish here just as Netflix enters its golden age. I suggest buying more on any dips – this comeback story has plenty of gas left in the tank, both fundamentally and optically, now that positive sentiment has returned.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ve been pounding the table on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) (formerly Facebook) for two years now, first calling it a “buy” around $112 in 2022. In October 2023, I projected a move to $400 per share by 2024, driven by ad revenue resilience and metaverse potential. We fell a bit short, since META ended 2023 near $350, but it now trades around $460 per share post-market as of writing.\n\nFour months ago, I said,\n\n“Meta does not pay a dividend, unlike many mature tech stocks, and its valuation seems fair based on 2023 estimates. If Meta did return cash to shareholders instead of investing heavily in its metaverse vision, a dividend could make it more appealing for long-term investors.”\n\nJust as I suggested last fall, Meta announced a quarterly 50 cent per share dividend hours ago (as of writing), alongside a $50 billion share buyback authorization. This capital return program demonstrates management’s confidence in continued free cash flow generation even with heavy Reality Labs investment dragging on earnings. The dividend also sets a new tone for Meta as a shareholder-friendly tech giant capable of balancing growth prospects with delivering direct value today.\n\nI’m not going to backpedal now that META stock is trading where it is. That price tag still looks attractive for long-term investors due to the new buyback program and dividend. The company’s core advertising business boasts tremendous staying power thanks to unrivaled user engagement and data advantages. Meanwhile, Metaverse initiatives will bear fruit over the next decade across consumer and enterprise applications.\n\nPatience has already paid off for believers in this dominant social media ecosystem. Now, income and buybacks provide extra incentives alongside an improving growth narrative. I suggest buying more META stock, and holding forever. My October bull case assumed $500 per share by the end of 2025. I think $600 is achievable now.\n\nIs that a stretch? We’ll see.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) Quantum computing stocks: Sign of IBM with Canada Head Office Building in background in Markham, Ontario, Canada. IBM is an American multinational technology company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother veteran tech company making strides lately is International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), which I flagged a year ago, saying, “IBM will likely grow much faster in the future as it is making a turnaround by shifting its focus to cloud computing, AI, and blockchain.”\n\nSure enough, Big Blue is back after years of sluggishness. Strategic imperatives like hybrid cloud, security, and AI now generate most of IBM’s sales. Quantum hardware remains a key differentiator, too – IBM recently unveiled its new 433-qubit Osprey processor while competitors are far behind.\n\nUp 37% in one year, IBM seems to be regaining its groove. The company’s cloud, AI/ML, quantum, and blockchain segments indicate an effective pivot toward the most promising future technologies. Renewed revenue growth and expanding margins further cement my confidence. IBM should keep outpacing as enterprises quest to extract value from data across hybrid environments.\n\nTesla (TSLA) A person walks past the storefront of a Tesla (TSLA) store with several vehicles visible behind a glass door\n\nSource: Ivan Marc / Shutterstock.com\n\nShifting gears, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has endured a painful stretch along with the broader electric vehicle complex. TSLA stock is down 24% just since 2024 began as spiking rates, inflation, and gloomy macro forecasts create strong headwinds for automakers. Competition is also heating up, with BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) quickly moving up the ranks in terms of global EV sales.\n\nNonetheless, I remain staunchly bullish on Tesla over any investment horizon beyond 12-18 months. At less than $190 per share, as I write this, TSLA stock trades at the cheapest valuation I’ve seen since April 2023.\n\nRates won’t stay high forever. Inflation continues to moderate, as well. Once economic storm clouds clear, Tesla will still provide immense growth potential as the de facto leader of a rapidly-emerging mobility market. China’s production issues should sort themselves out over time, too. This creates a compelling risk/reward setup for patient investors.\n\nI expect TSLA stock to regain $300+ per share within two years as macro drags fade and the company’s vertical integration engine kicks back into high gear. EV penetration still stands very low globally. Thus, Tesla remains the best EV option to capitalize on mainstream adoption.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast and admittedly, the least conviction pick from my end, is Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The world’s most valuable public company (depending on the day) has essentially traded sideways for six months now, absent any compelling growth narrative. iPhone sales still dominate the company’s top line, while tablets, personal computers, and wearables contribute much less individually. Unfortunately, streaming remains a money pit.\n\nRumors suggest the company is cooking up an autonomous electric vehicle behind closed doors. However, I wouldn’t bank on such a product moving the needle soon, even if released eventually. Meanwhile, Apple has largely remained on the AI sidelines, forfeiting major performance potential versus peers aggressively pursuing this vertical.\n\nNonetheless, shares seem reasonably valued at around 30-times earnings. The company’s Services and Accessories segments continue to grow nicely as Apple’s installed base marches higher. While unlikely to rally sharply anytime soon, I don’t see much downside risk to AAPL stock either. Steady dividend increases and buybacks are likely to provide extra support.\n\nFor now, Apple looks stuck in the mud – an acceptable hold, but not one I’m excited to buy more of amid fierce sector rotation. Still, its fortress balance sheet and ecosystem stickiness should prevent meaningful underperformance if tech stabilizes. I rank AAPL stock a tepid buy simply due to its relative resilience.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investment management company Bireme Capital recently released its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. In 2023, the fund returned 21.3% net of fees underperforming the S&P 500’s 26.2%. The fund was up 448% net since inception in 2016 vs the S&P at 161%, an annual outperformance of 11.7%. Last year was the second calendar year in a row that the fund underperformed the S&P 500, and the first since 2019. Nonetheless, the firm is particularly proud of last year’s returns because 2023 was an extraordinarily tough year for the relative performance of active value managers.

        "content": "Participants\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg; Head of IR; Spotify Technology S.A.\n\nDaniel G. Ek; Founder, CEO & Chairman; Spotify Technology S.A.\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel; CFO; Spotify Technology S.A.\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood morning, and welcome to Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. (Operator Instructions) As a reminder, this conference call is being recorded. \r\nI would now like to turn the call over to Bryan Goldberg, Head of Investor Relations. Thank you. Please go ahead.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. Thanks, operator, and welcome to Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Conference Call. Joining us today will be Daniel Ek, our CEO; Paul Vogel, our CFO; and Ben Kung, our VP of Financial Planning and Analysis, who has been assisting with the transition while we search for our new CFO. We'll start with opening comments from Daniel and Paul. And afterwards, we'll be happy to answer your questions. Questions can be submitted by going to slido.com, s-l-i-d-o.com and using the code #SpotifyEarningsQ423. Analysts can ask questions directly into Slido, and all participants can then vote on the questions they find the most relevant. \r\nIf for some reason, you don't have access to Slido, you can e-mail Investor Relations at ir@spotify.com, and we'll add in your question. \r\nBefore we begin, let me quickly cover the safe harbor. During this call, we'll be making certain forward-looking statements, including projections or estimates about the future performance of the company. These statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of factors discussed on today's call, in our shareholder deck and in filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission. \r\nDuring this call, we'll also refer to certain non-IFRS financial measures. Reconciliations between our IFRS and non-IFRS financial measures can be found in our shareholder deck, in the financial section of our Investor Relations website and also furnished today on Form 6-K. \r\nAnd with that, I'll turn it over to Daniel.\n\nStory continues\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nAll right. Thanks, Bryan, and hey, everyone, and thanks for joining us. I hope you've had the opportunity to review our shareholder deck to get a sense of what an incredible year 2023 was for Spotify. \r\nThroughout the year, we notched some really significant milestones and set numerous records. This included 113 million net adds on the MAU side and premium net adds of 31 million, both the biggest full year additions in our history. And our annual Wrapped experience also toppled previous levels of engagement surpassing 2022 numbers in just the first 31 hours of the campaign. We accomplished all of this by significantly exceeding our own expectations when we entered the year and against the backdrop of global turmoil and uncertainty and Q4 was a continuation of the story. \r\nAnd while I'm pleased with the level of growth we saw in 2023, perhaps what is even more gratifying is that it also marked a very different year for Spotify, a true evolution in how we operate our company. A year where we started to prove that we're not just a company that has an amazing product, but one that also is building a great business. And there's no question that we had to make some difficult decisions to put us on track to achieve our goal of being a consistently profitable company but by taking these steps, I'm super confident in where we're heading. \r\nSo looking to 2024, you should expect a continuation of what you saw in 2023, strong product development, which leads to strong growth, but with an increased focus on monetization and efficiency, which in turn drives profitability. \r\nAnd I know some of you may start to wonder if we're sacrificing growth for profitability. Long term, we believe that the real value of Spotify is in solving problems at the intersection between creators and consumers . With scale, there will be even more opportunities to do so. Therefore, growth is still the most important thing we can deliver. However, equally true is that our hurdle rate for investment has increased. \r\nSo what gifts? Well, as I've shared before, we have various levers to pull at different times to drive revenue growth. These include growing our users, creating new businesses with new revenue streams and increasing revenue per user through price increases. \r\nIn 2023, we leveraged all three throughout the year at various times, but this won't always be the case, you should expect to see a shift back and forth among prioritizing these three key elements based on a variety of considerations. And looking ahead, I believe 2024 is going to be another year of solid progress led by an acceleration of revenue growth. \r\nThat said, I think it is important to remind investors that we constantly modulate between what we spend most of our time focusing on. In some years, it's focusing on growing the top of the funnel. And in some years, it's about driving monetization of those users. The last few years has been extraordinary from the top of the funnel perspective. Our aim is to continue this trend, but our focus in 2024 is more on how we monetize that growth. \r\nI also wanted to provide a quick update on our audio books business, which is performing well, and we are very excited about its potential. It's still early days, but the feedback from listeners and from the industry is extremely encouraging. Data shows that our entry into this market has dramatically accelerated its overall growth. In Q4, we became the #2 provider of audio books behind Audible, which is notable given how entrenched the legacy players are. \r\nAnd this is exactly what we set out to do: grow the pie for the publishing industry and expand the interest in audio books to an entirely new set of listeners. More to come as this takes hold and we roll it out through additional markets. \r\nBefore I turn it over to Paul to provide more details on the numbers, I also wanted to take this opportunity with all of you on the line to thank him and wish him well. Although Paul is sticking around for a couple more months, this will be his last earnings call. He's been a great partner and helped to solidify the position of the strength that we sit in today. So thank you, Paul, for these years. \r\nI also wanted to give you a quick update on our CFO search. We are well underway, and I'm happy with the caliber of the candidates that I'm seeing. As we enter this next phase of focusing on having both a great product and building a great business, I'm confident we will find the right person, someone who is passionate about driving the levels of efficiency and resourcefulness that are critical to our long-term success. \r\nPaul, thanks again, and over to you.\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nGreat. Thanks, Daniel, and thanks, everyone, for joining us. I'd like to add a bit more color on the quarter and then touch upon the broader performance of the business and our outlook. \r\nQ4 is a very strong quarter. MAU grew like 28 million to 602 million, and we added 10 million net subscribers finishing at 236 million. Both MAU and subscriber growth continued to be above our historical trend and outperformed forecast. Revenue grew 16% year-over-year to EUR 3.7 billion during the quarter. Excluding the effects of unfavorable currency movements, revenue grew 20% year-on-year, representing an acceleration of 300 basis points versus the prior quarter as a result due to the ongoing effects of the new subscription pricing. \r\nTurning to gross margin. Gross margin of 26.7% was above guidance by about 10 basis points due primarily to favorability in our podcast business. We reported an operating loss of EUR 75 million, which was better than guidance due mainly to lower-than-expected marketing spend and personnel and related costs. \r\nAs we previously disclosed, our operating loss was impacted by about EUR 143 million of charges related to the efficiency actions we announced in December. Excluding the onetime charges, we generated EUR 68 million of adjusted operating profit, which is more than double the third quarter as the business continued its early stage of inflection towards sustainable growth and profitability. \r\nFinally, Free cash flow was positive EUR 396 million in Q4. While some of the strength was timing related, we remain confident that we've entered a new chapter in terms of expanding the business, the business's cash generation potential. \r\nLooking ahead to the first quarter guidance, we are forecasting 618 million MAU, an increase of 16 million from Q4 and 230 million subscribers, an increase of 3 million over Q4. We're also forecasting a currency-neutral revenue growth rate of 20% plus year-on-year putting to EUR 3.6 billion in total revenue. We also anticipate a gross margin of 26.4% and an operating profit of EUR 180 million. While we no longer give full year guidance, we do expect healthy full year 2024 user growth that should be close to the average of the last few years, and we expect strong subscriber growth as well. \r\nGross margin and operating margin are both expected to improve throughout the year to deliver meaningful full year expansion with podcasting expected to deliver positive gross profit for the year. We also expect our free cash flow generation to meaningfully exceed what we generated in 2023. \r\nAnd finally, as Bryan mentioned, Ben Kung, who has been a trusted partner of (inaudible) Finance, is also on the call and we're joining us for Q&A. And additionally, I'd like to thank Daniel and all of my colleagues over the past 8 years for making my time at Spotify truly special. \r\nAnd with that, I'll hand things back to Bryan for Q&A.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. Thanks, Paul. Again, if you've got any questions, please go to slido.com, #SpotifyEarningsQ423. We're going to be reading the questions in the order they appear in the queue with respect to how people vote up their preference for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAnd our first question is going to come today from Doug Anmuth on podcasting. Have podcasts flipped into positive gross profit yet? And how do you think about inflection here through '24 as you're rationalizing content spending?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes, I'll take this one, Doug. Yes. So I think just to level set with everyone, I think when we had our Investor Day last year, everyone was probably expecting our podcast business to be a net adder to the business and probably thought that the music margins was worse than what they ended up being and obviously, as we outlined then, podcasting was a drag to the business, but something we were committed to turn around. And I'm pleased to say in Q4, we were very close to breakeven on that business, which gives me a lot of confidence that as we get into 2024, we will achieve the full year profitability target on podcasting. \r\nAnd so when you think about then, what are the drivers for that to happen? Well, it's really two drivers. On the top line side, we're still seeing healthy growth on engagements. That engagement in turns means there will be more opportunities for us to monetize those engagement hours, and that's the top line. And then on the bottom line, we have doubled down on the deals that worked, and we have got -- really throughout 2023, gotten out of a lot of the deals that didn't work. And that's the result you're now seeing with the close to breakeven and that then will lead to a positive podcasting business in 2024.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. Our next question is going to come from Michael Morris on margins. What are the most impactful steps that will help you progress towards your long-term music gross margin goal of 30% to 35%? And can you share more detail on the gross margin levers in 2024 and the relative impact you anticipate from each?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nGreat question, Michael. In terms of the progress on the music margin goals, we see a lot of potential in the growth of our marketplace products as we continue to focus on driving adoption of those and adding value to our label partners and therefore, sort of building upon the progress that we've already made to date in that area. \r\nIn terms of 2024, I think you've called out some of the key levers with respect to your comment on Q1. Really, the story of 2024, I think, can be broken into sort of these 3 parts. It's a continuation of the journey on profitability and podcasting. It's the continuation of marketplace growth, as I mentioned, and also just gaining greater efficiency and leverage in our other cost of revenue areas such as cloud cost and streaming delivery. We think all three are equal parts important to the story in 2024. And so we're looking forward to building on that progress there.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got a question now from Rich Greenfield on advertising. With advertising revenues still under 14% of your revenues. I'm surprised to see it's not growing faster than subscription revenue. How do you accelerate advertising growth to reach your goals of it becoming 20% plus of your overall revenues?\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nYes, I'd say a couple of things here. So first, I think we're very pleased with how advertising is growing. Obviously, the market -- a lot of ways continues to be choppy, but our FX-neutral high-teens growth on the advertising side, we think is really strong and really strong relative to the industry overall. So we feel good about kind of the advertising growth. That's number one. \r\nNumber 2 is, we've obviously seen on the subscriber side, it is faster growth on subscribers in general, plus we've had a price increase. And so just the overall growth on the premium side has probably been even faster than maybe we would have thought and others would have thought when you factor in both the outside subscriber growth and the price increase. \r\nAnd the last thing I'd also just remind you of the advertising business does get impacted more significantly by FX than the premium business. And so when you're thinking about just reported numbers, that also has an impact on sort of the progression. But I think we feel really good about both sides of the businesses right now. So everything is progressing as planned.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. We've got a follow-up from Rich Greenfield on podcasting. How should we think about the revenue opportunity and gross margin impact of shifting from an exclusive podcast like Call Her Daddy or Joe Rogan to nonexclusive?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes, Rich. So I think to kind of up level and talk about it generally and remind people. So when we walked into podcasting, we actually went in with multiple strategies at once. We did exclusives that you're referencing to, but we also did our own and original programming, and we also did licensed nonexclusive deals, too. And what we said at the time, I think many people mostly sort of made a reference to thinking that this was an all-out exclusive effort similar to that of Netflix. But we said we take much more of an opportunity approach to the strategy and we're going to try many different things. And for some shows, exclusive matters for some others, it don't. \r\nSo I think the general story, just to be candid here with all of you on the line is that, what we've seen is that while exclusivities were net positive on the side, it's not driving as much as the opportunity that we see on the ad side. And so by broadening distribution, we think we can accomplish a number of different goals. Most notable among them, we are going to be more aligned with the creator. The creator obviously wants to be on many different platforms and wants to have as big of an audience as possible. So that's important. \r\nAnd then the second part is, when you think about the revenue growth story on advertising, we're very excited with what we've been seeing in early 2023 with these new types of deals that we've been structuring because we really become aligned with the creator. And long term, that is the reason why I started Spotify. We care equally about consumers, and we care equally about creators. So I feel like with this new strategy, we're actually even better aligned with the creator because we're not asking the creator to trade one for the other. And because advertising is in such a strong growth position for us, I feel I'm really excited about the opportunity we can bring both the creators and to Spotify itself with that strategy.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question comes from Zach Morrissey on Marketplace. Can you provide an update on marketplace and how that performed in 2023? And how should we think about momentum into '24?\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nYes. Marketplace performed really well in '23. The growth rate, basically the contribution to gross profit grew at similar rates to 2022. So really strong growth in '23. And then just to reiterate what Ben said prior about overall gross margin, when you think about the improvements and gross margin moving to 2024, marketplace will be a key contributor, again, along with the podcasting flip and some of the other costs of revenue.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got a follow-up from Zach. You saw strong subscriber growth and marketing leverage in 2023, how are you thinking about marketing spend in 2024? And do you see more room for further efficiencies?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. And just as a reminder to everyone, this is something I talked about, I believe, during the Q1 earnings call in 2023, where I was positively surprised and some of the efficiencies we were seeing is still sort of healthy top line growth. And that trend has been continuing for much of 2023. And the reality is we don't know how far that will go. I feel good about the efficiencies we're seeing so far. \r\nThe big concern always when you're making these things is you may see some healthy positive responses intra-quarter, but then long term, are you impacting the brand. So we're always going to modulate towards that. But -- but I think what we've been seeing so far has just been pure efficiencies and quite great ones. And I expect there's still some, but the question is still internally, we're still debating how much? \r\nThe most important thing for us, as I said, is long-term growth still for the company. So that's what we will optimize for. And I think you're going to see us modulate between the quarters. Some quarters we may spend a little bit more on some less. \r\nThe most important metric for all of you, though, is to think about the LTV to SAC. We referenced this before. It had been in 2022 and 2023 going down, the efficiency in some of our spend. Now you're going to see a higher hurdle rates. So we're going to be a lot more diligent as we're thinking about these marketing investments overall. But the spending per quarter may be more opportunistic, and you should think about it as such. But if you see a strong LTV to SAC, why wouldn't you? And that's the approach we take.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question is going to come from Eric Sheridan on operating priorities. Following your fourth quarter restructuring, what's your updated view about balancing long-term growth investments, accelerating the pathway to long-term margin targets in the next few years? And/or optimizing internal efficiency on an annualized basis?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes, I'll start and then Paul or Ben, if you want to chime in on that. \r\nYes. I mean, I really talked about it in my introductory remarks, but it is a new way for us to operate as a company, one where we're consistently thinking about efficiency all the time top line. We started doing it in early 2023, and I think we are gradually becoming better quarter-by-quarter. And I think investors should expect the same much for 2024. We are going to continuously look at being more resourceful with the resources we have. That's just the new modus operandi that we have. \r\nBut that said, that obviously leads to a concern then, okay, well, are we doing that to sacrifice at the expense of growth? And the answer should be, of course, not. That's not at all what we want to do. We still care about long-term growth because we believe that's where we're going to be able to solve real and meaningful problems for consumers and creators alike with scale. So that's our real focus. \r\nBut it's a constant balancing act. And I think what you're seeing us rather than sort of growth at all cost or growth, growth, growth, you're going to see us quarter-by-quarter optimizing at various parts of that funnel. Sometimes it's top line growth, sometimes it's bottom line. As a general trend, we had healthy top line growth in 2023. 2024 is about monetizing more of that top line growth. That's the general trend. But you'll see in various geographies, we may have just MAU growth as the goal and in some others, it may be more of a just ARPU approach as an example.\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nYes. I would just add, I think to everything Daniel said, if you think about the free cash flow and the acceleration of free cash flow and the better profitability, it just gives the business so much more optionality in terms of what it can do moving forward. And so I think you've seen that sort of inflection on the free cash flow side, you've now seen us on an adjusted basis, profitable for two quarters in a row with the forecast again for Q1 of next year. And so all that just puts the business in a much better place for the team to have the optionality to invest in areas that really makes sense for the long term.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question is going to come from Rich Greenfield on audio books. What surprises you most about the current state of the audio book market?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes, Rich, I think it's two parts of focus. So I think on our side, the intriguing part is we are able to bring a whole new audience to audio books. So internally and externally, I think the biggest surprise has been the type of titles that resonate with consumers. These are not the normal titles that traditionally does well, that do well on Spotify, and that's pleasing to see because that means we're bringing a whole new audience to audio books, the format, which is great to see. \r\nAnd then I think overall, I'm just happy to see that the partners we have on the publisher side and the author sides are just very excited about the innovation we're bringing and very open-minded to trying new things. And this is an industry that's so important, I think, to the world. And it's great to see that there is a hunger and willingness to innovate among all of our partners there. So that's definitely been a positive surprise. And it's amazing to see also how much value audio books is adding to our subscriber base. So I feel really good about that.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Next question is from Benjamin Black on margins. Last quarter, you mentioned 2024 gross margin should exceed those of 2023. Is that still the case? And if so, how should we be thinking about the trajectory of gross margins throughout 2024?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nThanks, Benjamin. Building on my earlier commentary, we feel very excited about the potential for 2024 gross margins. I mentioned some of the building blocks that we have ahead of us kind of going into this year. And I think you should expect that we're going to continue focusing on what we did in 2023, which is building sequential growth in that gross margin, and it's about executing against those building blocks of opportunity that we have that I mentioned previously.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question is going to come from Jessica Reif Ehrlich on the music business. Universal Music Group just pulled their music from TikTok. What are the implications to Spotify from a competitive standpoint? And how does this impact, if at all, your negotiations with your recorded music partners?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. Obviously, I'm not going to comment on any sort of competitive dynamic. But what I can say is we feel really good about our relationship with our music partners. It's probably at the best it's been. I don't know, whatever, it's been better, to be honest. So I feel really good about where we are with our music partners. I feel great about the value we're bringing to the music industry. And I think that's being widely recognized. And yes, I don't think it has much of an implication, any other competitive dynamic but we feel good about the partnership. We feel great about opportunities to enhance the partnership to any extent that, that creates opportunities. So yes, we're overall very excited.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. Our next question is from Maria Ripps audio books. Could you talk about what type of engagement you've seen with the free 15 hours of audio books listening? To what extent do you think the expanded value proposition is driving any of the subscriber momentum? And are you seeing any uplift to audio books purchases in the relevant markets?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes, Maria. So I mentioned that in my prior response, but the engagement has been very strong, very positively surprised about the content mix. It's driving as well what type of titles that our consumers are engaging with not very surprising. It is a lot of entertainment. It's a lot about culture. Maybe some of the titles that traditionally doesn't do as well in the book market, but also pleasing is very many younger authors, newer authors as well given the model where you can take a chance on a totally new book without sort of eating up the credit, which I think kind of drove you towards more safer bets. So we're seeing a very, very interesting sort of trend around the content consumption, which is really great and I believe, additive to the entire book industry, which is amazing. \r\nNow as it relates to how that translates into our business, I think it's too early to say but what we've seen generally speaking is the more engagement we have on our platform, the better the value is of course and then everyone knows that audio books is an expensive proposition where buying an audio books today costs a lot of money. So it's another reason why we're offering a great value to our consumers. And that, of course, gives us an ability to increase the value that then allows us long term to follow through by reflecting that in the price that we have as well to our consumers.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Next question from Justin Patterson on revenue potential. Investors now have confidence in your operating margin potential and the redesigned app is resonating with users. As you look ahead, what should give investors confidence in your revenue growth, achieving the 20% targets outlined at your Investor Day?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nI'll start with this one, Ben, and then maybe you can chime in. \r\nSo I think, again, this is very much a continuation of the trend of 2023. And just to level set again, 2023, we walked into the year thinking that we'll have healthy top line growth and focus on the bottom line on efficiencies and that was pretty much the year, but we exceeded all of our expectations on the MAU side, which then translated into exceeding all of our expectations on the sub side and then when you top off that with price increases, that leads to a very healthy dynamic. And that top line growth has really been a continuation of that trend in all of 2023. \r\nSo I've said this before, but I'll say it again, MAU growth sooner or later then translate into conversion to subscriber that sooner or later then translate into revenue growth that sooner or later then translates into bottom line. And so given 2023, I feel really good about our ability to have healthy revenue growth throughout the year and with this smaller cost structures that we're having because of the focus on efficiency that we had really throughout 2023, we talked about it on the podcasting side. We talked about it on the employee side but also, as Ben mentioned, with cloud costs, all the other things that we've been focusing on, that should give you confidence that 2024 will be a great year. \r\nI don't know if you have any addition, Ben?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nYes. No, I think all that commentary is very much sort of the perspective going forward. The top -- the funnel kind of our user side and subside looks very strong. And I think the focus is about sort of monetizing that, both from a premium subscription perspective as well as focusing on making sure that our ad business continues to grow at a healthy clip going forward. So we feel really strong about sort of progressing towards the 20% targets.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question is going to come from Kannan Venkateshwar on product. Given the pricing is a bigger part of the growth algorithm. Have you considered models beyond the All-You-Can-Eat framework used today?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nIn fact, we actually already do have some other pricing mechanics throughout the world. It's easy to think that Spotify is a single proposition for everyone in the world. It's far from today. So for instance, we have a day passes, it's just one product that we're offering in certain markets, week passes. We even have physical gift cards that people scratch cards from on a weekly basis in order to top up their Spotify listening. So we are very much adapting our pricing models in favor of what consumers want. And that's something that you should expect us to continue to do. \r\nNow with that said, to touch a little bit, one of the things, of course, why we are talking about the Apple case is many things like, for instance, a la carte purchases, things like superfan things like purchasing of audio books, top-up things that could be quite meaningful for Spotify's revenues is a significant hindrance today because Apple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases, exceeds even our own cuts that we're able to take inside of the app. So some of these more innovative things that we would like to do, we are currently restricted in doing on the iOS ecosystem, which limits some of that more innovative things that we would like to do. \r\nSo yes, all in all, we are already doing it in other territories. We would like to do even more of it. But to do that, certainly in the Western world, which many of these markets being very heavily iOS influenced, we are precluded from doing it at a way where -- which could be profitable and good for consumers and creators because of Apple stance.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. That's a good segue into Michael Morris' question on the Digital Markets Act. You posted twice about the DMA with the potential positives to your business and then also about your dissatisfaction with Apple's proposed changes. Do you expect the DMA to be implemented in a way that supports your vision? And if so, what do you expect the new functions to be available? And how may they impact the company financially?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nMichael, I think the truth is we don't know yet. The -- we outline our response to how we would be compliant with the DMA. But obviously, that then very much depends on Apple stance in allowing us to do so. And Apple then obviously subsequently responded with their stance, which is very much incongruent with our stance on the matter and frankly, I think it's a bit of a forest because it looks on the surface that they're complying with it but behind the surface, they're doing pretty much everything to make this such an attractive experience that's no same developer want to pick any of the new terms. \r\nNow the good news, I guess, from the investor standpoint, and I know that there initially with some questions about whether or not this would be a downside for Spotify. I don't think that's the case. So we still have the ability to be on the old terms and keep going as we're currently going. But there are future upsides that could be quite significant. \r\nWe talked a little bit about it with fan clubs, all these other things that we could do for creators that we would probably be barred from doing because it simply means that all of Spotify would be unprofitable if we took these new terms. So no downside, but there will be quite a lot of upside if, in fact, we were going to be able to do what we wanted to do, not just for Spotify, but for creators and consumers alike. \r\nAnd just as a last reminder, this law will come into play in March 7. So obviously, my hope is still very much that the European Commission will take action and allow this to happen because it will be far greater for the ecosystem, both for consumers and creators alike.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question comes from Batya Levi on audio books. How should we think about the impact of audio books consumption cost on margins?\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nYes. Thanks, Batya. So as you know, we don't really break out the individual components like that. What I will say is while we're investing in audio books, we still see a nice improvement in gross margin through 2024, which Ben has talked about at length already on the call. And so -- we feel like we have a model for audio books and the progression of audio books over the next couple of years. It's going to be very additive. We've talked about at the Investor Day where we believe the long-term gross margin of the audio books business can get to. And so we're still really encouraged about that. And in general, we're very optimistic that you're going to continue to see gross margin progression throughout 2024.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got another question from Kannan, this time on the music business. Has growth in international markets helped flip any major ones from fixed minimum payouts to variable payouts? And could we see some impact in 2024?\n\nUnidentified Company Representative\n\nGreat question, Kannan. The short version -- the short answer to this question is yes. I would say that it's been a story of steady progress in sort of how we grow the user base and then begin to monetize them in these international markets and there's really kind of two engines to this. It's about sort of driving subscriber growth and building upon sort of the subscription revenues in these markets, but also making sure that we start to light up the advertising side in these markets as well, both of which basically ultimately help us clear these hurdles in fixed minimum payouts. So I think the story is one of ever constant progress in this department.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got another question from Doug Anmuth on podcasting. With most major podcast content renewals resolved, what are your key priorities for the podcast business in 2024?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. Much more of a continuation of 2023 with the exception, obviously, as you said, we've kind of transitioned the podcasting business from one structure to a different structure throughout 2023, that's mostly done. Now it's back to innovation and growth again. \r\nWhat I'm most excited about is there are lots of things that creators are asking us to do that enables them to easier post content, have more ways of engaging with their audience. You've seen some of this already in ['22 and '23]. As a reminder, you saw video podcasting growing in a healthy way on the platform. You've seen us add Q&A responses, which is quite phenomenal to see the comments that are showing up on Spotify. Now you've seen much more interactivity and more and more creators are starting to use those tools, but that's just the beginning. We have plenty of plans on podcasting, which I think will mean more content on the platform, which I also think means more engagement. \r\nSo it has been a profitability story in 2023. And I think that's going to play out. But where we're focused on is really all about now growing podcasting and increasing it. And we think it's a lot larger of a medium than most people really today give it credit for. That's not where we need to prove. But we are doing so from a profitable standpoint instead of one that's losing a lot of money for us.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got a question from Rich Greenfield on user engagement. Daniel, you've talked about user interest in your [Hack day] creation day list, which feels like another [AIML] use case to drive engagement. How is it impacting overall usage and time spent? And by the way, my day list for today is [Sad Tailspin Tuesday].\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nAll right. Well, hopefully, nothing we're seeing on this call today gives you any reason to tail spin on a sad basis. But jokes aside, yes, I mean this, again, is a story of innovation at Spotify. What's so cool is we have these crazy engineers and scientists inside of the company that dreams up these kind of weird and wonderful things, which seems like very narrow use cases, but this is culture. And what they do is they test culture and they bring it out and they personalize culture to people. And it turns out that people are just reacting in this weird and wonderful way, and they want to express their own identity through music, which in itself is not surprising. It's a very core thing for humanity and something that we've been doing. And the team keeps finding weird and wonderful ways for consumers to be able to do that. \r\nAnd I think I referenced this, but we saw searches increased by over 2,000% on a day list. So it's a widely sought after feature people are excited to come into the app every day now to find out whatever Spotify thinks your current mood is of today. And yes, we keep churning these types of things out. It's kind of our way of creating content. And I'm really proud of the team and the things that they're doing in this department and it wouldn't surprise me if we see many more innovative things come out of it, both on -- of course, on the music side, but later on also reflecting that on the audio book side and the podcasting side as well.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Our next question is going to come from Benjamin Black on efficiency. What are some of the key learnings you've seen with the more streamlined cost structure? And as we look ahead, what's your philosophy on headcount growth?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. I mean the key things are probably not the surprising things. It's always what happens, right? Initially, when you go through an exercise, everyone kind of says, well, we can't cut this because then all of a sudden, everything will stop working. And it turns out that -- as this is true in so many cases, most things can tend to work anyway even when you go through that exercise, and it actually even killing things that sometimes sort of works is a healthy thing to refocus and reenergize people on the things that really drive lots of value. So those are some of the obvious lessons, which I think you guys have heard plenty of times before on these calls before. \r\nI think the more exciting things are the things we're in the midst of learning this as a company. So by no way it means things we're fully adapted to this mindset. But I think, this is something I wrote in my internal memo that we then published as well is, is this notion of being relentlessly resourceful. For me, that means to think constantly about the resources we're having and not just think about getting more of them, but thinking about how we reallocate constantly everything we're doing to the most and highest impact use case. And there, I don't think we are yet. So I think the good news is that there is still some ways for us to go on it. \r\nAnd I think the way you should think about headcount growth is, we're not allergic to it. We're not saying, hey, we can never ever grow anything. We should grow things that obviously are working, but the hurdle rate for any new type of investments will be much higher than what it has been and more importantly, I think you're going to see us more diligent in shutting down things that perhaps have sort of worked but may not work as well going forward into the future. And you're going to see that all across the company in a pretty big way. \r\nAnd I think the biggest takeaway I can give to you, that doesn't mean that the company is any danger of any kind because sometimes that get interpreted by media and investor, if they're no longer showing up in a big way to event X, maybe they're in dire straits and so on. That's not the case. We're just simply thinking about, are there better ways for us to do this? Are there better ways for us to achieve this efficiency and try to think outside of the box. Maybe it is not to throw the lavish party. Maybe it is to have a virtual party where we could have 10x the audience come and show up. Maybe it is about partnering with other brands and doing something in conjunction that where 1 plus 1 doesn't equal 2, but equals 3 or more. \r\nSo you're going to see us, I think, still have a lot to learn, but re-question things that in the past have worked, but we need to think about how we do them going forward.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. We've got time for a few more questions. Our next one is going to come from Steven Cahall on margins. First quarter is typically the lower margin quarter of the year. Are there any onetime benefits in the strong implied Q1 margin guidance? Or can we assume the same seasonality of sequentially improving margins for 2024?\n\nPaul Aaron Vogel\n\nThanks, Steven. I think you have sort of the right themes in your question there. I think to reiterate, as Daniel said, in 2023, we had a lot of focus areas between sort of growing our users and subs, driving sort of monetization to price increases and efficiency actions, all these has sort of taken our core business, I think, to a new stair step. And I think Q1 is sort of where that new core business is shining through. And so I think that implies sort of like a new starting point, I think, for where you can expect the margin to go. And as I said before, our focus is to continue building on that sequentially quarter-on-quarter into 2024. So we look forward to making progress in that department.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. We've got question from Richard Kramer on execution. What's the message to the organization about new growth initiatives following your recent headcount reduction? How do you mitigate the execution risk in 2024?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. I think implied in your question, Richard, is obviously this, how do you do both? How do you, on the one hand, save? And how do you tell people that you want to grow? And I think this is why in my last response, I focus so much about the mindset of being relentlessly resourceful and what it actually means. So I don't think it is either or I think it's both. And so I think we need to become more efficient by deprioritizing some of the existing things, but we also need to invest in some of the new. But when we're investing in some of the new, what is the optimal way of doing that? You talk about execution risk. I think it is exactly the right thing and right framing of it. It is about execution. It isn't about strategy. It's about how do we -- [buy] constraining the resources we have, how do we think about different ways to executing some of these newer growth initiatives? If the hurdle rate is X, how can we more quickly prove out that something is working? \r\nThose are some of the questions that I, Ben, Paul and the rest of the team is having when we're looking at these types of things and when we're talking to the teams. And I think the good news is that the teams are excited. They're excited to show that there's a different path to do this. They're excited because they also see the momentum in how it currently translates to the business and that sort of momentum fuels that mindset as well. I think it would have been honestly harder to do so from a backdrop if we had to do some of these discussions if we had 1 year, 1.5 years of slog just ever sort of going through this. But we've actually gone through all the hard stuff this past year. And we have plenty of things to learn, of course, but I feel really good about now. The optimism that the team has never fun to do a riff of course. \r\nAnd so we're happy to have this behind us, and we feel obviously a huge sense of gratitude to everyone who has been part of the company and then had to leave. But I know the team is excited about where we are and where we're heading and how it's translated into a healthier Spotify.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nAll right. We're going to take one last question, and we're going to take Maria's question, Maria Ripps on podcasting. Is it reasonable to assume that Spotify is looking to structure most of its podcast deals in a similar fashion to what was reported in the Wall Street Journal regarding Joe Rogan? And how is the company thinking about the trade-off between engagement and advertising revenue or profitability by deemphasizing exclusivity?\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. I think, Maria, I sort of already mentioned some of these things. But -- generally speaking, we had multiple strategies in podcasting. It wasn't just all about exclusivities even if that got most of the -- sort of press headlines. And what we've been able to see here is as we've been learning over these past few years, is that while some of these exclusivity deals worked, generally, it wasn't aligned with what the creator wanted. The creator wants to have broader audience. And I feel like with these new deals that we've been making for most of 2023, we are in a position where we're actually better aligned with the creator. We can both deliver the growth rate, and we are equally incentivized to drive audience growth and, of course, then also drive revenue growth because we both share in that upside. \r\nSo I think the team was able to innovate and create a much smaller structure and that is the path we see going forward on more and more of our deals and I think even on the MAU side, it will be on a healthy basis because we're in a very different position than we were just a few years ago in podcasting because today, Spotify is, in many cases, the #1 podcasting player already. \r\nSo exclusivity makes sense when you're the smaller playing trying to gain scale. When you're the bigger player, the additional value of the exclusivity is far smaller than it is about being aligned. And it feels also that from a value's point of view, this is better aligned with who we are at Spotify, too.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nGreat. Thanks, Maria, and thanks, everyone, for your questions. That's going to conclude our question-and-answer session today, and I'd like to turn it back over to Daniel for some closing remarks.\n\nDaniel G. Ek\n\nYes. Thanks, Bryan. \r\nThe long-term opportunity for Spotify is strong. Hopefully, you heard that now during the call and during the Q&A session. And we will continue to innovate in big and small ways to deliver for our listeners and the artists, creators and authors on our platform and make no mistake that we will continue to make bold bets, invest and seize on the opportunities when they make sense. But hopefully, it's clear now with much more disciplined approach going forward. \r\nThanks, everyone, for joining us today.\n\nBryan Daniel Goldberg\n\nOkay. Great. And that concludes today's call. A replay will be available on our website and also on the Spotify app under Spotify earnings call replays. \r\nThanks, everyone, for joining.\n\nOperator\n\nThis concludes Spotify's Fourth Quarter 2023 Earnings Call and Webcast. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.",

        "title": "15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the 15 most powerful Asian countries in 2024. You can skip our detailed analysis on the economic potential and race for power in the world’s largest continent by heading over to the 5 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024.\n\nAsia’s Corporate Power\n\nWestern observers have been talking about Asia’s future potential for quite some time, and that future is catching up faster than expected. According to a report by McKinsey & Company, Asia, which in the year 2000 accounted for less than one-third of the world’s GDP in purchasing power parity terms, is poised to make up more than 50% of the global economy by 2040. In addition to this, Asia will also account for about 40% of the world’s consumption by then.\n\nPricewaterhouseCoopers has forecast that China alone would constitute 20% of the world’s GDP by 2050, while India will surpass the United States to become the second largest economy in the world, with Indonesia being fourth biggest economic power. All of these projections reiterate what many experts have long been saying, that this is going to be Asia’s century.\n\nOver the last decade or so, several large corporations including Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) have outsourced some of their operations to Asian countries, for reasons ranging from cheap skillful labor to the lucrative opportunities offered by the huge market size in the continent.\n\nToday, 95% of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)’s iPhone, iPads, and MacBooks are made in China – the country which also happened to be the source of 20% of the company’s overall revenue in 2022. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also making inroads in the Indian market. Its first retail store in the country was inaugurated last year in Mumbai.\n\nThere has been an uptick in Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s investments in Asia as well. In 2021, the company announced to set up a new data center in Indonesia, which is expected to increase revenues for the tech giant by $6.3 billion. Moreover, the International Data Corporation (IDC) has noted that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is likely to add to $39 billion and create 100,000 new jobs in the UAE’s economy between 2022 and 2026 through its cloud based services.\n\nStory continues\n\nAsian corporations themselves contribute about $19 trillion to the world economy each year, according to a report. The continent is home to some of the largest corporations in the world, like Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM), TATA Group, and Reliance Industries, among others.\n\nThe Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM) holds a 12% share of the world’s automobile industry. 11.2 million vehicles were sold by the company in 2023, which secured Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE:TM)’s status as the top automaker for the fourth successive year. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Limited (NYSE:TSM) is the largest producer of semiconductors in the world, holding a 60% share of the global market. In 2023, it even beat the likes of Intel and Samsung in revenue, according to a report.\n\nRace for Power in Asia\n\nSeveral economic powerhouses in Asia have begun leveraging their financial strength to enhance their military capabilities. According to the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (SIPRI), about 25% of the world’s military expenditure of $2.2 trillion in 2022 was incurred by Asian countries.\n\nDefense expenditure has spiked 45% in the continent over the past decade, with the steepest rise seen in South Asia (46%) and East Asia (50%) – the two major flashpoints in the region. The threat of China invading Taiwan is higher today than it has ever been. The US has been ramping up its presence in the Indo-Pacific, and has approved sales of weapons worth billions to Taipei lately.\n\nLast year in March, Washington approved the sale of weapons worth $619 million for Taiwan, including 100 AGM-88B HARM and 200 AMRAAM missiles for its F-16 fleet. RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) and Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) are the primary contractors of the deal. South Korea is also set to receive up to 25 F-35 fighter jets developed by Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) from the US for a deal worth $5 billion, amid increasing aggression from Pyongyang and Beijing.\n\nOil-rich countries in the Middle East are also racking up their defense capabilities. The trend has picked up pace especially after the Arab Spring of 2010 that rattled several Arab monarchies. Saudi Arabia for instance has become the fifth largest spender on defense, having incurred over $75 billion in 2022, which included a $3 billion agreement with RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX) to acquire 300 MIM-104E Patriot missiles.\n\nAmerican defense contractors are also expanding their presence in the Middle East, as part of the strategic ties between the US and its Arab allies. Earlier this week, Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) announced that it had signed agreements with Saudi firms to manufacture parts of its Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) missile defense system in the kingdom. 15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nFour weighted metrics have been considered to rank the most powerful Asian countries in 2024. These are economic strength (40%), military strength (35%), political power (15%), and cultural influence (10%). We observed where every Asian country ranked on each metric in the region and then assigned them weighted scores for those metrics. Finally, these scores were aggregated to have an overall score. Countries in this article are listed in descending order of their overall scores.\n\nData on military strength has been sourced from our recent article, 24 Most Powerful Militaries in the World in 2024. To determine economic rank, we referred to IMF’s figures on nominal GDP for 2023. Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index 2023 was consulted for political soft power of countries, while we used CEO World’s rankings for cultural influence.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a similar consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). Whether you are a beginner investor or professional one looking for the best stocks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nLet’s now head over to the list of the most powerful countries in Asia.\n\nTop 15 Most Powerful Asian Countries in 2024:\n\n15. Pakistan\n\nEconomic Strength Rank: 18\n\nMilitary Strength Rank: 7\n\nPolitical Power Rank: 19\n\nCultural Influence Rank: 27\n\nWeighted-Average Ranking: 3.80\n\nDespite ranking low on political soft power and cultural influence, Pakistan is one of the most powerful countries in Asia. It boasts having the thirteenth strongest military in the world (7th in Asia), and an economy that is approaching the $350 billion mark. That being said, the country has generally underachieved for its size and potential, largely due to the volatile political situation at home.\n\n14. Vietnam\n\nEconomic Strength Rank: 15\n\nMilitary Strength Rank: 13\n\nPolitical Power Rank: 16\n\nCultural Influence Rank: 14\n\nWeighted-Average Ranking: 3.59\n\nVietnam is a key manufacturing hub in Southeast Asia, with an economy measured at $433 billion in 2023 by the IMF. The country has been leveraging its economic strength to upgrade its armed forces, with military spending having grown by over 700% in the last decade. Vietnam is ranked 69th, midway, in Brand Finance’s Global Soft Power Index 2023.\n\n13. Iran\n\nEconomic Strength Rank: 17\n\nMilitary Strength Rank: 11\n\nPolitical Power Rank: 17\n\nCultural Influence Rank: 5\n\nWeighted-Average Ranking: 3.43\n\nDespite facing sanctions and isolation from much of the world, Iran continues to be one of the most powerful Asian countries, with its economy valued at $366 billion in nominal terms by the IMF. The country’s military is known for its large fleet of tanks and a sizable number of battle-hardened troops, who are over 600,000 in number. Iran, due to its rich history and heritage is the fifth most culturally influential country in Asia, according to CEO World.\n\n12. Taiwan\n\nEconomic Strength Rank: 8\n\nMilitary Strength Rank: 10\n\nPolitical Power Rank: Not Listed\n\nCultural Influence Rank: Not Listed\n\nWeighted-Average Ranking: 3.35\n\nWith a GDP of over $750 billion, Taiwan is one of the most powerful Asian countries.

        "title": "Spotify CEO Daniel Ek unloads on Apple by calling its compliance with new EU antitrust rules ‘a farce’",
        "content": "Spotify CEO Daniel Ek ratcheted up his yearslong fight with Apple over its app store policies by accusing the company of skirting new EU requirements to fix the problem.\n\nEk had successfully pushed Europe’s antitrust regulators to require that Apple let users download iOS apps from third party app stores. But on Tuesday, he complained that Apple’s subsequent changes are “a farce” that continues to harm app developers.\n\n“Apple’s stance is very much incongruent to our stance on the matter, and frankly, I think it’s a bit of a farce,” Ek said during Spotify’s earnings call on Tuesday.\n\nTo comply with the EU’s new rules, Apple recently introduced new terms for app purchases and downloads. While Apple is reducing its commission fee for in-app transactions—from 30% to 17%, or 10% for small businesses—it is tacking on additional charges. Developers who use the App Store’s payment processing system will have to pay a 3% fee, and large developers will have to pay €0.50 ($0.54) every time a user downloads their app from an alternative app store.\n\nThis leaves music streaming giant Spotify in the same or a worse position than under Apple’s old policy of charging developers a 30% commission on in-app purchases, Spotify said. App developers can choose whether they want to operate under the old rules or switch to the new ones, but those who adopt the new terms can never switch back.\n\n“It looks on the surface like they’re complying with it,” Ek said during the call about Apple complying with the new EU regulations. “But behind the surface, they’re doing pretty much everything to make this such an unattractive experience that no sane developer would want to pick the new terms.”\n\nApple didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nApple’s policy changes and the new regulation, called the Digital Markets Act (DMA), go into effect in March. During Apple’s earnings call last week, CEO Tim Cook said predicting how consumers will react to the change is difficult, and that it’s too early to know how the changes will impact the company’s revenue. While Spotify says Apple’s new policies circumvent the new rules, the European Commission will ultimately decide on the matter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the core of this feud is Spotify’s bottom line. Over the past four quarters, it has reported a profit only once. Ek protested that some of his company’s ideas to generate more revenue, like selling individual audiobooks, are undermined by Apple’s excessive fees.\n\n“Apple insists on taking a 30% cut, which in many cases exceeds even our own cut,” he said, adding that it limits “some of these innovative things we would like to do.”\n\nNo downside\n\nThe good news for Spotify investors is that Apple’s policy changes result in no downside for Spotify’s existing business, Ek said. Spotify can continue to operate under Apple’s old terms. If the European Commission strictly enforces the DMA against Apple, though, the “potential upsides could be quite significant,” he said.\n\nFor the most recent quarter, which ended Dec. 31, Spotify reported subscriber growth that beat analysts’ expectations and revenue that fell slightly below. The company had 236 million paid subscribers, up 10 million from the previous quarter. Meanwhile, it generated $3.67 billion in revenue, or 16% year-over-year growth.\n\nInvestors cheered the news Tuesday morning, sending the stock soaring 9% before it retreated to a 4% gain, at $231.92.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Move Over, Tesla: 5 Stocks That Could Take Its Place in the Magnificent Seven",
        "content": "Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has long been the odd duckling of the Magnificent Seven, the group of seven high-performing tech companies that have dominated the S&P 500 over the past year and change.\n\nUnlike the other six…\n\nCosts. Tesla makes its money from high-cost manufacturing, which depresses gross margins and lowers cash returns on investment. Auto manufacturing has never been – and likely will never be – “scalable” like software and other tech products. Competition. The firm is facing greater competition than the rest. Last month, China’s BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) overtook Tesla as the world’s largest electric vehicle maker. Innovation. And its CEO’s top innovations are often siphoned into separate entities like Neuralink (brain implants) and Starlink (worldwide internet coverage). Tesla’s only revenue stream beyond EVs is in solar power.\n\nTogether, that makes Tesla’s balance sheet look more like an industrial firm’s than a monopolistic tech giant. By focusing his company on high-cost production, Elon Musk has left Tesla looking more like a regular automaker than the world’s next disruptor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips A chart showing TSLA's gross margins and estimated earnings against the other Magnificent 7 members.\n\nThat’s caused some problems for Tesla’s stock. Since January, its market capitalization has shrunk by a quarter. Most recent estimates peg U.S. EV growth at just 19% in 2024, down from a 45% jump the previous year, while potential competition from China could spoil the market further. Analysts believe Tesla will see its revenues rise just 14% this year, its slowest pace on record.\n\nBut what company could replace Tesla in the Magnificent Seven? Few firms have the same monopolistic bargaining power as the other six: Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). And even fewer have the raw financial resources to catch up or build their own “moats” in the tech industry.\n\nNevertheless, the writers and analysts at InvestorPlace.com – our free investment news site – have several ideas of which firms could replace the EV company. Even though Tesla still commands an outstanding A+ grade in my AI stock-grading system, MarketMasterAI, several pure-play tech firms could soon steal its place.\n\nStory continues\n\n5 Stocks to Replace Tesla: Advanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn December, chip designer Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) launched the MI300, a 3D “superchip” designed to take on Nvidia’s top AI products.\n\nThe design is groundbreaking. The new chip is roughly 30% faster than Nvidia’s top-of-the-line H100 design. And orders are already streaming in. AMD’s management estimates that sales will top $3.5 billion in the first year. That vaults AMD back into competition with Nvidia, a firm that currently ships 86% of the world’s AI accelerator chips.\n\nIt’s why InvestorPlace.com’s Tyrik Torres believes that AMD could become the “Next Big Thing for Chip Investors in 2024”:\n\nThe Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit… work to train large-language models, and AMD CEO Lisa Su said these chips are comparable to Nvidia’s H100 but are “better on the inferenc[ing].”\n\nAll of this means, while AMD shares have risen more than 136% over the past 12 months, there is still enough upside potential to get new investors interested.\n\nOf course, not everyone agrees. This week, David Moadel warns that optimism over AMD stock could be getting out of hand:\n\nIf you’re a contrarian investor, you may bristle at the ultra-optimistic consensus associated with AMD. You’ll bristle even harder when you discover that AMD’s GAAP-measured trailing 12-month price-to-earnings ratio is 1,353x. That not a misprint…\n\nIn other words, I don’t recommend pressing your luck with AMD stock at its currently stretched valuation.\n\nAMD also faces an enormous uphill battle in AI acceleration software, an area that Nvidia has dominated for the past decade. Any software optimized for Nvidia’s CUDA platform needs to be rewritten for AMD’s open-sourced ROCm system.\n\nStill, AMD is an attractive alternative for cloud computing firms seeking to reduce their reliance on Nvidia. And given AMD’s recent successes against Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the X86 server business, don’t be surprised if this underdog soon gives Nvidia a run for its money.\n\n2. Broadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of networking giant Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) came within striking distance of Tesla’s market capitalization last week. The $20 billion difference was almost a rounding error for the $560 billion firm.\n\nBroadcom is the most likely company to eclipse Tesla’s value in the coming months. The high-value chip and software business is a provenly strong aggregator of firms, and AI has recently turbocharged its networking business. Analysts expect net income to grow double-digits this year, outpacing Tesla’s growth fourfold.\n\nThat’s because demand for networking and wireless chips has been insatiable. Vendors from Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) to Arista Networks (NASDAQ:ANET) have seen revenues for networking chips rise double digits in the past quarter, offsetting far slower growth in other areas. Charles Munyi at InvestorPlace.com notes that Broadcom is an “AI beneficiary [that] increased its dividend by 14% and will see significant free cash flow growth”. Paul La Monica adds that Broadcom is one of five mega-cap stocks that could turn the Magnificent Seven into the ”Dynamic Dozen.”\n\nOf course, several issues stand in Broadcom’s way.\n\nThe most obvious is that Broadcom focuses on high-tech enterprise sales, which is a historically cyclical business. Sales are expected to slow to single digits in 2026 as growth ebbs.\n\nBroadcom’s M&A strategy also faces headwinds. The semiconductor industry now trades at enormous premiums, which largely eliminates Broadcom’s historical ability to cheaply buy up smaller companies and wring out efficiencies.\n\nStill, investors might not care in the end. “Sorry, Tesla and Elon fans,” La Monica writes. “It looks like investors are finding other large-cap stocks to embrace so far in 2024.”\n\n3. Eli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn November 2023, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Eli Lilly’s (NYSE:LLY) Zepbound, the company’s response to Novo Nordisk’s (NYSE:NVO) Ozempic and Wegovy weight-loss drugs. Studies found that Lilly’s entry was more effective at treating patients on average, with a regular dose helping people lose 25% of their weight.\n\nMuch of this news had already been anticipated. An earlier version of Eli Lilly’s weight-loss treatment, Mounjaro, had already been approved in 2022, and the company’s shares had already risen two-thirds in the year leading up to Zepbound’s approval.\n\nBut more upside is likely on the way. Today, roughly a third of Americans are overweight, and 36% are obese, according to the Harvard School of Public Health. These figures have more than doubled since 1980, driven by worsening diets and a spike in childhood obesity. Zepbound’s efficacy has also taken the medical world by storm.\n\nThat’s made Wall Street particularly bullish about Eli Lilly’s prospects. Analysts at Morningstar believe that drugs combating weight will generate $120 billion in revenues annually by 2031, split evenly between Novo Nordisk and Eli Lilly.\n\nThe figure could be even higher. While the federal Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services currently does not cover weight-loss medications, lobbying to get these drugs approved for coverage from the American Medical Association has been intense. The benefits of weight-loss drugs also extend to diabetes, heart disease, and other risk factors that will be difficult for CMS to argue away.\n\nIt’s why Alex Sirois highlights Eli Lilly this week at InvestorPlace.com for its “strong buy” rating on Wall Street. Chris Markoch went a step further in January, calling Eli Lilly a firm with “massive upside”:\n\nThe real upside for Eli Lilly comes from projected earnings. In the next 12 months, the company expects to see earnings grow by 89%. Much of this is due to the success of its GLP-1 weight loss drugs Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\nStill, investors will want to tread carefully. Eli Lilly trades at a significant premium to its fundamental value of roughly $450, so it will need to achieve multiple years of super-normal growth to justify its current $660 price tag.\n\n4. Netflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn 2022, Forbes writer Peter Cohan proclaimed that “FAANG Is Dead.” Shares of Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX), the “N” in that group, had fallen 70%, and few believed that the streaming giant could beat better-funded rivals like Disney (NYSE:DIS) or Amazon. The latter would splash out $715 million to launch The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power streaming TV series later that year.\n\nBut it turns out it’s harder to beat Netflix than it might seem. Amazon’s Rings of Power proved to be a flop; only 37% of people who started the series finished it, according to a study by Forbes. And even Disney has struggled to maintain momentum. In its most recent quarter, the media giant revealed that domestic paid subscribers to its Disney+ streaming service had increased by only 1% quarter-over-quarter. Disney-owned Hulu lost 100,000 online subscribers.\n\nMeanwhile, Netflix has continued to push ahead. On Jan. 26, the firm revealed that subscribers had increased 5.3% quarter-over-quarter and 12.7% year-over-year. Margins have also expanded, rising from 7% to 16.9% in a year. Netflix now has roughly as many viewers as Prime Video and Disney/Hulu combined.\n\nIt’s why Netflix tops Joel Baglole’s list at InvestorPlace.com of “3 Hypergrowth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever.” In an update this week, Baglole notes how Netflix is not only reasserting itself as the world’s dominant streaming company, but also the only profitable one:\n\nAs of yesterday, NFLX stock is up 12% after another strong earnings print. Growing subscription numbers are driving the share price higher. In the last six months, the stock has gained 30%, including an 18% rise so far in 2024. News that the company added 13.1 million net new subscribers in Q4 of 2023 has shifted the share price into overdrive.\n\nOf course, an investment in Netflix comes with several risks. Firstly, subscriber growth will slow in 2024 as the benefits of cracking down on password sharing rolls off. Secondly, the firm is reaching saturation in the U.S. and Canadian markets, where roughly 55% of households already subscribe.\n\nFinally, valuations are relatively stretched based on the financial resources Netflix must pour into content creation. A bottom-up valuation prices the streaming firm’s stock closer to $450, well below its current $565 market price.\n\nStill, Netflix and most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have long shown that high-growth companies can often grow fast enough to fill in their valuations. With Disney and other competitors struggling, Netflix could take Tesla’s “Magnificent” crown.\n\n5. Visa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final pick to become the next “Magnificent Seven” stock comes down to four stocks:\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU)\n\nEach of these firms dominates its industry and has gross margins that exceed 70%. They’re also fast-growing, with earnings growth expected to top 15% this year. In other words, all look much like a Magnificent Seven stock.\n\nEach also has its fans at InvestorPlace.com. Salesforce is favored by Michael Que for its GenAI-powered tools. Marc Guberti prefers Adobe for its relatively favorable valuations. And Luke Lango prefers Intuit for its strong AI tool set that is launching just in time for the 2024 tax year. (subscription required).\n\nMy favorite, however, is Visa, a company that has quietly become one of the fastest growing blue-chip stocks on the market. And here’s why I recommend it above all others.\n\nIn August 2023, my MarketMasterAI system began awarding Visa the top A+ score. And by December, the payments firm had risen into the Top 5.\n\nA look under the hood quickly reveals the reason. MarketMasterAI uses analyst estimates (among other data points) to predict how markets will perform over the next six months. And these figures have been steadily rising for the past several months, especially among consumer-focused firms. Earnings-per-share estimates for 2024 at cruise firm Royal Caribbean Cruises Ltd. (NYSE:RCL), a bell-weather of U.S. consumer demand, have surged from $6 at the start of 2023 to $9.30 today. Airlines, home builders, and other cyclical firms are seeing similar upgrades.\n\nThat tells us that payment firms like Visa should perform marvelously over the next six months. Payment companies rely on rising spending, and we’re currently seeing a “goldilocks” environment of strong consumption and low default rates. Cross-border transactions are also returning on rising international travel. This is a particularly lucrative source of profits for firms like Visa and should keep margins high going into 2025.\n\nPerhaps most importantly, Visa remains a monopolistic business that’s riding a secular wave of electronic payments. Its services are accepted almost universally, and its ubiquity in the financial system means it doesn’t matter whether consumers use credit, debit, or mobile for payments. As long as consumers are ditching cash, Visa will benefit.\n\nThat makes Visa stand out from the rest. It’s fast growing, lucrative, and able to maintain its leading position with virtually no effort. In other words, a perfect “Magnificent Seven” stock.\n\nThe Real Magnificent Seven\n\nFans of old Westerns will have doubtlessly watched the 1960 movie The Magnificent Seven, an adaptation of the 1954 Japanese epic Seven Samurai. In it, the ensemble cast, including Steve McQueen and James Coburn, join forces to defend a village against a gang of bandits.\n\n[Mild spoiler alert] The fortunes of the seven vary wildly. Some survive the encounter, while others do not. The movie’s winding script, which leaned heavily on the Japanese original, is a masterclass on keeping viewers guessing.\n\nThis is probably not what Bank of America strategist Michael Hartnett thought when he coined the term “Magnificent Seven” to describe America’s top tech stocks at the time. To the uninitiated, the phrase sounds more like a “can’t lose” list of investments.\n\nLife, however, often mimics art. Tesla’s 2030 bonds now trade at 82 cents on the dollar, depressed by fears of an EV slowdown. And analysts have cut their earnings per share estimates by 20% on average over the past 30 days.\n\nThat’s why Louis Navellierlaunches a new video this week that details how to navigate this new normal. In it, he reveals the Quantum Cashproject, his newly upgraded AI-powered income system. Quantum Cash recently paid out a $3,375 windfall in a one-month time frame… $4,650 in three months… $11,925 in five months… and $16,875 in 11 months.\n\nSo, if you’re feeling a little behind in your retirement savings and want to build a second income stream (even if you have a smaller portfolio)… consider setting aside five minutes of your time to watch Louis’ critical broadcast, here.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung held a LONG position in shares in GOOG and GOOGL.

        "title": "Analyst Estimates: Here's What Brokers Think Of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) After Its First-Quarter Report",
        "content": "As you might know, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently reported its quarterly numbers. The result was positive overall - although revenues of US$120b were in line with what the analysts predicted, Apple surprised by delivering a statutory profit of US$2.18 per share, modestly greater than expected. Earnings are an important time for investors, as they can track a company's performance, look at what the analysts are forecasting for next year, and see if there's been a change in sentiment towards the company. So we gathered the latest post-earnings forecasts to see what estimates suggest is in store for next year.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Apple  earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nFollowing last week's earnings report, Apple's 43 analysts are forecasting 2024 revenues to be US$388.3b, approximately in line with the last 12 months. Statutory per share are forecast to be US$6.55, approximately in line with the last 12 months. In the lead-up to this report, the analysts had been modelling revenues of US$396.3b and earnings per share (EPS) of US$6.57 in 2024. The consensus seems maybe a little more pessimistic, trimming their revenue forecasts after the latest results even though there was no change to its EPS estimates.\n\nThe consensus has reconfirmed its price target of US$200, showing that the analysts don't expect weaker revenue expectations next year to have a material impact on Apple's market value. That's not the only conclusion we can draw from this data however, as some investors also like to consider the spread in estimates when evaluating analyst price targets. There are some variant perceptions on Apple, with the most bullish analyst valuing it at US$250 and the most bearish at US$125 per share. This is a fairly broad spread of estimates, suggesting that analysts are forecasting a wide range of possible outcomes for the business.\n\nLooking at the bigger picture now, one of the ways we can make sense of these forecasts is to see how they measure up against both past performance and industry growth estimates. We would highlight that Apple's revenue growth is expected to slow, with the forecast 0.9% annualised growth rate until the end of 2024 being well below the historical 10% p.a. growth over the last five years. Compare this against other companies (with analyst forecasts) in the industry, which are in aggregate expected to see revenue growth of 4.7% annually. Factoring in the forecast slowdown in growth, it seems obvious that Apple is also expected to grow slower than other industry participants.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThe most obvious conclusion is that there's been no major change in the business' prospects in recent times, with the analysts holding their earnings forecasts steady, in line with previous estimates. Unfortunately, they also downgraded their revenue estimates, and our data indicates underperformance compared to the wider industry. Even so, earnings per share are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. Even so, earnings are more important to the intrinsic value of the business. The consensus price target held steady at US$200, with the latest estimates not enough to have an impact on their price targets.\n\nFollowing on from that line of thought, we think that the long-term prospects of the business are much more relevant than next year's earnings. At Simply Wall St, we have a full range of analyst estimates for Apple going out to 2026, and you can see them free on our platform here..\n\nAnd what about risks?

        "content": "Semiconductor stocks have experienced a dramatic divergence in their fortunes over the past year. For chip companies with exposure to AI, business is booming. For everyone else, times are tough.\n\nIn fact, despite the AI boom, total global semiconductor sales fell 8.8% in 2023. And if you removed AI-related chips from the equation, the decline would have been far sharper. The cycle has turned quite negative in categories such as memory and analog chips.\n\nWhile many AI-related semiconductor stocks have soared and now have dubious valuations, there are still real bargains in other parts of the chip space. These are three of the best opportunities today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTexas Instruments (TXN) Texas Instruments logo on its world headquarters located in Dallas, Texas.\n\nSource: Katherine Welles / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN) is the world’s largest analog semiconductor company by market share.\n\nAnalog chips are vital because they allow devices to translate real-world information, such as weather conditions, into data that devices can recognize. Analog chips are a huge piece of the Internet of Things theme, as all sorts of appliances and devices can now connect to the Internet and be controlled remotely.\n\nRight now, Texas Instruments has a huge growth opportunity in smart cars. The computing intensity of vehicles is skyrocketing as automakers put everything from increasingly sophisticated entertainment systems to self-driving and more into the next generation of cars. Texas Instruments offers various solutions for the auto market and should enjoy tremendous growth in that field over the next decade.\n\nHowever, Texas Instruments has seen its stock underperform over the past year as the new car market has dipped amid higher interest rates. That makes for a buying opportunity, as Texas Instruments’ ruthless focus on capital efficiency and its large share repurchase program will continue delivering shareholder value during this current cyclical downturn.\n\nStory continues\n\nQorvo (QRVO) qorvo (QRVO) logo on the screen of a mobile phone\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nQorvo (NASDAQ:QRVO) is a semiconductor company focused on mobile communications. It makes radio frequency filters, front-end modules and power amplifiers needed to build high-end smartphones.\n\nQRVO stock underperformed in 2023 thanks to the dip in the smartphone market. There was a particular downturn in the Asian market that had analysts concerned. More broadly, Qorvo has significant revenue exposure to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), a legitimate risk factor should the iPhone maker ever switch suppliers.\n\nThat said, Qorvo shares appear to be significantly undervalued, especially as the smartphone market seems to have bottomed out. Specifically, Qorvo’s most recent quarterly earnings report showed a 44% jump in year-over-year revenue, which exceeded even the high end of the firm’s prior guidance.\n\nAnd Qorvo is not just a smartphone parts maker, either. It also sells products for other fields, such as television equipment, infrastructure and military purposes and wireless base stations. While Qorvo has concentrated exposure to Apple, Samsung Electronics and other phone makers, that is more than baked into the stock price, with shares at an estimated 17 times 2024 earnings and just 13 times projected 2025 earnings.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is the world’s largest semiconductor foundry operator. Foundries produce chips for other semiconductor companies that don’t wish to own and operate their own manufacturing facilities.\n\nTSM has built an incredible business with unprecedented operating scale and efficiency. It has more than 56% market share globally. The next closest peer, Samsung, has just a 12% share by comparison.\n\nAs the semiconductor industry expands in the coming years, TSM will naturally pick up a large chunk of the market as it grows.\n\nThe biggest risk to Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is arguably from politics. Tensions have mounted between China and Taiwan. However, the company is mitigating this risk by investing heavily in overseas facilities in locations such as Arizona. Despite strong earnings and favorable long-term prospects, TSM stock is still available at less than 20 times forward earnings today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in TXN stock.

        "title": "Spotify shares jump after strong guidance and user growth outweigh earnings miss",
        "content": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that missed expectations. But strong guidance helped boost shares in early trading as the music-streaming platform continues to focus on profitability amid recent price hikes and changes to its podcasting strategy.\n\nThe company reported an operating loss of 75 million euros ($80.6 milliom) in the quarter amid severance and real estate related charges, but guided to strong Q1 operating income of 180 million euros.\n\nSpotify's stock jumped in premarket trading immediately following the results, up nearly 10%.\n\nThe streaming service reported a net loss of 70 million euros ($75.2 million), or a loss of 0.36 euros per share. That missed analyst expectations of a loss of 0.31 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 430 million euros, or a loss of 2.23 euros a share.\n\nThe losses come after the company turned a profit in Q3 for the first time in over a year.\n\nGross margins, however, came in stronger than expected at 26.7%, slightly beating company guidance of 26.6%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick down slightly to 26.4% in the first quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. With the exception of Q3, margins have been stuck between 21% and 25% in recent quarters.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.67 billion euros — 16% higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, but slightly below Wall Street expectations of 3.72 billion euros. Spotify guided to first quarter revenue of 3.6 billion euros.\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) beat company estimates of 601 million to hit 602 million in the quarter — a 23% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q1 MAUs to come in at 618 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nPremium subscribers also surpassed Wall Street expectations of 224 million — a 15% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 239 million in the first quarter. Spotify's strong guidance helped boost shares in early trading. (Patrick Semansky/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, jumped on both a yearly and quarterly basis, coming in at 396 million euros compared to 216 million euros in the prior quarter and negative 73 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nAverage revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 1% to 4.60 euros (or 5% year-over-year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.)

        "title": "Spotify stock jumps after strong guidance and user growth outweigh earnings miss",
        "content": "Spotify Technology (SPOT) reported fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday that missed expectations. But strong guidance helped boost shares in early trading as the music-streaming platform continues to focus on profitability amid recent price hikes and changes to its podcasting strategy.\n\nThe company reported an operating loss of 75 million euros ($80.6 million) in the quarter amid severance and real estate-related charges. This was ahead of updated company guidance that Q4 operating losses would come in between 93 million euros and 108 million euros.\n\nThe audio giant also guided to a strong Q1 operating income of 180 million euros, well ahead of Wall Street consensus expectations. Spotify reported an operating loss of 231 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nSpotify's stock jumped in premarket trading immediately following the results, up nearly 10%.\n\nThe streaming service reported a net loss of 70 million euros ($75.2 million), or a loss of 0.36 euros per share. That missed analyst expectations of a loss of 0.31 euros per share. It also compares with the year-earlier period loss of 430 million euros, or a loss of 2.23 euros a share.\n\nThe losses come after the company turned a profit in Q3 for the first time in over a year.\n\nGross margins, however, came in stronger than expected at 26.7%, slightly beating company guidance of 26.6%. The streamer said it expects margins to tick down slightly to 26.4% in the first quarter, primarily driven by year-over-year improvements in music and podcasting.\n\nSpotify has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. With the exception of Q3, margins have been stuck between 21% and 25% in recent quarters.\n\nRevenue, meanwhile, totaled 3.67 billion euros — 16% higher compared with the fourth quarter of 2022, but slightly below Wall Street expectations of 3.72 billion euros. Spotify guided to first quarter revenue of 3.6 billion euros.\n\nStory continues\n\nUser figures\n\nTotal monthly active users (MAUs) beat company estimates of 601 million to hit 602 million in the quarter — a 23% improvement compared with the total in the year-ago period. The streaming service anticipates Q1 MAUs to come in at 618 million.\n\nPremium subscribers also surpassed Wall Street expectations of 224 million to hit 236 million — a 15% year-over-year jump. Spotify expects that subscriber count to increase to 239 million in the first quarter. Q4 net additions of 10 million contributed to record full-year net additions of 31 million, the company said.\n\nFree cash flow, another key metric for investors, jumped on both a yearly and quarterly basis, coming in at 396 million euros compared to 216 million euros in the prior quarter and negative 73 million euros in the year-ago period.\n\nThe average revenue per user, or ARPU, for Premium subscriptions increased 1% to 4.60 euros (or 5% year over year, excluding foreign exchange headwinds.) ARPU was driven by price increase benefits that were partially offset by discounted plans and lower prices in emerging markets, the company said.\n\nProfit pledge\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon",
        "content": "Earnings season has arrived, providing fresh batches of figures to consider when expanding your portfolio.\n\nTwo of the major companies releasing results last week were Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Both have built immense brand loyalty with consumers and boast powerful positions in retail. Apple has almost unrivaled supremacy in consumer tech products. Amazon has similar dominance in e-commerce and the cloud market.\n\nSince 2019, Apple has soared by 349% and Amazon by 96%. While past growth is no guarantee of what's to come, these companies have solid long-term outlooks as they continue to expand in their respective industries. Meanwhile, Apple and Amazon both beat Wall Street forecasts for earnings per share  and revenue in their most recent quarters.\n\nBut is Apple or Amazon the better stock to buy right now?\n\nApple\n\nApple is coming out of a tricky year. Macroeconomic headwinds caught up with the company in its fiscal 2023 (which ended Sept. 30, 2023), and revenue dipped by 3%. However, the results from its fiscal 2024 first quarter (which ended Dec. 31, 2023) showed signs that a recovery could be underway.\n\nDuring the quarter, Apple's net sales rose 2% year over year to $120 billion, beating analysts' expectations by more than $1 billion and breaking a streak of four consecutive quarters of revenue declines. Meanwhile, its earnings hit $2.18 per share compared to an expected $2.10 per share.\n\nYet, outperforming estimates wasn't enough to quell investor concern over its iPhone business. Smartphone sales increased 6% in Q1 2024, yet fell 13% in China. That country has increased restrictions on the iPhone, threatening sales in one of Apple's most crucial markets. China accounts for about 17% of its product sales.\n\nAs a result, Apple's stock fell nearly 4% in after-hours trading following its earnings release on Feb. 1.\n\nHowever, recent challenges are why keeping a long-term perspective with proven growth stocks like Apple is crucial. The company has a highly lucrative digital services business and is investing heavily in expanding markets like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, the tech firm hit nearly $100 billion in free cash flow last year. It has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.\n\nAmazon\n\nWall Street seemed to have the opposite reaction to Amazon's earnings release. The e-commerce giant's shares rose by nearly 10% after it posted its Q4 2023 results on Feb. 1.\n\nDuring the quarter, Amazon's revenue grew 14% year over year to $170 billion, outperforming the consensus forecast by close to $4 billion. Meanwhile, its earnings per share came to $1, compared to an expected $0.80.\n\nMuch of Amazon's stellar growth came from its e-commerce business. Its North American segment posted operating income exceeding $6 billion, significantly improving on the $240 million in losses reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nAmazon's Q4 was a fitting end to a stellar year of growth. After suffering steep declines in 2022 as spikes in inflation curbed consumer discretionary spending, the company pulled off an impressive turnaround.\n\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is up 63% year over year, compared to a 28% rise in Apple's share price. During the same period, Amazon's free cash flow soared by 427% to $17 billion. Apple's total free cash flow is higher, but declined by just over 1% over the last 12 months.\n\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory, with solid retail growth and a highly profitable cloud business.\n\nIs Apple or Amazon the best stock to buy right now?\n\nComparing these firms' forward price-to-earnings ratios (P/E), Apple's 28 against Amazon's 48 makes the iPhone company's stock look like a far better value. Forward P/E is a valuation metric calculated by dividing a company's share price by its estimated future earnings per share. The lower the figure, generally, the better the value.\n\nHowever, the chart below shows their valuations are more complex than that. AAPL EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Apple's earnings could hit nearly $8 per share over the next two fiscal years, and Amazon's might reach just under $7 per share. Multiplying these figures by the companies' forward P/E ratios yields stock prices of $218 for Apple and $317 for Amazon.\n\nBased on their current positions, these projections would see Apple's stock price rise 17% by fiscal 2026, while Amazon shares would increase by 84%.\n\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer in a decision between these two companies. The tech giant is on a growth path too good to ignore, making it the better stock to buy right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World. You can skip our detailed analysis of permanent residency and go directly to the 5 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World.\n\nThis vast world is filled with places of wonderment. Many of us love to travel and experience the diversity in nature and culture that has spread out to nooks and corners around the globe. Additionally, there are those who choose to settle down permanently in a country other than their birthplace. In the latter case, the idea behind the visit is to simply explore new experiences and spend some vacation time in a pleasing manner. However, in the former, practicality takes precedence, and numerous variables are considered before a final decision is reached. The aim is to choose the best permanent-residency country in the world.\n\nAccording to the IOM UN Migration Report 2022, the majority of people worldwide still reside in their countries of origin. Only one in thirty individuals falls into the immigrant category. In 2020, it was estimated that approximately 281 million international migrants existed globally, constituting about 3.6% of the total world population. Notably, this figure marked an increase of 128 million people compared to the 1990 figure and was three times higher than the estimated figure for 1970. Thus, this indicates a burgeoning desire in people to move, sparking the search for the best country in the world to settle permanently.\n\nWhat is Permanent Residency?\n\nPermanent residency, often referred to as a PR visa, denotes a resident status in a country other than one's country of origin, granting individuals the right to live, work, study, and even establish a business in that country. Holders of a PR visa may also be entitled to social security, healthcare, and various financial benefits. Additionally, the visa may permit individuals to bring their families, including parents, and children may qualify for free schooling. It is important to note that these benefits can vary across countries. The residency permit, which is issued to legally ensure these activities, is usually renewed after a specific time period. During this time, individuals are free to enter or leave the country, but it's crucial to keep in mind that maintaining residency status typically requires a minimum physical presence.\n\nStory continues\n\nTypes of Permanent Residency Visas\n\nThere are various types of permanent residency visas, including skilled immigration, state/territory/province-sponsored immigration, employer-based immigration, family migration, and investment migration. While certain general requirements apply to all PR visas, specific details can vary from country to country. In fact, some countries do not even permit permanent residency, and the necessary physical presence requirement also differs across nations. Hence, before uprooting one's life to move elsewhere, it's essential to ensure that the chosen destination is the best fit for permanent residency.\n\nThe Country with the Highest Immigrants\n\nOver the past decade, a significant number of individuals have been seeking settlement or acquiring second citizenship in European nations. This trend has been further fueled by European countries easing their immigration processes, largely in response to labor shortages within the union. However, it's noteworthy to highlight the permanent immigrant inflow figure of the United States for the year 2022, standing at 1.05 million--the highest compared to other countries. The U.S. has consistently ranked as the top country for accepting immigrants, with the 2021 figure reaching 833,900, as reported by US News. This trend is unsurprising, given the country's generous approach to immigration through various channels. One notable method is employer-based immigration, where companies sponsor employees for green cards. Tech giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), and Adobe Inc. (NASDAQ: ADBE), among others, have actively sponsored their employees for green cards.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is an American multinational technology company that has employed a substantial number of overseas workers over the years. In the fiscal years 2020 to 2022 alone, the company submitted 13,381 labor condition applications for H-1B visas and 3,412 labor certifications for green cards. Notably, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) recently reached a $25 million settlement with the U.S. government concerning the hiring of immigrants.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), another American multinational technology company, has employed a significant number of foreign workers. From 2020 to 2022, the company submitted 26,695 labor condition applications for H-1B visas and 9,920 labor certifications for green cards. Barbara Leen, Senior Corporate Counselor at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), remains an advocate for immigrants, actively urging for reform in the U.S. immigration policy.\n\nLet’s take a look at our list of 20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World. 20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World\n\n20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World\n\nMethodology\n\nTo determine the top 20 countries for permanent residency, our focus centered on the key reasons people move, such as improved work opportunities and a better quality of life, encompassing health and education. Our methodology relied on data from the Migrant Integration Policy Index 2020, considering metrics like security of permanent residency, labor market mobility, education, and health integration for each nation. By averaging these scores, we identified countries facilitating smoother relocation while meeting these key objectives. In the case of tied averages, the cost of living index served as a tie-breaker. For instance, if three places had the same scores, 0.2 points were awarded for the highest cost of living index, and 0.1 points for the second highest. A higher average score indicates a more favorable ranking.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\n20 Best Permanent Residency Countries in the World\n\n20. Japan\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 63\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 59\n\nHealth Score: 65\n\nEducation Score: 33\n\nInsider Monkey Average Score: 55\n\nIn the Asian region, Japan stands out as one of the best countries for permanent residency. As a developed nation, it ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Geographically well-positioned, Japan provides strategic access to other Asian countries, as well as Australia, New Zealand, and the South Pacific Islands, offering immigrants diverse opportunities. The country's high permanent residency score, coupled with robust health integration and labor mobility prospects, emphasizes the favorable conditions for immigrants to settle comfortably. Notably, Japan's permanent residency is granted indefinitely, in contrast to the continuous renewals or predetermined time limits associated with other visas.\n\n19. United Kingdom\n\nPermanent Residency Score: 58\n\nLabor Market Mobility Score: 48\n\nHealth Score: 75\n\nEducation Score: 40\n\nInsider Monkey Average Score: 55.25\n\nThe United Kingdom remains one of the most favored destinations for expatriates. As a developed nation with high-quality amenities, particularly in education, many individuals aspire to secure permanent residency in the UK. Those with this status can enjoy various benefits, including the right to live and work in the country indefinitely.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Buyers of Apple Inc.’s new Vision Pro headset are finding it can be a major hassle if they lose their passcode.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nKing Charles Treated for Cancer in New Health Scare for Monarchy Why NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% Off China Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore Investors Eastern Europe’s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire West Bonds Fall After ‘One-Two Punch’ of ISM, Fedspeak: Markets Wrap\n\nThe company is telling users who forget their code — typically a series of digits — that they’ll have to bring the device to a store or mail it to AppleCare customer support if they want to get it working again. Apple will then erase and reset it.\n\nThe issue is one of a few early customer-service snags surrounding the $3,499 device, which went on sale Friday. The company’s support staff also has been fielding questions from users struggling to set up Optic ID — an eye-scanning tool for logging into the device — and the built-in Apple Music app.\n\nThe passcode problem could be particularly frustrating. When customers enter their passcode incorrectly too many times, the headset will be disabled. If users still can’t recall their passcode after a waiting period, they’ll need to send it back to Apple to be reset, according to guidance given to the company’s support staff. At that point, all content on the device will be erased.\n\nIt’s a quirk that doesn’t exist with Apple’s other products. The company’s smartwatch, for instance, has a mechanism that lets users set it up again if a passcode is forgotten.\n\nIt’s possible that Apple makes software changes in the near future that would allow the passcode to be reset without needing to send the product back. An Apple spokeswoman didn’t respond to a request for comment.\n\nOn Apple’s community forum, one customer said he spoke to an agent who was flooded with calls about the problem. “He’s had to deal with a lot of angry customers after telling them their only recourse is to return to the store,” the user wrote. “He said Apple Support was really caught off guard by this and apologized for not being better prepared.”\n\nStory continues\n\nOne complication with the Vision Pro is it doesn’t have a USB-C port that lets users plug it into a Mac for troubleshooting. The company did release a special strap for developers to be able to attach the headset to a Mac last week, but that accessory costs about $300 and isn’t meant for consumers.\n\nRead More: Apple Vision Pro Debut Brings New Shopping Experience\n\nThe Vision Pro is Apple’s first major new hardware category since it began selling smartwatches almost a decade ago. The device isn’t expected to be a blockbuster product — partly due to its hefty price tag — but curious customers streamed into Apple stores over the weekend to try it out. The product’s reception has been generally positive, with reviewers praising its immersive video playback and productivity features.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders  Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "High-Risk, High-Reward: 7 OTC Stocks That Could Make You Rich This Year",
        "content": "I cannot stress enough how risky OTC stocks or securities traded over the counter really are. For one thing, just the name OTC should ring some alarm bells. This designation means that these securities don’t trade on exchanges like the New York Stock Exchange or the Nasdaq. Instead, they trade via broker-dealer networks. And not all stock platforms support what’s otherwise known as the pink sheets.\n\nSecond, many investors are shocked to discover the administrative costs tied to OTC stocks. Yes, many of these securities are “cheap,” trading hands at unit prices well below a buck. However, that doesn’t mean that it’s cheap to you. Wide bid-ask spreads may mean that your holdings may have to rise significantly higher to be net profitable. Also, even if you are profitable, low trading volume could mean a long time to find a buyer.\n\nAt the same time, OTC stocks or otherwise highly speculative shares can fly higher. Some examples include the following:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMonster Beverage (NASDAQ:MNST): In 1997, you could have had MNST for just two cents. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL): On a split-adjusted basis, you could have bought AAPL for 10 cents in December 1980. Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD): Back in June 2015, AMD traded for below $2.\n\nOf course, there are way more failures than successes. But if you want to go for gold, below are the OTC stocks to consider.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Tencent (TCEHY) sign on Tencent headquarters in Shenzhen, China.\n\nSource: StreetVJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nA Chinese multinational technology conglomerate, Tencent (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) has had a rough outing in 2023. Mainly, that’s due to the challenging circumstances surrounding the Chinese economy. And if a CNN report proves correct, 2024 could be an even rougher outing. Still, Tencent’s expansionary ambitions reach beyond its home nation. With eyes on Japan, South Korea, Southeast Asia, and several other international regions, Tencent could be interesting for speculators.\n\nTo be sure, with a market capitalization of around $337.5 billion, TCEHY doesn’t exactly rate as one of the typical OTC stocks. However, it’s a great confidence booster because it’s in some ways the best of both worlds: offering tremendous upside potential while also being a technology stalwart in its home nation.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts rate shares a consensus moderate buy with a $49.56 average price target. That implies an upside potential of over 40%. What’s more, the high-side target hits $61.13, possibly delivering growth of over 73%. If that wasn’t enough to whet your appetite, shares trade at only 13.06X forward earnings, below the interactive media sector’s median value of 21.19X.\n\nBYD (BYDDF) A close-up view of the power supply plugged into a vehicle from BYD Company (BYDDY).\n\nSource: J. Lekavicius / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoving on to another Chinese company, BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF) presents a unique proposition. First, it’s a major automotive enterprise specializing in electric vehicles, yet it technically ranks among the OTC stocks. Second, Warren Buffett – who is best known for investing in reliable blue chips – owns BYD via Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-B). To be fair, Buffett has been reducing his exposure but he still owns a sizable amount.\n\nDespite the seemingly contradictory tone, investors may want to consider adding BYDDF to their portfolio. Yeah, it’s one of the OTC stocks and yes, the Chinese economy looks rather putrid if I’m being honest. However, with EVs becoming increasingly commoditized, guess who’s going to win that battle? There’s just no way that western nations can compete with their higher labor costs.\n\nAlso, investors should consider another element: demand. European politicians may want to reduce the flood of Chinese EVs. But their constituents? They love ‘em. So do analysts, who rate BYDDF a consensus strong buy with a $36.03 price target. That implies 63% upside potential.\n\nXiaomi (XIACF) Power supply connect to electric vehicle for charge to the battery. Charging technology industry transport which are the futuristic of the Automobile. EV fuel Plug in hybrid car.\n\nSource: buffaloboy / Shutterstock.com\n\nYet one more Chinese company to discuss and then we’ll get into the really wild OTC stocks. A designer and manufacturer of consumer electronics and related software, Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACF) is a cynical play. For example, beyond its consumer electronics business, it’s also involved in the EV space. Recently, the company launched its first electric-powered vehicle, which might have caught the eyes of some lawyers.\n\nI’m joking there, but seriously, the Xiaomi SU7 looks like it ripped off the design of a particular German brand. But if the consumers who love BYD offer any clues, the SU7 should be a hit. Apparently, it has the performance (up to 664 horsepower) and the longevity to better the top players in the ecosystem. And even if you didn’t like the EV pivot, Xiaomi should win in consumer electronics.\n\nFrankly, with smart devices becoming so commoditized, people may start looking to price more often than brand. If so, XIACF has a clear pathway to robust shareholder profits. Analysts agree, rating the stock a unanimous strong buy with a $2.66 average price target.\n\nQuisitive Technology Solutions (QUISF)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOkay, let’s buckle up for some serious OTC stocks and by that, I mean high risk, high reward. First, Quisitive Technology Solutions (OTCMKTS:QUISF) bills itself as a premier global Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) partner that harnesses its cloud platforms and complete technologies to generate transformational impact for midsize and enterprise-level customers. It’s an intriguing idea because, at one point, shares closed at $1.54 on a weekly average basis.\n\nCurrently, QUISF trades hands at only 22 cents. And you should note that over the past 52 weeks, it lost more than 53% of its equity value. Further, according to the security’s point-and-figure (P&F) chart, it prints a double bottom breakdown. According to StockCharts.com’s educational section, this pattern is a bearish signal. That said, the pattern should also be viewed in a broader context due to possible whipsaw effects.\n\nAnd what is that context? Basically, the broader cloud computing market could be worth $2.43 trillion by 2030. Quisitive just needs to take a bite out of this market to potentially drive higher. Analysts seem to be on the same page, pegging the average price target at 49 cents.\n\nPeninsula Energy (PENMF) periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowing. Uranium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs a fan of the uranium energy space, I perked up when I came across this opportunity hidden among OTC stocks. As a uranium extraction specialist, Peninsula Energy (OTCMKTS:PENMF) addresses a critical supply shortage that recently sprouted. According to The Wall Street Journal, last month, uranium prices jumped to a 16-year high after one of the world’s largest producers – Kazakhstan’s state-owned company Kazatomprom – warned of production target shortfalls.\n\nWith uranium supplies uncertain for the next two years, several uranium players have skyrocketed. One of the exceptions is PENMF. In the trailing one-year period, the security declined by 8%. That said, it is up 15% on a year-to-date basis but that’s a modest performance compared to exchange-listed uranium specialists.\n\nStill, as far as OTC stocks are concerned, Peninsula could be intriguing because of geopolitical considerations. Basically, it features 100% ownership of the Lance Project, which is one of the largest uranium projects in the U.S.\n\nBetter yet, analysts expect great things, pegging shares a moderate buy with a 17-cent target. That implies almost 85% upside potential, with the high-side target landing at 22 cents.\n\nSaturn Oil & Gas (OILSF) Panorama of Oil and Gas central processing platform in twilight, offshore hard work occupation twenty four working hours. Best oil stocks to buy\n\nSource: Oil and Gas Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Calgary, Alberta, Canada, Saturn Oil & Gas (OTCMKTS:OILSF) is a resource company engaged in the business of acquisition, exploration and development of petroleum and natural gas resource despoits in Western Canada. Further, the company’s current focus is to advance the exploration and development of its oil and gas properties in Alberta and Saskatchewan.\n\nAs an upstream player in the hydrocarbon space, Saturn might not seem particularly relevant. Late last year, many oil-producing nations agreed to cut production in a bid to bolster prices. However, that effort did not succeed. Also, Reuters recently reported that rising U.S. oil production has frustrated the aforementioned oil producers. So, it seems OILSF could be one of the losing OTC stocks.\n\nHowever, the blowout January jobs report suggests that we shouldn’t quite give up on black gold just yet. More people with jobs should translate to more resource consumption. And to be blunt, renewable energy just won’t be enough to feed the growing demand profile. Notably, Echelon Wealth Partners believes OILSF could hit $4.22 per share or 137% up.\n\nVivos (RDGL) Doctor or physician calculating a patients medical bills at a desk. Medical bills, health costs, health expenses.\n\nSource: THICHA SATAPITANON / Shutterstock\n\nBefore discussing radiation oncology medical device firm Vivos (OTCMKTS:RDGL), it’s important to disclose that I own RDGL stock. Please make a decision based on your own due diligence and a sober reflection of your risk tolerance. This is a security that has already lost almost 28% YTD and is likely subject to severe market turbulence.\n\nWith the caveats out of the way, Vivos is engaged in the development of its yttrium-90-based brachytherapy device, RadioGel, for the treatment of non-resectable tumors. According to Johns Hopkins Medicine, brachytherapy is a radiation treatment that is given directly into the patient’s body. Typically, the radiation is deployed using tiny devices such as wires, seeds, or rods filled with radioactive materials.\n\nWhere Vivos distinguishes itself is that RadioGel utilizes an injectable particle-gel, which delivers a very high local radiation dose. More broadly, RDGL entices speculators because the underlying industry is still in its early innings, worth $907.76 million in 2022.\n\nAs for a price target, it’s difficult to say as no analyst currently covers RDGL. However, based on my personal research, I believe around 5 cents is the bottom.\n\nPenny Stocks\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators.

        "title": "People are wearing Apple Vision Pro headsets while driving Teslas. Fuzzy distracted-driving laws suggest they can get away with it",
        "content": "Apple Vision Pro owners seem willing to pay thousands of dollars to not look at the world in front of them.\n\nSince Apple Vision Pro’s Friday release across U.S. stores — with an eye-watering starting price of $3,500 — people have been spotted wearing their headsets courtside at NBA games, at the gym, on the subway, and crossing the street. At least two viral videos show people in the driver’s seat of a moving Tesla while still wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset, drawing criticism from government officials and other advocates for distraction-free driving.\n\n“Driving while wearing a VR headset is reckless and disregards the safety of everyone on the road,”  a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration spokesperson told Fortune in a statement. “All vehicles with advanced driver assistance systems require a fully attentive human driver performing the driving task and monitoring the surrounding environment at all times.”\n\nThe Apple Vision Pro user guide warns users to “never use Apple Vision Pro while operating a moving vehicle, bicycle, heavy machinery, or in any other situations requiring attention to safety.”\n\nDistracted driving in the U.S. is a growing problem. The NHTSA reported 3,522 deaths in 2021 — compared to 3,142 the year before, a 12% increase — from distracted driving, or “any activity that diverts attention from driving” like texting, eating, or fiddling with your in-car entertainment. These accidents account for between 8-9% of car-related deaths in the U.S.\n\nCars with self-driving features have dangers of their own. Tesla recalled 2 million vehicles in December due to issues with the self-driving features, and U.S. safety regulators have investigated 1,000 Tesla Autopilot-related accidents, 40 of which were fatal.\n\nWhile there isn’t comprehensive evidence on the prevalence of distracted driving in partially automated vehicles, according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety, there’s a widespread perception that partially automated vehicles are the same as fully self-driving cars, which has led drivers to take their eyes off the road and hands off the wheel.\n\nStory continues\n\nDante Lentini, who posted a video of himself wearing the Apple Vision Pro headset while in the driver’s seat of a partially automated Tesla and appearing to be pulled over by police, told Fortune that the stunt wasn’t as dangerous as it looked. He said his device was on transparency mode and that he was viewing the road from the headset’s cameras. Lentini said an Apple engineer told him the Apple Vision Pro has a steering-wheel detector that does not allow users in the driver seat to use its apps. Apple did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nWearing the headset while driving isn’t as dangerous as using other technologies behind the wheel, Lentini argued.\n\n“While I understand the initial backlash and concern, I believe people may not know the device displays a passthrough vision display of what’s in front of me,” he said. “While I don’t recommend driving with it on, I would find someone being on their phone or even eating to be more hindered.”\n\nDespite the video showing a police car pulled up behind him in a parking lot, Lentini was not pulled over or given a citation. The video was meant to be a skit, he said.\n\nSwerving into legal troubles\n\nLentini wasn’t busted for distracted driving, and inconsistencies in laws banning distracting technology in cars may explain why.\n\nThe use of handheld devices while driving is illegal in 24 states, and texting is illegal in 48 states, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics — and in all but two of those states, texting while driving is a primary law. That means law enforcement can ticket a driver for distracted driving without any other traffic violation, such as speeding.\n\nBut texting only accounts for some of the distractions behind the wheel. Two-thirds of drivers surveyed by the IIHS reported performing a distracting activity behind the wheel, like using a navigation app, making a call, or reading texts. Eight percent of those surveyed reported playing a video game while driving.\n\nWhile 35 states have laws that prohibit screens in drivers’ lines of sight, some of those states, such as New York and New Jersey, limit the ban to television, not internet streaming. In states like Texas, similar bans don’t apply to devices with screens mounted near the dashboard.\n\nThe introduction of face-mounted technology further complicates how distracted-driving laws are enforced. In 2013, Southern California driver Cecelia Abadie was pulled over and given a speeding ticket while driving wearing Google Glass, an Android mixed-reality product. She was given an additional citation for wearing Google Glass. California vehicle code 27602 outlines that a person should not drive if a screen pointed toward the driver is displaying video. Both charges were thrown out because of lack of evidence that the device was turned on and playing video.\n\nBy February 2014, several states introduced legislation regulating the use of Google Glass behind the wheel. Google led lobbying efforts to kill bills banning Google Glass use while driving, arguing because the product was not yet readily available, banning it would be premature. Google Glass prototype sales ended in January 2015, but Google’s most recent enterprise version of the device was on the market from 2019 to 2023.\n\nIt’s unclear if Apple Vision Pro will face similar regulatory hurdles as the Google Glass but until it does, expect more inadvisable headset sightings in online stunts.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "title": "Not All of Big Tech Posted Magnificent Results for the 4th Quarter",
        "content": "Did Meta and Amazon just save earnings season?\n\nBig tech earnings kicked off earnings season last week and not all of the results were so magnificent. Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) got things started on Tuesday, and while both surpassed top and bottom-line expectations, it wasn't enough for investors. Weak advertising revenues for Alphabet resulted in a nearly 6% stock price decline in the wake of the report,[1] and light guidance from Microsoft also didn't go over well with investors.[2] Given the momentum tech had into these reports and rich price-earnings levels, investors were less willing to forgive minor stumbles. The same went for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), which reported disappointing revenue from China on Thursday, the stock fell over 5% in the hours after the report before climbing back on Friday.[3]\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with DIS.\n\nThe two standouts for last week were undoubtedly Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (AMZN?), both handily beating expectations on the top and bottom-line.[4] Even sweeter for Meta investors was the announcement of the company's first ever dividend of 50 cents as well as a $50 billion buyback plan.[5] CEO Mark Zuckerberg also vowed to \"keep things lean,\" a strategy that has worked well for the social media company who successfully pulled off the \"year of efficiency\" in 2023.[6]\n\nAs a result of better-than-expected reports last week, the FactSet blended S&P 500 EPS consensus now stands at 1.6%, an uptick from -1.4% the week prior.[7]\n\nBut that's not all that moved the markets last week, the first Federal Reserve meeting of 2024 ended up being a bust when Chairman Powell indicated they are not ready to begin cutting rates yet.[8] The CME Group FedWatch tool is now predicting a 60% probability of a rate cut at the May 1st meeting, with the likelihood of a March 20th cut falling to 21%.[9]\n\nWhile markets initially fell after that news on Wednesday, they perked back up after Thursday's tech results and Friday's blockbuster jobs number. Nonfarm Payrolls came in at 353,000 for January, and unemployment stayed at 3.7%, marking 24 consecutive months of sub-4% unemployment and the longest stretch since the 1960s.[10]\n\nStory continues\n\nIndustrials, pharma and consumer discretionary take center stage?\n\nWe get results from a smattering of sectors this week, including the restaurant space (MCD, CMG), Industrials (CAT, UBER), pharma (GILD, LLY) and always highly anticipated Disney (NYSE:DIS). Not All of Big Tech Posted Magnificent Results for the 4th Quarter\n\nSource: Wall Street Horizon\n\nOutlier earnings dates this week?\n\nAcademic research shows that when a company confirms a quarterly earnings date that is later than when they have historically reported, it's typically a sign that the company will share bad news on their upcoming call, while moving a release date earlier suggests the opposite.[11]\n\nThis week we get results from a number of large companies on major indexes that have pushed their fourth-quarter 2023 earnings dates outside of their historical norms. Nine companies within the S&P 500 confirmed outlier earnings dates for this week, all of which are later than usual and therefore have negative DateBreaks Factors*. Those names are McDonald's Corporation (NYSE:MCD), IDEX Corporation (NYSE:IEX), Edwards Lifesciences Corp (NYSE:EW), Mid-America Apartment Communities (NYSE:MAA), McKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK), The Hershey Company (NYSE:HSY), ConocoPhillips (NYSE:COP), T. Rowe Price (NASDAQ:TROW) and Catalent Inc. (NYSE:CTLT).\n\n* Wall Street Horizon DateBreaks Factor: statistical measurement of how an earnings date (confirmed or revised) compares to the reporting company's 5-year trend for the same quarter. Negative means the earnings date is confirmed to be later than historical average while Positive is earlier.\n\nQ4 earnings wave?\n\nThis season peak weeks will fall between Jan. 29 - March 1, with each week expected to see over 1,000 reports. Currently Feb. 22 is predicted to be the most active day with 561 companies anticipated to report. Thus far, 64% of companies have confirmed their earnings date and 18% have reported (out of our universe of 10,000+ global names). Roughly 46% of the S&P 500 has reported.

        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell as the music streaming platform continues to focus on profitability amid changes to its podcasting strategy.\n\nIn the third quarter, Spotify turned a profit for the first time in over a year as its recent price hikes coupled with lower-than-expected costs related to personnel and marketing spend boosted its bottom line.\n\nThe company also committed to lower podcast investments, which helped boost margins to 26% in the quarter. Spotify guided to more margin improvements in Q4 with the metric expected to come in at 26.6%.\n\nThe company has previously said it expects the metric to come in between 30% and 35% over the long term amid plans to further scale its podcasting and ads business. With the exception of Q3, margins have been stuck between 21% and 25% in recent quarters.\n\nOutside of margins, subscriber numbers are expected to once again surge with a gain of around 28 million monthly active users in the quarter, including 9 million premium subscribers, according to analysts.\n\nSpotify had guided to 27 million monthly active user additions but matched Wall Street's expectations of 9 million premium subs.\n\nHere's what Wall Street expects, according to Bloomberg consensus estimates:\n\nRevenue: 3.72 billion euros Adjusted loss per share: -0.31 euros Total monthly active users (MAUs): 602 million\n\nOverall, analysts have been bullish on Spotify after the audio giant pledged to improve its profitability beginning in 2023 on a gross margin and operating income basis.\n\nSpotify spent $1 billion pushing into the podcast market over the past four years with splashy A-list deals and $400 million-plus studio acquisitions.\n\nThat spending took a significant bite out of gross margins and weighed heavily on profitability. In response, Spotify committed to several rounds of layoffs — three in 2023 alone. The company also announced CFO Paul Vogel will step down from his position on March 31.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to layoffs, Spotify raised prices, changed up its royalty structure, and made audiobooks free to paying subscribers.\n\nBut more changes are expected as Spotify further revamps its podcast strategy to focus more on distribution rather than exclusivity. Spotify is set to report its fiscal fourth quarter earnings on Tuesday before the bell as the music streaming platform continues to focus on profitability amid more changes to its podcasting strategy. (Patrick Semansky/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nLate last week, Spotify announced a new deal with its most popular podcaster: Joe Rogan.\n\nThe company revealed Rogan's podcast, which was previously exclusive to Spotify, will be available on additional services like Apple Podcasts (AAPL), Amazon Music (AMZN), and YouTube (GOOGL) for the first time in years.\n\nThe multiyear deal, which the Wall Street Journal pegged at $250 million, represents Spotify's broader podcast distribution push, which it first began to roll out last year.\n\nUnder the new agreement, Spotify will handle distribution and ad sales as it works to maximize revenue. Rogan, meanwhile, will receive a guaranteed minimum rate and cut of the advertising revenue.\n\nThe company recently renegotiated a similar contract with \"Call Her Daddy\"'s Alexandra Cooper.\n\nThe podcast, which Spotify purchased for a reported $60 million in 2021, will now be available on all major audio platforms after more than two years as a Spotify exclusive. The company will maintain the exclusive rights to the podcast's video portion.\n\nSpotify shares have surged about 80% over the past year and are up more than 15% year to date. The stock is still off about 40% from its record high of $364.59 a share in February 2021.\n\nCorrection: A previous version of this article misstated Spotify's monthly active users growth.

        "content": "Over the weekend investors were certainly digesting the quarterly results from Magnificent Seven players Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META last Friday.\n\nOf course, Meta Platforms’ stood out by announcing its first-ever dividend during its earnings release but all three were able to exceed their top and bottom line expectations. While Meta may have stolen the show on Friday, let’s check out Amazon and Apple’s quarterly results and see if now is a good time to buy stock in these iconic tech giants.\n\nAmazon Q4 Review\n\nRounding out its fiscal 2023 Amazon reported Q4 earnings of $1.01 per share which easily surpassed the Zacks Consensus of $0.81 a share by 24%. Even better, Q4 earnings soared 380% from $0.21 a share in the comparative quarter. Fourth quarter sales of $169.96 billion beat estimates by 2% and leaped 14% YoY. Amazon produced Q4 net income of $10.6 billion which skyrocketed from the $300 million the e-commerce bohemoth brought in a year ago. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAmazon attributed its very strong Q4 results to a record-breaking holiday shopping season and saw 13% and 17% growth in its North America and International segment sales respectively. In terms of its cloud services, Amazon’s AWS segment sales were up 13% to $24.2 billion during Q4 but slightly missed estimates of $24.37 billion.\n\nStill, Amazon’s total sales were up 12% in FY23 to $574.8 billion with net income of $30.4 billion climb swinging from a net loss of -$2.7 billion a year ago. This translated into annual earnings of $2.90 per share which skyrocketed 308% from $0.71 a share in 2022.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Q1 Review\n\nReporting its fiscal first quarter results of Friday, Apple’s Q1 earnings of $2.18 per share was up 16% YoY to a new record high and topped the Zacks Consensus of $2.09 a share by 4%. Quarterly sales of $119.57 billion topped estimates by over 1% and rose 2% YoY. Apple reported net income of $33.92 billion which jumped 13% from the prior year quarter.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple’s Q1 growth was fueled by iPhone sales and an all-time revenue record in its Services segment sales which includes Apple news, music, and TV along with its App Store, iCloud, AppleCare, and Apple Pay. iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion and beat estimates by 1% although Services sales of $23.11 billion were still -1% short of the consensus of $23.39 billion. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nFollowing their favorable quarterly results Amazon’s stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) while Apple lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). The trend of positive earnings estimate revisions looks likely to continue for Amazon while investors may want to monitor Apple’s warning of softer iPhone sales during the current quarter despite the company's immense probability.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy on the Dip: February 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is coming back, creating a long list of hot metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nLook at Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) Reality Labs, for example. While it saw a massive loss of $4.6 billion in its recent quarter, revenue stood at $1 billion. A year earlier, the Labs’ revenue was $727 million. “We’ve invested heavily in both AI and the metaverse and will continue to do so,” CEO Mark Zuckerberg added.\n\nDespite the metaverse’s dismal history, it could be worth about $936 billion by 2030, according to Grand View Research. This is due in part to end-use industry demand from media and entertainment, education, and aerospace and defense.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith excitement only set to grow, investors may want to look into these top metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nRoblox Corp. (RBLX) Roblox Stock IPO\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy on pullbacks is Roblox Corp. (NYSE:RBLX).\n\nOver the last few weeks, Roblox slipped from about $46 to $38, where it found double bottom support. Further, analysts at Roth MKM reiterated its buy rating on the stock.\n\nWe’ll get more information from RBLX earnings on Tuesday. Roth MKM raised its estimates after a strong year of engagement for the company. The firm also “boosted fourth-quarter bookings expectations to $1.08B — reflecting 20% growth, in line with the rest of Wall Street — and raised its forecast for adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization to $188M,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nRemember that RBLX is the closest thing to a mainstream metaverse, with about 70.2 million daily active users.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nTake advantage of the recent dip to $32 on Unity Software (NYSE:U).\n\nDown but not out, it’s cutting its workforce by about 25%. Focusing more on profitability, U is working with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). They are concentrating on immersive, real-time 3D apps for the tech giant’s Apple Vision Pro. Plus, with the metaverse showing signs of life, the company should see stronger demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Bank of America just reiterated a buy rating on Unity.\n\n“The bank has faith that Unity will emerge better positioned to compete in a stabilizing mobile game market with improved profitability and strategic focus. The wind-down of certain businesses will remove $300M in low-growth business that drags on profitability, and headcount reductions will result in savings of about $230M,” as noted by Seeking Alpha.\n\nFrom its current price of $32.84, I’d like to see Unity Software initially retest $42.\n\nProShares Metaverse ETF (VERS) An image of a person wearing a VR headset looking up, a nebulous digital cloud in the upper corner\n\nSource: Vit-Mar/Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want to diversify at a low cost, check out the ProShares Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:VERS).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.58%, the VERS ETF tracks the Solactive Metaverse Theme Index, which tracks stocks most relevant to the metaverse industry. Also, each company needs to generate at least 50% of revenues from metaverse operations. Top holdings for the ETF include Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), Meta Platforms, Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nSince November, the VERS ETF ran from a low of about $33 to a high of $43. It dipped to about $39.62 and is just starting to push higher again.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this article, we will be taking a look at the 13 best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts. To skip our detailed analysis of the US tech industry, you can go directly to see the 5 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nUS Tech Stocks Continue to Attract Investors\n\nFor most of 2023, the tech sector seemed to have established itself as a safe haven for many investors with its prolonged rallies, helped by the rising interest in artificial intelligence (AI) and the growing profitability of several large tech companies. It seems as though these positive trends are continuing in 2024, with many investors remaining faithful to their tech holdings and expecting higher profitability from their investments as the year progresses. With such strong optimism driving up the tech stocks, many are beginning to wonder whether this obsession with tech stocks ever come to an end and whether other names in the market will ever gain investor attention again.\n\nOn February 1, Mizuho Americas' Farzin Azarm joined CNBC's \"Street Signs Asia\" to discuss current trends in the US tech sector and this investor obsession with tech stocks. Here are some of his comments:\n\n\"Everybody is in the US tech names, everybody, and nobody's selling these names because why would they? Every day you come in, NVIDIA's making a new all time high, look at what Meta is doing after hours look at what Amazon is doing after hours. It's been a safe haven and people are saying 'why should I abandon these names that have given me a return every day? Why should I move away from something like this and invest in something that risky, that hasn't given me any kind of a return?'\"\n\nThe Impact of the Tech Rally on China\n\nAccording to Azarm, this continued preference for US tech stocks is resulting in other stocks, notably those originating in China, being ignored. He believes that a \"crack\" in the US tech and AI trade is the only thing that will rotate money back into Chinese stocks at the end of the day. He added that because investors have already committed huge amounts to expensive American stocks, they do not have the appetite to invest further in more expensive companies. As such, he believes that when the US tech rally slows down, cheaper valuation Chinese companies may begin to attract investor attention. On this front, here's what Azarm had to say:\n\nStory continues\n\n\"People are looking for underperformance, people are looking for... cheaper valuation companies. The US names are trading at 30-35 times now, some of these names. They're priced to perfection. They're not going down, it's amazing to me, but once it does, and it's gonna come, I think that money may go to China.\"\n\nIn light of the above, it is unsurprising that major names such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) continue to be considered some of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts and investors alike. These companies are some of the best long-term tech stocks to invest in and have been dubbed the best tech stocks to buy for several years, all due to their stellar performance. But they have been joined by many other notable names, which our list below will highlight. 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe have selected the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts by using a stock screener to identify American tech stocks and then shortlisting the top stocks based on their upside potential according to Wall Street analysts. The stocks are ranked from the lowest to the highest upside potential as of February 5. We have also mentioned the number of hedge funds holding stakes in each stock. Some leading companies, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), had to be excluded from our list because of their low upside potential.\n\nBest American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\n13. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 70\n\nUpside Potential According to Analysts: 8.53%\n\nAverage Price Target: $46.42\n\nIntel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is a semiconductor company based in Santa Clara, California. It develops, manufactures, markets, and sells computing and related products and services.\n\nA Buy rating was maintained on shares of Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) on January 26 by Vijay Rakesh at Mizuho, alongside a price target of $55.\n\nIn the third quarter of 2023, 70 hedge funds were long Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC), with a total stake value of $2.1 billion.\n\nUpslope Capital Management mentioned Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) – New Long: This is not a traditional long for Upslope in any sense. Intel is outside of the box in terms of typical sector and market cap focus, and the position is really a portfolio hedge (and structured as such). The thesis is very simple: Intel is uniquely positioned to benefit in two important scenarios, both of which require “protection” for Upslope’s portfolio: a continued melt-up in technology stocks and/or rising tensions over Taiwan. Combined with expectations and sentiment around Intel that were incredibly low, this nudged me to add exposure via long-dated INTC call options. While still material in terms of delta-adjusted exposure, the position has been reduced repeatedly and is much more modest today.”\n\nLike Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) is one of the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\n12.

(NYSE:NOW) continues to grow revenue and earnings at above a 20% rate, as they have for many years. The company has a software automation platform that efficiently builds applications on top of and across many enterprise functions. The NOW platform can automate almost any workflow previously done through email, spreadsheets, or some other less-than-efficient method. Its addressable market is very large because of the sheer breadth and depth of the tasks that can be automated by using its software. ServiceNow’s offerings tend to save customers money and make their workflows less prone to error. The company’s growth has been among the most consistent in our Portfolio prior to, during, and after the pandemic.”\n\n10. Apple Inc.

The company has continued to offer new solutions that allow advertisers to target customers effectively and efficiently via one of the world’s leading digital platforms. Moreover, operating profits are rising due to an organization-wide focus on improving productivity and accelerating the time to market for new products. However, overall profitability continues to be weighed down by losses in the Reality Labs segment. But, there is positive optionality that Meta will emerge from the AI arms race as one of the leading players in the industry.”\n\n6. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 110\n\nUpside Potential According to Analysts: 11.82%\n\nAverage Price Target: $194.16\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc.

(NASDAQ:AMD) as of February 1.\n\nWhite Falcon Capital Management mentioned Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its fourth-quarter 2023 investor letter:\n\n“It is important to note that the returns depicted above actually originated in the market turmoil of 2022 and were only realized in 2023. We assess that about 75% of the returns in 2023 were derived from just 35% of the portfolio. Notably, the technology companies we acquired in 2022 – Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), Amazon, Docebo, NU, Rover – performed exceptionally well. In hindsight, the decision to allocate to technology stocks appears straightforward; but it actually demanded courage and conviction to buy and add to these stocks during the fear and uncertainty of the 2022 bear market.\n\nThe top 5 positions in the portfolio were: Precious Metals royalty basket, Nu Holdings, AMD Amazon.com and Converge Technology Services. AMD has worked out great for us but we must admit that it has gotten expensive. AI was not part of our original investment thesis and AMD is a great reminder of how one can get ‘lucky’ investing in quality businesses run by competent management teams (ditto for Amazon).”\n\nLike Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) is among the best American tech stocks to buy according to analysts.\n\nClick to continue reading and see the 5 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nSuggested articles:\n\n10 Most Popular Technology Stocks Among Billionaires 12 Best Medical Technology Stocks To Buy Now 10 Best Technology Stocks to Buy According to Giant Quant Hedge Fund\n\nDisclosure: None. 13 Best American Tech Stocks To Buy According to Analysts is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "Meta's Ad Business Continues To Rebound, Its Metaverse Efforts Continue to Advance But Its Moral Integrity Remains Questionable",
        "content": "Last week, earnings from Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) closed out January.  Amazon stock rose more than 8% on Thursday in after-hours trading as the e-commerce and cloud titan reported better than expected fourth quarter figures that showed its earnings bounced back. Although Apple also surpassed Wall Street’s estimates and reported for the first time in a year its revenue grew, its stock fell after-hours. Microsoft reported a thriving bottom line along with impressive growth of its cloud business. But even Microsoft isn’t immune to corporate layoffs that are still plaguing the tech industry. Google also reported strong top and bottom-line figures but missed analyst estimates. Therefore, Google shares went down more than 6% upon earnings on Tuesday. Moreover, Google remains focused on cost-management.\n\nBut Meta did more than greatly surpass analyst estimates with its fourth quarter figures along with announcing its first ever dividend as it continues to work on making the metaverse happen with its Reality Labs division that hit $1 billion for the first time in the latest reported quarter.\n\nMeta Reported Its Profit Tripled In The Last Three Months Of 2023\n\nFor the quarter ended in December, Meta reported its revenue jumped 25% YoY to $40.1 billion, surpassing LSEG’s estimate of $39.18 billion as the ad business continued to rebound after a brutal 2022. Meta also lowered its expenses 8% YoY to $23.73 billion and as a result of efficient cost-cutting initiatives, its operating margin more than doubled to 41%. Therefore, net income more than tripled to $14 billion, or $5.33 per share. Earnings per share amounted to $5.33, also topping LSEG’s estimate of $4.96.\n\nAlthough its virtual reality unit recorded a loss of $4.65 billion, Reality Labs  passed $1 billion for the first time which shows Meta continues to advance on the metaverse and AI front.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg also revealed that AI advances helped boost the company’s ad business which grew faster than of its rival Google that earlier reported YoY growth of 11% for its latest quarter. Along with other social media executives, Zuckerberg was questioned during a law hearing on Wednesday for being accused for insufficient safety and design measures that have caused mental health issues for their children and even deaths by suicide. Zuckerberg has been working on restoring his image by examining ways to curb harm made by social media platforms, but these ‘products’ have created a lot of harm to the most fragile generations.\n\nOutlook\n\nMeta announced it pay its investors a dividend of 50 cents a share on March 26th.\n\nFacebook parent guided for first-quarter sales in the range between $34.5 billion and $37 billion, topping analyst estimates of $33.8 billion. Meta also guided for 2024 expenses to be between $94 billion and $99 billion.\n\nLike Google, Meta remains focused on keeping things lean. Although its greatest goal is to make the metaverse happen, it has perhaps an even harder task of having to prove its products are not harming the mental health and lives of its users. Moral integrity and responsibility for its actions is something all Big Tech still needs to live up to.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Here is What to Know Beyond Why Apple Inc. (AAPL) is a Trending Stock",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products have returned +2.6%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.6% change. During this period, the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, which Apple falls in, has gained 0.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Apple is expected to post earnings of $1.55 per share, indicating a change of +2% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed -2.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $6.57 points to a change of +7.2% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.18 indicates a change of +9.4% from what Apple is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Apple is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Apple, the consensus sales estimate of $92.41 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of -2.6%. The $392.87 billion and $417.12 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +2.5% and +6.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nApple reported revenues of $119.58 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +2.1%. EPS of $2.18 for the same period compares with $1.88 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $117.62 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +1.66%. The EPS surprise was +4.31%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nApple is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Apple. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "You may have heard the slogan, \"This, not that.\" The mantra encourages people to think about their decisions. Something popular might not benefit you, so consider a similar, better alternative.\n\nIt's a fun game that came to mind when thinking about some of Warren Buffett's investments, which are held in Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company. Some of Berkshire's most significant and best-performing stocks aren't always right for everyone. Fortunately, you don't need to go off the beaten path to find that good alternative.\n\nHere are two trillion-dollar companies that Berkshire owns. One is a screaming buy today, while the other is best for investors to avoid -- at least, for now.\n\nBuy this: Amazon\n\nThough it's not a massive position at just 0.4%, e-commerce and cloud leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a holding of Berkshire Hathaway since 2019. Most people are familiar with Amazon's e-commerce business, which dominates the U.S. with a 38% market share. Some may also know that Amazon's cloud platform, AWS, is the global leader, with roughly a third of the worldwide market. Even fewer likely know that Amazon is quickly becoming an advertising powerhouse.\n\nWhat should attract buyers to the stock today is a valuation that's sneakily attractive even as the stock trades near its highest price in a year. Amazon's business has many moving parts, and e-commerce requires investments to expand to accommodate growth.\n\nSo I like looking at Amazon's operating cash flow (revenue minus expenses from running the company) to understand how much of a bargain the stock is. Comparing its price to its operating cash flow per share, you'll see that the stock is near its cheapest valuation in a decade: AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nThat's a great launch pad for future investment returns. After all, e-commerce and cloud computing are massive industries that should still have many years of growth ahead.\n\nBeing a market leader, Amazon will almost surely capture a solid piece of these growth trends over the coming years. Analysts believe that could translate to annualized long-term earnings growth averaging 24%. This setup makes Amazon a \"Magnificent Seven\" stock you can continue buying confidently.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot that: Apple\n\nSeeing iPhone maker Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) here might be jarring. After all, it's Berkshire's largest stock investment by a wide margin, nearly half of its entire portfolio. Buffett himself has even called Apple the best business Berkshire owns. But this ultimately boils down to timing. Apple is undeniably one of the world's most significant financial and cultural companies. People, myself included, love their iOS devices.\n\nBut the company has gotten so big that growth is getting harder. Apple's revenue growth has slowed dramatically in recent years since it brought 5G iPhones to market. There doesn't seem to be a big motivator for many consumers to switch as often, and there are already over 2 billion active iOS devices worldwide. Naturally, slowing revenue growth has caused analysts to continue lowering their long-term expectations for earnings. AAPL EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nIronically, the stock continues to thrive. Shares are at all-time highs, and the stock's valuation has increased to over 28 times estimated 2024 earnings. The risk to new buyers is that sentiment might cool on the stock if Apple can't increase the growth to justify such a lofty price tag. Its current PEG ratio is roughly 3, indicating that shares are pretty pricey for their expected growth. I like to see this ratio under 1.5.\n\nThose who own the stock can feel free to hold it because Apple is a remarkable company. It's just run high enough that new buyers may find better alternatives like Amazon. The stock will again be a fantastic buy-and-hold idea once the valuation makes more sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Amazon wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Has Bought More of This Stock Than Any Other Over the Last 5 Years -- No, It's Not Apple",
        "content": "Warren Buffett's investing track record is tough to match. Since taking over as CEO and chairman of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, he took the struggling textile company and turned it into a massive conglomerate. The share value increased from $18 then to around $580,000 today. That computes to an eye-popping cumulative return of over 3,200,000% and a compound annual growth rate of about 19.4% for the last 58.5 years.\n\nMuch of that growth is fueled by Buffett's expansion into the insurance industry and using the float provided by insurance premiums to invest in an equity portfolio (or fully purchasing businesses). So, when Buffett makes a buy or sell decision, the whole investing world pays attention. And there's one stock Buffett has been buying much more than any of the others in Berkshire's portfolio over the last five years. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nSome of the biggest purchases in the Berkshire portfolio\n\nBuffett and his team manage a massive $373 billion portfolio. Berkshire Hathaway is required to report its U.S. holdings at the end of every quarter by filing form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Additionally, the conglomerate must report any stock purchases or sales for companies in which it owns a stake of 10% or more within three days of the trade. That gives investors a lot of insight into what Buffett's buying and selling for Berkshire.\n\nAs of its most recent reports, Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is by far the biggest holding in Berkshire's portfolio. The iPhone maker accounts for nearly half of the entire portfolio value. And Buffett hasn't been shy about how much he likes Apple. \"It's better than any business we own,\" he told shareholders at their annual meeting last May.\n\nBuffett has consistently added to Berkshire's position in Apple since its initial investment in 2016. There were a few times when Berkshire some shares for tax purposes, but Buffett later called those decisions a mistake.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Berkshire's stake in Apple is worth around $173 billion, Buffett and his team likely spent around $40 billion establishing that position. That's a massive buy for sure, and it shows Buffett is very willing to put his money where his mouth is.\n\nDespite the heavy weighting in Berkshire's portfolio, Buffett continues to occasionally buy more Apple shares. The most recent purchase was in the first quarter of last year.\n\nAnother stock Buffett's been piling cash into lately is Occidental Petroleum(NYSE: OXY). Berkshire Hathaway initially took a stake in Occidental by providing $10 billion in capital in exchange for 100,000 preferred shares paying an 8% dividend. Occidental used the capital to fund its purchase of Anadarko.\n\nAt the start of 2022, Buffett began building a position in Occidental's common stock. It's been one of his favorite stocks to buy over the past two years as he's grown Berkshire's stake in the company to nearly 28%. Establishing that position cost about $13.5 billion, so the total investment since 2019 has been about $23.5 billion. That said, Occidental has started redeeming some of Berkshire's preferred shares, buying back about $1.5 billion through the third quarter of last year.\n\nWhile Apple and Occidental have been two of Buffett's biggest investments lately, neither comes close to the amount he's put into buying shares of his favorite stock. And investors won't find it on form 13F. They'll have to look at Berkshire's quarterly reports.\n\nThe stock Buffett's bought more of than any other\n\nOver the last five years, Buffett's spent about $75 billion buying one stock in particular. But the value of those stock purchases doesn't show up in Berkshire's portfolio. Nonetheless, shareholders, in aggregate, are at least $75 billion wealthier as a result.\n\nThe stock Warren Buffett's been buying up like no other is, in fact, Berkshire Hathaway itself.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway's share repurchase policy underwent a significant change in mid-2018. Previously, Buffett would only buy back shares of Berkshire if it fell below 120% of book value. However, that didn't present very many opportunities to buy back stock and proved to be overly restrictive.\n\nThe board changed the policy in mid-2018 to allow Buffett to buy shares whenever he and Charlie Munger determined the stock price was below Berkshire's intrinsic value, so long as the company kept at least $20 billion in cash and Treasuries on its balance sheet.\n\nSince then, Buffett has gone on to repurchase shares of Berkshire Hathaway every quarter. He was especially active in buying shares in 2020 and 2021. With a whopping $157 billion in cash and equivalents on the balance sheet and a business generating billions in free cash flow every quarter, there's a very good chance Buffett will keep buying back Berkshire stock going forward.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway shareholders benefit from Buffett's share buybacks. As Buffett reduces the number of shares outstanding, the stake of existing shareholders in Berkshire's future earnings increases. As a result, the buybacks support the company's earnings per share, which is one of the biggest determinants of its stock price. Additionally, Buffett's willingness to deploy extra cash toward buybacks means there's a big buyer willing to step in if the stock price declines, which should prevent the price from ever falling too far.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech Stocks Face High Bar to Sustain Gains in 2024",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The Magnificent Seven group of megacap tech stocks need to deliver stellar earnings to keep outperforming the broader market, according to a growing consensus on Wall Street.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhy NYC Apartment Buildings Are on Sale Now for 50% Off Powell Tells ‘60 Minutes’ Fed Is Wary of Cutting Rates Too Soon Eastern Europe’s Richest Woman Pivots $43 Billion Empire West China Tightens Some Trading Restrictions for Domestic and Offshore Investors Elon's Cage Fight With Zuckerberg Just Happened. He Lost\n\nThe group — comprised of Apple Inc., Microsoft Corp., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Meta Platforms Inc. and Tesla Inc. — doubled in value in 2023, outperforming the broader Nasdaq 100 Index’s 54% rise. The majority extended gains this year — with the exception of Tesla and Apple.\n\nOptimism about a stronger-than-expected economy, peaking interest rates and artificial intelligence have helped bolster the stocks. Investors are now questioning if gains can be sustained through 2024 and if the grouping of seven will remain intact as their performances differentiate. Tesla has dropped 24% this year, while Meta is up 34%. The Facebook parent on Friday saw the biggest single-session market value gain in history.\n\n“As the Dot Com boom showed, continued outperformance requires stocks to exceed the high bar set by consensus,” a Goldman Sachs Group Inc. team led by David Kostin said. “The “fate of the magnificent 7 stocks depends on their ability to deliver rapid revenue growth in 2024,” he wrote.\n\nThe strategists noted a wide dispersion of consensus growth estimates across the group. That’s highlighted by varying degrees of revenue expectations for this year. While Nvidia’s revenue is expected to soar 119% from a year prior, Alphabet’s is seen dropping 7%, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nOthers suggest a more selective approach to Magnificent Seven allocation. Berenberg strategists prefer to be exposed to some of these stocks, but not all of them, especially as the US technology sectors’ valuations are lofty versus global peers, providing a sell signal.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Overall, the Mag7 group retains earnings momentum leadership relative to the S&P 493,” they wrote in a note. “The group needs to maintain this momentum to outperform again in 2024.”\n\nThe reporting season has been mixed. Meta and Amazon delivered quarterly earnings and outlooks that far exceeded Wall Street’s expectations. Microsoft posted its strongest revenue growth since 2022.\n\nApple returned to revenue growth but demand in China was weaker than feared. Tesla’s recent performance meanwhile has stoked debate as to whether it can maintain its place in the group, amid warnings of plunging demand for EVs and the impact of price cuts on margins. Nvidia is expected to report later this month.\n\nTo be sure, there are concerns about the increasing dominance of a small number of stocks. JPMorgan Chase & Co. quantitative strategists last week noted this is drawing similarities with the dot-com bubble, raising the risk of a selloff. The likelihood of the broader index outperforming the top ten stocks in the near future is becoming increasingly likely, they said.\n\nStill, Morgan Stanley’s Michael Wilson recently listed Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet and Nvidia among a screen of high-quality growth stocks that have overweight ratings from the bank’s analysts. He said such shares can continue outperforming amid strong earnings revisions.\n\n“We see a relative performance catch up to strong relative earnings revisions and note that the cohort can outperform in all three macro scenarios we have laid out for 2024,” Wilson wrote in a note on Monday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Bloomberg New Economy Is Looking for World-Changing Leaders  Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

It's evolve or die in this new role — risk clinging to the past and its myriad of practices, or embrace the future and crush it.\n\nThe same could be applied to investors at this very moment in time.\n\nEvolve your thinking around the Magnificent Seven trade that has brought you immense paper profits the past year, or get your portfolio blown up in the not-too-distant future.\n\nAm I being too harsh? Maybe, but I need to be because I truly feel that investors have forgotten there are more ways to make money than hitting the buy button on seven tech stocks. And with their blinders on, they are overlooking new trends/news/info that warrant a short-term pause on the explosive Mag Seven trade.\n\nFirst thing that is fresh to the scene is an updated market narrative.\n\nIf late 2023 was all about interest rate cuts in an election year, then the first half of 2024 is shaping up to be about the potential for next to no rate cuts this year.\n\nHeadline job creation of 353,000 for January and big upward revisions for job gains in November and December signal an economy doing pretty darn well. It's an economy that in no way needs a rate cut this spring. An economy so strong as to justify a more hawkish Fed.\n\n\"Forget the anecdotal signs of tech layoffs and companies going for efficiency this year, the economy is producing hundreds of thousands of new jobs,\" FWDBONDS chief economist Chris Rupkey wrote in a client note.\n\n\"Fed officials are going to have to sharpen their pencils on the timing of any interest rate cuts this year because higher rates are sure not slowing the economy down.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, the incoming data from the last two weeks suggests no rate cuts are imminent — and that removes a key tailwind that powered market psychology (and inflated trading multiples) around Mag Seven stocks.\n\nThen, secondarily, there are the fundamentals of these tech behemoths as seen on their recent earnings days.\n\nI'm not sure about you, but I haven't been blown away by results out of Mag Seven stalwarts Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft and Tesla. All of these reports had warts that should call into question trading multiples on them. Apple's performance in China was weak. March quarter guidance was weak. iPhone sales didn't wow.\n\nAs for Alphabet, it missed on cloud sales. Tesla's quarter and Elon Musk-led earnings call was littered with red flags.\n\nMicrosoft's quarter poked a hole in the narrative — for now — that all its new AI is going to lead to a massive reappraisal of its earnings estimates by the Street in 2024. Stripping out the first-ever dividend by Meta being announced, its quarter was reasonable — but it's also jacking up its 2024 capex a ton.\n\nAmazon's quarter was the lone rockstar through and through. Accelerating sales out of AWS, impressive operating margin expansion, and a killer guidance.\n\nTake all of this new info together and the message should be clear to investors ... evolve your thinking on the Mag Seven, or else.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 5, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META.\n\nBig Tech Crushes Earnings: Which One Should You Buy?\n\nWe saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.\n\nLast Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft and Alphabet, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon, Apple and Meta Platforms.\n\nAll these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now.\n\nEarnings Summaries\n\nMicrosoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.\n\nAlphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.\n\nAmazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nMeta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nValuations\n\nThe chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.\n\nAAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them.\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.\n\nThe success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.\n\nMeta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nAlphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business, does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubt it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.\n\nApple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.\n\nNonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – February 5, 2024 – Zacks.com releases the list of companies likely to issue earnings surprises. This week’s list includes Microsoft MSFT, Meta Platforms META, Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, Alphabet GOOGL, Tesla TSLA and Nvidia NVDA.\n\nMagnificent 7 Earnings Results Solidify Market Leadership\n\nWe have seen some awe-inspiring results from Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Amazon in recent days that reconfirm their leadership position in this market.\n\nThese companies, along with their peers in the ‘Magnificent 7’ group of stocks – Apple, Alphabet, Tesla and Nvidia – led the market higher last year, and that momentum has continued this year.\n\nOther than Tesla, whose results disappointed the market once again and reflected the fourth quarter in a row of disappointing results, all of the other Mag 7 members that have reported came out with impressive growth numbers. The market wasn’t particularly impressed with the Alphabet and Apple reports, but they came out with Q4 earnings growth of +51.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\n\nTesla’s earnings were down -45.8% in Q3 on +3.5% higher revenues, as the EV-maker continued to grapple with weakening margins in an increasingly competitive EV market.\n\nUsing estimates for Nvidia, which will be coming out with its December-quarter results on February 21st, and actual results for the other six members of the group, total Q4 earnings for the group are expected to be up +48.7% from the same period last year on +14.5% higher revenues.\n\nPlease note that the Mag 7 companies currently account for 28.6% of the S&P 500 index’s total market capitalization and are expected to bring in 19.5% of the index’s total earnings in 2024. For 2023 Q4, the Mag 7 group has a bigger weightage, bringing in 23.1% of all S&P 500 earnings.\n\nGiven their enormous earnings power and growth profiles, it is hard to argue with the group’s market leadership. Importantly, analysts had been raising their estimates for the group even before the December-quarter results, with these numbers now adding to the positive revision momentum.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond these mega-cap players, total Q4 earnings for the Technology sector as a whole are expected to be up +24.2% from the same period last year on +8.1% higher revenues.\n\nThe Earnings Big Picture\n\nThis week’s blockbuster Tech results has pushed the aggregate earnings growth picture for the S&P 500 index to +4.3% from last week’s +1.1% growth pace. Excluding the contribution from the Mag 7 stocks, Q4 earnings for the rest of the index would be down -4.2%.\n\nQ4 Earnings Season Scorecard\n\nIncluding all the results that came out through Friday, February 2nd, we now have Q4 results from 230 S&P 500 members, or 46% of the index’s total membership.\n\nWe have more than 500 companies on deck to report results this week, including 106 S&P 500 members. This week’s line-up includes a who’s who of the index, including Disney, Elli Lilly, MacDonalds, DuPont, Caterpillar, Ford, Pepsi, Chipotle, Uber, PayPal, Expedia, and many others.\n\nTotal Q4 earnings for the 230 index members that have reported already are up +4.2% from the same period last year on +2.8% higher revenues, with 81.3% beating EPS estimates and 63.9% beating revenue estimates.\n\nFor a detailed look at the overall earnings picture, including expectations for the coming periods, please check out our weekly Earnings Trends report >>>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +6.2 average gain per year.

        "title": "1 \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock to Buy Hand Over Fist in February, and 1 to Avoid Like the Plague",
        "content": "Over the past four years, Wall Street has been a stomping ground for volatility. Beginning in 2020, the three major stock indexes have traded off bear and bull markets in successive years.\n\nDuring periods of heightened volatility, it's not uncommon for investors to seek out the safety of time-tested outperformers. While the \"FAANG stocks\" have certainly fit the bill since 2013, it's the \"Magnificent Seven\" that now find themselves in the spotlight. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nInvestors have flocked to the Magnificent Seven stocks\n\nWhen I say Magnificent Seven, I'm talking about:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) MSFT Chart\n\nThese seven industry-leading businesses have vastly outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 since the start of 2023, and they all offer sustained moats and/or clear-cut competitive advantages that have made them attractive investments.\n\nMicrosoft's Windows is still the undisputed leader in desktop operating systems, while Azure ranks No. 2 in global cloud infrastructure services market share. Apple's iPhone has been the domestic smartphone share leader for more than a decade. Meanwhile, Apple's capital-return program is unrivaled by all other public companies. Alphabet's Google accounted for a monopoly esque 91.5% of worldwide internet search share in January 2024. Further, Alphabet is the parent of YouTube, the second most-visited social site, and Google Cloud, the global No. 3 in cloud infrastructure service share. Amazon brought in nearly $0.40 of every $1 spent in U.S. online retail sales in 2022. It's also the parent of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is responsible for nearly a third of global cloud infrastructure service share. Nvidia's A100 and H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) are expected to account for around 90% of all artificial intelligence (AI)-inspired GPUs deployed in high-compute data centers in 2024. Meta Platforms holds the top social media \"real estate\" on the planet. Facebook is the most-visited social site, while Instagram, WhatsApp, and Facebook Messenger, in combination with Facebook, help to collectively draw almost 4 billion users to Meta's family of apps each month. Tesla is North America's leading electric-vehicle (EV) maker -- nearly 1.85 million EVs produced in 2023 -- and the only pure-play EV manufacturer that's generating a recurring profit, based on generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP).\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the outperformance of the Magnificent Seven in 2023, their outlooks in 2024 (and beyond) notably differ. As we move forward into the shortest month of the year, one component stands out as exceptionally inexpensive, while another is rife with warning signs.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to buy hand over fist in February: Alphabet\n\nAmong the seven widely owned companies that comprise the Magnificent Seven, none stands out as a smarter buy for investors right now than Alphabet.\n\nWhereas most of the Magnificent Seven stocks have fared well during earnings season, Alphabet stock took it on the chin. Specifically, Wall Street was less than pleased with growth in the company's core advertising segments.\n\nArguably the biggest concern for Alphabet is that nearly 76% of its $86.3 billion in total revenue from 2023 came from advertising. It's no secret that advertisers will pare back their spending at the first hint of trouble for the U.S. or global economy. There are a couple of money-based metrics and recession-predicting tools that suggest a downturn in the U.S. economy is likely in 2024.\n\nBut it's equally important for investors to take this guessing game in stride. Even though we can't predict when recessions will occur, history pretty conclusively shows they don't last very long. Nine of the 12 recessions since 1945 have ended in less than a year, with none of the remaining three surpassing 18 months. On the other hand, periods of expansion are known to last for years. Buying ad-driven leaders during periods of short-lived economic weakness has, historically, been a genius move.\n\nIt's hard not to get excited about Alphabet when its foundational cash-cow segment appears impenetrable. As noted, Google accounts for 91.5% of worldwide internet search share. You have to go back almost nine years to find the last time Google didn't comprise at least 90% of global search on a monthly basis. It's the undisputed leader in search, which makes it a hot commodity for businesses wanting to target their advertising. In short, it gives Alphabet virtually unparalleled ad-pricing power.\n\nHowever, Alphabet's future cash-flow drivers are likely found in its ancillary operating segments. Daily views of YouTube Shorts catapulted from 6.5 billion in 2021 to more than 50 billion by early last year. This new monetization channel has been a nice lift for YouTube's ad revenue.\n\nMeanwhile, Google Cloud just delivered its fourth consecutive quarter of operating income following years of operating losses. Enterprise cloud spending is still in its early innings, which suggests there's a double-digit, exceptionally high-margin growth opportunity to be had with cloud infrastructure services.\n\nBut the top selling point for Alphabet might just be that it remains cheap. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 18 is actually lower than the forward P/E of the benchmark S&P 500 -- despite Alphabet's offering a higher growth rate. Furthermore, it's valued at less than 13 times forward-year cash flow, which compares to an average cash flow multiple of 18 times over the previous five years.\n\nTack on a $97.7 billion net cash buffer and it's easy to see why Alphabet is a screaming bargain in February (and beyond). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe Magnificent Seven stock to avoid like the plague in February: Nvidia\n\nHowever, not all of the Magnificent Seven stocks are worth buying. In February (and likely beyond), semiconductor giant Nvidia is worth avoiding.\n\nNvidia's claim to fame has been the rapid ascent and uptake of AI solutions. Nvidia's A100 and H100 GPUs have, thus far, handily outperformed the competition, which has allowed the company to absolutely dominate in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nOne of the more exciting developments in calendar year 2024 for Nvidia is a meaningful uptick in A100 and H100 output. Chip fabrication giant Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is rapidly increasing its chip-on-wafer-on-substrate capacity, which will allow Nvidia to supply more of its game-changing AI chips this year.\n\nI'd be remiss if I didn't also mention that Nvidia has benefited immensely from A100 and H100 GPU scarcity. Through the first-half of fiscal 2024 (Nvidia's fiscal year ends in late January), Nvidia's cost of revenue actually declined. In other words, the entirety of the company's data-center revenue growth came from exceptionally strong pricing power.\n\nWhile there's no denying Nvidia has made its shareholders richer, there are a number of potential red flags.\n\nTo begin with, Nvidia's gross margin is liable to come under pressure in fiscal 2025 as output of its A100 and H100 GPUs increases. As scarcity of its AI-GPUs wanes, there'll be less of a reason for businesses to pay a premium price for these chips. In short, Nvidia may be its own worst enemy -- at least from a margin standpoint.\n\nIt's also increasingly likely that Nvidia's market share of GPUs used by AI-accelerated data centers has peaked or is very near a peak. Advanced Micro Devices introduced its MI300X AI-GPU last year and plans to ramp up the rollout of this Nvidia competitor in 2024. In December, Intel unveiled its generative AI Gaudi3 chip to compete with Nvidia's H100 chip. Gaudi3 is expected to launch sometime this year. AMD and Intel shouldn't have trouble grabbing share from Nvidia.\n\nU.S. regulators have given investors another reason to keep their distance from Nvidia. On two separate occasions, regulators have restricted the chips Nvidia could export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Even the slower GPUs Nvidia crafted for China failed to garner a thumbs-up from U.S. regulators for export. These restrictions have the potential to cost Nvidia billions of dollars in sales each quarter.\n\nThe final straw for Nvidia is that every next-big-thing investment trend over the past 30 years has resulted in an initial bubble-bursting event. This is to say that investors have always overestimated the uptake of a new innovation or technology. I don't anticipate AI or its poster child (Nvidia) being exceptions to the rule.\n\nAt more than 61 times estimated cash flow in fiscal 2024, and with a laundry list of red flags, Nvidia makes for an easy avoid in February.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Alphabet wasn't one of them.

Since becoming Berkshire's leader in the mid-1960s, he's overseen a phenomenal 4,700,010% aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A), as of the closing bell on Feb. 1, 2024.\n\nWhat's great about the Oracle of Omaha's tenure as CEO is there are few secrets. Though he's not going to divulge what he and his investment team are buying ahead of time, he's proven more than willing to share his investment philosophy and thoughts on the U.S. economy over the years. In particular, Buffett is a big fan of buying stakes in brand-name businesses with sustainable competitive edges.\n\nEven factoring in down years, Buffett and his investing aides have led Berkshire Hathaway to a nearly 20% annualized return over roughly six decades.

As of the closing bell on Feb. 1, it was less than $162 billion in market cap away from joining a very select group of publicly traded companies to have reached the $1 trillion valuation mark. This club currently includes:\n\nMicrosoft: $3 trillion Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL): $2.89 trillion Alphabet: $1.77 trillion (Class A shares, GOOGL) Amazon: $1.65 trillion Meta Platforms: $1.01 trillion\n\nElectric-vehicle manufacturer Tesla also previously joined the trillion-dollar ranks, but has lost more than 50% of its value since reaching an all-time high. That's just six publicly traded companies out of thousands of major exchange-listed businesses that have reached the trillion-dollar plateau. Berkshire finds itself less than a 20% gain away from becoming lucky No. 7.\n\nA big reason Berkshire Hathaway continues to outperform most years is its highly concentrated investment portfolio. Despite having stakes in around 50 stocks, Buffett and his team strongly believe in putting an outsized percentage of their capital to work in their best investment ideas. Many of these top ideas have outperformed the broader market.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor instance, Apple accounts for a 46% share of Berkshire's $372 billion investment portfolio, as of February 1. Buffett and his investing team have put in the neighborhood of $36.3 billion to work in shares of Apple since the first quarter of 2016. This sizable bet on Apple has resulted in an unrealized gain of almost $135 billion. Betting on Apple's incredibly strong brand, as well as its leading innovation via the iPhone and its burgeoning Services segment, has proved to be an incredibly smart move.\n\nAnother catalyst for Berkshire's ongoing success is that its investment portfolio and the roughly five dozen businesses it's acquired over the years -- this includes famous insurer GEICO and prominent railroad BNSF -- are primarily cyclical. In other words, they tend to ebb and flow with the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nWarren Buffett and his late right-hand man Charlie Munger learned a long time ago that it's a fool's errand to attempt to guess when downturns will occur in the U.S. economy and stock market. Rather, they positioned Berkshire's investment portfolio and the company's owned assets to take advantage of long-winded periods of expansion. Since recessions are historically short-lived, patience has allowed Berkshire Hathaway to thrive.\n\nTo add to the above, Buffett's company tends to hang onto its largest investments for a long time. For instance, Coca-Cola and American Express have been continuous holdings since 1988 and 1991, respectively. You could argue that doing nothing was the best decision Warren Buffett and his team ever made. Image source: Apple.\n\nA rotten Apple could spoil the bunch (at least in 2024)\n\nBut in spite of more than a half-century of outperformance and an investment portfolio that's intricately pinned to the health of the U.S. economy, I'm not convinced that 2024 is the year we'll see Berkshire Hathaway join this exclusive club.\n\nOne potential hurdle for Berkshire Hathaway's stock is the possibility of a U.S. recession taking place. Although economic data points are strong at the moment, a couple of predictive indicators and money-based metrics tell a different story. Specifically, the first decline in M2 money supply since the Great Depression, coupled with an assortment of recession-predicting tools, suggest an economic downturn is likely.\n\nConsidering how cyclical most of Berkshire's investments and owned assets are, Buffett's company is prone to weakness during short-lived periods of contraction.\n\nHowever, the biggest threat to Berkshire Hathaway gaining a tad over 27% during 2024 and joining the exclusive trillion-dollar club is a rotten Apple.\n\nEverything I noted earlier about Apple is true. It's been a leader in smartphone market share in the U.S. for more than a decade and has seen strong sales growth from its Services segment as CEO Tim Cook emphasizes high-margin subscription services. There's little question that Apple is going to remain profitable.\n\nHowever, Apple's outsized returns have historically come on the heels of strong growth (think high-single-digit or low-double-digit annual sales increases). In fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30, 2023), Apple's year-over-year revenue fell by nearly 3%. During the fiscal first quarter of 2024 (ended Dec. 30), revenue growth totaled just 2%. Even with above-average inflation as a tailwind, muted demand for its physical products, along with weaker sales in China, have heavily weighed on its operating performance.\n\nThough Berkshire Hathaway can fall back on its roughly five dozen wholly owned assets that have steadily increased the company's operating income over time, overcoming a poor year from an investment that accounts for close to half of the company's invested assets could be too big of a pill to swallow.\n\nI have no doubts that Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway will eventually join elite company and become a trillion-dollar business. But I fully expect a single rotten Apple to spoil the dream -- at least in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Berkshire Hathaway wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Huawei Technologies climbed back to the No 1 spot of China's smartphone market in the initial two weeks of this year, according to a report by research firm Counterpoint, putting more pressure on 2023 industry leaderApple and major mainland rivals in the world's largest handset market.\n\nThis marks the first time Huawei reclaimed the top smartphone sales ranking on the mainland since Washington imposed sanctions on the Shenzhen-based company when it was added to the US trade blacklist in May 2019, which crippled the firm's once-lucrative handset business, according to the report on Sunday by Counterpoint research analysts Ivan Lam and Zhang Mengmeng.\n\nThat resurgence was jump-started by Huawei's surprise release last August of its Mate 60 Pro 5G smartphone - powered by its advanced Kirin 9000S processor, which was locally developed in spite of US tech sanctions - as well as the firm's Android replacement mobile platform HarmonyOS, the report said. It also pointed out that brand loyalty among Chinese consumers greatly contributed to the popularity of Huawei's new 5G handsets.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Counterpoint report, however, indicated that Huawei still faced cutthroat competition on the mainland against Apple and major domestic handset vendors that include Xiaomi, Oppo and Vivo, which continue to launch high-end smartphone models.\n\nA shopper holds up two display units of Huawei Technologies' 5G Mate 60 Pro smartphone at an electronics store in Xian, capital of northwestern Shaanxi province, on September 9, 2023.

Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nStory continues\n\nRobust domestic demand for Huawei's new 5G smartphone models, years after its release of the Mate 40 series in October 2020, reflect improved consumer appetite for handset upgrades amid Beijing's efforts to ease mounting pressure from debt, deflation and weak confidence.\n\nChina's smartphone industry showed signs of recovery in 2023, when shipments grew 6.5 per cent year on year to 289 million units, according to data from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology. Domestic brands made up 231 million units, or around 80 per cent, of total shipments.\n\nThe mainland's high-end handset segment sales also grew 37 per cent last year, despite overall weakness in the global smartphone industry, Counterpoint data showed. While Apple led that market segment in the country in the first half of last year, the iPhone maker's sales started to get squeezed in the third quarter amid a strong push by Chinese vendors led by Huawei\n\nThe rise of Huawei smartphone sales on the mainland early this year, followed a decline in iPhone sales in the fourth quarter.\n\nApple, however, still ranked as mainland China's leading smartphone vendor in the fourth quarter and the whole of last year, according to a report by tech research firm IDC.\n\nLast week, Apple reported a nearly 13 per cent drop in revenue from its Greater China region - covering the mainland, Hong Kong, Macau and Taiwan - in the December quarter, while sales rose in its other operating regions.\n\nApple's weekly smartphone shipments in China have declined by 30 to 40 per cent in recent weeks, according to a recent research note by Kuo Ming-chi, a TF International Securities analyst known for his accurate assessment of Apple's business. Kuo expected this downward trend to continue this year.\n\n\"The main reason for the decline is the return of Huawei and the fact that foldable phones have gradually become the first choice for high-end users in the Chinese market,\" Kuo wrote in the note.\n\nThe global premium smartphone market, where handsets are priced from US$600, saw Apple remain the \"undisputed leader\" last year with a dominant 71 per cent share, according to a Counterpoint report last month.\n\nStill, Apple's share in that segment was down from 75 per cent in 2022 amid the resurgence of Huawei on the mainland and the gains made by Samsung Electronics, the report said.\n\nIn a rare move, Apple last month offered Chinese consumers discounts of up to 800 yuan (US$113) on a range of products, from iPhones to MacBooks, ahead of the Lunar New Year to fend off competition from the likes of Xiaomi and Honor, which also cut their handset prices.\n\nHuawei, however, did not pursue a similar strategy, as it faced a supply shortage of its Mate 60 Pro owing to production constraints.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "(Recasts, adds context on the sector, details on January performance from paragraph 2)\n\nTAIPEI, Feb 5 (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, on Monday reiterated that it expected an on-year drop in first quarter revenue coming off a high base.\n\nThe first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.\n\nFoxconn said in a statement that overall operations in this year's first quarter were \"gradually entering the traditional off-peak season, and seasonal performance is expected to be similar to that of the past three years\".\n\nIt noted that in the first quarter of 2023, as factories resumed normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing shipments led to a higher comparison base.\n\n\"The outlook for the first quarter of this year is expected to decrease year-on-year,\" Foxconn said, reiterating previous guidance.\n\nThe company does not give numerical forecasts.\n\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$522.1 billion ($16.65 billion), which it said was the second-highest ever for the same period, the highest being the previous January.\n\nThat was up 13.5% month-on-month, but down 20.9% year-on-year.\n\nCompared to the year-ago period, it said in January revenue for cloud and networking products increased significantly due to new customer product launches, but with personal computer demand slowing revenue fell slightly for computing products.\n\nFoxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on Sunday he expects the company's business this year to be \"slightly better\" than last year but is facing a shortage of chips for AI servers, where demand is booming.\n\nFoxconn will report fourth quarter earnings on March 14, when it will also update its outlook.\n\nFoxconn's shares closed down 0.5% on Monday ahead of the release of its January numbers, compared with a 0.2% gain for the broader market.

        "title": "10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the ten best Australian stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of some of the biggest stocks in Australia and how you might trade them, then you can skip ahead to 5 Best Australian Stocks To Buy.\n\nWhen we talk about the fundamentals of macroeconomics, land, along with capital and labor, is a fundamental component of economic growth. After all, land is needed for setting up industrial plants, offices, and other facilities that constitute the fabric of any economy. Subsequently, it's unsurprising that several of the world's largest economies, such as the United States, the People's Republic of China, the Republic of India, and the Russian Federation are all among the largest countries geographically.\n\nThe exceptions to this, namely Japan and the Federal Republic of Germany, rely on either their population or engineering technology to make up for a smaller geographical footprint. One country that is among the biggest in the world, at least when it comes to its size, is Australia. Occupying an entire island, Australia is one of three Anglo Western nations in the southern hemisphere, and it's among the most developed nations in the world.\n\nAustralian companies engage in billions of dollars of business each year, and the nation's gross domestic product per capita in nominal terms (GDP per capita) is $63,487 - the tenth highest globally. Additionally, Australia is relatively peaceful and ranks low in corruption perception indexes, making it unsurprising that hundreds of thousands of immigrants flock to its border annually to try to improve their living standards.\n\nLike most countries, Australia is also facing economic turbulence as we enter 2024. Its proximity to China makes it dependent on the second most populous nation in the world, and Australia's strong natural resources industry also ties its prosperity with the global economy.\n\nThese factors also affect when it comes to Australian stocks. Some top Australian stocks such as Commonwealth Bank of Australia (ASX:CBA.AX) and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) are worth hundreds of billions of dollars. Additionally, since Australia is anything but geographically close to the United States, several Australian stocks that represent important portions of its economy are not available for trading on U.S. stock indexes such as the NYSE and the NASDAQ. However, other Australian stocks such as Woodside Energy Group Ltd (NYSE:WDS) do offer American investors to directly take advantage of their strengths locally through the stock market.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet, if one were to simply rely on American stock indexes, then investing in Australian stocks would provide an incomplete picture. This is because if we use a stock screener to narrow out all Australian stocks that trade on U.S. exchanges, then a clear divide is present in the form of market capitalization. For instance, while it's true that the most valuable Australian stock in terms of market capitalization is BHP Group whose American Depository Receipts (ADRs) can be bought on the NYSE, the next couple of stocks are available only on the Australian Stock Exchange (ASX).\n\nSome such Australian stocks are also the most valuable. In fact, some high market capitalization stocks apart from the Commonwealth Bank, such as National Australia Bank Limited (NAB.AX), Fortescue Ltd (FMG.AX), and National Australia Bank Limited (NAB.AX) which have a combined market capitalization of hundreds of billions of dollars do not have their shares trade on U.S. stock exchanges. If you're interested in finding out which locally traded ASX Australian stocks bring in billions in revenue, you can take a look at 15 Largest Australian Companies by Revenue.\n\nHowever, one major Australian stock that trades directly on the NYSE is a technology firm. The U.S. consumer and enterprise technology industry is the most advanced in the world and often sees the world's best and brightest vie for an opportunity to work for mega cap giants such as Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META). Yet, it's Australia that also competes with the big guns when it comes to organizational, human resources, and project management software.\n\nThis is because among the handful of Australian stocks available for trading on U.S. exchanges is the Sydney based software firm Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM). Domiciled in Delaware, along with Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL), Atlassian was among the first firms in the world to develop project management software. Its main product Jira is widely recognized in the industry, and the firm's financial results for Q2 FY2024 reveal that Jira brought in a cool $1 billion in recurring revenue. The firm's Form-10Q for the quarter ending in September 2023 shows that out of the $977 million in total revenue or net sales, $426 million or 43.6% came from the United States. For this particular Australian stock, unlike others like BHP, the U.S. economy is much more important when it comes to analyzing share price performance and evaluating it as a candidate for investment. Since Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM) is an enterprise focused firms, tighter economic conditions such as high inflation and interest rates end up acting as headwinds but also potentially priming it for future growth.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best Australian stocks to buy. Some notable picks are Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP). 10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best Australian stocks, we scanned far and wide and made a list of 21 Australian stocks that either trade directly on U.S. exchanges such as the NYSE and NASDAQ or have their American Depository Receipts available for trading. They were ranked by the number of hedge fund investors in Q3 2023 and the top stocks were chosen.\n\nFor these best Australian stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n10 Best Australian Stocks To Buy\n\n10. Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 1\n\nMesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO) is one of the smallest companies on our list. Headquartered in Melbourne, Victoria, the firm is a biotechnology company which has several products in trials to treat diseases such as retinopathy and inflammatory diseases.\n\nJust one hedge fund out of the 910 that are part of Insider Monkey's database had bought Mesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO)'s shares as of Q3 2023 end. This lone investor was Israel Englander's Millennium Management.\n\nMesoblast Limited (NASDAQ:MESO) joins Atlassian Corporation (NASDAQ:TEAM), Rio Tinto Group (NYSE:RIO), and BHP Group Limited (NYSE:BHP) in our list of the best Australian stocks to buy.\n\n9. Immutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 2\n\nImmutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP) is another biotechnology company. It is headquartered in Sydney and is developing treatments to tackle cancer. During its second quarter of fiscal year 2024, the firm had $103 million in cash and equivalents. It believes that these are sufficient to cover operations for the next couple of years.\n\nAs of September 2023 end, two out of the 910 hedge funds polled by Insider Monkey were the firm's shareholders. Immutep Limited (NASDAQ:IMMP)'s largest investor in our database is Israel Englander's Millennium Management due to its $1.4 million stake.\n\n8. Opthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 4\n\nOpthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT) develops treatments for eye diseases that involve the organ's blood vessels and fluid management. It's one of the most highly rated stocks on our list. Analysts have rated Opthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT)'s shares Strong Buy on average and the average analyst share price target is $12.83.\n\nDuring last year's third quarter, two out of the 910 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had bought and owned Opthea Limited (NASDAQ:OPT)'s shares.\n\n7. Bionomics Limited (NASDAQ:BNOX)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 4\n\nBionomics Limited (NASDAQ:BNOX) is headquartered in Eastwood, and like other biotechnology companies, it also focuses on developing cancer treatments. Additionally, the firm is also focusing its efforts on helping patients with nervous system ailments. The firm had a busy 2023, which saw it progress on several products such as a treatments to help manage Post Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD).\n\nInsider Monkey's September quarter of 2023 survey covering 910 hedge funds revealed that four had invested in Bionomics Limited (NASDAQ:BNOX).\n\n6. Tritium DCFC Limited (NASDAQ:DCFC)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q3 2023: 7\n\nTritium DCFC Limited (NASDAQ:DCFC) is the first non biotechnology Australian stock on our list. The firm is part of the highly critical electric vehicle charging industry that has to grow if EVs are to dominate the future. 2023 hasn't been kind to the Australian stock either, as not only did the shares drop by more than 80%, but Raymond James and B.

        "content": "TAIPEI (Reuters) -Taiwan's Foxconn, the world's largest contract electronics maker and Apple's biggest iPhone assembler, on Monday reiterated that it expected an on-year drop in first quarter revenue coming off a high base.\n\nThe first quarter is traditionally quieter than the previous one, the season when Taiwan's tech companies race to supply smartphones, tablets and other electronics to major vendors such as Apple for Western markets' year-end holiday period.\n\nFoxconn said in a statement that overall operations in this year's first quarter were \"gradually entering the traditional off-peak season, and seasonal performance is expected to be similar to that of the past three years\".\n\nIt noted that in the first quarter of 2023, as factories resumed normal operations following the COVID-19 pandemic, increasing shipments led to a higher comparison base.\n\n\"The outlook for the first quarter of this year is expected to decrease year-on-year,\" Foxconn said, reiterating previous guidance.\n\nThe company does not give numerical forecasts.\n\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, said revenue last month reached T$522.1 billion ($16.65 billion), which it said was the second-highest ever for the same period, the highest being the previous January.\n\nThat was up 13.5% month-on-month, but down 20.9% year-on-year.\n\nCompared to the year-ago period, it said in January revenue for cloud and networking products increased significantly due to new customer product launches, but with personal computer demand slowing revenue fell slightly for computing products.\n\nFoxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on Sunday he expects the company's business this year to be \"slightly better\" than last year but is facing a shortage of chips for AI servers, where demand is booming.\n\nFoxconn will report fourth quarter earnings on March 14, when it will also update its outlook.\n\nFoxconn's shares closed down 0.5% on Monday ahead of the release of its January numbers, compared with a 0.2% gain for the broader market.\n\n($1 = 31.3510 Taiwan dollars)\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Kim Coghill and Emelia Sithole-Matarise)",

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens. You can skip our detailed analysis of methods of obtaining second passport as well as a look at the US MNCs in the European market and go directly to the 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.\n\nIn this ever-expanding world of opportunities, the idea of second passports has been hailed as a harbinger of many benefits, both economic and social. Whether it is a desire to live and experience the gems and natural wonders of this world, incentives for a higher quality of life, or even financial diversification, there is something for everyone here. About half a century ago, the concept of a second passport or dual citizenship was unfathomable and highly disliked by almost all countries. However, with time and advancement, the significance of a free flow of residents between countries has been acknowledged, and a more tolerant view has emerged as a consequence. Thus, we can now find various easy countries for a second passport for U.S. citizens.\n\nAs is the case with almost everything, there are both advantages and disadvantages to acquiring and maintaining a second passport. However, with the increasing trend towards dual citizenship, it appears that the benefits far outweigh the negative aspects. The perks include, but are not limited to, access to global travel, better social and economic benefits, more business and job opportunities, and certain tax reliefs. For a detailed analysis of dual citizenship advantages and disadvantages, check out our article on Dual Citizenship: Advantages, Disadvantages, and Requirements. Thus, the appeal of obtaining a second passport can be understood, and the search for the easiest countries to achieve this, is justified.\n\nWhere are the Americans Moving?\n\nThe growing demand for a second passport has prompted many people, especially the rich, to relocate to various countries around the globe. According to a recent estimate from the State Department, approximately 9 million Americans are living abroad. It is observed that 40% of US residents abroad choose to move to the Western Hemisphere, which includes Canada, Central, and South America. Additionally, 26% move to Europe, 14% to East Asia and the Pacific, and another 14% to the Middle East. Many prominent US entrepreneurs have made headlines with news of their foreign citizenship. Sam Altman, co-founder and CEO of OpenAI, has acquired Indonesia’s Golden Visa. Eric Schmidt, former CEO of Google's parent company Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), chose Cyprus’s Golden Visa, and billionaire Peter Thiel, co-founder of PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ: PYPL) and an early investor in Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), obtained New Zealand’s citizenship in 2011. Therefore, it is evident that there are countries where US residents can gain a second passport with ease.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow to Get a Second Passport\n\nTo acquire a second passport, there are primarily four paths to follow: citizenship through birth/descent, citizenship through marriage, citizenship through investment, and citizenship through a residency-by-investment program or naturalization. Citizenship through birth/descent is attained by being born to parents with citizenship, automatically granting the same for the child. Proof of an ancestral connection with a citizen can also lead to citizenship. Citizenship through investment is mainly acquired by making an economic investment in the country. Naturalization is a process through which citizenship can be achieved by gaining residency in a country, often through investment, and building a relationship with the country by spending a specified time there. Alternatively, citizenship can be granted by marrying a citizen of a country. Thus, depending on the method employed, there are many countries where US residents can access a second passport.\n\nIs it Just US Residents or Are Multinationals (MNCs) Expanding to Europe too?\n\nEuropean markets stand among the largest global economies. With an increasing influx of emigrants to these states, it's no surprise that more companies are expanding their operations there. Thirty percent of US companies move to Europe to achieve their profit goals, and thirty-two percent even introduce new products to tap into this burgeoning market.\n\nIreland’s economy, in particular, has experienced a staggering positive impact from multinationals in 2022. These companies contributed 56% to the total value added, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook-- Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ: META), Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG). Notably, sectors such as information and communication, dominated by MNCs like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL), Facebook (NASDAQ: META), and Google-- Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ: GOOG), witnessed the most significant expansion.\n\nPfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) is actively expanding its operations in the European market, as indicated by recent developments. In October 2023, the US pharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE), secured unconditional EU anti-trust approval for its $43 billion acquisition of cancer drug maker Seagen (SGEN.O).\n\nSimilarly, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) is making strategic moves to maintain a strong presence in the European market. On December 13, 2023, the company announced the expansion of its Self Service Repair program, now covering the iPhone 15 lineup and Mac models powered by M2 chips. This extension includes the 14- and 16-inch MacBook Pro, the 15-inch MacBook Air, Mac mini, Mac Pro, and Mac Studio. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) also confirmed the availability of this Self Service Repair program in 24 additional European countries, such as Croatia, Denmark, Greece, the Netherlands, Portugal, and Switzerland. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens\n\n15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens\n\nMethodology\n\nTo create our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, we conducted extensive research on the best and most straightforward options available. We also referred to our article from the previous year, highlighting the 15 Easiest Countries to Get Citizenship as an American. Additionally, we cross-referenced our findings with ImmigrantInvest.com’s list of countries that permit dual citizenship for US citizens. Our comprehensive approach considered various methods for obtaining dual citizenship, encompassing citizenship by descent, residency, naturalization through investment programs, and citizenship by investment programs. We made sure to include countries from diverse regions, spanning Latin America, Asia and the South Pacific, Europe, and the Caribbean Islands.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that uses a consensus approach to identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks. The website tracks the movement of corporate insiders and hedge funds. Our top 10 consensus stock picks of hedge funds outperformed the S&P 500 stock index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). So, if you are looking for the best stock picks to buy, you can benefit from the wisdom of hedge funds and corporate insiders.\n\nNow that we have thoroughly combed our sources and selected the easiest countries for second passport for US citizens, we present it to you in an ascending list:\n\n15. New Zealand\n\nIn the Asia and South Pacific region, numerous countries offer citizenship through various means. Considering the countries that permit dual citizenship for US residents and the fact that New Zealand falls under the category of the easiest countries to obtain citizenship through descent, we have placed this country at number 15 on our list.\n\nConsidered one of the most affordable and expedient methods to acquire a second passport, gaining citizenship in New Zealand is remarkably straightforward. If one of the parents is a citizen of New Zealand, the child can easily obtain citizenship by submitting an application, with the process typically taking about 30 working days. For those seeking an even faster turnaround, a reduced processing time of 10 days is available for an additional fee. New Zealand, being a developed country, ensures a high quality of life for its residents. Acquiring dual citizenship from this nation can prove to be a beneficial option for many Americans.\n\n14. Italy\n\nItaly, being one of the European countries, stands out as one of the easiest nations to obtain citizenship for US residents through descent. All that is required is proof of Italian descent, with a birth certificate of oneself and one's parents, grandparents, or any direct ancestor typically considered sufficient. Other acceptable documents may include death certificates, divorce or marriage certificates. However, two conditions must be met: the ancestor acquired citizenship before June 14, 1912, and this citizenship had not been renounced or replaced by a second citizenship before the birth of their child.\n\n13. St. Kitts and Nevis\n\nSituated in the Caribbean, this picturesque island is a favored destination for US residents. It not only provides the chance to enjoy natural marvels but also offers opportunities for financial gains through multiple tax advantages. The St. Kitts and Nevis citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the easiest and quickest ways for US citizens to obtain a second passport. The program doesn't require any mandatory stay period in the country, and the immigration process is completed in just four months. The primary requirement is a $250,000 payment to the Sustainable Island State Contribution (SISC).\n\n12. St. Lucia\n\nSimilar to St. Kitts and Nevis, another Caribbean island stands out as one of the easiest options for obtaining a second passport for US citizens. The St. Lucia investment program is particularly cost-effective, requiring a contribution of $100,000 to St. Lucia’s Government Development Fund as the minimum investment. While this figure applies for a single person, a slightly higher amount for a spouse or children allows the qualified US resident to secure dual citizenship for themselves and their family in just three months.\n\n11. Vanuatu\n\nIn the Pacific region, Vanuatu takes the lead by offering the only citizenship-by-investment program. Individuals, including US residents, can acquire citizenship by investing $130,000. Beyond the relatively low investment requirement, the most significant advantage lies in the expeditious process, which can be completed in approximately 2 months. Vanuatu not only offers various tax benefits, including no income tax, inheritance tax, or capital gains tax but also provides a straightforward and easy pathway for gaining a second passport for US residents.\n\n10. Ireland\n\nIreland is a popular destination for immigration, particularly through the Descent Program. The Irish government has made this process highly accessible, allowing individuals to qualify for citizenship rights by establishing an ancestral connection up to the great-grandfather. Additionally, other familial ties, such as marriage to an Irish citizen, provide an opportunity for citizenship, with the requirement of spending at least three years with the said spouse or partner. Although this period may seem relatively long, it is shorter compared to Portugal or Switzerland. Therefore, Ireland stands out as one of the easiest countries for obtaining a second passport for US citizens.\n\n9. Canada\n\nClose to the US, Canada is considered one of the easiest countries for US residents to apply for obtaining dual citizenship. Known for its welcoming environment, Canada boasts a straightforward immigration process. While US citizens don't require a visa for stays less than 180 days, a visa or residency permit is needed for longer stays.\n\nWhile the Quebec Investor Program is an option, the easiest route is through the Express Entry System. Under this program, individuals skilled in three major economic fields in Canada are evaluated using a point system. The higher the points, the greater the likelihood of obtaining a visa. Subsequently, a stay of at least three years or 1095 days out of 5 years would lead to citizenship. Other conditions include passing tests related to Canadian history and language (English or French) as well as fulfilling any necessary tax obligations.\n\n8. Cyprus\n\nThis European country is renowned as one of the easiest nations providing citizenship through a residency-by-investment program. The Golden Visa allows an individual to acquire residency rights within three months, with an investment of at least €300,000. This residency can eventually lead to citizenship in approximately seven years, provided essential government requirements are met. These include maintaining the investment and residency for seven years, adhering to the required time period for staying in the country, and visiting Cyprus at least once every two years.\n\n7. Antigua and Barbuda\n\nThe Caribbean Islands continue to offer some of the easiest paths for obtaining a second passport for US residents, with Antigua and Barbuda emerging as a prominent option. Notably, this stunning island stands out due to its low investment amount ($100,000) and a quick and hassle-free process. In contrast to many countries that increase the initial investment amount with the introduction of more family members, Antigua and Barbuda includes a spouse and two children in the same figure, with additional cost only on the form of fees. There are three ways to make the investment, and citizenship can be obtained in about three to four months. However, the country requires a presence of five days a year for passport renewal.\n\n6. Grenada\n\nGrenada secures the 6th position on our list of the easiest countries for a second passport for US citizens, primarily due to the speed with which citizenship can be achieved. The country's citizenship-by-investment program stands out as one of the best in the Caribbean Islands. With a minimum investment through a donation of $150,000 for a single person (which increases to $200,000 and additional fees for a family of four), a qualifying investor can attain citizenship within three to six months.\n\nClick to continue reading and see our 5 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens.\n\nSuggested Articles:\n\n24 Countries Where You Can Retire on Just Social Security in 2024 15 Countries With Highest Mortgage Rates 12 Most Innovative Economies in Europe\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Easiest Countries for Second Passport for US Citizens is originally published on Insider Monkey.",

        "title": "After Skyrocketing 615%, Why Does Warren Buffett Still Own Apple Stock?",
        "content": "Many people believe that Warren Buffett is the greatest investor ever. As the longtime CEO of Berkshire Hathaway, he has held many winning investments.\n\nPerhaps his most successful is Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). The conglomerate first started buying shares in the iPhone maker during the first quarter of 2016. And since the start of that year, shares have skyrocketed an incredible 615%.\n\nA whopping 45.7% of Berkshire's entire portfolio is represented by just Apple. With such a high weighting, coupled with a market cap of $2.9 trillion and a price-to-earning (P/E) ratio of 30.4, it forces one to wonder why the Oracle of Omaha still owns Apple today.\n\nI think there are four reasons why this might be the case.\n\nFavorite holding period\n\nBuffett's investment strategy has long focused on finding outstanding businesses and aiming to hold them for a long time. In fact, his favorite holding period is forever.\n\nApple has the makings of a forever stock. Its incredibly powerful brand supports its economic moat. And because customers are also using the company's software and services more, Apple has an ecosystem that drives stickiness. These traits have helped support the business's financial success.\n\nThe added benefit of having an indefinite holding period is that it doesn't trigger a taxable event. This means compounding isn't interrupted unnecessarily.\n\nPotential for returns\n\nWhen picking stocks to invest in, the hope is that they can beat the market over the long term. Despite its huge market cap and premium valuation, Buffett might still believe that Apple has the potential to produce strong returns going forward.\n\nWith dividends reinvested, the S&P 500 has historically returned an average of about 10% per year. This is a difficult hurdle for most active managers to beat. But Buffett may think there is a high chance that Apple can outperform the broader index.\n\nIf this is the case, then there's absolutely no reason why he should sell, especially since he probably has expert knowledge about the business after owning it for all these years.\n\nStory continues\n\nBeneficial capital allocation\n\nBerkshire owns a 5.9% stake in Apple thanks to its holding of nearly 916 million shares. This massive position provides a financial windfall.\n\nApple pays a dividend that yields a measly 0.52%. But based on the current quarterly payout of $0.24, Buffett's firm receives an annualized $879 million from its equity position in the tech giant.\n\nApple uses the vast majority of its free cash flow to retire its outstanding stock. From the end of fiscal 2018 through the end of 2023, the business saw its share count shrink by 21%, a capital-allocation policy that increases Berkshire's ownership stake.\n\nMore of the same problem\n\nIn this instance, it's very easy to come up with reasons for why Apple should be sold right now. But let's also consider the opportunity cost. If Buffett sold the entire position today, what would Berkshire do with the almost $170 billion in proceeds?\n\nThis sizable cash infusion would only exacerbate the conglomerate's problem. It already has $152 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and U.S. Treasury bills on the balance sheet, a sum that Buffett hasn't seemed to have had much use for in terms of finding compelling investments. He would likely have no idea what to do with more money that would come from selling Apple.\n\nThis tells me that even though a valid argument can be made that at its current size and expensive valuation it should be sold, Apple still provides a better potential return than just holding cash. This might be what Buffett is thinking.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "Bill Gates, currently the eighth richest man in the world with a net worth of over $121 billion, made his fortune from Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). Since stepping down as CEO of Microsoft, Gates has invested across several assets to multiply his wealth.\n\nGates's investment portfolio currently holds 75 stocks and is valued at $38.91 billion as of Nov. 14. Several renowned billionaires have also invested in the stocks Gates holds, reflecting the resilience of respective large-cap companies amid the volatile market backdrop.\n\nWhile each billionaire investor has a unique approach, the majority of them have a substantial stake in the biggest tech stocks in the market. These technology giants who have dominated the market have withstood the test of time. As the macroeconomic headwinds, including economic slowdown concerns and uncertainty regarding the rate cut timeline persist, following billionaires' cues might be beneficial.\n\nTake a close look at a handful of blue chip stocks that not only appeal to Gates but also capture the attention of fellow billionaires.\n\nMicrosoft Corp.\n\nGates owns 1.38% of the total outstanding shares of Microsoft. The Magnificent Seven stock dominated the tech space last year, with its strategic investments in OpenAI and the acquisition of Activision Blizzard attracting investors. Shares of Microsoft have risen by over 6% year to date, outperforming the tech-focused Nasdaq Composite index's 2% gains so far this year.\n\nThe company's growth potential has attracted several other billionaires as well. Billionaire portfolio manager Ken Fisher bought over 560,000 shares of Microsoft in the fiscal third quarter of 2023, bringing his total holdings to approximately 24.9 million shares. Microsoft is the second-largest holding in Fisher's portfolio. Fisher's Fisher Asset Management has over $236 billion in assets under management.\n\nSteven Cohen, founder and CEO of hedge fund company Point72 Asset Management, also bought over 203,000 shares of Microsoft in the third quarter ended Sept. 30. Cohen owns 2.03 million shares of Microsoft, accounting for 2.18% of his total portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nCitadel Founder and CEO Ken Griffin also bought nearly 1.63 million shares of Microsoft in the third quarter, increasing his stake in the tech behemoth by 47.9%.\n\nDon’t Miss:\n\nInvesting in real estate just got a whole lot simpler. This Jeff Bezos-backed startup will allow you to become a landlord in just 10 minutes, and you only need $100. Warren Buffett once said, \"If you don’t find a way to make money while you sleep, you will work until you die.\" Here are three high-yield investments to add significant income to your portfolio. Passive income investments are one of the most trusted methods for riding out a recession, so it's no surprise that people are turning to high-yield real estate notes that pay a fixed 7.5% to 9%.\n\nApple Inc.\n\nGates bought approximately 52,815 shares of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in the third quarter. The Microsoft co-founder joined the Apple bandwagon relatively late, as many billionaires already have significant exposure to the tech giant. Warren Buffett, one of the most influential investors of this generation, considers Apple to be one of his crown jewels, claiming the business is \"better than anything we own.\"\n\nBuffett has a 5.9% stake in Apple as he owns over 915 million shares, making it his largest portfolio holding. He last bought Apple shares in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nFisher increased his stake in Apple in the third quarter, scooping up over 878,000 shares. Apple is the largest holding of Fisher Asset Management, accounting for 5.25% of its total portfolio.\n\nConcerns regarding slowing demand for Apple's products have caused the stock to plummet this year. Given concerns regarding Apple's sales in China amid tensions between the U.S. and China, the tech giant has been strategically shifting its production base to India. The company aims to produce nearly 25% of its iPhones in the Southeast Asian country.\n\nBank of America upgraded Apple stock to Buy on Jan. 18, issuing a price target of $225. This indicates a potential upside of over 17%.\n\nRead Next:\n\nElon Musk may be adding landlord to his list of titles. Here’s how to join him in his latest venture with as little as $100.

        "title": "7 Steady Blue-Chip Stocks to Buy and Hold All Year",
        "content": "The Fed crushed expectations of lowering interest rates by holding the current rates steady. However, there are several signs of the economy improving and this could mean lower rates in the coming months. But if you want to build a resilient portfolio that survives the ups and downs of the economy, you need to consider stocks that are worth holding on to for years — like reliable blue-chip stocks. While these stocks may not be cheap, they are stable companies with a long history, impressive balance sheet and a strong business. They understand the market, have a range of products and services and have proved themselves time and again. This is what sets it apart from the other companies, and such stocks are worth holding on to for years. Let’s take a look at the seven most reliable blue-chip stocks to buy and hold throughout 2024.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) In this photo the Microsoft Office 365 logo is seen on a smartphone and a pc screen. AVPT stock, AVPT provides services for Microsoft (MSFT) products\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the biggest tech giants right now and its financials didn’t disappoint. In the recent quarterly results, the company saw an 18% year-over-year (YOY) rise in revenue to hit $62 billion and it saw strong growth from the cloud services business.\n\nDriven by the Activision Blizzard acquisition, the company saw a 61% YOY jump in gaming revenue this quarter. Azure, its cloud business also saw a revenue growth of 30% YOY. The company has invested heavily in artificial intelligence and has integrated AI into its products and services.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt expects to start seeing returns from this year. The company is already at its best, and MSFT stock is trading at $407 today. However, it will continue moving upward this year and is one stock that will keep rewarding you. It also enjoys a dividend yield of 0.74% making it a top choice for passive investors.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nI have been writing about Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for a while and had recommended a buy before the quarterly results. The e-commerce giant is set to have an excellent 2024, and its recent numbers are proof. A dynamite stock for the year, it has grown the cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS) at a solid pace in the past five years.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt saw a surge in revenue during the pandemic, significant lows due to high inflation and has rebounded in 2023. Amazon is firing on all cylinders, and it reported a 14% jump in revenue to hit $170 billion ,and the EPS came in at $1. Even the sales at AWS saw a 13% jump to $24.2 billion, and this segment will continue growing throughout 2024.\n\nThe advertising revenue has been on an upward momentum since the past quarter, and it saw a 27% YOY rise in sales to a record $14.7 billion. Trading at $170 today, the stock is up 51% in the year and shows no signs of slowing.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nA personal favorite and a global business, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is winning the market with loyal customers. If you have used an Apple product once, there is very little chance that you would want to switch to a different company. Apple is a solid brand and has an enviable balance sheet.\n\nThe company finally saw a surge in iPhone sales in the recent quarter and reported a revenue of $119.6 billion with an EPS of $2.18. The iPhone sales came in at $69.7 billion but the sales have slowed down in China. Even the sales of iPads have seen a drop. However, this is temporary.\n\nApple is so much more than its devices and generates significant revenue from the Services segment. It reported a record revenue of $23.1 billion in services, and I believe this segment will continue to expand. The company is known for innovation and offering world-class products. Trading at $186 today, the stock is up 23% in the year, and this upward momentum will continue in 2024.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Google launches Bard AI. Google search bar on a phone in hand with release information on background. Google Bard AI vs OpenAI ChatGPT. . reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: salarko / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is down 6% over the past week, and any drop in the stock is a chance to buy. The drop is due to the recently announced results where the company produced a revenue of $65.5 billion from advertising, lower than analysts’ expectations. Its total revenue came in at $86.3 billion, and the operating income stood at $23.7 billion.\n\nMost of the revenue was from the advertising business, and the rest was from the search engine and the other social media products. However, the bigger picture for the company looks highly attractive, and there are many reasons to load up on the stock.\n\nThe operating income and profit are growing at a healthy rate, and the stock hit a record high last month. It has dropped since then and is trading for $142 today. The company has missed expectations but only by a small number and this is not a reason to avoid the stock. GOOG stock is a strong buy and hold.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is another option in reliable blue-chip stocks. The company has had a tough ride but it has survived through it all. In 2022, it saw a drop in revenue and membership growth, but the same picked pace in 2023, and it is entering this year on a very optimistic note. It stopped password sharing and cracked down on those who accessed the service without paying, and this has helped improve the revenue numbers.\n\nIts fourth-quarter results were also impressive. The company saw a 12.5% YOY rise in revenue growth, and the EPS came in at $2.11. Most importantly, the company added 13.1 million subscribers, its highest jump since 2020. Its growing member numbers and revenue growth are proof that this streaming giant is here to stay.\n\nIt expects an even faster growth this year while aiming for an operating margin expansion. The stock is exchanging hands for $567 and isn’t cheap, but it is worth it. The stock is up 21% year-to-date (YTD) due to the quarterly results.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top fintech stocks, Visa (NYSE:V) is a solid buy in 2024. The company has been thriving despite the unpleasant macroeconomic situations. It has a strong business model where it generates revenue whenever someone uses a Visa card.\n\nThe company has a global presence and caters to more than 100 million merchants. In the recent quarterly reports, Visa reported a 9% YOY increase in revenue to $8.6 billion, while the payments volume grew by 8% and the EPS was up 20%.\n\nVisa has never disappointed in the earnings, and it is a rock-solid business that will continue to grow as we transition from cash to card. It also boasts of a dividend yield of 0.75% and pays a quarterly dividend of $0.52. Visa is also making strategic acquisitions to enhance its position in the industry. Trading at $277, the stock is up 7% YTD.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches. reliable blue-chip stocks\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) delicious burgers are raking in big revenue for the company. An excellent buy, the company has nailed the franchise business model and has managed to keep the operating costs down while steadily generating revenue. It is one of the most reliable blue-chip stocks to own.\n\nIt has done well despite inflation and boasts of a strong dividend yield of 2.27%. The stock is trading close to the 52-week high at $294 today but has the potential to grow at least 25% this year. The company is set to report earnings soon and I am certain it will be a blowout quarter, driven by the holiday season. It has already beaten revenue estimates for the past three quarters with an 11% rise in sales in the previous quarter.\n\nA highly reliable business, McDonald’s is generating enough cash to keep rewarding the shareholders and is one of the best brands in the market. It enjoys a pricing power and has a solid presence across the global market which ensures it stands strong in any market situation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Companies test out different ways to talk about ESG without saying 'ESG'",
        "content": "Midway through another earnings season, the free-fall in C-suite mentions of the movement for environment, social, and governance (ESG) strategies is on pace to plumb new depths.\n\nThere have been just nine direct mentionsamong S&P 500 companies of the politically controversial term amid the sea of hundreds of earnings calls in recent weeks, according to data from financial data company FactSet through Friday afternoon.\n\nThat is a far cry from the 156 mentions among S&P 500 companies during the fourth quarter of 2021, when usage of the term peaked according to the company.\n\nAnd citations this year are either very brief or reflect a more charged political landscape, according to a Yahoo Finance analysis.\n\n\"Clients are taking a more measured approach to how they integrate ESG,\" noted Andy Wiechmann, the chief financial officer of finance company MSCI (MSCI) on his company's earnings call, in just one example.\n\nThe term has come up in a handful of other places, including on recent calls for stock market index operator NASDAQ (NDAQ), drug wholesaler Cencora (COR), and elevator maker Otis Worldwide (OTIS). But nearly all household names have moved away from the term entirely.\n\nThat doesn't mean that a conversation around the issues underlying ESG has been absent. Through the use of different buzzwords — or simply a straight-ahead discussion of how companies factor climate change into business decisions — the topic appears to be alive and well.\n\nNew terms like 'green economy' and 'energy transition'\n\nRecent earnings from some of the top companies on Wall Street are perhaps the best example of the divergent trends.\n\nWhile no major bank brought up ESG directly, according to FactSet, climate and other issues remained a topic of much interest.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon made sure his investors were aware of \"an ongoing need for increased spending due to the green economy,\" adding that climate change was one of a few \"significant and somewhat unprecedented forces [that] cause us to remain cautious.\"\n\nStory continues Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, during an appearance alongside other banking CEOs in Washington last December. (Win McNamee/Getty Images) (Win McNamee via Getty Images)\n\nAnother example came on an earnings call for BlackRock (BLK), the world's largest money manager.\n\nCEO Larry Fink has been among the faces of the ESG movement in recent years thanks to his annual letters urging companies and long-term investors to do more to prepare for climate change. But he recently grew disenchanted with the term and announced last June that he would stop saying it at all.\n\nHe stayed true to that pledge on BlackRock's Jan. 12 earnings call. The company unveiled plans to buy private equity firm Global Infrastructure Partners but — without ever saying ESG — Fink made clear that a changing climate and \"the energy transition\" were key factors driving the $12.5 billion deal. Larry Fink, CEO of BlackRock. (Sean Gallup/Getty Images) (Sean Gallup via Getty Images)\n\n\"If we are going to decarbonize the world ... capital and infrastructure is going to be very necessary,\" Fink told investors, adding \"that supply/demand imbalance creates compelling investment opportunities for our clients.\"\n\nThe same trend held in the past week as Big Tech companies took center stage. There was little mention of ESG, but plenty of discussion of things like the climate.\n\n\"In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work,\" Apple (AAPL) CEO Tim Cook noted on his call. Apple CEO Tim Cook in New York City on Friday as the Apple Vision Pro headset began to go on sale. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition, terms like \"sustainable investing,\" \"responsible business,\" and \"transition investing\" have also been floated by business leaders and corporate advisers in recent months as other ways to talk about the issues raised by ESG without using the term itself.\n\n'Woke capitalism'\n\nA recent Global Strategy Group poll found overwhelming bipartisan support when Americans are asked whether they support companies \"that try to have a positive impact on their communities.\" That support falls dramatically among Republicans once the term ESG is introduced.\n\nAnti-ESG advocates are quick to claim that the declining prominence of the term is a win for their side as they work to stop what they call \"woke capitalism,\" which they say prioritizes a political agenda over maximizing returns for investors.\n\nThe push against ESG has also scored some high-profile victories in recent years, such as when money management giant Vanguard withdrew from a climate-focused consortium called the Net Zero Asset Managers initiative. Some ESG funds are also closing as investor interest moves elsewhere.\n\nBut ESG advocates say there could be a silver lining for their side if the controversial term is largely taken off the table.\n\n\"Obviously the word ESG has been polarized,\" said Randell Leach, the CEO of a community bank called Beneficial State Bank largely devoted to social responsibility, in a recent interview.\n\nBut he's OK with that, saying he sees the change as a way to stop companies from pushing ESG as a cover for \"greenwashing\" and instead forcing a more direct case for the underlying principles.\n\n\"The market has evolved,\" he added.\n\nDimon's recent comments, Leach says, show the most powerful banker in the world can more directly make an affirmative case that taking climate into account \"is just smart business.\"\n\nBen Werschkul is Washington correspondent for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for politics news related to business and money\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance",

        "title": "15 Largest Sovereign Wealth Funds: One Earned $213 Billion in 2023",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 15 largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. If you want to skip our analysis, you can go directly to the 5 Largest Sovereign Wealth Funds in the World.\n\nSovereign Wealth Funds\n\nA sovereign wealth fund (SWF), or a sovereign investment fund is a state-owned investment fund made up of wealth generated by the government. In simple terms, a sovereign wealth fund is a state-owned savings portfolio from which a state invests in various financial and non-financial segments to grow capital and increase wealth. A well-managed sovereign wealth fund plays a vital role in a country's economy and adds to its surplus accounts. Popular sovereign wealth funds have investments in real and financial assets such as real estate, stocks, bonds, precious metals, and various other industries.\n\nSince the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has suffered a massive shock as it continues its way back to recovery. Following the pandemic, things got difficult for State-Owned Investors (SOIs). 2022 was one of the most difficult years for SOIs, especially impacted by Russia's invasion of Ukraine which led to an increase in oil prices and drove inflation rates to new levels in almost four decades. Today, the global economy faces more threats due to geopolitical turmoil including rising tensions in the Middle East. Iran and its proxies are up against Israel and its allies, amidst the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war situation. On February 2, BBC reported that the US has approved plans for strikes on Iranian targets in Iraq and Syria.\n\nAccording to Global SWF, the sovereign wealth funds shrank for the first year in 2022. However, the scale of the drop in sovereign wealth funds’ wealth in 2022 is debatable as most SWFs report with significant delays. Still, the SWFs lost around $1 trillion in 2022, as per Global SWF.\n\nCompared to 2022, 2023 was much better for sovereign wealth funds as they increased their spending. On January 1, Reuters reported Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF) accumulated approximately a quarter of the $124 billion spent by SWFs worldwide in 2023. Saudi Arabia's SWF is one of the largest sovereign wealth funds in the world. Saudi Arabia generates most of its wealth from the oil economy and has designated a share of its oil wealth to the Public Investment Fund (PIF). The PIF spent a whopping $31.5 billion in 2023 compared to $123.8 billion spent for all sovereign wealth funds. Saudi Arabia is one of the richest Arab countries and the government is working on the diversification of its economy through various investments. PIF is playing a vital role in diversifying the country's economy. The PIF owns four of the biggest football clubs from the Saudi Pro League including Al-Ittihad, Al-Ahli, Al-Nassr, and Al-Hilal.

According to researchby the Thinking Ahead Institute, the SWFs account for a record share of 38.9% of total assets among the largest 100 global asset owners.\n\nThe Sovereign Wealth Fund that Earned $213 Billion in 2023\n\nNorway’s giant sovereign wealth fund has made massive gains in 2023. On January 30, Norges Bank Investment Management reported that Norway Government Pension Fund Global recorded a profit of 2.22 trillion Norwegian kroner, or $213 billion, in 2023. The remarkable gains for Norway Government Pension Fund Global were mainly driven by strong returns on its investments in technology stocks.

        "title": "3 Top Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now",
        "content": "The metaverse has taken a back seat in terms of media attention and investor sentiment about the future of the technology. However, companies continue to pour billions of dollars into the hardware and software that will allow people to connect in a virtual space. That suggests there might still be some investment opportunity to be had here.\n\nIf you're interested in the companies leading the way on the metaverse, three big tech companies should be front and center in your research. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), MetaPlatforms(NASDAQ: META), and Unity Software(NYSE: U) are the standout leaders in the metaverse today.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWhether it intends it or not, Apple is a leader in the metaverse. The company creates and sells some of the devices consumers will use to interact virtually, whether that's smartphones and computers or next-generation virtual reality headsets like the Vision Pro.\n\nApple will also play a role in the creation and capture of virtual spaces. Most Apple iOS devices now include LiDAR, which helps map rooms or give spatial information about how far distances are in a virtual space. Apple's Augmented Reality Kit (ARKit) is also a leading platform for digital assets, and it's built into hundreds of millions of devices.\n\nThe metaverse is going to need hardware to interact with the virtual space, and Apple will be at the center of that hardware race. Apple may not build the metaverse, but it will build the devices we use to get there.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms changed its name from Facebook to tell investors this is now a metaverse company. Mark Zuckerberg is spending over $10 billion per year building the hardware and software to make his vision a reality. So far, it hasn't led to financial success or widespread adoption, but that hasn't stopped Meta Platforms.\n\nThe Meta Quest 3 is Meta Platforms' latest virtual reality headset built to interact with metaverse assets the company is creating. It's hard to call this device (or VR in general) a success for Meta, but it may lead to the technology that ultimately becomes successful.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta's Ray-Ban sunglasses are an example of where this technology could be used in more devices. They are capture devices today, but will likely add AR features in the future, bridging the digital world and physical world in ways that may be more natural than with Quest or Apple's Vision Pro.  Meta is also beginning to incorporate artificial intelligence, which could be revolutionary in the metaverse. Users could ask the AI to make a virtual call to someone, create 3D assets, or pull up a sporting event or TV show in the virtual world.\n\nMeta Platforms may not be the dominant VR company a decade from now, but it's hard to argue this won't be a connective tissue in the metaverse, and that's not a bad place to be.\n\n3. Unity Software\n\nThere are two game engines vying to be the metaverse leaders, Unity and Unreal. Unreal, made by Epic Games, has become the better high-fidelity game engine, but Unity's claim to fame is as the preferred tool for making iOS games and VR content, and it is a preferred partner of Vision Pro at launch.\n\nUnity has struggled to find its footing as a public company as its business model has changed and advertising revenue hasn't taken off as hoped. These are challenges management needs to overcome, but Unity's value to metaverse developers is not in question.\n\nThis is still the leading game engine for virtual worlds, and I think it's more likely Unity's quality improves than developers switch to Unreal wholesale.\n\nThe future of the metaverse\n\nWhat we don't know is what the metaverse will look like a decade from now. Will it be a \"place\" we go to meet friends and do business, or will it be more like a 3D conference call?\n\nNo matter where we go in the metaverse, Apple, Meta, and Unity will be major players. For investors, that provides a lot of upside and optionality.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them.

        "content": "TAIPEI (Reuters) - Taiwan's Foxconn, Apple's biggest iPhone assembler and the world's largest contract electronics maker, expects its business this year to be \"slightly better\" than last year but is facing a shortage of chips for AI servers.\n\n\"We did pretty well last year, although we had a rather large write off in the first quarter,\" Foxconn Chairman Liu Young-way said on Sunday, referring to a writedown related to its 34% stake in Japanese electronics maker Sharp Corp.\n\n\"As for this year's outlook, I think it might be slightly better than last year,\" Liu told reporters on the sidelines of the company's annual employee party in Taipei.\n\nFoxconn in November said it had a \"relatively conservative and neutral\" outlook for 2024.\n\nDemand for artificial intelligence (AI) servers will \"of course\" be good, but global economic uncertainty given geopolitical problems will affect consumer product demand, he added.\n\n\"One (market segment) will be good, but very many others - uh-oh.\"\n\nApple on Thursday forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations as its China business took a hit.\n\nThe results confirmed some analysts' concerns that the company's signature product is losing ground in the key Asian market where consumers are buying foldable phones and phones from Huawei, powered by a China-made chip.\n\nLiu said production capacity for chips for servers is limited, even with strong demand.\n\n\"When it comes up to keeping up with demand, perhaps there need to be new factories,\" he added.\n\nFoxconn, formally called Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, will report fourth quarter earnings next month when it will also update its outlook for this year. It releases January sales data on Monday.\n\nFoxconn's shares have slid 2.4% so far this year, compared with a 0.7% gain for the broader market.\n\n(Reporting by Ben Blanchard; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)",

        "title": "11 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts",
        "content": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 11 best American defense stocks to buy according to analysts. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest events in the defense sector and the top weapons and firms, then you can take a look at the 5 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts.\n\nThe defense industry, despite all the footage of F-16s firing missiles, is a rather less glamorous sector. Defense companies make all kinds of armaments and combat equipment, both lethal and non-lethal. From Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT)'s fourth generation war fighters like the F-16, or Superior Group of Companies, Inc. (NASDAQ:SGC)'s uniforms, each product plays a crucial role in sustaining a war machine regardless of whether there's peace or war.\n\nHowever, when it comes to talking about pure play defense stocks, these are firms that make weapons or provide direct services to the military. From bullets to missiles, defense stocks benefit from having a stable customer in the form of governments. So while firms such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) or Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are subject to the whims of their customers, others like The Boeing Company. (NYSE:BA) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC) know that not only will they be required to service existing stockpiles, but also that a need to continuously keep themselves abreast of the latest developments in high technology industries such as materials science and aerospace engineering is indispensable.\n\nAfter a brief period of stability following America's withdrawal from Afghanistan, the world was plunged into war once again as Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022. Since then, not only has the Ukraine invasion endured and seen the Eastern European nation take on one of the biggest militaries in the world, but conflict in the Middle East has also expanded. 2024 ushered in the first U.S. deaths in the Middle East since the attack on Israel.\n\nWhen we talk about defense stocks, one common claim is that as soon as there's a war in which their equipment might be involved (i.e. demand creation), the share prices of defense companies surge. (i.e. investors prepare for growth) For U.S. defense stocks, this claim stood the test of time at the onset of the Russian invasion. As an example, consider the shares of Lockheed Martin Corporation (NYSE:LMT) and Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC), two of America's biggest nearly pure play defense stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the Russian invasion began on February 24th, 2022, Lockheed's shares surged by over 19% over the next two weeks before losing all their gains over the course of the next seven months. The stock roared back to life over the course of the next weeks, and since the start of hostilities and since Hamas's attack, the stock is up by 6%.\n\nSimilarly, Northrop's shares also surged during late February and in October after marking a 4% drop earlier this year in the wake of the company's earnings report. This report, which covered Northrop Grumman Corporation (NYSE:NOC)'s earnings for the fourth quarter of and full year 2022 saw the American defense stock's earnings share and sales grow 25% and 16%, respectively. However, the stock fell as Wall Street was not impressed by a 30% net earnings drop for the full year.\n\nEven though they might experience some periodic turbulence, American defense stocks are nevertheless at the top of the global food chain. As an illustration, consider our coverage of the Top 20 Most Valuable Defense Companies in the World. Within this list, out of the top five most valuable defense stocks, four were American. Along with Lockheed and Boeing, the top four defense stocks included the Charlotte, Carolina based industrial conglomerate Honeywell International Inc. (NASDAQ:HON) and missile manufacturer RTX Corporation (NYSE:RTX).\n\nBut what about Wall Street? After all, if investment banks and hedge funds are such savvy gurus, then they must possess some uncanny ability to 'sense' when an American defense stock's fortunes will rise. Well, we can see if investment bank The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS) was thinking ahead as it tinkered with its investment portfolio during the second quarter of 2023. We took a look at Goldman Sachs's defense and aerospace stock portfolio as part of our coverage of Goldman Sachs Defense Stocks: Top 10 Stock Picks.\n\nFor reference, during Q2 2023, the Russian invasion of Ukraine had marked its first anniversary and the Hamas attack was on the horizon. During this period, while Goldman Sachs's top five defense stock picks were all American defense stocks, the bank's favorite defense stock was Lockheed whose jets are so far unmatched globally in stealth technology. RTX (formerly Raytheon) and Boeing were the next two American defense stocks. When we analyze Goldman Sachs's stock portfolio for Q3 2023, we find that the bank trimmed its stake in Lockheed and RTX by 11% and in Boeing by 3%. All these American defense stocks were also present in our coverage of Top 16 Defense Contractors in the World in 2023, with Lockheed, RTX, Boeing, and General Dynamics Corporation (NYSE:GD) taking the first four places.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the best American defense stocks to buy according to analysts. Some top analyst American top defense stock picks are Rocket Lab USA, Inc. (NASDAQ:RKLB), Planet Labs PBC (NYSE:PL), and V2X, Inc. (NYSE:VVX). 11 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\nSpaceKris/Shutterstock.com\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the best American defense stocks according to analysts, we ranked the 40 most valuable American aerospace and defense stocks by their average analyst share price upside and picked out the top stocks. The list was then further refined to remove those stocks that catered purely to civilian needs.\n\nFor these top American defense stocks, we used hedge fund sentiment. Hedge funds’ top 10 consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years (see the details here). That’s why we pay very close attention to this often-ignored indicator.\n\n11 Best American Defense Stocks To Buy According to Analysts\n\n11. Spirit AeroSystems Holdings, Inc.

        "title": "Could Apple Acquire Peloton in 2024? 2 Things Investors Should Know About the Rumors",
        "content": "Thanks to its lineup of incredibly popular hardware products, and its budding services and software offerings, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has become one of the most valuable businesses on the face of the planet. Its expertise and dominant success in the consumer-focused tech world could be beneficial when it comes to potential acquisitions.\n\nConsider Peloton Interactive (NASDAQ: PTON). This once-thriving exercise equipment and app enterprise has experienced falling demand and ongoing net losses. Maybe its turnaround plans could get a boost with some help.\n\nWith its massive financial resources, is there a possibility the iPhone maker will go out and buy the struggling fitness company? Here are two important things that investors should know about the ongoing rumors of this deal.\n\nApple is a worthy buyer\n\nApple specializes in developing beautiful hardware differentiated by its own proprietary software, which is exactly what Peloton does. The difference is that Apple has maintained lasting success in a profitable manner, thanks to an emphasis on its innovative culture, brand strength, and pricing power. Peloton wants to be just like this.\n\nWith the Watch and Fitness+, Apple already has a presence in the health space. CEO Tim Cook said in 2019 that Apple's greatest contribution to humanity \"will be about health.\" The overarching goal to improve people's lives is something Peloton shares with Apple.\n\nThis deal might make sense strategically. Apple already has over 2 billion active devices. Adding exercise equipment into high-income households would provide another avenue to collect data, and there are neat ways the two companies could find ways to integrate.\n\nFor example, Apple Music could provide all the music for Peloton's massive workout catalog. And through Apple Card, Apple could provide certain rewards or incentives to buy a piece of Peloton's hardware.\n\nApple also has the financial resources to buy Peloton with cash. In fiscal 2023, the tech enterprise produced $100 billion of free cash flow. There is more than enough cash in its coffers.\n\nStory continues\n\nPeloton would barely move the needle\n\nNow that we've looked at all the compelling reasons that demonstrate why Apple would be a no-brainer buyer for Peloton, let's consider why I don't see this deal happening anytime soon.\n\nFor starters, Apple isn't known for a corporate strategy that favors sizable acquisitions. Its largest purchase occurred in 2014 when it bought Beats for $3 billion. At a meaningful premium to Peloton's current market cap of $2.1 billion, a possible takeover would still be in the ballpark as one of Apple's biggest. I don't know if management is trying to do this.\n\nApple generated $383 billion of revenue in fiscal 2023 (ended Sept. 30). In its fiscal 2023 (ended June 30), Peloton registered sales of $2.8 billion. Even if the exercise company saw its revenue surge under Apple, it still might simply be too small an opportunity.\n\nOn the one hand, if this deal did happen, but ended up not working out, the purchase price would be a rounding error for Apple, and shareholders would likely shrug it off. At least executives would have tried something that made strategic sense, but just wasn't in the cards.\n\nBut let's say this transaction became a reality, and Peloton was successfully integrated into Apple's operations, with a return to growth and profitability for the fitness business. It still wouldn't move the needle for the tech giant.\n\nApple basically has the entire global population as its addressable market. Those who are interested in spending a four-figure sum to buy exercise equipment are a tiny fraction of this. Nonetheless, should this deal ever be on the table, it would undoubtedly benefit Peloton much more than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Apple wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 5 Stocks.\n\nAfter recommending investors to go easy on mega-cap tech stocks and take some profits on them during the start of 2024, Jim Cramer is back to praising the strengths and resilience of these companies after major technology stocks part of the Magnificent Seven group started posting earnings. Cramer recently said in a program on CNBC that we have reached a strange \"confluence of events\" that makes it hard to \"value anything.\" Cramer praised strong earnings reports from Apple, Microsoft, Meta and Amazon. Cramer advised investors not to worry about high valuations of these companies and said it does not make sense to sell these stocks just because these companies are \"big.\" Cramer said these major technology companies have not \"fooled\" their way to such high valuations and there was nowhere else to go for these stocks \"but up.\"\n\nCramer's Thoughts on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nJim Cramer's message to market skeptics who believe tech stocks are headed for a crash is this: \"enough already!\"\n\nCramer said Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) generated about $330 billion in collective revenue and about $58.5 billion in collective profits in the recently reported quarter. Cramer said it would not make sense to compare these companies with those that collapsed during the dot com bubble\n\nOn a side note, Cramer shrugged off China fears and recommended investors to \"own\" Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares and not trade it.\n\nCramer Says Tesla Does Not Deserve to Be in the Magnificent Seven Group\n\nCramer yet again criticized the market's fears around concentration of the broader stock market gains in a handful of companies also known as the Magnificent Seven group of stocks. Cramer said it does not make sense to worry about market gains of major companies and compare them to smaller companies. Cramer, however, was clear about Tesla as he believes the company no longer deserves to be in the Magnificent Seven group. Cramer said Tesla's exit from the Mag. Seven group of stocks was made easier by the judge who recently rejected Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite this bullish outlook on tech stocks, there are some companies Jim Cramer is bearish on. In this article we decided to talk about those stocks. Jim Cramer is Bearish on These 12 Stocks\n\nFor this article we saw several latest programs of Jim Cramer and picked 12 stocks he's bearish on.

Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 7\n\nJim Cramer, when asked about Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) in a recent program, said he does not know \"what mortgages they have\" and therefore cannot recommend the stock.\n\n\"And I suggest you do not own it.\"\n\nOver the past one year Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR) shares have declined by 41%.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, seven hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in Invesco Mortgage Capital Inc (NYSE:IVR).

US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 20\n\nJim Cramer's reply was a resounding \"No\" when he was asked about US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA) during his program a few days ago.\n\nCramer said that you can't own this stock in this state (New Jersey).\n\nThe stock has declined by about 12% over the past one year.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter of 2023, 20 hedge funds out of the 910 funds tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in US Silica Holdings Inc (NYSE:SLCA).

Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 26\n\nJim Cramer is highly bearish on Plug Power Inc (NASDAQ:PLUG).

GAAP net loss for the third quarter was $61.2 million compared to a GAAP net income of $119.5 million in the previous quarter and GAAP net income of $24.7 million in the same quarter last year. Our non-GAAP net loss was $31 million compared to a non-GAAP net income of $157.4 million in the previous quarter, and a non-GAAP net income of $54.1 million in the same quarter last year.

Non-GAAP net diluted loss per share was $0.55 compared to a non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $2.62 in the previous quarter, and non-GAAP net diluted earnings per share of $0.91 in the same quarter last year.\n\nAs mentioned by Zvi, we expect that the stabilized solar revenue levels after the inventory correction has run its course will be approximately $600 million to $700 million quarterly. Under this scenario, corporate non-GAAP gross margins are targeted to be 30% to 32%, including approximately 500 basis points of benefits from IRA manufacturing tax credit and operating profit margins are targeted to be at 11% to 14% after implementing cost reduction activities. I reiterate that this scenario is based on no improvement in demand from our third quarter sell through levels and assumes no incremental revenues or margin from new products. Turning now to the balance sheet. As of September 30, 2023, cash, cash equivalents, bank deposits, restricted bank deposits and investments were $1.5 billion.\"\n\nRead the entire earnings call transcript here.\n\nClearBridge Select Strategy made the following comment about SolarEdge Technologies, Inc.

        "title": "Tech: Is Meta truly the 'Patek Philippe of the internet'?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) and Amazon (AMZN) shares move higher after both tech players posted positive earnings results on Thursday. Bernstein Internet Research Analyst Mark Shmulik joins Yahoo Finance Live to break down the biggest Big Tech drivers for earnings season thus far, particularly Meta's outlook.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, shares of Meta and Amazon are extending gains today, hitting new highs in the session as investors cheer on their latest quarterly results. The strength in the fourth quarter driven largely by a rebound in digital ad sales. Amazon saw a 27% jump year on year, while Meta more than tripled overall sales from the same period last year with a big chunk of that coming through from ads.\n\nJoining us now is Mark Shmulik, Bernstein internet research analyst. Mark, you know so much of this is about setting expectations. Certainly, investors liked what they saw yesterday after the bell. How do you sort of put these names that we've seen this week side by side to see why these particular names are being rewarded in such a big way today?\n\nMARK SHMULIK: Yeah. Look, you've certainly seen divergence this quarter starting with Meta well at the top. Amazon certainly up quite a bit. Google was down by a similar amount that Amazon was up and of course, some of the others.\n\nAnd I think the biggest reason for that is going into this year after the big year the Magnificent Seven have had last year, there wasn't a lot of like really great conviction about really good ideas of what do you own in internet and tech. And I think those companies that put up the numbers where it mattered most and kind of calmed the biggest fears or worries about specific names performed the best. Meta, the biggest question heading in to 2024 was do you really want to own Meta into a decelerating revenue growth environment? Can we really trust them to keep their costs in check? And then they put out a monster guidance to suggest that the question we should be asking is, how long can they keep this up?\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd with Amazon there was certainly a lot of excitement and a lot of optimism that 2024 was going to be the year they're going to finally deliver that operating income inflection, you know, we've long held out hope for and that's exactly what they did. They put out a very, very strong beat on operating income for the fourth quarter. Their comments suggested that that operating income growth is durable you know and it's showing up in the guidance for Q1. And this is exactly what investors want to see right now.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: And Mark, you called Meta, especially for that quarter, the Patek Philippe of internet. Now, that's a pretty big statement to make given especially when you think about the price and the significance of Patek Philippe and their watches. Talk about what you're looking at there that sets Meta apart and what is going to keep them having that edge, as you mentioned. If they're going to be on top, what's going to keep them there?\n\nMARK SHMULIK: Yes, as a watch aficionado still not wearing any watches. But you know, I think what stood out why I called it the Patek Philippe is really a couple of reasons, right? The famous Patek kind of slogan is you never really own one, you just hang on to it for a generation, you know. And the biggest complaint about longer-term investors with Facebook and now Meta has been there's always this view that there's an expiration date to social media.\n\nAnd I think the more important thing I took away from this earnings was not the revenue beat and kind of guidance for 2024. That's great. You do need a strong core. But what they really showed is the longevity of this business, this vision you know that Mark has that we've all questioned at some points in the past.\n\nThe adjacencies are there. Threads usage is up, you know. Reels usage is up. WhatsApp is growing in the United States.\n\nWe've got north of 3 billion users. And Facebook Blue is still growing in the US. This isn't going anywhere. And longer term, all the investments in AI and the Metaverse, whether you believe in it or not, there's a pathway that this company is going to find a way to be around forever. And so just like Patek, my comment here is you can own Meta's stock and you can hand it down to your kids.",

        "title": "Apple Vision Pro 'taking us way out into the future': Analyst",
        "content": "Apple's (AAPL) highly-anticipated Vision Pro headset finally hit store shelves. It came a day after the tech giant reported first quarter results that underwhelmed investors.\n\nD.A. Davidson Managing Director Gil Luria says the Vision Pro \"changes perceptions about Apple's ability to innovate,\" an issue that has arisen given the company hasn't launched a new product category for a few years. Luria thinks the device \"will change how we do computing\" and that \"it's Apple taking us way out into the future.\" Luria also explains that future devices will likely resemble glasses more than the large headsets consumers are contending with today.\n\nIn the earnings report, one sore spot for investors was Apple's China sales. On that point, Luria says there is \"very little visibility\" into China sales, describing the outlook as \"murky.\" Luria argues there are a lot of factors that figure into Apple's business in China including the country's weakening economy, the competitive handset market, and a government that can be protectionist.\n\nWatch the video above to hear what Luria has to say about advancements with the iPhone and how Apple may use generative AI.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Stephanie Mikulich\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Apple's Vision Pro hitting shelves today with CEO, Tim Cook, marking the launch at the company's flagship store right here in New York City on Fifth Avenue. It is Apple's first major new category since 2015, with a price tag of nearly $3,500. This coming on the heels of earnings, of course, last night, but the stock has been edging lower, really bouncing around due to weakness in China. It is well off its lows of the day. Let's bring in Gil Luria, DA Davidson managing director, to talk more about this. Hey, Gil. Good to see you.\n\nGIL LURIA: Good to see you.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Let's start with the Vision Pro and then we can broaden it out to the earnings. $3,500, cool product by most of the reviewers, that's what they're saying. What does this-- what does the Vision Pro do for Apple?\n\nStory continues\n\nGIL LURIA: Well, the first thing it does is it changes perceptions about Apple's ability to innovate. We haven't had a new product category in a while and this is a very big, new innovation. It will change how we do computing. Spatial computing is very different than how we do it now, how we interact with applications, how we would view what we're seeing, where the battery is, where the display is. So it's Apple taking us way out into the future. For now, at a price point that most folks can't afford, but will give at least some people a perspective on where things are headed, especially so developers can develop the new applications and tools that are more appropriate for spatial computing.\n\nJARED BILKRE: Gil, maybe I'm just reading into this personally, but I see the pictures with Tim Cook and the new headset on. He doesn't look the happiest. And you know, I go back, Jony Ive, was really never into AR and VR. I'm not sure he would have endorsed this. In fact, he left Apple before this was really developed. I'm just wondering if there's something there. If you think people inside Apple are really gung-ho about this.\n\nGIL LURIA: Well, again, the point is, this isn't what we're going to have on our head in five years. Nobody is going to have this heavy, clunky device that has an external battery and weighs a pound, and has multiple straps that needs to be adjusted. That's not what it's going to look like in five years. In five years, it's just going to be glasses. We're just going to have glasses that we can see our surroundings, we can see multiple screens, and multiple applications at once, and that's how we're going to use this device. It's not going to look like the big ski goggles that they are today.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Gil, can we assume even as this spatial computing innovation is happening, that like the iPhone is kind innovated out, right? It's got like the-- are we going to see any more leaps of innovation in smartphones, or, with the existing technologies, of pretty much as far as it's going to go?\n\nGIL LURIA: Well, I think there's a few more opportunities for innovation. So phones can still get lighter, thinner, maybe transparent, some other handset makers make them foldable. But what would really look out for is Apple is going to introduce new generative AI capabilities, most likely in the June WWDC event and they might tie it to the next iPhone cycle.\n\nSo they may make the iPhone 16 be the only handset that can run these types of applications. And if that's the case, we'll have a major upgrade cycle. The last time we had a major upgrade cycle was the iPhone 12, that was the first phone that was capable of getting on a 5G network. If they make a phone that's the first and only phone that can operate something that consumers want, such as generative capabilities, that may drive another upgrade cycle.\n\nJARED BILKRE: I've got to ask you about China because that has been a sore spot, not only for Apple, but for the entire exporting world for that matter. What do you think the future is for Apple, specifically in China?\n\nGIL LURIA: We have very little visibility, the outlook is murky because there's so many factors that contribute to performance in China. First and foremost, the Chinese consumer, the economy there is weak, the market's weak, the real estate markets weak, the sources of wealth are dissipating for that high end Chinese consumer. Then you have-- it's the most competitive handset market with a local incumbent that is very price competitive, but also has some rich features that they're introducing.\n\nAnd then finally, you have the government deciding how protectionist they want to be. There's reports out of China that they're not allowing government backed agencies, for people that work in those types of agencies, to have iPhones. Possibly, as a retaliation around our measures in limiting AI chips. Possibly, as part of a bigger political statement. Either way, those are things that are going to be very hard for Apple to predict. It's going to continue to be in that market. In fact, they had the highest share in China last year still with all of this, but it's going to be very hard to predict what's going to happen to that going forward.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Gil, you mentioned AI in passing, right? And Tim Cook sort of teased that something is coming from the company on the AI front. I mean, Apple does tend to leak a little bit. Maybe we'll get a little more insight into what it might be. But I mean, do you have any theories? And I guess, three-part question. Do you have any theories? When do you think we'll learn more? And what is that going to do for Apple?\n\nGIL LURIA: Well, so it's usually not Apple that's leaking, it's their-- they have such a broad supply chain that just-- that somebody, somewhere, a vendor of Apples is usually the person who's leaking it. Apple actually tries really hard not to front run its product, just so-- because there's so much speculation. And that's what they're doing here. All we know for now is that there are uses of AI already. When we use our text to-- and they autocomplete a text, that's the use of AI.\n\nYou could expect that to expand from there. But based on the resources they have and the attention they're focused on, and how important it is for their future, I would expect some things that we're not thinking about yet to come out later this year, to make the experience better, to help us summarize experiences, pre-populate messages, and possibly help more with translation, either to language or to programming, or to application maneuvering. There's a lot of things they can do. And again, they have so many resources, so many smart people working in Cupertino, that I would expect them to do something that will impress us.\n\nJULIE HYMAN: Gil, thanks so much. Appreciate it.\n\nGIL LURIA: Thank you.",

        "title": "Analysis-Vision Pro headset is Apple's next Mac and TV combined",
        "content": "By Stephen Nellis and Dawn Chmielewski\n\n(Reuters) - Apple's Vision Pro could upend how people watch television at home and how they use computers at work, potentially positioning the headset to be a successor to both traditional television and the Mac.\n\nThe $3,500 headset, which blends three-dimensional digital content with a view of the outside world, landed in the company’s physical U.S. stores on Friday. It enters a market crowded with lower-cost rivals from Meta Platforms, HTC and others that have mostly been confined to the video game market and failed to find a mass audience.\n\nBut Apple's pricey device comes with custom computing chips and difficult-to-manufacture displays that rivals lack. Analysts who have tried the headset say these features could make the device a threat to almost every large two-dimensional screen at home or work.\n\nWalt Disney has quietly worked with Apple for years on an app for the Vision Pro's launch, the latest in a history of collaboration between the two companies.\n\n“When we saw this, it became evident it was a new canvas for how we can tell stories in a way that hasn't been done before,” said Aaron LaBerge, chief technology officer of Disney Entertainment. “And so it became pretty obvious that we wanted to do something here just as a way to stretch ourselves.”\n\nThe Disney+ app envelops movie viewers in one of four environments, so they can watch “Star Wars: The Force Awakens,” from the seat of a fictional X-34 landspeeder craft on the planet of Tatooine, like a futuristic drive-in movie theater, or catch “Avengers: Endgame” from inside Avengers Tower in midtown Manhattan. Viewers can also watch 42 Disney films in 3D, including box office hits “Avatar: The Way of Water,” “Black Panther” and “Inside Out.”\n\nJamie Voris, chief technology officer at Walt Disney Studios, said filmmakers such as “The Lion King” director Jon Favreau and James Cameron of \"Avatar\" are interested in telling stories in new ways. Disney has built an experience it teased in a clip screened at Apple’s Worldwide Developer Conference last June, in which consumers interact with its Marvel Studios animated anthology series, “What If?”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe device also opens new ways to experience live sporting events or theme park rides, Voris said.\n\n“It speaks really well to what we do best, which is bring our characters and stories into the real world and bring you closer to the people that you care about,” said Voris.\n\nIt’s not clear that a mixed-reality device was what late Apple co-founder Steve Jobs had in mind when he confided to biographer Walter Isaacson that, in developing a next-generation television, “I finally cracked it.” But to analysts like Ben Bajarin of Creative Strategies, the Vision Pro seemed like it fulfilled that long-ago promise.\n\n\"I don't know if this is what Jobs meant when he said 'I cracked TV,'\" said Bajarin. \"But the platform element is what makes it more interesting than if they launched a TV. It can be productivity. It can be social. ... It could become a much bigger deal and a much bigger opportunity than if it were just a TV.\"\n\nTo be sure, the pricey Vision Pro will not be a quick best-seller. In a note to investors, Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi said Apple has told its supply chain to expect to build only 1 million units - and even that might be Apple preparing excess capacity ahead of consumer demand.\n\nApple’s approach “suggests a lack of confidence that consumers will feel compelled to buy immediately without needing to be convinced by in-store demos,” Sacconaghi wrote.\n\nBut the high price presents less of a barrier to business purchasers.\n\nJay Wright, chief executive of Campfire, a startup that makes software for using headsets to collaborate remotely on three-dimensional files such as engine designs, noted that the original Mac computer in 1984 cost the equivalent of nearly $7,500 today. But small businesses flocked to the Mac for its ability to create and print documents and brochures.\n\n“It's important to recognize this is not a consumer accessory device, like Apple Watch. This is a whole new computing platform,” Wright said. “I'm of the opinion that this is more like what comes after the Mac than what comes after the iPhone.”\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Nellis in San Francisco and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Peter Henderson and Lisa Shumaker)",

        "title": "Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "content": "Apple Inc's robust financial performance with a significant increase in net income. Continued dominance in the smartphone market with the iPhone as a key revenue driver. Expansion in services and wearables presenting new growth avenues. Challenges from global economic uncertainties and competitive pressures.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), a global leader in technology, released its 10-Q filing on February 2, 2024, revealing the company's financial performance for the quarter ended December 30, 2023. The filing indicates a solid financial position, with net sales amounting to $119.575 billion, a slight increase from the previous year's $117.154 billion. The company's net income saw a notable rise to $33.916 billion from $29.998 billion, showcasing Apple's ability to maintain profitability amidst a competitive landscape. This SWOT analysis delves into the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats as disclosed in the recent SEC filing, providing investors with a comprehensive understanding of Apple Inc's strategic positioning.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Signs with CHTR. Decoding Apple Inc (AAPL): A Strategic SWOT Insight\n\nStrengths\n\nFinancial Resilience and Product Dominance: Apple's financial health remains robust, with an increase in net income to $33.916 billion, up from $29.998 billion in the previous year. This financial resilience is underpinned by the iPhone's continued dominance in the market, contributing significantly to the company's revenue. Apple's ability to maintain high-profit margins, particularly in its services segment, which saw an 11% increase in net sales, further solidifies its financial strength. The company's diversified product portfolio, including the Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch, complements the iPhone ecosystem, creating a comprehensive suite of products that drive customer loyalty and recurring revenue.\n\nInnovation and Brand Equity: Apple's commitment to research and development, with expenses maintained at $7.696 billion, underscores its focus on innovation. The company's brand is synonymous with quality and innovation, which is reflected in its strong gross margin of $54.855 billion. Apple's brand equity is a competitive advantage that allows it to command premium pricing and maintain a loyal customer base. The introduction of new products, such as the updated MacBook Pro and iMac, demonstrates Apple's continuous effort to innovate and meet consumer demands.\n\nStory continues\n\nWeaknesses\n\nDependence on Key Products: Despite its financial success, Apple's heavy reliance on the iPhone, which accounts for a significant portion of its revenue, poses a risk. Any disruption in the iPhone's market appeal or supply chain could have a substantial impact on the company's overall performance. Additionally, the decrease in iPad sales by 25% indicates potential vulnerabilities in Apple's product mix that need to be addressed to ensure sustained growth.\n\nSupply Chain and Geopolitical Risks: Apple's supply chain is complex and global, with significant exposure to geopolitical risks and trade tensions, particularly in Greater China, where net sales decreased by 13%. The company's reliance on outsourcing partners and individual suppliers for components and manufacturing also presents operational risks that could affect its ability to deliver products efficiently and cost-effectively.\n\nOpportunities\n\nServices and Wearables Expansion: The growth in Apple's services and wearables segments presents significant opportunities. With an 11% increase in services net sales, Apple is well-positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for digital content, cloud services, and subscription-based models. The wearables market also offers potential for expansion, despite a decrease in sales, as consumer interest in health and fitness technology continues to rise.\n\nInternational Markets and New Technologies: Apple's performance in international markets, such as a 15% increase in Japan net sales, highlights the opportunity for further geographic expansion. Additionally, the company's investments in new technologies, such as augmented reality and artificial intelligence, could open up new revenue streams and strengthen its competitive position in the long term.\n\nThreats\n\nCompetitive Pressure and Market Saturation: The technology industry is highly competitive, with rapid innovation and changing consumer preferences. Apple faces intense competition from other smartphone and technology manufacturers, which could erode its market share and pressure margins. Market saturation, particularly in mature markets, poses a challenge to growth, as most consumers already own smartphones and upgrade cycles lengthen.\n\nEconomic Uncertainties and Regulatory Changes: Global economic uncertainties, including inflation and currency fluctuations, can impact consumer spending and Apple's international sales. Regulatory changes, such as those related to privacy and antitrust concerns, could also force Apple to alter its business practices, potentially affecting its profitability and strategic direction.\n\nIn conclusion, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) exhibits a strong financial foundation and brand equity, driven by its flagship iPhone and a growing services segment. However, the company must navigate challenges such as product dependence, supply chain complexities, and competitive pressures. Opportunities for expansion in services, wearables, and international markets are countered by threats from market saturation and regulatory changes. Apple's strategic focus on innovation and customer experience positions it to leverage its strengths and opportunities while addressing its weaknesses and threats in the dynamic tech landscape.\n\nThis article, generated by GuruFocus, is designed to provide general insights and is not tailored financial advice.

        "content": "YouTube’s global head of music Lyor Cohen celebrates YouTube’s subscription milestone on Feb. 1. Johnny Nunez/Getty Images for City of Hope\n\nThis week in tech earnings showed some bright spots in video and music streaming at Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Alphabet (GOOGL). All three companies saw subscription and advertising revenue grow significantly in the December quarter and credited the success to their respective video and music streaming platforms.\n\nApple: Services unit, including Apple TV+, has 1 billion subscribers\n\nOn the Apple earnings call yesterday (Feb. 1), Apple’s services unit, which includes Apple TV+ and Apple Music, was a central topic of discussion. Martin Scorsese’s Killers of the Flower Moon, produced by Apple Studios, got a mention from CEO Tim Cook, who noted the movie’s 200-plus accolades, including 10 Oscar nominations this year, are growing Apple’s awards portfolio. “Across all Apple TV+ productions, we’ve now earned 2,050 award nominations and 450 wins since we’ve introduced the service,” Cook said.\n\nApple’s services unit passed 1 billion paid subscribers at the end of 2023 and brought in $23.1 billion in quarterly revenue, an 11 percent jump from the previous year. Apple’s chief financial officer Luca Maestri expects another double-digit growth in the current quarter. “Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business,” Maestri said on the earnings call. “And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.”\n\nAmazon: Prime, including Prime Video, has 200 million subscribers\n\nAmazon’s advertising services revenue jumped 27 percent in the December quarter to $14.7 billion. Revenue from subscriptions to digital products like music, games and books rose 14 percent to $10.5 billion. Though user reaction to Amazon bringing ads on Prime Video (which made an ad-free subscription more expensive) has been mixed, the company seems optimistic that the ad-tier plans will bring in more users.\n\n“We are looking for ways to increase our advertising in our streaming properties, including Fire TV…and Prime Video, but also things like Freevee and Twitch,” Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky said yesterday’s earnings call.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet: YouTube Premium and Music have 100 million subscribers\n\nOver the last few years, Alphabet has been more open about disclosing financial details at YouTube. In its quarterly report on Jan. 30, Alphabet disclosed YouTube’s paid subscriber number for the first time. The video platform had more than 100 million subscribers (including non-paying trial subscribers) at the end of 2023. On the earnings call, Alphabet and Google (GOOGL) CEO Sundar Pichai said YouTube is the main driver of the company’s subscription revenue.\n\nLyor Cohen, the head of music at YouTube and Google, touted some of the steps Alphabet has taken to grow its subscription business, crediting early access to A.I. tools and generative A.I. music covers as some of the factors. “From leveraging A.I. to enhance creative imagination to seamlessly bridging short-form and long-form content for maximum artist exposure, we can forge a future together where the music industry thrives,” Cohen said in a blog post yesterday.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning A Guide to 'Anatomy of a Fall': Plot, Characters, Awards Chances and More 'Kingsman' Director Matthew Vaughn Assembles Cast for New Spy Thriller Rare Photo of the Elon Musk's $50,000 Tiny Home Shared By Biographer\n\nRead the original story Where Apple, Amazon and YouTube Parent Alphabet Stand In the Streaming War and others by Nhari Djan at Observer.",

        "title": "Big Tech Earnings Recap: The Numbers and What CEOs Are Saying About 2024",
        "content": "Big Tech companies closed 2023 with a blowout quarter. Getty Images/Observer\n\nThis week, five of the stock market’s “Magnificent Seven”—Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN) and Meta (META)—reported financial results for the last quarter of 2023. Big Tech companies closed a year full of bold headlines: Alphabet’s YouTube reached 100 million subscribers; Microsoft launched a suite of A.I. products and finalized its acquisition of gaming behemoth Activision Blizzard; Apple debuted the iPhone 15 and released its Vision Pro VR headset (It’s available in stores today (Feb. 2)); Meta began paying its first ever cash dividend; and Amazon further expanded its e-commerce offerings and upped its game in video streaming.\n\nHere is a recap of Big Tech’s overall blowout Q4 and what their CEOs said on earnings calls.\n\nAlphabet\n\nQuarterly revenue: $86.3 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago Net income: $20.69 billion, or $1.64 per share Advertising revenue: $65.52 billion\n\nGoogle (GOOGL)’s ad revenue for the December quarter included $48 billion from Google Search and approximately $9.2 billion from YouTube. On a call with analysts on Jan. 30, CEO Sundar Pichai touted the rapid growth of YouTube, calling it a “key driver of our subscription revenue.”\n\nThe tech giant also reported the first time that YouTube had more than 100 million paid subscribers at the end of 2023. The video platform plowed in as much revenue as Google’s cloud business, which also saw strong growth in the fourth quarter.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nQuarterly revenue: $62 billion, up 18 percent from a year ago Net income: $21.9 billion, or $2.93 per share Cloud revenue: $33 billion, up 24 percent from a year ago\n\nMicrosoft drew headlines throughout 2023 for its many initiatives, from deepened collaboration with OpenAI to legal progress in its $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard.\n\nOn the earnings call on Jan. 30, CEO Satya Nadella emphasized the company’s transition from experimenting with A.I. to applying the technology at scale, with A.I. capabilities being integrated across Microsoft’s product offerings, from Microsoft Copilot to Azure AI to GitHub Copilot, the popular A.I. developer tool.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We’re using this A.I. inflection point to redefine our role in business applications,” Nadella told analysts.\n\nApple\n\nQuarterly revenue: $119.6 billion, up 2 percent from a year ago Net income: $33.9 billion, or $2.18 per share iPhone revenue: $69.7 billion, up 6 percent from a year ago\n\niPhones continued to dominate Apple’s revenue makeup, accounting for roughly 60 percent of its Q4 sales. The Mac segment generated $7.8 billion in revenue, returning to growth, while iPad revenue fell 25 percent from the previous year to $7 billion. The sharp decline was in part due to Apple’s lack of new iPad models in 2023.\n\nApple’s revenue in the “Wearables, Home, and Accessories” business fell 11 percent year-over-year to $12 billion. This decline was offset by a 11 percent growth in the “Services” unit, which includes Apple TV+, Apple News+ and Apple One bundles. The unit reported $23.1 billion in revenue in the December quarter, a record high.\n\nApple reported earnings a day before its Vision Pro headset arrived in stores in the U.S. On yesterday’s earnings call, CEO Tim Cook called the Vision Pro “the most advanced personal electronics device ever. We can’t wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.”\n\nAmazon\n\nQuarterly revenue: $169.9 billion, up 14 percent from a year ago Net income: $10.6 billion, or $1.00 per share e-Commerce revenue: $70.54 billion, up 8 percent from a year ago AWS revenue: $24.2 billion, up 13 percent from a year ago\n\nAmazon saw record user acitivites during last quarter’s Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping events, where customers purchased over 1 billion items on Amazon globally. In the U.S., over 500 million items were ordered from independent sellers, attracting millions of new Prime memberships. Throughout 2023, Amazon provided its fastest-ever global delivery to Prime members, delivering over 7 billion units the same or the next day.\n\n“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023,” CEO Andy Jassy said on the earnings call yesterday.\n\nAmazon plans to increase capital expenditures in 2024, particularly in expanding its A.I. efforts. The company just launched Rufus, an A.I.-powered shopping assistant. In addition, its recent move to display ads on Prime Video aims to leverage Amazon’s massive audience for advertising expansion. In the fourth quarter, Amazon generated $14.7 billion in ad revenue, up 26.7 percent from a year ago.\n\nMeta\n\nQuarterly revenue: $40.1 billion, up 25 percent from a year ago Net income: $14 billion, or $5.33 per share (up 300 percent from a year ago)\n\nMeta tripled profits in the December quarter, in part thanks to aggressive cost-cutting in the previous months. The tech giant also announced its inaugural cash dividend of $0.50 per share during the earnings call yesterday.\n\nMeta’s family of social media apps, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp, had 3.19 billion daily active users at the end of 2023. Threads, Meta’s answer to Elon Musk’s X, had 130 million monthly active users at the end of last year. CFO Susan Li said on the earnings call Meta would no longer report Facebook-specific numbers, suggesting a shift away from its legacy social media platforms. Altogether, revenue from the total family of apps came at $39 billion during the quarter, a 24 percent increase from the previous year.\n\nLooking into 2024, CEO Mark Zuckerberg promised significant investments in A.I. for foundational research and product development, expecting capital expenditures to be between $30 billion and $37 billion this year. “Moving forward, a major goal will be building the most popular and most advanced A.I. products and services,” Zuckerberg said on yesterday’s earnings call.\n\nTrending Observer Stories\n\nMrBeast's First X Video Raises More Questions Than Answers About X's Creator Program 'Poor Things': See It And Hate Yourself in the Morning A Guide to 'Anatomy of a Fall': Plot, Characters, Awards Chances and More 'Kingsman' Director Matthew Vaughn Assembles Cast for New Spy Thriller Rare Photo of the Elon Musk's $50,000 Tiny Home Shared By Biographer\n\nRead the original story Big Tech Earnings Recap: The Numbers and What CEOs Are Saying About 2024 and others by Shreyas Sinha at Observer.",

        "title": "Apple’s Vision Pro lands as the company faces threats from all sides",
        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) Vision Pro officially hit the market on Friday, marking the most significant product launch for the company since the Apple Watch back in 2015. But the enthusiasm for the company’s most ambitious product in years was tempered on Wall Street after Apple reported a slowdown in China sales during its fiscal first quarter.\n\nThe Vision Pro is, as Apple calls it, a spatial computer. But for the average person, it’s a high-powered AR/VR headset.\n\nI originally used the Vision Pro after Apple debuted it during its WWDC event in June 2023, and again just before its Feb. 2 launch. And yes, it’s every bit as impressive as you’ve heard.\n\nBut a lot is riding on the Vision Pro’s long-term success as Apple looks for its next major product platform. And with storm clouds swirling above Apple’s Cupertino headquarters, the company needs a win more than ever.\n\nApple’s rough start to 2024\n\nApple has been dealing with an array of difficulties throughout the first few weeks of the year, and it’s not looking any brighter going into February. But the most pressing issue the company is facing at the moment is a slowdown in sales in Greater China.\n\nApple’s third-largest market behind North America and Europe, China has been a key catalyst in Apple’s growth story over the years as the country’s expanding middle class and a surge in smartphone sales provided fertile ground for the iPhone’s popularity to take off in the region.\n\nAccording to Counterpoint Research, Apple was still the bestselling smartphone brand in China in Q4 2023, capturing 20% of the market compared to local rivals Xiaomi, Huawei, and Honor, which took 16%, 15.2%, and 15.1%, respectively. But Huawei saw its year-over-year market share jump 71.1% from the year prior thanks to its new 5G smartphones, while Apple’s fell 9%.\n\nThat, coupled with China’s lumbering economy, meant that Apple’s overall Greater China revenue declined from $23.9 billion in Q4 2022 to $20.8 billion in Q4 2023.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to UBS analyst David Vogt, if Apple’s market share decline is permanent and the smartphone market grows a predicted 3% in 2024, “lost share in China could pressure iPhone revenue by slightly more than $7B, a 3.5% iPhone revenue headwind and ~1.9% total company headwind.”\n\nRegulatory headwinds abound\n\nApple also finds itself in a tangle of regulatory problems in the European Union as it works to navigate the bloc’s Digital Markets Act (DMA). Set to go into effect this year, the DMA ensures large tech companies don’t have too much power over the broader tech ecosystem. So far, Apple has announced that it will open up its platform, allowing users in the region to install third-party app stores and giving app developers the option to offer users third-party payment options beyond Apple’s in-app payment system. Bryan Chiang tries out an Apple Vision Pro headset during the first day of sales at a Palo Alto, Calif., Apple store on Friday, Feb. 2, 2024. (Noah Berger/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut there’s a catch. If developers decide to use outside payment options, they’ll still have to fork over cash to Apple. The tech giant, however, says the charge, which amounts to a 50 euro cent fee, only applies to developers whose apps are downloaded more than 1 million times in a year. After that they’ll need to pay that charge for each subsequent download.\n\nCritics, including Spotify CEO Daniel Ek and Epic CEO Tim Sweeney, have struck back at Apple with Ek calling the new rule “hostile” and Sweeney saying it’s a “devious new instance of Malicious Compliance.” The EU still has to determine if Apple’s new rules comply with the DMA.\n\nIn the US, meanwhile, Apple is staring down a potential Department of Justice antitrust lawsuit. According to the New York Times, the DOJ is looking into how Apple controls its hardware and software as a means of keeping consumers locked into its ecosystem and fighting off competitors. While any lawsuit could potentially take years to wind its way through the legal system it could distract the company at a time when it’s seeking to push into a new product category.\n\nHere comes the Vision Pro\n\nThe Vision Pro serves as Apple’s next-generation computing platform. At $3,499 it’s not exactly priced to move for the typical consumer, but that doesn’t minimize its importance for the company.\n\nAfter years of development, the headset can’t fail. And while I’ve only been able to use it briefly across two separate roughly 30-minute sessions, it’s hard to imagine a competitor matching what Apple has to offer anytime soon. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nThe display is the sharpest I’ve seen on an AR/VR headset, the fit is comfortable, and the interface is incredibly easy to navigate. Apple boasts an enormous library of apps for the Vision Pro, though there are notable big names missing, including Netflix and YouTube.\n\nThere’s also the fact that the Vision Pro is powered by an external battery that Apple says gets two hours of battery life, which could be a turnoff for some users.\n\nI’ll dive deeper into what it’s like to use the Vision Pro when I get my hands on one for an extended period, but it’s safe to say Apple has created an incredible piece of technology. Now it needs to sell the general public on it.\n\nJust add that to the list of challenges the company will have to overcome in the year ahead.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - A federal judge on Friday said tens of millions of Apple customers can pursue a class action accusing the company of monopolizing the market for iPhone apps by banning purchases outside its App Store, leading to higher prices.\n\nU.S. District Judge Yvonne Gonzalez Rogers had in March 2022 refused to certify a class action, but changed her mind after the class was narrowed to include only Apple account holders who spent $10 or more on app or in-app content.\n\nWhile remaining \"concerned\" that the narrowed class might include more than 10 million accounts that suffered no harm, or 7.9% of the total, Rogers said that number could be reduced and there was no fixed \"cutoff\" for denying certification.\n\nThe Oakland, California-based judge also rejected Apple's bid to exclude testimony it considered unreliable from two expert witnesses, including Nobel Prize-winning economist Daniel McFadden, about how it may have harmed consumers.\n\nApple, based in Cupertino, California, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMark Rifkin, a lawyer for the consumers, said he was \"extremely pleased\" and looked forward to the next phase of the 12-year-old antitrust case. He estimated that the class incurred \"billions of dollars in damages.\"\n\nClass actions can result in greater recoveries at less cost than if plaintiffs are forced to sue individually.\n\nRogers has also overseen \"Fortnite\" videogame creator Epic Games' antitrust case against Apple.\n\nIn Sept. 2021 she ordered Apple to loosen restrictions on where developers can seek payment from customers for their apps, but stopped short of requiring Apple to allow downloads to iPhones outside its App Store.\n\nA federal appeals court upheld much of that ruling in April 2023, and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to get involved last month.\n\nThe case is In re Apple iPhone Antitrust Litigation, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 11-06714.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Sandra Maler)",

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) stock rocketed higher on Friday, climbing more than 20% after the company posted better-than-expected earnings and guidance and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nWith Friday's rally, the company added nearly $200 billion to its market cap, a stock market record, according to Bloomberg data. Meta shares were trading around $475 on Friday; at its lows in 2022, the stock fell to as low as $90.\n\nMeta's market cap now stands north of $1.2 trillion.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Meta Connect event at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 27, 2023. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payroll costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges, including severance and facilities consolidation, totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317, down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

        "content": "We saw a slew of earnings this week from the market’s leading stocks, and they didn’t disappoint. In addition to many other companies that reported earnings, five of the ‘Magnificent 7’ informed us of their performance.\n\nOn Tuesday, we heard from Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL, and then on Thursday afternoon from Amazon AMZN, Apple AAPL, and Meta Platforms META.\n\nAll these market leading companies have put up incredible stock performance over the last 18 months, and it looks like that trend may well continue. In this article we are going to take a look at the quarterly earnings reports, valuations, and Zacks Ranks, and attempt to identify which are the most attractive investments right now. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nEarnings Summaries\n\nMicrosoft: Q2 2024 saw Microsoft soar past expectations with 18% revenue growth and a 33% EPS jump. Their cloud product, Azure, fueled the gain with a 30% surge and doubled its AI integration showcasing commitment to the future. However, a lower-than-expected Q3 revenue forecast was a notable concern. Despite this, Microsoft remains a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) with its thriving cloud business and dedication to AI advancements.\n\nAlphabet: While Q4 2023 earnings for Alphabet topped EPS estimates by 2%, ad revenue missed expectations slightly, leading to a stock price dip despite an overall 14% YoY sales growth. Their cloud business continues to shine, but concerns linger about growth in the core advertising engine. With a Zacks Rank 3 (Hold), may be a bit less appealing based on earnings estimate trends.\n\nAmazon: Q4 2023 earnings were music to investors' ears with Amazon exceeding estimates on both revenue and EPS. Their cloud computing arm, AWS, continues to be a major growth driver, and advertising revenue also surpassed expectations. This positive report led to a stock price rise and solidified Amazon's Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nApple: Q1 2024 earnings saw Apple beat analyst expectations for both revenue and EPS. Revenue grew 2% YoY to $119.6 billion, and EPS increased 16% YoY to $2.18. While iPhone sales slightly missed expectations, Services revenue reached an all-time high, suggesting a shift towards recurring income streams. The company also achieved a record number of active devices. Apple has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) rating.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms: Q4 2023 earnings surpassed expectations, leading to a more than 20% surge in stock price. Both revenue and EPS beat analyst estimates, with revenue growing 25% YoY. The company announced its first-ever quarterly dividend and a $50 billion stock buyback, further contributing to investor excitement. Metaverse investment continues, and its profitability remains a concern for some investors. META has a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) rating.\n\nValuations\n\nThe chart below shows the forward earnings multiples of each of the stocks discussed in this article. We can see that GOOGL and META have the lowest, near 20x, and AMZN has the highest at 43.5x.\n\nAAPL and MSFT are in the middle of the pack with 28.4x and 36.2x respectively.\n\nIt is also worth noting that AMZN, META and GOOGL are all below their 10-year median valuations, while AAPL and MSFT are above them. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nConclusion\n\nI think Meta Platforms and Amazon are showing the most promise for further big moves ahead. Amazon’s development is just so impressive to me, with AWS still growing at 20%, and their new advertising business growing at 23% annually and suddenly bringing in $60 billion in sales annually.\n\nThe success in ads is even more impressive when compared to Alphabet, the leading online ad platforms, whose growth is slowing significantly.\n\nMeta Platforms too is just absolutely killing it. Even with its 250% rally in the last year and a half it still trades at a very reasonable earnings multiple. And now with its new $50 billion buyback plan, and a new dividend, it is showing a real commitment to returning cash to shareholders.\n\nAlphabet, although it has some concerning growth data regarding its ad business does continue to chug along. I don’t think it has the best growth prospects, but there is no doubting it is the cheapest of the Magnificent 7, which makes it a worthy investment consideration.\n\nApple and Microsoft are of course fantastic businesses that should be a part of any well diversified investment portfolio, but I think at this point in time are less appealing than the other three. Apple is seeing a slowdown in iPhone sales growth, and Microsoft seems to have a lot of future news priced in especially regarding its recent gains with AI. The premium valuations are a concern as well.\n\nNonetheless, this group of the world’s leading companies have shown that even at their mammoth sizes, they continue to thrive. Furthermore, they are showing that the US economy is still performing at a steady rate.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

Baird Technology Desk Sector Strategist Ted Mortonson provided insight into the results and the impacts of AI on Google and other tech companies.\n\nMortonson said, \"People are really focused on this move to generative AI and that seems to be a very big focus longer term for The Street, where Google has had basically a monopoly on search. With generative AI, you've got different players at least trying to dethrone them in some way.\"\n\nMicrosoft (00:00:52)\n\nMicrosoft's fiscal second-quarter earnings beat estimates, but Wall Street supposedly expected more from AI-driven revenue streams. Brent Bracelin, Piper Sandler Equity Research Analyst on Cloud, discussed the results and outlook for future revenues as generative AI turns roughly one-year-old in its adoption by tech giants.\n\nStory continues\n\nBracelin said, \"Generative AI is one-year-old. We're one year into this new AI cycle of Microsoft. They disclosed their AI business actually doubled sequentially. It's now a $4.4 billion run rate business in year one.\"\n\nStarbucks (00:01:10)\n\nStarbucks (SBUX) released its latest quarterly earnings with results missing revenue expectations despite growing over 8% year-over-year. In addition, the company is cutting its original full-year guidance for 2024. Starbucks CFO Rachel Ruggeri discussed the latest earnings report, what the company plans to change, and ongoing headwinds for the company.\n\nRuggeri said, \"We had a strong quarter in Q1, and it was really driven by our most loyal customers remaining engaged across the globe. And so as we think about going forward ... what we're really focused on is continuing to drive customers into our rewards program.\"\n\nBoeing (00:01:29)\n\nBoeing (BA) narrowed its fourth-quarter losses as outlined in its latest earnings results, but is withholding 2024 guidance amid questions surrounding the manufacturing of its 737 Max 9 jet series. Melius Research Managing Director of Aerospace, Defense & Space Robert Spingarn broke down the implications for Boeing.\n\nSpingarn said, \"The fact that there's no guide here isn't really a suspension so far as I can tell ... The FAA has asked for a freeze on the 737, arguably the most important product they do. And I think they're just being smart and not trying to get ahead of the regulator.\"\n\nNovo Nordisk (00:01:47)\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) reported a 36% surge in sales thanks to high demand for weight loss drugs Wegovy and Ozempic. Novo Nordisk CFO Karsten Munk Knudsen discussed the company’s results and what it has in store in the coming months.\n\nKnudsen said, \"We are really happy and very proud about the results we delivered this morning. Being able to grow the company by 36% is historic in our context and in an industrial context.\"\n\nQualcomm (00:02:08)\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) posted its first-quarter earnings results, revealing a quarterly revenue of $9.94 billion, $6.69 billion of which came from its handsets division, a 16% increase year-over-year. Qualcomm Chief Financial Officer and Chief Operating Officer Akash Palkhiwala discussed the chipmaker's performance, the current transition to AI-based tech, and China's economic environment.\n\nPalkhiwala said, \"When people buy a new phone, they're buying a more expensive phone. And so we are seeing this tremendous make shift towards more expensive devices, towards more expensive chips. And that shows up in our revenue growth.\"\n\nMeta (00:02:21)\n\nMeta Platforms outpaced Wall Street estimates for its fourth-quarter earnings, posting $40.1 billion in revenue and earnings of $5.33 per share. Seaport Global Analyst Aaron Kessler discussed Meta's earnings and its guidance around pivots into AI.\n\nKessler said, \"Obviously investors are going to like that showing continued expense discipline on their part. And so I think investors are really more focused on the guidance and the dividend for Meta.\"\n\nAmazon (00:02:36)\n\nAmazon reported its fourth-quarter earnings, beating Wall Street estimates with $170 billion in revenue versus an expected $166.2 billion. Wedbush Securities Managing Director Scott Devitt broke down the results and the performance of the online retailer's various segments and business properties.\n\nDevitt said, \"At $13.2 billion, which is what they did in the quarter, you have a trajectory that's leading the company towards kind of a 10% bogey in 2025 now, which is not something that investors were expecting.\"\n\nApple (00:02:50)\n\nApple's first-quarter earnings results blew past Wall Street estimates, posting over $119.5 billion in revenue and adjusted earnings per share of $2.18. However, net sales across Apple's categories and devices fell below expectations, particularly in its services and performance in China. Manhattan Venture Partners Head of Research Santosh Rao discussed Apple's sales miss and how Apple will proceed in generative AI investments.\n\nRao said, \"The number is a miss overall, but I think it's not a major disaster because it's all about the future here going forward, how they get the generative AI into their whole mix and all that. So there are a lot of other levers that they can pull, but at this point it is definitely a disappointment that two areas that we were concerned about did disappoint.\"",

        "title": "Apple Fans Line Up to Spend $3,499 on the Vision Pro Headset",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. faithful lined up at its US stores on Friday to pick up the first Vision Pro headsets, ushering in what the company calls “the era of spatial computing.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again Mark Zuckerberg’s Wealth Surges by $27 Billion as Meta Rallies Stock Bull Run Powers Ahead as US Economy Roars: Markets Wrap\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook appeared at Apple’s flagship Manhattan store on Fifth Avenue to commemorate the launch, greeting modest crowds. At the company’s location at the Grove shopping mall in Los Angeles, clapping Apple employees welcomed in the day’s first customers.\n\nThe Vision Pro vaults Apple into its first major new product category since 2015: a $3,499 headset that melds virtual and augmented reality. It’s been a relatively niche market until now, with Meta Platforms Inc. dominating the industry. But Apple hopes to use cutting-edge technology — and the company’s famous marketing muscle — to turn it into something bigger.\n\nAt Apple’s New York store, Cook said that customers may be most impressed by the device’s interface — what he called “the magical way you control it.” The Vision Pro relies on eye movement and hand gestures to navigate users through immersive experiences.\n\n“It works the way the mind works,” he told Bloomberg Television’s Caroline Hyde. “People put it on and they instantly know how to use it.”\n\nRead More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace Headsets\n\nThe launch was a more subdued affair than the initial rollout of the iPhone and other new devices. When Apple’s phone first went on sale in 2007, customers swarmed stores from New York to San Francisco, desperate to get their hands on one. Friday’s debut drew a relatively small mix of customers either looking to buy the device or just try it out.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, Cook compares the Vision Pro debut to the birth of Apple’s other iconic devices, including the Mac, iPod and iPhone, saying it “joins the pantheon of groundbreaking products.”\n\n“Apple Vision Pro brings together thousands of innovations to create a product that’s like nothing the world has ever seen before,” he said in a memo to staff following the launch. “It’s an extraordinary achievement, and as so many of you can attest, it has been years in the making.”\n\nThe Vision Pro has a more elaborate sales process than any previous Apple product. It includes 20- to 25-minute product demos that show 3D video and apps in mixed reality. At the company’s largest US stores, Apple rolled out circular seating arrangements and carpets to provide testers with a living room feel.\n\nThe launch followed a mixed earnings report from Apple late Thursday. Though iPhone sales were better than anticipated last quarter, the company is struggling in China. Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri also signaled that sales in the current quarter won’t be as strong as some analysts had estimated.\n\nFor now, the Vision Pro won’t be a big driver of sales. Its shipments will be measured in the hundreds of thousands this year, compared with hundreds of millions for the iPhone. But it could turn Apple into the biggest player in the mixed-reality market.\n\nAnalysts estimated that Apple sold roughly 180,000 Vision Pros during the Vision Pro’s preorder period, which began in mid-January. At $3,499 a pop, that’s well over $600 million in revenue.\n\n“I think we’re going to do well,” Cook said in New York after being asked about sales. “I think we’re doing well today.”\n\nHere’s Cook’s full memo to employees:\n\nTeam,\n\nToday we launched Apple Vision Pro, introducing an entirely new era of spatial computing. Moments like this should make us all pause — to celebrate what we’ve achieved and reflect on the amazing potential that still lies ahead.\n\nThis morning I was with our team at Apple Fifth Avenue, where the excitement for this moment was palpable. It’s an incredible thing to watch people experience Apple Vision Pro for the very first time. The impossible becomes possible right before their eyes, and often they don’t have the words to describe the experience. It really is a technology you have to see — and see through — to believe. And it was truly a gift to hear customers share their amazement, their emotion, and their dreams for this incredible device we’ve created. The whole experience reaffirmed the magnitude of this moment, as well as our Retail teams’ vital role in delivering this unprecedented technology to the world.\n\nApple Vision Pro brings together thousands of innovations to create a product that’s like nothing the world has ever seen before. It’s an extraordinary achievement, and as so many of you can attest, it has been years in the making. Apple Vision Pro is a reality thanks to you — thanks to your commitment, your passion, and your contributions to the special culture that drives innovation at Apple. I especially want to thank all of the teams that have been dedicated to this project, who poured in countless hours over many years to yet again push the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nOf course, for us, the most important thing about Apple Vision Pro is how it enriches our customers’ lives — strengthening connection, unlocking potential, and empowering people to accomplish things that simply wouldn’t be possible any other way. It’s profoundly moving to think of people reliving their most treasured memories, or even introducing a loved one to a relative they never had the chance to meet. It’s exhilarating to imagine the unbelievable new entertainment experiences our customers will discover, and the innovative apps our amazing developers will create. It’s exciting to think of everything this unlocks for industries the world over, and of the incredible opportunities that still lie ahead. Because with spatial computing, this is just the beginning of the impact we can make.\n\nTwo weeks ago we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Mac, a revolutionary device that transformed the world and laid the foundation for decades of innovation. When we shared iPod with the world, we put a thousand songs in our customers’ pockets overnight. I remember the day we launched iPhone. We knew we had something special, but none of us could have foreseen its profound impact on our everyday lives. Then came iPad, a magical sheet of glass that becomes anything you want it to be, fostering new forms of connection and creativity for millions of people. With Apple Watch, there isn’t a day that goes by I don’t get a note from a user about its lifesaving impact. And now with today’s launch, Apple Vision Pro joins the pantheon of groundbreaking products that have defined Apple and redefined technology as we know it.\n\nIt’s not every day we have a moment like this one. Thank you for all you’ve done to make it possible.\n\nTim\n\n(Updates with rest of memo at bottom of story.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters Mano dura de El Salvador contra el crimen seduce a América Latina AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.",

        "title": "A dizzying week of wins and woes for Big Tech’s CEOs",
        "content": "Hi there, it’s tech reporting fellow Rachyl Jones. The busiest week for tech CEOs in recent memory comes to a close today—following a spree of earnings announcements from Meta, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. And when taking the whole week into account, there’s a few things investors and consumers can glean about the future of the world’s top companies.\n\nFirst, the massive layoffs that have plagued the tech industry over the past year are doing wonders for the companies’ bottom lines, and executives appear keen on continuing to operate in a lean fashion. Meta’s headcount is down 22% from the same time last year, representing the elimination of 67,000 jobs, which CEO Mark Zuckerberg said “is helping us execute better and faster,” adding that “we will continue to carry these values forward as a permanent part of how we operate.” For Amazon, which is down 27,000 employees in two years, further job cuts are on the table, CFO Brian Olsavsky said on Thursday. And as Big Tech continues to integrate artificial intelligence technologies into corporate workflows, layoffs will remain a subject to watch.\n\nSpeaking of AI, executives had a lot to say about their respective investments in the technologies—except for Apple, which has largely kept mum about its plans but teased a generative AI announcement coming later this year (see news blurb below). For the rest of the pack, though, the term “AI” sounded 200 times across the four earnings calls. Amazon expects its generative AI services to produce tens of billions of dollars in revenue over the coming years. Microsoft and Alphabet are already feeling the benefits of AI on their businesses (though specific financial details from the companies are woefully scant). Perhaps the company with the biggest talk was Meta, which is planning a massive infrastructure investment (to the tune of at least $30 billion to $37 billion this year) to win the AI race, and with CEO Mark Zuckerberg touting the company’s vast trove of user data as its secret weapon.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the AI arms race is taking place amid growing concerns over safety and privacy, and mounting regulatory pressure.\n\nIn fact, the threat of Big Tech regulation marked another common thread throughout the week, offering a striking contrast as CEOs took their lumps from regulators one day and celebrated record results and stock gains the next.\n\nFor Zuckerberg, that took the form of a four-hour grilling by the Senate Judiciary Committee on how Facebook and Instagram risk the safety and well-being of children. Support for reining in social media companies is a rare point of bipartisanship in Congress, with a series of legislative measures on the table. Amazon abandoned its $1.4 billion acquisition of iRobot on Monday, citing “undue and disproportionate regulatory hurdles.” And Apple is preparing for major changes to its App Store in the EU in March, to comply with Europe’s competition law. The company will allow iPhone users to download apps from non-Apple app stores, and it will lower the fees it charges developers. The EU market represents 7% of global App Store sales, but how the regulation will impact revenue—well, CEO Tim Cook gave an answer to the effect of “We’ll have to wait and see.”\n\nWith that, here’s today’s biggest news in tech.\n\nRachyl Jones\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "title": "Apple Returns to Revenue Growth: 5 ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL reported solid first-quarter fiscal 2024 results, wherein it beat estimates on both earnings and revenues. The iPhone manufacturer returned to quarterly sales growth after four straight quarters of declines. However, a decline in China sales pulled down the stock.\r\n\r\nApple shares dropped as much as 3% in after-market hours on China concerns, erasing $84 billion of the company's market valuation. This has put ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan in focus. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nApple Earnings in Focus\n\nEarnings per share came in at $2.18, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 and improving 16% year over year. Revenues grew 2% year over year to $119.6 billion and edged past the estimated $117.6 billion. The revenue growth ended the four straight quarters of sales declines and was boosted by iPhone 15 handset sales and services growth (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\niPhone sales grew 6% to $69.7 billion. Services revenues, comprising iTunes, Apple Music, iCloud, Apple Pay and Apple Care, rose 11% year over year to an all-time high of $23.1 billion. Revenues from Wearables, Home and Accessories, which includes Apple Watch, AirPods, HomePod, Apple TV and Beats headphones, declined 11% to $12 billion. Mac sales rose a fraction to $7.8 billion, while iPad sales declined 25% to $7 billion. Apple is still struggling in China, with sales falling 12.9% year over year to $20.8 billion.\r\n\r\nThe tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the ongoing quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that iPhone sales in the March quarter would be similar to last year’s $51.33 billion in revenues. This excludes $5 billion in sales attributed to outperformance a year ago as supply recovered from COVID-19 shutdowns and caught up to demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 64 securities in its basket, with Apple making up for 20.4% share.

The fund charges 9 bps in fees per year.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF manages $62.2 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 312 technology stocks. It currently tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Here, Apple accounts for 21.5% share. Systems software, technology hardware storage & peripheral, semiconductors, and application software are the top four sectors.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, whereas volume is solid at nearly 494,000 shares (read: Tech Leads S&P 500 to Highs: Does Further Rally Await ETFs?).\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC)\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF is home to 303 technology stocks with an AUM of $8.8 billion. It follows the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index. Apple accounts for a 21.6% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF has an expense ratio of 0.08%, while volume is solid at 245,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW)\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index, giving investors exposure to 133 U.S. electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies.

        "title": "Tesla woes get investors talking about its successor in 'Magnificent Seven'",
        "content": "By Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas\n\n(Reuters) - The recent slump in Tesla stock threatens its place in an elite grouping of companies that powered a surge in U.S. markets in recent years, experts said, while triggering chatter of an AI-linked replacement for the electric automaker.\n\nThe so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" - Apple, Microsoft, Amazon.com, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Nvidia and Tesla - staged a blistering rally last year and pushed Wall Street to record highs.\n\nThe group holds a collective weight of 28.6% in the S&P 500, up from 27.8% at the end of 2023. That is close to the highest weight ever for that group of stocks, according to LSEG data.\n\nA successor to Tesla will likely be one that would be able to monetize the booming demand for artificial intelligence, a dozen institutional investors told Reuters.\n\n\"It's Magnificent 6,\" said Brandon Michael, senior investment analyst at ABC Funds.\n\n\"Tesla has a lot of issues with competition from Chinese EV makers, price cuts, shrinking margins and even Musk said it himself that the Dojo supercomputer is a long shot.\"\n\n\"And if I were to put a seventh in there, it would be Broadcom, which is a leader in custom silicon and is facilitating the AI revolution.\"\n\nTesla's stock, which is down nearly 24% so far this year, formed a \"death cross\" on Thursday, a sign interpreted by some traders as portending more losses. The death cross kicks in when the 50-day moving average falls below the 200-day moving average.\n\nWaning demand due to high borrowing costs and lower government subsidies, and price cuts across geographies are among challenges the EV pioneer is navigating.\n\nApple, the other laggard in the group, is down 2.94% as of last close. Its shares fell 2.2% on Friday after the company forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below Wall Street expectations.\n\n\"What's changed now is that we flipped over the calendar to 2024 and this is the \"show me\" year where people are looking at companies' abilities not just to use AI, but to monetize AI, therefore, some of the shine has come off Apple,\" said Art Hogan, chief market strategist at B Riley Wealth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, mounting optimism around AI has lifted shares of Nvidia by 31% this year, Microsoft by about 9% and pushed a popular gauge of U.S. chipmakers to an all-time high.\n\nApple was dethroned by Microsoft as the world's most valuable company in January as investors were disappointed by the lack of AI-related plans in its business model and subdued China demand.\n\nMeta soared 21% to a record high on Friday after its first dividend and Amazon.com jumped 6.6% as it beat fourth-quarter revenue expectations.\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" follows earlier investor phrases such as FANG, which initially was Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google, and then became FAANG to include Apple.\n\nDuring the late 1990s tech boom, investors piled into the so-called \"Four Horsemen,\" which were Cisco Systems, Intel, Dell Computer, and Microsoft.\n\nWho is in the race?\n\nChipmaker Broadcom, which ABC Funds' Michael suggested would be key contender, has doubled in value in 2023, with traders betting on a boost from the company's recent acquisition of VMware.\n\nAnother market favorite is Advanced Micro Devices, a close competitor of Nvidia, which produces chips for all graphic processor units needed for AI and jumped over two-folds in 2023.\n\nChris Beauchamp, IG Group's chief market analyst, said although the chipmaker's market valuation pales in comparison to the EV giant's, it could step up to the plate given it's another big beneficiary of the AI drive.\n\nMost others said the group might just shrink to six members and a new catchphrase might just emerge, with some already referring to the smaller set as the \"Magnificent Six\".\n\n(Reporting by Johann M Cherian and Ankika Biswas; Additional reporting by Purvi Agarwal in Bengaluru; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila)",

        "content": "In this article, we will look at the 15 highest-quality Bluetooth speakers for 2024. If you want to skip our analysis of the global speaker market, you can go directly to the 5 Highest Quality Bluetooth Speakers for 2024.\n\nBluetooth speakers have been in the market for a couple of years now and are improving in quality and features with each day. Bluetooth speakers connect devices via Bluetooth technology and help users play music, audiobooks, movies, and more, for a better audio experience. These are different from wireless speakers, which can be connected through Wifi as well as Bluetooth.\n\nRecent Trends in the Global Speaker Market\n\nAccording to a report by Straits Research, the global speakers market was valued at $68 billion in 2021. With steady progression, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 30.7% between 2022 and 2030, reaching $756 billion by the end of the forecasted period.\n\nThe most significant development in the speakers market recently has been the inclusion of artificial intelligence-led virtual assistants. Siri by Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alexa by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Google Assistant by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) all rely on true wireless stereos (TWS) or Bluetooth connectivity to operate in homes and offices. These smart speakers perform various functions on voice commands, such as controlling the lighting around the house, playing music, providing information from Google, and many other home automation tasks.\n\nSmart speakers are becoming increasingly affordable because of increased demand in the market. Due to high-end companies selling expensive speakers, consumers look for alternatives provided by other speaker manufacturers. Speaker performance and audio quality are crucial factors for a large number of consumers and they are willing to pay higher prices to get a quality product, while others may settle for average quality for an affordable price. You can also take a look at 10 Smartphones with the Best Audio Quality.\n\nStory continues\n\nBattery technologies play a key role in maintaining high-quality portable speakers or true wireless stereo systems. Major speakers companies rely on high-quality lithium batteries that last 8 plus hours, however with recent developments in battery technologies, companies are developing batteries that last over 40 hours as well. You might also be interested in the 12 biggest battery manufacturers in the world and 10 next generation battery technology companies.\n\nNow that we have discussed the trends in the global speaker market, let's take a look at some of the prominent companies, such as Sonos Inc. (NASDAQ:SONO), VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX), and Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY), that are dominating the speakers market.\n\nKey Players in the Global Speaker Market\n\nSonos Inc. (NASDAQ:SONO) is an American manufacturer of audio products, such as speakers and headphones. Its multi-room Bluetooth speakers are one of the company's most-sold products.

Sonos Inc (NASDAQ:SONO) speakers will have various custom-built optimizations and will deliver high-quality and balanced sound. The size of the ceiling speakers is customizable and keeping design aesthetics in mind, they come in various colors too.\n\nVOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX) is a leading distributor and manufacturer of consumer electronics such as high-definition audio systems and home entertainment systems. VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX) also specializes in automotive electronics and commercial audio equipment. On January 9, VOXX International Corporation (NASDAQ:VOXX) reported earnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2023. The company reported earnings per share of $0.14 and outperformed EPS estimates by $0.24. The company's revenue for the quarter grew by 5.45% and amounted to $135.26 million.\n\nSony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) has a diverse portfolio that includes a wide range of audio equipment and speakers. The company's audio and speaker products are some of the most widely sold products due to their global demand. On January 5, Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY) announced the change in the executive team of Sony Ventures Corporation, its investing arm. Kazuhito Hadano has been appointed as the CEO of Sony Ventures Corporation and Gen Tsuchikawa has been appointed as the new Chairman of the company. Gen Tsuchikawa was previously the Corporate Vice President as well as the CEO of Sony Group Corporation (NYSE:SONY). The Chairman and CEO assumed their roles on January 1. 15 Highest Quality Bluetooth Speakers for 2024\n\nA close up view of an innovative wireless speaker aimed to revolutionize the audio industry.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile our list of the 15 highest-quality Bluetooth speaker brands for 2024, we used consensus picks from various online websites that sold speakers. We analyzed the number of reviews and ratings for Bluetooth speakers across Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy. We took the number of reviews and rankings each speaker brand had across our vendors' websites. We added the total number of reviews and averaged the ratings for each brand. Based on these two metrics, we ranked the highest-quality Bluetooth speakers for 2024 and listed them below in ascending order.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. By using a consensus approach, we identify the best stock picks of more than 900 hedge funds investing in US stocks.

We also continued to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets, with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, the Philippines, Poland and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia and Chile.\r\nIn Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double digits year-over-year. And I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be an historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple Stores for customers in the U.S., with expansion to other countries later this year.\r\nApple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation, and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device. There's already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves.\r\nMoments like these are what we live for at Apple. They are why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\r\nNow let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We're proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic and a new 48-megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of 7 Pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SOS and Roadside Assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their life-saving impact.\r\nTurning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having 1 less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple Silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable neural engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning.\r\nThis past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple Silicon for Mac: M3, M3 Pro and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance, empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro or beating their high score in a graphics-intensive game. A favorite among students, business owners, artists and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best Pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in-one is now faster than ever, thanks to M3.\r\nIn iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the tenth-generation iPad during the December quarter last year and 1 less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to device for students, creatives and more, with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad. iPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet.\r\nIn Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new Double Tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like Irregular Rhythm Notification and Fall Detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most. And for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch.\r\nMeanwhile, our AirPods lineup continued to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion, an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had 1 less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter. And we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare.\r\nAcross our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses. We're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades, including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, 9 BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2,050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service.\r\nWe're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl Halftime Show featuring Usher.\r\nTurning to retail. In recent months, we opened 3 stores, including our 100th store in Asia Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow.\r\nAt Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world. We also continue to do essential work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world.\r\nIn recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030.\r\nApple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by a core belief in the transformative power of innovation. And so we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long term and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. \r\nWith that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nThank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, 2 unique factors affected our results: first, we had an additional week in the quarter; and second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these 2 factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets, with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track.\r\nProducts revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and 1 less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio. Thanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments and is now over 2.2 billion active devices.\r\nServices revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We're very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets, with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific.\r\nCompany gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record, and operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion.\r\nLet me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East and Korea as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia. Our iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving the new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were 4 out of the top 5 models in the U.S. and Japan; 4 out of the top 6 models in urban China and the U.K. and all top 5 models in Australia.\r\nMac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and returned to growth despite 1 less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago. Customer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great, and our Mac installed base reached an all-time high, with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S.\r\niPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10th generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product. And customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S.\r\nWearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago. This time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro second generation, the Watch SE and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly 2/3 of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. And the latest report from 451 Research indicates customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S.\r\nAnd in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services. Both transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high with paid accounts growing double digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only 4 years ago.\r\nFinally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+, to more publications on News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade.\r\nTurning to enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Macs, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work. In emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000-plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly 2/3 of them choosing Mac as their primary computer.\r\nWith the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as the new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come.\r\nLet me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was, $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter.\r\nAs we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis.\r\nAs a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year. When we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago.\r\nFor our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today, our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. \r\nWith that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nThank you, Luca. (Operator Instructions) Operator, may we have the first question, please?\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nWe'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley.\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\n\nI have 2, and congrats on the nice quarter here. Luca, maybe if we start with you, can you unpackage some of the Services drivers a bit for us? Obviously, really nice outperformance in the December quarter versus your expectations. A record gross margin implies your higher-margin businesses were likely the sources of outperformance. But can you maybe just clarify a bit how we should think about Services growth for the March quarter? And then speak to some of those underlying drivers in the December quarter and then in the March quarter, what the different puts and takes would be. And then I have a follow-up, please.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nThanks, Erik, for the question. Let's start with the December quarter. As we said, up 11%, $23.1 billion is an all-time record for us, with all-time records in the Americas, in Europe and the rest of Asia Pac. So it was pretty broad-based geographically and very strong across all the Services categories because we had all-time revenue records for cloud, for payments, for video and for advertising and December quarter records for the App Store and for AppleCare.\r\nObviously, last year, we had an extra week so the 11% is stronger than -- the underlying performance is stronger than 11% that we have reported. I think the entire ecosystem is doing well because we continue to see growth and new all-time highs in both transacting accounts and paid accounts, which is obviously very important. And paid subscriptions continue to grow strong double digits.\r\nJust as a reference, we have more than 1 billion paid subscriptions across all the services on our platform. This is more than double the number of paid subscriptions that we had only 4 years ago, so obviously very significant growth there. What I said during the prepared remarks around the March quarter, I mentioned that we will continue to grow double digits at a percentage that is similar to what we reported for the December quarter. We don't provide guidance around the different Services category so we will provide more color when we report in 3 months.\n\nErik William Richard Woodring\n\nOkay. And then, Tim, really nice to see your installed base reach a record high, again, against all products and geos. I'm wondering if you could share a bit more detail about the new users you were able to onboard over the last 12 months, meaning how might this new cohort look different from past cohorts either in terms of geographic representation or skew to certain products or even how their monetization trends might differ from past cohorts.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. Erik, I would say emerging markets are -- have been a very key area of strength for us. If you look at it, India grew, in revenue terms, grew strong double digits in the December quarter and hit a quarter revenue record. The other emerging markets like Indonesia also hit a quarterly record, and we had several regions with records from Latin America to the Middle East. And that theme has been pretty consistent across the other quarters of the year as well. And so emerging markets, very, very important, and I feel like we're doing a great job there.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Mike Ng with Goldman Sachs.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nI just have 2 questions as well. First on Services. Just on the outlook for the March quarter for a similar double-digit growth rate as the December quarter, I'm just wondering why not -- why won't it be potentially faster, given that the December quarter obviously had a headwind from the extra week comp, and I also think that some of the pricing uplifts on select Apple One services that were implemented last winter should help in the March quarter. Any additional thoughts there would be great in terms of what some of your assumptions are. And then I have a quick follow-up.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes. We'll see how the quarter develops. I would point to 2 things. One is the fact that we mentioned that we expect a couple of points of negative foreign exchange in the March quarter, and foreign exchange was essentially flat for us in the December quarter. So you've got a bit of a headwind there. And then when you look at the progression of our Services business over the last few quarters, the compares for March are slightly more difficult than the compares for December.\n\nMichael Ng\n\nGreat. And then my second question, it was very interesting to hear about some of the enterprise customer investments into Vision Pro. Could you maybe just talk about some of the efforts to support the Vision Pro developer ecosystem? And it was also good to hear about the potential upcoming announcements on AI, so any thoughts there would also be helpful.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. We are incredibly excited about the enterprise opportunities with Vision Pro. I've seen several demos from different companies. Luca mentioned several in his opening remarks, but Walmart has a very cool merchandising app. There are firms that are doing collaboration, design collaboration apps. There are field service applications. Really all over the map. There are applications that are for control center, command center kind of things.\r\nSAP has really gotten behind it and, of course, SAP is in so many of companies that I think there will be a great opportunity for us in enterprise, and we couldn't be more excited about where things are right now. We're obviously looking forward to tomorrow. This has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple. And really, it took a whole of company effort to bring it to this far.\r\nIn terms of generative AI, which I would guess is your focus, we have a lot of work going on internally as I've alluded to before. Our MO, if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work and not to get out in front of ourselves. And so we're going to hold that to this as well. But we've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nI had 2 questions as well. First on iPhone, there have been concerns around replacement cycles lengthening, China competition intensifying. And you still beat iPhone revenues despite the weaker performance in China. Curious how you're thinking about the 15 cycle overall, given what you saw in the December quarter. And I have a follow-up.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nIt's Tim. We were up 6% as we mentioned in the opening remarks. We're happy with that performance. Underneath there, we had really strong performance in several parts of the world, with all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia Pacific. As I've mentioned earlier, we did particularly well in several emerging markets from Latin America to the Middle East, and we set December quarter records in India and Indonesia, and so really some spectacular broad-based reactions to iPhone.\r\nWe also, importantly, set an all-time record worldwide for iPhone upgraders. And the installed base hit a new all-time high, consistent with the -- our overall devices. And so there's a lot of good things. Luca mentioned in his opening comments that iPhones were 4 out of the top 5 smartphone models in the U.S. and Japan and 4 out of the top 6 in urban China and the U.K. and all top 5 in Australia. And this customer satisfaction level for iPhone 15 hit 99%.\r\nIf you look at iPhone 15 since the announcement of it and shipment in September, so this is including some of Q4, and you compare that to iPhone 14 over the same period of time, iPhone 15 is outselling iPhone 14. And so we feel very good about that, and the upgraders hitting a record is particularly exciting for us.\n\nWamsi Mohan\n\nGreat. And as a follow-up, obviously, you're just launching the Vision Pro and it's an entirely new category. It's a price point that's a much higher starting price point relative to most of your other, probably over the last decade, product introductions. But just wondering, how would you measure the success of Vision Pro over time? And which Apple product's adoption curve would you look at as potentially the most similar? And is there a way in which we could think Vision Pro could eclipse maybe something like the iPad in revenue over time?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nEach product has its own journey, and so I wouldn't want to compare it to any one in particular. I would just say we couldn't be more excited internally. We've gotten an incredible amount of excitement from developers and from customers that can't wait until tomorrow to pick up their units. And we're incredibly proud to be able to demo the unit in so many of our stores in the U.S. starting tomorrow for people that are -- that want to check it out.\r\nAnd so we'll see and report the results of it in the Wearables category that you're familiar with. I think that if you look at it from a price point of view, there's an incredible amount of technology that's packed into the product. There's 5,000 patents in the product. And it's, of course, built on many innovations that Apple has spent multiple years on, from silicon to displays and significant AI and machine learning, all the hand tracking, the room mapping, all of this stuff is driven by AI. And so we're incredibly excited about it. I can't wait to be in the store for tomorrow and see the reaction myself.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Amit Daryanani with Evercore.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nI have 2 as well. I guess, first, I was hoping you could talk a little bit about what are you seeing in China right now. I think from a geographic basis, one of the few places that was down double digits while everything else was growing. So I'm hoping you'd spend a bit of time discussing what are you seeing there from a competitive perspective and more importantly from a demand perspective in China.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. If you look at iPhone in China Mainland, which I think has been the focus of a lot of interest and you look at it in constant currency, so more of an operational view, we were down mid-single digits on iPhone. And so it was the other things that drove the larger contraction year-over-year. On the good news side, we had solid growth on upgraders year-over-year in Mainland China, and we had 4 of the top 6 smartphone models in urban China. Also, IDC just put out a note that you may have seen that we were the top brand in -- for the full year and for the December quarter. And so there's some good news along with -- obviously, we'd prefer not to contract.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nFair enough. And then as a follow-up, you folks have implemented a fair bit of changes around the App Store in Europe post the DMA implementation there. Can you just touch on what are some of the key updates? And then Luca, net of it all, do you see it having any significant impact financially to your Services or the broader Apple P&L statement?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nYes. Let me try to answer a little bit of both and then Luca can add some comments to it. We announced a number of changes last week in Europe that would be in effect beginning in March, so the last month of the first calendar quarter, the second fiscal quarter. Those are -- some of the things that we announced include alternate billing opportunities, alternate app stores or marketplaces, if you will. We're also opening NFC for new capabilities for banking and wallet apps. And so these are some of the things that we announced.\r\nIf you think about what we've done over the years is we've really majored on privacy, security and usability. And we've tried our best to get as close to the past in terms of the things that are -- that people love about our ecosystem as we can. But we're going to fall short of providing the maximum amount that we could supply because of -- we need to comply with the regulation. And so in terms of predicting the choices that developers and users will make, it's very difficult to do that with precision. And so we'll see what happens in March.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes. And Amit, as Tim said, these are changes that we're going to be implementing in March. A lot will depend on the choices that will be made. Just to keep it in context, the changes apply to the EU market, which represents roughly 7% of our global App Store revenue.\n\nAmit Jawaharlaz Daryanani\n\nPerfect. That's a really good perspective to have.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nI have 2 as well as you'd imagine. I guess the first question I want to just ask and maybe unpack a little bit more, just remarkable trends that we're seeing in your product gross margins specifically. So I'm curious as we look forward, I guess on this last quarter, were there any kind of benefits you're seeing from like just the purchase component obligations that you put in place, let's say, a year ago and that flowing through? And how are you thinking about the component pricing environment as we think about that gross margin into the March quarter and looking forward?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes. On the products side, and then maybe I'll make a comment in total for the company, on the products side, our gross margins increased sequentially 280 basis points, so obviously a very significant increase. I would say the 2 primary components of the increase are a favorable mix. Of course, iPhone did very well. We did very well with our high-end models. And leverage, of course. It's the biggest quarter of the year for us and so we get the leverage effect.\r\nWe had a partial offset negative impact from foreign exchange, but net-net, obviously very significant improvement. And we had very similar dynamics on the Services side where we increased sequentially 190 basis points, also in this case, due to a more favorable mix. And so the combined effect of the 2 businesses gave us the 45.9% at the total company level, which is up 70% sequentially. You've heard from my prepared remarks that we are guiding total company gross margin to 46% to 47%, which is an additional expansion of margins compared to the already very strong results of the December quarter.\n\nAaron Christopher Rakers\n\nOkay. And then the second question I was just going to ask. Tim, you alluded to kind of your excitement around generative AI and some announcements that we should think about maybe later this year. One of the things that stands out for me is that your capital expenditures has actually come down this last year. I'm curious, as you look to lean in more to generative AI, is there something we should consider about the CapEx intensity at Apple to make investments to really set the table for a generative AI kind of platform as we move forward, just given some of the things that we've seen from some other large tech companies?\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nI'll take the question, Aaron. We've always said we will never underinvest in the business, so we are making all the investments that are necessary throughout our product development, software development, services development. And so we will continue to invest in every area of the business and at the appropriate level. And we're very excited about what's in store for us for the rest of the year.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from Krish Sankar with TD Cowen.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nI have 2 of them. First one for Luca, a clarification and a question. The $5 billion impact in March quarter, is this for product revenue or is that total company revenue? And along the same path, you highlighted the strong gross margins, and I understand last year, some of the commodity costs are deflationary but it looks like it's going to be inflationary right now. And obviously, you've done some of the Mac conversions, silicon conversions. So I'm just trying to figure out how much juice is there more to squeeze on the gross margin side. And then I have a follow-up for Tim.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nYes. The -- so the first part of the question was around the $5 billion. The $5 billion, as I mentioned, a year ago, we had this disruption of supply on iPhone 14 Pro and Pro Max because of the factory shutdown due to the COVID-19 situation. And so essentially, there was pent-up demand. As we exited the December quarter, they got fulfilled. And we also did the channel fill associated with it during the March quarter. So the close to $5 billion that I mentioned is entirely related to iPhone.\r\nOn the gross margin side, obviously, we are at very high levels of gross margin. And I'll repeat what I said before, we've had good expansion over the last few quarters, and now we are guiding to 46% to 47%, and that takes into account everything that is going on, which is the commodity environment, which is the foreign exchange situation, and obviously, the product and services mix. And the outcome of this is the guidance, which obviously is very strong and we're very happy with it.\n\nKrish Sankar\n\nAnd then I have a follow-up for Tim. Tim, it was very interesting to hear your comments on enterprise. And historically, Apple has been a consumer-centric company. And now with Vision Pro, Macs, et cetera, penetrating more into the enterprise, I'm kind of curious how to think about Apple of the future. Would it still be consumer-centric or do you think it's going to be more enterprise-focused also as we get into the future?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nWe've really concluded that we can do both, that if you look at it, what has happened over the last several years is that employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them. And so it sort of took some of the central command from the traditional company and decentralized the decision-making. That is a huge advantage for Apple because there's a lot of people out there that want to use a Mac. They're using a Mac at home. They'd like to use one in the office as well.\r\niPad has also benefited from that. Vision Pro, it's -- when you look at the ton of use cases, I mean, we're starting with 1 million apps and 600-plus that are -- have been designed particularly for Vision Pro. When I look at what is coming out of enterprise, it's some of the most innovative things I've seen come out of enterprise in a long time. And so I think there's -- like there is for the Mac and iPad, and of course, iPhone has been in enterprise since the early days of iPhone, I think there's a nice opportunity there for Vision Pro as well.\n\nOperator\n\nOur next question is from David Vogt with UBS.\n\nDavid Vogt\n\nI have 2 questions as well. So Tim and Luca, I appreciate the strength in the emerging markets like India and the other names that you kind of listed on the call. But can you maybe spend some time on the Americas? Obviously, that was relatively flat. You touched on China. What are you seeing in that market from the carriers here in the States? And is the sales cycle elongating or the replacement cycle elongating? And in your view, what has to change to kind of maybe reaccelerate that business in the Americas, particularly in the iPhone business?\r\nAnd then on sort of -- I just want to make sure I understand sort of the guide. So when I think about the $5 billion pull-forward last year in the March quarter from a channel fill perspective, even if I backed that out last quarter or I back it up this quarter, the March quarter, this would be sort of the softest quarter since the COVID pandemic. Obviously, I know the Americas, as I just touched on, is a little bit softer and China, which you cleared up earlier. But how do you think about the differences in sort of the macro conditions by region? And again, do you have a sense for, are we nearing a trough from a macro demand perspective? Or how long do you think this particular weakness persists?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nLet me take the first part of your question about Americas. If you look at the U.S., which is -- obviously drives the vast, vast majority of the revenue in Americas, we grew in the December quarter from an iPhone business point of view. And the installed base hit an all-time high. If you look at the replacement cycle, it's very difficult to measure the replacement cycle at any given point. And so what we focus on internally a lot is the active installed base and the -- obviously, the sales over usually a cycle, and we feel better about those things.\r\nIf you look at the -- who's selling what in the U.S., the iPhone is 4 out of the top 5 selling smartphones in the U.S. And of course, the customer satisfaction in the U.S., as we alluded to earlier, is 99%. So we feel very, very good about what our position is in the U.S.\n\nLuca Maestri\n\nAnd I would add to that, keep in mind, obviously, the extra week that we had a year ago, that obviously makes the compare more a bit distorted. On the March quarter guide, I would point to you that, obviously, the COVID years had a lot of, let's say, turmoil in it, a lot of volatility that typically you wouldn't see. If you look at our sequential progression from December to March this year versus pre-COVID versus like a more normal environment, it's actually stronger than those years.\n\nOperator\n\nOur last question is from Ben Reitzes with Melius Research.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nTwo questions if I can sneak them in. Just wanted to clarify on China, Tim. I think last quarter, you still thought it was a growth market. Obviously, you know that there's some concerns with the recently and given what we saw in the quarter. Is there something that we can kind of point to where you feel that, that market can resume growth in the future? And I'm wondering if you're still upbeat about that prospect. Then I just have a quick follow-up.\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nBen, we've been in China for 30 years, and I am -- I remain very optimistic about China over the long term. And I feel good about hitting a new installed base number, a high watermark and very good about the growth in upgraders year-over-year in the -- during the quarter.\n\nBenjamin Alexander Reitzes\n\nGreat. And just in terms of AI, I know you're not going to talk about your plans, but do you believe -- are you a believer in the edge thesis that AI and processing on smartphones and devices like yours is going to have a huge role in AI and AI apps, and that it's something you guys can take advantage of?\n\nTimothy D. Cook\n\nLet me just say that I think there is a huge opportunity for Apple with gen AI and AI and without getting into more details and getting out in front of myself.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli\n\nAll right.

        "content": "Shares of Meta Platforms (META) rocketed higher at the start of trading Friday, climbing more than 16% after the company posted better than expected earnings and guidance, and announced new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share. In the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Meta Connect event at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 27, 2023. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payrolls costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges including severance and facilities consolidation totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317 down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Q1 2024 Earnings Call Transcript February 1, 2024\n\nOperator: Good day, and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2024 Earnings Conference Call. Today's call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and introductions. I would like to turn the call over to Suhasini Chandramouli, Director of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple's CEO, Tim Cook; and he'll be followed by CFO, Luca Maestri. After that, we'll open the call to questions from analysts. Before turning the call over to Tim, I would like to remind everyone that the quarter we're reporting today included 13 weeks, whereas the quarter we reported a year ago included 14 weeks. Please note that some of the information you'll hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements, including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation and future business outlook, including the potential impact of macroeconomic conditions on the company's business and results of operations.\n\nThese statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple's most recently filed annual report on Form 10-K and the form 8-K filed with the SEC today along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. I'd now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks.\n\nTim Cook: Thank you. Suhasini. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining the call. Today, Apple is reporting revenue of $119.6 billion for the December quarter, up 2% from a year ago despite having one less week in the quarter. EPS was $2.18, up 16% from a year ago and an all-time record. We achieved revenue records across more than two dozen countries and regions including all-time records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific. We also continue to see strong double-digit growth in many emerging markets with all-time records in Malaysia, Mexico, The Philippines, Poland, and Turkey, as well as December quarter records in India, Indonesia, Saudi Arabia, and Chile. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record with paid subscriptions growing double-digits year-over-year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd I'm pleased to announce today that we have set a new record for our installed base, which has now surpassed 2.2 billion active devices. We are announcing these results on the eve of what is sure to be a historic day as we enter the era of spatial computing. Starting tomorrow, Apple Vision Pro, the most advanced personal electronics device ever, will be available in Apple stores for customers in the U.S. with expansion to other countries later this year. Apple Vision Pro is a revolutionary device built on decades of Apple innovation and it's years ahead of anything else. Apple Vision Pro has a groundbreaking new input system and thousands of innovations, and it will unlock incredible experiences for users and developers that are simply not possible on any other device.\n\nThere is already so much excitement behind this product from reviewers, customers, and developers. They are praising everything from the incredible experience of watching a movie on a 100-foot screen to remarkable new machine learning capabilities like hand tracking and room mapping. We can't wait for people to experience the magic for themselves. Moments like these are what we live for at Apple. They're why we do what we do. They're why we're so unflinchingly dedicated to groundbreaking innovation and why we're so focused on pushing technology to its limits as we work to enrich the lives of our users. As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that will shape the future. That includes artificial intelligence where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\n\nNow, let's turn to the results for the December quarter, beginning with iPhone. We are proud to report that revenue came in at $69.7 billion, 6% higher than a year ago. The iPhone 15 lineup has earned glowing reviews and been embraced by customers. The iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus feature a gorgeous new design with color-infused back glass and contoured edges, Dynamic Island, A16 Bionic, and a new 48 megapixel camera system. And the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max set the gold standard for smartphones with a beautiful and lighter titanium design, industry-leading performance with A17 Pro and our most advanced camera system with the equivalent of seven pro lenses and the ability to record spatial video. Features like Emergency SoS and roadside assistance via satellite bring peace of mind to users when they travel, and I'm grateful for every note I've received about their lifesaving impact.\n\nTurning to Mac. Revenue came in at $7.8 billion, up 1% year-over-year, driven by the strength of our latest M3-powered MacBook Pro models in spite of having one less week of sales. Just last week, we got to wish Mac a happy 40th birthday. When it was introduced 40 years ago, Mac changed everything, and through the years, it has done so again and again. Recently, we have been on a tremendous pace of innovation. Since the introduction of Apple silicon in 2020, we've been proud to offer our users unmatched performance and power along with a remarkable Neural Engine for artificial intelligence and machine learning. This past fall, we had an amazing launch of the latest generation of Apple silicon for Mac, M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max. These chips break new ground in power and performance empowering users to do more than they ever could before, whether they're making a musical masterpiece using the latest features in Logic Pro, or beating their high score in a graphics intensive game.\n\nA favorite amongst students, business owners, artists, and video editors, our MacBook Pro lineup is the world's best pro notebook family. And iMac, the world's most capable and best-selling all-in one, is now faster than ever, thanks to M3. In iPad, revenue for the December quarter was $7 billion, down 25% year-over-year due to a difficult compare with the launch of the M2 iPad Pro and the 10th generation iPad during the December quarter last year and one less week of sales. iPad remains the most versatile, capable, and elegant tablet on the market today. It continues to be the go-to-device for students, creators, and more with customers loving iPad's incredible combination of portability and performance. Powerful apps like Final Cut Pro and Logic Pro for iPad allow video and music creators to unleash their creativity in new ways that are only possible on iPad.\n\niPad continues to push the boundaries of what's possible on a tablet. In Wearables, Home and Accessories, revenue came in at $12 billion, down 11% from a year ago due to a difficult compare with the launch timing of several products in this category and the impact of the 14th week last year. Across our latest Apple Watch lineup, we're enabling and encouraging our users to live a healthier day, while making Apple Watch even more intuitive to use. The new double tap gesture on Apple Watch Series 9 and Apple Watch Ultra 2 make it easier to answer calls, play and pause music or take a photo with iPhone. I've been deeply moved by the many touching stories about how features like a regular rhythm notification and fall detection helped Apple Watch users when they needed it most.\n\nAnd for the first time ever, users can choose a carbon-neutral option of any new Apple Watch. Meanwhile, our AirPods lineup continue to be a holiday favorite. In Services, we set an all-time revenue record of $23.1 billion and an 11% year-over-year increase. Because we had one less week this quarter, this growth represents an acceleration from the September quarter, and we achieved all-time revenue records across advertising, cloud services, payment services and video, as well as December quarter records in App Store and AppleCare. Across our services, we're constantly growing our offerings to give users even more to love. With the redesigned Apple TV app, we've made it easier for subscribers to enjoy all their favorite shows, movies and sports, including Apple TV+ hits like Masters of the Air, Monarch, and Slow Horses.\n\nWe're proud to be a part of Martin Scorsese's Killers of the Flower Moon, a film that has moved audiences and earned more than 200 accolades including Best Film of the Year from the New York Film Critics Circle, nine BAFTA nominations, a Golden Globe win, and 10 Oscar nominations, including Best Picture. Across all Apple TV+ productions, we've now earned 2050 award nominations and 450 wins since we've introduced the service. We're also excited to have a new season of Major League Soccer kicking off this month. We're looking forward to seeing Lionel Messi return to the field and to following all of our favorite teams in what is sure to be an incredible season. And we're counting down to the Apple Music Super Bowl halftime show, featuring Usher.\n\nTurning to Retail. In recent months, we opened three stores, including our 100th store in Asia-Pacific. Throughout the holidays, our team members pulled out all the stops to help customers find the perfect gift. And I know our U.S. team members are especially excited to begin demoing Apple Vision Pro for our customers tomorrow. At Apple, we live and breathe innovation. We are driven to pioneer new technology that can enrich our customers' lives, and we're just as intentional about showing up with our values and being a force for good in the world. February is Black History Month, and to honor it, we've launched our new Black Unity Collection, which includes the Black Unity Sport Loop band. This year's designs reflect a lasting commitment to working toward a more equitable world.\n\nWe also continue to do a central work through our Racial Equity and Justice Initiative, and we're proud to continue providing grants to organizations that are making a real impact in the world. In recent months, we've also taken significant strides in our environmental work. We're partnering with suppliers to bring more clean energy online for Apple production. We're using more recycled materials than ever before and more energy-efficient transportation than ever before. And each day, we are taking more and more steps toward becoming 100% carbon-neutral across all of our products by 2030. Apple is a company that has never shied away from big challenges. That's because we are grounded by a deep sense of purpose and guided by core belief in the transformative power of innovation. A wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nAnd so, we are optimistic about the future, confident in the long-term, and as excited as we've ever been to deliver for our users like only Apple can. With that, I'll turn it over to Luca.\n\nLuca Maestri: Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone. Revenue for the December quarter was $119.6 billion, up 2% from last year. During the December quarter a year ago, two unique factors affected our results. First, we had an additional week in the quarter. And second, we had COVID-related factory shutdowns that limited iPhone supply. We estimate that the net impact of these two factors resulted in a 2 percentage point headwind to our revenue performance this quarter. We set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest of Asia-Pacific, and continue to see strong performance across our emerging markets with double-digit growth in the majority of the emerging markets we track. Products revenue was $96.5 billion, flat compared to last year, driven by strength in iPhone, offset by challenging compares for iPad and Wearables, Home and Accessories and one less week of sales this year across the entire portfolio.\n\nThanks to our unparalleled customer loyalty and very strong levels of customer satisfaction, our total installed base of active devices set a new record across all products and all geographic segments, and is now over 2.2 billion active devices. Services revenue set an all-time record of $23.1 billion, up 11% year-over-year. When we take into account the extra week last year, this represents a sequential acceleration of growth from the September quarter. We are very pleased with our Services performance in both developed and emerging markets with all-time revenue records in the Americas, Europe, and rest of Asia-Pacific. Company gross margin was 45.9%, up 70 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and favorable mix, partially offset by foreign exchange.\n\nProducts gross margin was 39.4%, up 280 basis points sequentially, also driven by leverage and mix, partially offset by foreign exchange. Services gross margin was 72.8%, up 190 basis points from last quarter, due to a more favorable mix. Operating expenses of $14.5 billion were at the midpoint of the guidance range we provided and up 1% year-over-year. Net income was $33.9 billion, up $3.9 billion from last year. Diluted EPS was $2.18, up 16% versus last year and an all-time record. And operating cash flow was very strong at $39.9 billion. Let me now provide more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $69.7 billion, up 6% year-over-year. We set all-time records in several countries and regions, including Latin America, Western Europe, the Middle East, and Korea, as well as December quarter records in India and Indonesia.\n\nOur iPhone active installed base grew to a new all-time high, and we had an all-time record number of iPhone upgraders during the quarter. Customers are loving their new iPhone 15 family, with the latest reports from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 99% in the U.S. In fact, many iPhone models were among the top-selling smartphones around the world during the quarter. According to a survey from Kantar, iPhones were four out of the top five models in the U.S. and Japan, four out of the top six models in urban China and the UK, and all top five models in Australia. Mac generated revenue of $7.8 billion and return to growth, despite one less week of sales this year. This represents a significant acceleration from the September quarter when we faced a challenging compare due to the supply disruptions and subsequent demand recapture we experienced a year ago.\n\nCustomer response to our latest iMac and MacBook Pro models powered by the M3 chips has been great. And our Mac installed base reached an all-time high with almost half of Mac buyers during the quarter being new to the product. Also, 451 Research recently reported customer satisfaction of 97% for Mac in the U.S. iPad was $7 billion in revenue, down 25% year-over-year. iPad faced a difficult compare because during the December quarter last year, we launched the new iPad Pro and iPad 10 generation, and we had an extra week of sales. However, the iPad installed base continues to grow and is an all-time high with over half of the customers who purchased iPads during the quarter being new to the product, and customer satisfaction for iPad was recently measured at 98% in the U.S. Wearables, Home and Accessories revenue was $12 billion, down 11% year-over-year due to a challenging launch compare and the extra week a year ago.\n\nThis time last year, we had the full quarter benefit from the launches of the AirPods Pro 2nd generation, the Watch SE, and the first Watch Ultra. We continue to attract new customers to Apple Watch. Nearly two-thirds of customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product, and the latest reports from 451 Research indicate customer satisfaction of 96% in the U.S. And in Services, we were very pleased with our double-digit growth, which was driven by the strength of our ecosystem. Our installed base is now over 2.2 billion active devices and continues to grow nicely, establishing a solid foundation for the future expansion of our Services business. And we continue to see increased customer engagement with our services.\n\nBoth transacting accounts and paid accounts reached a new all-time high, with paid accounts growing double-digits year-over-year. Also, our paid subscriptions showed strong double-digit growth. We have well over 1 billion paid subscriptions across the services on our platform, more than double the number that we had only four years ago. Finally, we continue to build on the breadth and the quality of our current services. From Oscar-nominated theatrical releases with Apple TV+ to more publications or News+ like The Atlantic and exciting new games on Arcade. Turning to Enterprise, we continue to see many business customers leverage Apple products to improve productivity and drive innovation. Target recently added the latest M3 MacBook Pro to their existing deployment of thousands of Mac’s, enabling employees across various departments to do their best work.\n\nIn emerging markets, Zoho, a leading technology company headquartered in India, offers its 15,000 plus global employees a choice of devices, with 80% of their workforce using iPhone for work and nearly two-thirds of them choosing Mac as their primary computer. With the upcoming launch of Apple Vision Pro, we are seeing strong excitement in Enterprise. Leading organizations across many industries such as Walmart, Nike, Vanguard, Stryker, Bloomberg, and SAP have started leveraging and investing in Apple Vision Pro as their new platform to bring innovative spatial computing experiences to their customers and employees. From everyday productivity to collaborative product design to immersive training, we cannot wait to see the amazing things our enterprise customers will create in the months and years to come.\n\nLet me now turn to our cash position and capital return program. We ended the quarter with $173 billion in cash and marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $4 billion, leaving us with total debt of $108 billion. As a result, net cash was $65 billion at the end of the quarter, and our goal of becoming net cash-neutral over time remains unchanged. During the quarter, we returned nearly $27 billion to shareholders, including $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $20.5 billion through open market repurchases of 112 million Apple shares. We also retired an additional 6 million shares in the final settlement of our 19th ASR. As usual, we will provide an update to our capital return program when we report results at the end of this quarter.\n\nAs we move ahead into the March quarter, I'd like to review our outlook, which includes the types of forward-looking information that Suhasini referred to at the beginning of the call. The color we are providing today assumes that the macroeconomic outlook doesn't worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. And we expect foreign exchange to be a revenue headwind of about 2 percentage points on a year-over-year basis. As a reminder, in the December quarter a year ago, we faced significant supply constraints on the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max due to COVID-19 factory shutdowns. And in the March quarter a year ago, we were able to replenish channel inventory and fulfill significant pent-up demand from the constraints. We estimate that this impact added close to $5 billion to the March quarter's total revenue last year.\n\nWhen we remove this impact from last year's revenue, we expect both our March quarter total company revenue and iPhone revenue to be similar to a year ago. For our Services business, we expect a similar double-digit growth rate to what we reported in the December quarter. We expect gross margin to be between 46% and 47%. We expect OpEx to be between $14.3 billion and $14.5 billion. We expect OI&E to be around $50 million, excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our Board of Directors has declared a cash dividend of $0.24 per share of common stock payable on February 15, 2024, to shareholders of record as of February 12, 2024. With that, let's open the call to questions.\n\nSuhasini Chandramouli: Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first question please?\n\nOperator: Certainly. We'll go ahead and take our first question from Erik Woodring with Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.\n\nSee also 15 Navies with the Most Submarines in the World and 40 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth.\n\nTo continue reading the Q&A session, please click here.",

        "content": "Meta stock is now more than 16% higher in premarket trade following a bumper earnings report on Thursday. (SOPA Images via Getty Images)\n\nMeta (META)\n\nMeta stock is now more than 16% higher in premarket trade following a bumper earnings report.\n\nOver the last four quarters Mark Zuckerberg's behemoth has beat EPS by some margin. In September, it was 82.4% higher than expected. December saw a beat of more than 7%.\n\nFourth quarter earnings were $40.1bn, beating the predicted $39.18bn and up 25% year-over-year.\n\nThe bottom line is that the pivot to artificial intelligence (AI) products has been one of the winning factors. AI remains one of Meta's main investment areas in 2024, with the company increasing its capex by $2bn in this area.\n\nThe company also announced it will pay a 50 cent-per-share dividend to investors for the first time, and has authorised a $50bn share buyback programme. This will net CEO Zuckerberg around $700m.\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations on Thursday and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead, Yahoo Finance US reported on Thursday night.\n\nNet sales came in at nearly $170bn versus expectations of $166.2bn. That's 14% higher than the almost $150bn the company generated during the same period in the prior year. The outlook for the current quarter also surpassed forecasts, with the company estimating an upper range of $143.5bn.\n\n“This Q4 was a record-breaking Holiday shopping season and closed out a robust 2023 for Amazon,” said CEO Andy Jassy in the earnings release.\n\nAmazon's muscular earnings report and subsequent investor response followed more critical receptions to some of its Big Tech siblings, which also largely beat estimates.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple revenues beat forecasts for Q1, coming in at $119.6bn, led by the iPhone which saw revenue of $69.7bn.\n\nApple's results were, however, marred last quarter by regional revenue from China, Greater China revenue came in well short of forecasts at $20.8bn, indicating that the squeeze on sales is starting to have an effect.\n\nApple management seems concerned that's going to continue, as this quarter is expected to be similar to last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nElsewhere in the business, iPad revenues hit $7bn, Mac revenues were at $7.8bn, and wearables hit $12bn, falling slightly short of forecasts. Services were also short of forecast at $23.1bn.\n\nRead more: Best UK mortgage deals of the week\n\n\"The next few months are likely to be challenging for Apple having to deal with regulatory issues in Europe over its App Store, while its Watch has been the subject of issues with respect to its blood oxygen feature,\" said Michael Hewson of CMC Markets.\n\n\"The launch of the Vision Pro at $3,500 is unlikely to shift the dial when it comes to sales given how costly it is. Apple is launching some new iPads which may prompt an uptick in sales in this area over the next quarter, but the iPhone remains its key revenue earner so the slowdown in China will be a concern, however the Indian market could offer a way out on this front.\"\n\nStock is down around 2.8% in premarket trade.\n\nPeloton (PTON)\n\nShares of Peloton Interactive fell more than 20% by the end of the day on Thursday, dropping to a record low as the fitness company reported mixed second-quarter results and its third-quarter revenue guidance of $700m to $725m fell short of expectations.\n\nIt also warned on missing future goals for positive free cash flow, as some of its initiatives underperform.\n\nWatch: Amazon beats forecasts with help from AI</p><p>On Thursday, it said sales rose 14% to $170 billion - almost $4 billion better than expected. </p><p>Profits also exceeded Wall Street expectations. </p><p>Investors cheered the numbers, sending Amazon shares up as much as 8% in after-hours trade. </p><p>Its e-commerce unit saw gains after building fulfilment centers closer to customers, enabling cheaper, faster deliveries. </p><p>But investors were more focused on future revenue streams, including from artificial intelligence. </p><p>Cloud unit Amazon Web Services is incorporating the tech into more and more products, and starting to see the benefits. </p><p>On a call with analysts, chief executive Andy Jassy said AI would drive tens of billions of dollars in sales over the next few years. </p><p>The company is pouring money into chatbot-maker Anthropic as part of those efforts. </p><p>That’s to match rival Microsoft, which is putting $10 billion into ChatGPT-maker OpenAI. </p><p>Investors are also expecting big gains from advertising revenue. </p><p>Amazon recently launched ads in its Prime Video streaming service, with customers having the option to pay more for an ad-free service. </p><p>Not all of the company’s ideas work out, however. </p><p>This week it dropped a bid to buy iRobot - maker of the Roomba vacuum cleaner - amid opposition from European regulators. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/7CweKRes1kwORH3kl8XG2w--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/0234a81a06cccc67b07f02f8dceaa314\",\"duration\":\"PT1M37S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/3299af0d-39db-34a5-b2b2-a535c9334873.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-beats-forecasts-help-ai-092759570.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"3299af0d-39db-34a5-b2b2-a535c9334873\"}",

It operates over 270 retail locations across the country.\n\nOn the eve of its release, Cook said the Vision Pro \"has been multiple years of efforts from so many people across Apple.\"\n\nThe starting price of the device is $3,499.99, though that cost can go up if a customer decides to go with more storage, according to the Apple website.\n\nAPPLE WATCHES GO ON SALE WITHOUT BLOOD OXYGEN SENSOR AMID PATENT DISPUTE\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nIts Friday debut comes two weeks after Apple kicked off Vision Pro pre-orders on Jan. 19.\n\nThe company notched 160,000 to 180,000 pre-orders on the weekend after they opened up, selling out at one point, according to an estimate from TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.

        "content": "Apple’s new mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, hit the market February 2nd. The company’s first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro kicks off a new era of computing for Apple. But a hefty price tag coupled with the fact that the AR/VR space is still an unproven market, mean that Apple is fighting an uphill battle out of the gate.\n\nHere are three things you need to know about the Vision Pro.\n\nThe price tag.\n\nThe Vision Pro starts at $3,499, far more expensive than rival Meta’s priciest headset: the Meta Quest Pro, which costs $999. That price tag will likely prove to be too rich for even Apple’s most ardent fans, especially given the AR/VR industry’s relatively niche position in the consumer tech space.\n\nApple is advertising the Vision Pro as a “spatial computer,” rather than a simple headset. You’ll use it for watching movies, playing games, and, importantly, productivity apps, since it can mirror your MacBook’s screen and display it as a massive window floating in space directly in front of you. Whether that’s worth the price of entry is up to Apple’s legion of customers.\n\nThe experience\n\nI used Apple’s Vision Pro headset immediately after the company debuted it at its WWDC in June 2023 and again just ahead of its launch, and everything you’ve heard about it being a mind-blowing experience is spot on. The incredibly high resolution, microOLED display is world’s sharper than any other headset I’ve used, making images and videos appear crisp and colorful, and ensuring you can easily read text. The interface is wildly easy to navigate thanks to eye and hand tracking cameras, and the fit is surprisingly comfortable. Though there is a separate corded battery that you’ll need to put on your desk or slide into your pocket.\n\nBut Apple also needs to ensure it has the app ecosystem to match. So far, the company says it has a vast library of apps, including versions of its iPad apps.

The company's first new product category in nearly a decade, the Vision Pro kicks off a new era of computing for Apple. But a hefty price tag coupled with the fact that the AR/VR space is still an unproven market mean that Apple is fighting an uphill battle out of the gate. Here are three things you need to know about the Vision Pro.\n\nNumber one, the price tag. The Vision Pro starts at $3,499. That's far more expensive than rival Meta's priciest headset, the Meta Quest Pro, which costs $999. That price will likely prove to be too rich for even Apple's most ardent fans, especially given the AR and VR industry's relatively niche position in the consumer tech space.\n\nApple is advertising the Vision Pro as a spatial computer rather than a simple headset. You'll use it for watching movies, playing games, and importantly, productivity apps since it can mirror your MacBook's screen and display it as a massive window floating in space directly in front of you. Whether that's worth the price of entry is up to Apple's legion of customers.\n\nNumber two, the experience. I used Apple's Vision Pro headset immediately after the company debuted it at WWDC in June 2023 and again, just ahead of its launch. And everything you've heard about it being a mind-blowing experience is spot on. The incredibly high-resolution micro OLED display is world's sharper than any other headset I've used, making images and videos appear crisp and colorful and ensuring you can easily read text.\n\nThe interface is wildly easy to navigate, thanks to eye-and-hand tracking cameras. And the fit is surprisingly comfortable. Though there is a separate corded battery that you'll need to put on your desk or slide into your pocket. Of course, Apple also needs to ensure it has the app ecosystem to match. So far the company says it has a vast library of apps, including versions of its iPad apps. But the tech giant will also need developers to dream up apps uniquely designed for the Vision Pro if Apple is going to get people to stick around past the honeymoon phase.\n\nNumber three, what does this mean for Apple? The Vision Pro is Apple's first new product category since it first unveiled the Apple Watch in 2014. And while the watch landed at a time when smartwatches and fitness trackers were already gaining steam among consumers, the Vision Pro comes at a time when headsets still make up an incredibly small number of consumer tech sales. Apple is also going up against Meta's quest line of products, which Counterpoint Research says made up 49% of the AR/VR headset market in Q3 2023.\n\nIf Apple can get consumers to look beyond the Vision Pro's price and convince its army of developers to build new fascinating apps for the headset, it could be the company's next smash hit. Stay tuned to Yahoo Finance to see if Apple can pull it off.",

        "content": "Social media giant Meta Platforms (META) reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analyst estimates on the top and bottom lines, with the company offering a strong outlook for the current quarter and announcing new shareholder return initiatives.\n\nFor the fourth quarter, Meta reported adjusted earnings per share (EPS) of $5.33 on revenue of $40.11 billion. Analysts were anticipating adjusted EPS of $4.94 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. The company reported revenue of $32.2 billion in the same quarter last year.\n\nThe company also boosted its stock buyback authorization by $50 billion and initiated a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share.\n\nIn the current quarter, Meta said it anticipates revenue of between $34.6 billion-$37 billion, surpassing analysts' expectations for revenues to tally $33.6 billion.\n\nShares of Meta soared, gaining as much as 17% in premarket trading on Friday.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue came in at $38.7 billion in the fourth quarter, beating expectations for $37.8 billion. The company also reported 2.11 billion Facebook daily active users. Wall Street was anticipating 2.07 billion.\n\nThe company reported ad impressions rose 21% over last year during the period while the average price per ad fell 2%.\n\nMeta's Reality Labs, however, continues to burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, lost another $4.65 billion, up from the $4.3 billion the company lost on the endeavor in the same period last year. Still, the division beat expectations on revenue, topping $1.07 billion versus an anticipated $812 million.\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nBut Meta's Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in the minds of investors amid increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company's long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere's no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it's capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Meta founder and CEO Mark Zuckerberg speaks during the Meta Connect event at Meta headquarters in Menlo Park, California, on September 27, 2023. (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn 2024, Meta expects its expenses to total $94 billion-$99 billion, with the company noting, among other things, that payrolls costs will rise this year as it adds more staff in higher-cost, technical roles amid its push into AI features.\n\nMeta also disclosed that in 2023 restructuring charges including severance and facilities consolidation totaled $3.45 billion. The company's headcount as of Dec. 31, 2023, stood at 67,317 down 22% over the prior year.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% over that period and outperforming the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nIn January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark.

        "content": "Apple boss Tim Cook has revealed the tech giant will make a big announcement about generative AI features on its devices “later this year”.\n\nMr Cook said the iPhone maker was spending a “tremendous amount of time and effort” on AI and would share more details of that work later in the year.\n\nMany of Apple’s rivals have made a number of announcements around generative AI – Samsung and Google have made the technology key parts of recent phone announcements – while Google has also followed Microsoft and introduced a chatbot or virtual assistant to their computing platforms in the wake of the success of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple’s Tim Cook has said that the company is looking to make a big announcement around generative AI (Niall Carson/PA)\n\nIn contrast, Apple has said little on the subject.\n\nBut speaking on a call following the announcement of the firm’s latest financial results, the Apple chief executive said he believed generative AI was a “huge opportunity” for the company.\n\n“As we look ahead, we will continue to invest in these and other technologies that shape our future. That includes AI, where we continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort and we’re excited to share details of our ongoing work in that space later this year,” he said.\n\nThe Apple boss did not give any further details but did confirm he was speaking about generative AI.\n\n“Let me just say that I think there’s a huge opportunity for Apple with generative AI and with AI, without getting into many more details or getting out ahead of myself.”\n\nThe hint of generative AI features to come follows reports from the US that the next version of Apple’s iPhone software – iOS 18 – which is due to be announced later this year, could be one of the biggest updates in the operating system’s history.\n\nOne of Apple’s biggest smartphone rivals, Samsung, released their latest flagship devices this week, complete with a wide range of generative AI-powered features, including translation and transcription tools, as well as new photo editing capabilities.\n\nGoogle has made similar AI-powered tools a key selling point of its Pixel smartphone range in recent years.\n\nIn its latest financial results, Apple reported revenue of 119.58 billion dollars (£93.74 billion), up 2% on the same three-month period last year.",

        "content": "By Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh\n\nBEIJING (Reuters) -Apple's weak China sales performance may have shocked investors, but customers and analysts have been noting the rising challenges the company faces in its third-largest market.\n\nIntensifying competition from domestic rivals, coupled with longer upgrade cycles as consumers spend more cautiously amid an economic slowdown, have stunted Apple's China growth, with sales there nosediving by 13% in the quarter ending in December to $20.8 billion and missing estimates of $23.5 billion.\n\nShares of the company dipped about 3% in premarket trading on Friday, following the disappointing China sales.\n\n\"Apple's sales decline in China is not surprising given the strong competition it faced from local brands like Huawei and Xiaomi,\" said Toby Zhu, an analyst with research group Canalys.\n\nApple did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nAs the world's largest smartphone market, China is crucial to Apple's sales growth. For years, Apple has been the premium phone brand of choice in the country but the tide is now turning.\n\nThe pressure on Apple intensified in the second half of the year after Huawei's comeback in the high-end smartphone market with its Mate 60 series phones powered by a domestically-made chip.\n\nOther leading Android brands like Xiaomi also edged into the high-end turf that Apple has traditionally dominated. Xiaomi launched its premium Mi 14 model in October, touting its long battery life and camera capabilities. It sold 1 million units within a week of launch.\n\nCanalys' Zhu said Chinese manufacturers are gradually breaking into Apple's core price segment by introducing higher-priced foldable products.\n\nChinese consumers have also complained about a lack of innovation in Apple's iPhones, particularly in the design aesthetic, compared to earlier iterations.\n\n\"Another hurdle Apple needs to overcome is how it could bring more wow factors to the buyers and sustain its image as a tech pioneer. This is especially crucial when other Android vendors are now bringing foldables and AI to their products,\" said Will Wong, an smartphone analyst with IDC.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the same time, Chinese customers are holding on to handsets for longer because of the economic slowdown. Consultancy Counterpoint said in June that the replacement cycle was over 40 months.\n\nTo support its Chinese sales, Apple has cut prices. A massive discounting campaign by online retailers including Alibaba and Pinduoduo in October to clear iPhone 15 stock, just a month after it was launched in the country. In January, Apple offered rare discounts on its iPhones.\n\nThe October discounting effort seemed to only stem the decline, with Apple's phone shipments dropping by just 2.1% in the final quarter of 2023, while Huawei's sales increased by 36.2%, according to data from research group IDC.\n\nApple will likely continue to face pressure in China going forward. Jefferies analysts predict Apple's shipments in China will decline by a double digit percentage in 2024.\n\n\"The big miss in China is concerning as it could be the start of a longer downward trend there\", said Bob O'Donnell at TECHnalysis Research.\n\n(Reporting by Yelin Mo and Brenda Goh; Editing by Christian Schmollinger)",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe years of cost efficiency being enough are over and investors showered by gains from Big Tech are looking for more.\n\nPrimed by towering expectations of an AI-fueled transformation and narratives of relentless growth, the market is applying the same cutthroat logic of more with less.\n\nBut instead of executives touting their efficiency to eke through tough quarters, it’s shareholders applying the pressure for perfection.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) and Microsoft (MSFT) were on the receiving end of the squeeze this week. The pair surpassed analyst expectations but investors fixated on the perceived weak points, collectively pining for outstanding results to justify holding expensive stocks.\n\nBut the areas that appeared softer — ad revenue and cloud growth — only seemed squishy when investors applied a harsh rubric to the trillion-dollar giants. It's not enough for results to flirt with forecasted figures, or beat them. Only a smashing success can fully satiate Big Tech shareholders.\n\nMeta (META) and Amazon (AMZN) delivered the goods on Thursday, offering strong outlooks for the months ahead, and in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's case, introducing a sweetener: a new dividend. Investors rejoiced.\n\nThe forking paths of Big Tech's siblings this week highlight the unforgiving judgment of investors accustomed to abundance. Doing merely great isn't going to cut it.\n\nAs analyst Dan Ives said, following what he saw as a successful Microsoft report, the quarter \"should be printed out and hung in the Louvre.\" A view of the scene after activists hurled soup at the glass protecting the Mona Lisa at the Louvre Museum in Paris on Sunday. This is also how investors reacted to Microsoft's quarter. (Clement Lanot/AP Photo) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBut investors figuratively opted to skip the exhibit, highlighting the mismatch between inflated desire and what booming enterprises can deliver.\n\nInvestors expressed other financial qualms among otherwise thriving businesses. The grand pitch that executives are selling about AI’s transformative power apparently also comes with some fine print in the form of heavy up-front investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet reported capital expenditures that ballooned 45% for the quarter, exceeding $11 billion. Microsoft too recorded a 55% increase in capex. The boosted spending in Alphabet’s case was tied mostly to servers and data centers, the company said, as it prepares for the long-term growth potential of global AI applications.\n\nAnd there’s more where that came from. CFO Ruth Porat said that investment in capex will be noticeably larger in 2024. The tech, just like popular excitement, can be a challenge to prop up.\n\nEven purchasing the fuel to drive the dream of AI dominance can count against you.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

(Guy Bell)\n\nEuropean markets were higher in early trade on Friday, with mood buoyed by surging tech stocks in the US. The rises also follow a cluster of central bank interest rate decisions earlier in the week, where both the US Federal Reserve and Bank of England opted to keep rates on hold.\n\nThe FTSE 100 (^FTSE) rose 0.3% in early trade with European indexes such as the Dax (^GDAXI) and CAC (^FCHI) also buoyed on Friday following a raft of tech earnings in the US. The pan-European STOXX 600 (^STOXX) opened 0.4% higher. Facebook and Instagram parent Meta (META) is among tech giants that reported quarterly results on Thursday. Its stock is up more than 15% in premarket trade after it announced its first dividend.

Its revenue saw a 25% increase year-over-year, reaching $40.11 billion and exceeding the consensus of $39.02B.\n\nLooking ahead to Q1/24, Meta Platforms anticipates revenue between $34.5B and $37B, which is above the consensus estimate of $33.83B.\n\nThe company also declared its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.50, with a scheduled payment date of March 26, offering an annual dividend yield of 0.5%.

Shares of Apple dropped over 2% in pre-market today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant reported earnings of $2.18 per share with a revenue of $119.58B, outperforming analyst forecasts, which expected an EPS of $2.10 on revenue of $118.06B. Despite these strong overall results, revenue from greater China experienced a 13% decline to $20.82B, contributing to the underperformance in iPhone sales amid a tough competitive backdrop. iPhone revenue, which makes up about half of total revenue, rose to $69.70B from $65.78B a year earlier but missed estimates of $67.82B.\n\nAlphabet shares plunge amid higher AI spending forecast\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), experienced a 7% drop in its stock price on Wednesday after announcing its Q4 results and revealing that capital expenditures in 2024 will significantly increase compared to the previous year.\n\nThis increase in spending is part of the company's strategic initiative to enhance its AI capabilities, aiming to improve performance across its crucial advertising and cloud services units.\n\nDespite facing weaker-than-expected advertising growth in Q4, Alphabet's strong cloud business performance contributed to the company's revenue and profit surpassing Wall Street's forecasts.\n\nFor Q4, Alphabet reported an EPS of $1.64, above the analyst prediction of $1.59. The company's revenue for the quarter was $86.31B, exceeding the consensus estimate of $85.23B.\n\nUPS falls 8% on weak outlook\n\nShares of United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) tumbled over 8% on Tuesday following the announcement of its Q4 results, which were mixed, and its guidance fell short of expectations.\n\nThe logistics giant reported an adjusted EPS of $2.47 for the quarter, matching the consensus among analysts. However, its quarterly revenue of $24.92B represented a 7.8% decrease year-over-year and was below the anticipated $25.41B.\n\nLooking forward to 2024, UPS projected its full-year revenue to range between $92.0B and $94.5B, aiming for a consolidated adjusted operating margin of about 10.0% to 10.6%. This projection is below the analysts' expectations, who had forecasted full-year sales to reach $95.6B.\n\nFurthermore, UPS management announced plans to cut 12,000 jobs as part of a strategy to achieve $1B in cost reductions.\n\nTake your investing game to the next level in 2024 with ProPicks\n\nInstitutions and billionaire investors worldwide are already well ahead of the game when it comes to AI-powered investing, extensively using, customizing, and developing it to bulk up their returns and minimize losses.\n\nNow, InvestingPro users can do just the same from the comfort of their own homes with our new flagship AI-powered stock-picking tool: ProPicks.\n\nWith our six strategies, including the flagship Beat the S&P 500, which outperformed the market by a lofty 747% over the last decade, investors have the best selection of stocks in the market at the tip of their fingers every month.\n\nSubscribe here for up to 50% off as part of our year-end sale and never miss a bull market again!\n\nRelated Articles\n\nThis week in earnings: Meta jumps 16% following blockbuster results, UPS sinks\n\nKnight-Swift raises quarterly dividend to $0.16 per share\n\nHomes.com secures 43rd in SISTRIX IndexWatch 2023",

        "title": "Apple loses $84 billion in value after reporting weak sales in China, the ‘most competitive smartphone market in the world’",
        "content": "Apple should have been enjoying the release of its most recent quarterly results. The iPhone manufacturer returned to quarterly sales growth for the three months ending Dec. 30, after four straight quarters of declines. Sales of the iPhone rose 6% to $69.7 billion, and the company's services business hit a record high of $23.1 billion. Apple's overall revenue grew to $119.6 billion, beating analyst expectations.\n\nApple, in fact, did well everywhere—with one major exception. Sales in Greater China, which includes mainland China, Hong Kong and Taiwan, declined by 13% year-on-year, a larger decline that what analysts predicted. China is one of Apple's most important markets, after the U.S. and Europe.\n\nApple shares dropped 2.9% in extended trading after the iPhone maker released its quarterly results, wiping $84 billion of the company's market valuation. Apple's decline comes amid a good day for the overall U.S. tech sector, after bumper earnings from Meta and Amazon lifted their shares by 15.2% and 7.1% in after-hours trading respectively.\n\nInvestors may be worried about more than just weak China sales. Apple chief financial officer Luca Maestri warned that year-on-year comparisons for the current quarter will be distorted by a post-COVID surge in demand in early 2023. Maestri suggested that this quarter's sales will be roughly equal to sales a year ago—after removing approximately $5 billion worth of post-COVID revenge spending.\n\nApple can at least take comfort in its sales elsewhere in Asia. The company's Japan revenue hit $10.16 billion, ahead of analyst expectations, and Cook claimed that iPhone sales in South Korea hit a record high. The company also had record December-quarter revenue from emerging markets including India and Indonesia.\n\n\"The positive emerging market offset is a welcome news, but China remains a slight concern,\" Counterpoint Research's senior analyst Ivan Lam wrote in a research note. \"We’ll see whether Apple will get aggressive on pricing over the critical weeks before Chinese New Year.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nChina competition\n\nApple has tried to boost sales of the iPhone 15 series in China, including offering a rare discount ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday.\n\nThe firm's CEO Tim Cook called China \"the most competitive smartphone market in the world\" in an interview with Reuters. The company is the top-selling smartphone manufacturer in mainland China, according to research from IDC and Counterpoint Research, yet it faces the dual whammy of cooling consumer spending and more affordable offerings from local brands.\n\nApple's biggest Chinese competitor is Huawei, which released a new line of smartphones powered by advanced chips made in China. The release of Huawei's Mate 60 Pro sparked a wave of nationalistic pride in the country, as state media trumpeted the Chinese company's ability to withstand U.S. sanctions. Huawei had the biggest jump in market share for the final quarter of 2023, according to data from Counterpoint.\n\nFellow Chinese brands Xiaomi and HONOR also increased their market share for the last three months of 2023.\n\nChinese consumers are also turning to new foldable designs developed by companies like Huawei and HONOR. Over two-thirds of consumers are open to getting a foldable phone as their next device purchase, HONOR chief marketing officer Ray Guo claimed at the Fortune Global Forum last November.\n\nFoldables are \"a very popular and fast-growing segment in China,\" IDC analyst Nabila Popal told Reuters, also noting that \"Apple does not have a foldable device—yet.\"\n\nApple is also losing ground on the low-end of the market. Consumers that would otherwise buy older iPhone models are instead turning to locally-made products, Lam wrote.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures largely climbed higher Friday, boosted by generally positive corporate earnings ahead of the release of the widely-watched monthly jobs report.\n\nBy 06:10 ET (11:10 GMT), the Dow Jones Futures contract was largely unchanged, while S&P 500 Futures traded 25 points, or 0.5%, higher and Nasdaq 100 Futures climbed 165 points, or 1%.\n\nThe main U.S. averages closed higher Wednesday, rebounding from the post-Federal Reserve meeting losses as a generally positive earnings season helped the mood turn more optimistic.\n\nThe blue chip Dow Jones Industrial Average closed almost 370 points, or 1%, higher, while both the broad-based S&P 500 and the tech-heavy NASDAQ Composite gained 1.3%.\n\nMeta Platforms pays first-ever dividend\n\nHelping the stock market gains continue Friday was generally positive earnings from the mega-cap tech sector after the close of the previous session.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) stock surged in premarket trading after profit at the Facebook parent tripled from a year earlier, resulting in the tech giant paying a dividend for the first time as well as an additional $50 billion in share buybacks.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also gained after the online retailing giant swung back to a full-year profit of more than $30 billion, announcing $170 billion in quarterly sales.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) provided the blip to the positivity, as although the iPhone maker’s fiscal first-quarter results beat expectations, sales of its key product disappointed following weakness in China amid rising competition.\n\n\"Apple’s worrying China sales figures indicate demand for its high-end iPhones is slowing more than expected in the face of rising competition from local companies, including Huawei,\" Jesse Cohen, senior analyst at Investing.com, said Thursday.\n\nThe earnings season continues Friday, with results due from the likes of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nStory continues\n\nNonfarm payrolls loom large\n\nThe widely-watched monthly jobs report is due later in the session, and will provide investors - and Fed officials - with another data point from the labor market to help guide the path of interest rates going forward.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to have added 187,000 new jobs in January, slowing from 216,000 the prior month, with the jobless rate ticking up to 3.8% from 3.7%.\n\nThis would come after a surprise jump in jobless claims and a weak private payrolls report earlier in the week.\n\nA downside miss in payrolls could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, potentially bringing a March rate cut back into play.\n\nThe Federal Reserve kept interest rates on hold at more than two-decade highs on Wednesday, but Chair Jerome Powell poured cold water on the idea of rate cuts as early as March in his accompanying press conference.\n\nCrude on track for hefty weekly loss\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were still on course for hefty weekly losses following unsubstantiated reports that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was being discussed.\n\nBy 06:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.5% higher at $74.22 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.5% to $79.09 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, kept its oil output policy unchanged on Thursday, likely ensuring supply remained tight in the first quarter of the year.\n\nHowever, both contracts were on course for weekly losses of around 5%, as an end to the war between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas would lessen the tensions in the Middle East, easing concerns about supply disruptions through this key oil-rich region.\n\n(Oliver Gray contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNasdaq futures gain after tech titans report; nonfarm payrolls loom\n\nComfort Systems USA expands with Utah acquisition\n\nLipocine transitions TLANDO commercialization to Verity Pharma",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Investors will keep a wary eye on the January jobs report later in the session for clues over the Fed's future interest rate path, while the quarterly corporate earnings season continues.The mega-cap tech sector is likely to drive sentiment, while the crude market is set to end the week with hefty losses.\n\n1. January payrolls in spotlight\n\nThe widely-watched monthly jobs report is due later in the session, and will offer a guide about the health of the U.S. labor market, potentially a key factor in influencing when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates.\n\nThe U.S. economy is expected to have added 187,000 new jobs in January, slowing from 216,000 the prior month, with the jobless rate ticking up to 3.8% from 3.7%.\n\nThis would come after a surprise jump in jobless claims and a weak private payrolls report.\n\nA downside miss in payrolls could indicate that the 525 basis points of rate increases delivered by the Fed since 2022 are finally starting to bite, potentially bringing a March rate cut back into play.\n\nTraders have been pushing back bets on the beginning of U.S. rate cuts this year, but fresh signs of softness in the labor market would justify the current pricing of more than 140 basis points of cuts by year's end.\n\n2. Futures mixed ahead of payrolls release\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely higher Friday ahead of key employment data, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq index set to outperform after strong results from Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) after the previous close.\n\nBy 05:05 ET (10:05 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, S&P 500 futures climbed 25 points or 0.5%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose 165 points, or 1%.\n\nThe three main indices all closed around 1% higher on Thursday, rebounding after the post-Federal Reserve losses, helped by better-than-expected earnings largely across the board.\n\nInvestors will have a key economic release to digest Friday, the monthly jobs report [see above], while quarterly earnings continue to emerge, from the likes of Chevron (NYSE:CVX), Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), Bristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV).\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Meta and Amazon shine, while Apple disappointed\n\nThree of the mega-cap growth and technology stocks that have powered markets higher for much of the last year reported after Thursday’s market close, with differing impacts.\n\nThe shares of Meta Platforms and Amazon soared in after hours trade, adding a combined $280 billion in stock market value after the tech giants impressed investors with their quarterly results, while Apple's value shrank by $70 billion after its results.\n\nMeta delivered a 25% jump in revenue for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales, and the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nAmazon impressed as cloud growth met expectations while growth in online spending surged during the critical holiday shopping season.\n\nBy contrast, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) forecast a drop in iPhone sales and targeted overall revenue $6 billion below expectations, indicating that its signature product is losing ground in the key Chinese market.\n\n4. Nvidia value soared in January\n\nThe optimism surrounding the impact of artificial intelligence on corporate bottom lines was illustrated by the demand for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock this month.\n\nThe world's most valuable chipmaker saw its market value expand by a record $296.52 billion in January to around $1.52 trillion, surpassing the $248.23 billion in gains seen in May 2023.\n\nNvidia currently has a dominant position in the market for advanced AI chips, and plans to begin mass production later this year of an AI chip designed for its Chinese customers in order to comply with tightened U.S. export rules.\n\n5. Oil heading for hefty weekly loss\n\nOil prices edged higher Friday, but were still on course for hefty weekly losses following unsubstantiated reports that a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas was being discussed.\n\nBy 05:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded 0.7% higher at $74.33 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.7% to $79.23 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, kept its oil output policy unchanged on Thursday, likely ensuring supply remained tight in the first quarter of the year.\n\nThe group will next meet in March to decide whether or not to extend the voluntary oil production cuts in place for the first quarter.\n\nHowever, both contracts were on course for weekly losses of around 5%, as an end to the war between Israel and Iran-backed Hamas would lessen the tensions in the Middle East, easing concerns about supply disruptions through this key oil-rich region.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPayrolls, mega-cap tech earnings, Nvidia - what's moving markets\n\nGlobal equity funds draw inflows amid economic optimism and easing inflation\n\nShort on cash, El Salvador doubles down on Bitcoin dream",

        "content": "(Repeats late Thursday item with no change to text)\n\nBy Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra\n\nBENGALURU/NEW DELHI, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Tata Group is in advanced talks with Taiwan's Pegatron to form a partnership to run an iPhone assembly plant the Indian company is building in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.\n\nTata is building the iPhone assembly plant in Hosur city, which will be its second such facility in the country. The move comes as Apple and its contract manufacturers are rapidly expanding their India operations.\n\nTata is in talks to form a joint venture with Pegatron for the Hosur plant - its first such initiative - that would help speed up its plans to start manufacturing, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the talks are private and the deal has not been closed.\n\nThe Taiwanese firm would provide technical and engineering support at the plant, the sources said.\n\nPegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours in Taiwan. Tata and Apple also did not immediately respond.\n\nTata's success is crucial to Apple's ambitions. The U.S. firm has been diversifying beyond China following COVID-19 disruptions and geopolitical tensions and the proportion of iPhones made in India is expected to reach 20-25% this year, from 12-14% in 2023, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nTata's new plant with Pegatron is expected to have 20 lines for iPhone assembly, one of the sources said, adding that the Indian firm would hold a majority stake in the joint venture.\n\n\"Tata cannot build everything from scratch,\" said the second source, explaining the rationale behind the tie-up.\n\nTata's first iPhone assembly plant is in the southern state of Karnataka which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year.\n\nIndependently, Pegatron already operates an iPhone assembly plant in Tamil Nadu and is in talks to add a second facility. It currently accounts for about 10% of Apple's iPhone output in India, with Taiwan's Foxconn accounting for most of the rest.

        "title": "Apple China Slowdown Sparks Fears That Prized Market Is at Risk",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s latest quarterly results triggered investor fears that the company is losing clout in China, a long-prized market that generates roughly a fifth of its sales.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo Apple’s China Slump Deepens Even as Total Sales Grow Again QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Meta Plans $50 Billion Buyback in Bid to Win Over Investors\n\nRevenue from the region plunged 13% last quarter, marking the worst decline since the 2018 holiday season. The drop was jarring enough to overshadow otherwise strong results, which included Apple’s first overall sales growth in a year.\n\nBut the signs of trouble in China have been accumulating for months. The country’s government imposed stricter bans on the use of foreign technology in the workplace. Local rival Huawei Technologies Co. released a hot new smartphone touted as a local alternative to the iPhone. And Apple began offering rare discounts on its latest models.\n\nRead More: Is 2024 the Year US-China Tensions Finally Trip Up Apple?\n\nSales of iPads and wearable technology have been particularly weak in the country, adding up to a bleak picture. The company also warned that iPhone growth in the current quarter won’t be as strong as Wall Street anticipated, forcing analysts to rethink their projections. They went through a similar exercise with Apple’s previous earnings three months earlier.\n\n“We believe expectations need to move lower, yet again,” Brandon Nispel, an analyst at KeyBanc Capital Markets, said in a note to clients.\n\nChina’s importance to Apple goes beyond its status as the company’s third-largest market by revenue. It’s the country where Apple produces the vast majority of its devices, but also a tantalizing growth opportunity thanks to its 1.4 billion people and expanding middle class.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts Thursday, executives said their faith in China wasn’t shaken. Apple’s installed base is still growing, and current customers continue to upgrade their devices, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said. Still, iPhone revenue fell by a percentage in the mid-single digits when holding currency rates constant.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I remain very optimistic about China over the long term,” Cook said.\n\nChief Financial Officer Luca Maestri described the phone sector in China as the “most competitive market in the world.” And Apple isn’t the only player struggling to grow. Several of the top mobile makers saw shipments decrease last quarter, according to IDC. In fact, Apple took first place in the market because it didn’t shrink as much as others, the research firm said.\n\nRead More: iPhone Takes Top Spot in China for First Time Despite Challenges\n\nBut Huawei has bucked the downward trend. The company — blacklisted by the US over national security concerns — saw shipments surge 36% in China. That vaulted it to fourth place.\n\nThe technology company launched the Mate 60 Pro phone last year just before the iPhone 15 went on sale. The Huawei device, which runs on Chinese-made chips, is benefiting from a renewed wave of nationalism in the country.\n\nThat’s led to countermeasures. Last month, Apple began offering discounts of as much as 500 yuan ($70) on the iPhone 15 — a step it doesn’t usually have to take. The markdown was equivalent to about 5% off its top-of-the-line model.\n\nA resurgent Huawei and other manufacturers are posing a bigger threat than before, said Ivan Lam, an analyst at Counterpoint Research. In some cases, consumers are buying those brands rather than older iPhone 13 and 14 models, he said.\n\n“This is a competitive issue,” Lam said.\n\n--With assistance from Charlotte Yang.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nA Brutal Crime Crackdown Is Emboldening Leaders Across Latin America Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "title": "Skyworks Solutions Stock (NASDAQ:SWKS): Gearing Up for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Skyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS), a leading semiconductor company headquartered in California, had a disappointing 2023 in the market, with the chip sector facing several headwinds. Now, Skyworks stock is finally gearing up for a bull run with the demand environment continuing to show improvements, as evident from the company’s Q1-2024 earnings released on January 30. I am bullish on Skyworks, as I believe the company is attractively valued at a time when its prospects are improving.\n\nThe Improving Demand Outlook\n\nFor the first quarter of Fiscal 2024, Skyworks reported revenue of $1.2 billion and earnings per share of $1.97. The company generated record operating cash flows of $775 million for the quarter and record free cash flows of $753 million. These achievements came on the back of a near-10% year-over-year decline in revenue, highlighting the noteworthy efficiency improvements booked by the company to start the new Fiscal year on the right foot.\n\nSkyworks is booking efficiency gains at a time when the semiconductor sector is beginning to turn a corner. This is encouraging news for investors.\n\nAccording to Gartner (NYSE:IT), global semiconductor revenue declined by 11% in 2023 due to an inventory glut that stemmed from waning demand for high-performance chips. However, inventory levels are expected to normalize this year, paving the way for chip manufacturers to convert the surging demand for chips into financial gains. Gartner predicts global semiconductor revenue to grow by 17% this year to $624 billion.\n\nDuring the Q1 earnings call, Skyworks CEO Liam Griffin confirmed the ongoing recovery in demand and highlighted the stabilizing demand environment across Android ecosystems. The CEO went on to claim that excess supply conditions are abating and that inventory levels at the OEM level are normalizing. These remarks suggest Skyworks will be a beneficiary of the improving prospects for the chip sector this year.\n\nLeading Android smartphone manufacturers, including Samsung and Oppo, have struck a bullish stance for 2024, which is good news for Skyworks. Global smartphone shipments declined in both 2022 and 2023, but IDC projects unit shipments to grow by a modest 4% this year, marking the beginning of a new cycle in which smartphone shipments will continue growing through 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis improving outlook for the smartphone sector should enable Skyworks to grow in the foreseeable future. Skyworks is one of the leading component suppliers to Android smartphone makers and is also a major supplier of chips to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The Mobile segment accounted for 71% of revenue in Q1, while the Broad Markets segment accounted for the remainder.\n\nApple is the largest customer of Skyworks and generally accounts for more than half of its revenue. This high concentration on one customer increases the business risk for the company, but so far, Skyworks has managed this risk commendably by emerging as an indispensable partner of Apple that produces advanced chips with high radio frequency content. In the 5G era, smartphone manufacturers are trying to partner with chip companies with proven experience in delivering high-quality components, and Skyworks is one.\n\nInvestments, New Partnerships, and Diversification Efforts\n\nSkyworks Solutions is investing in its future by focusing on strategic investments in product development to position the company to secure more design wins in key market segments. The company continues to look for value-accretive partnerships as well. Examples of recent deals include the expansion of its WiFi design pipeline with key partners such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO), Linksys, and TP-link.\n\nSkyworks is investing in next-generation wireless standards such as WiFI 6E and 7 as well, which should enable the company to play a critical role in the ongoing upgrade cycle.\n\nIn a bid to diversify revenue sources, Skyworks is actively expanding into new market segments, which is another promising sign. In Q1, the company secured several design wins in the infrastructure development sector, including optical transport products for a leading, undisclosed operator in India. The company also reported a few design wins in the automotive sector, covering telematics, infotainment systems, and onboard chargers with a few OEMs.\n\nIs Skyworks Solutions Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nSkyworks may face some pressure if Apple iPhone sales lose some steam in 2024 amid inflationary pressures. Plus, Wall Street analysts seem divided on the prospects for the company.\n\nFor instance, on January 10, BMO Capital Markets identified Skyworks as a best-in-class growth company trading at a reasonable valuation in addition to 24 other tech companies. According to BMO (NYSE:BMO), these 25 companies could outperform the broad market this year, even if the momentum behind tech stocks loses some strength.\n\nKeyBank Capital Markets, however, struck a cautious stance for Apple’s key suppliers, as the research firm believes demand for Apple devices will not be impressive in 2024.\n\nOverall, based on the rating of 23 Wall Street analysts, SWKS stock comes in as a Moderate Buy. The average Skyworks stock price target is $111.68, which implies upside of 8.5% from the current market price.\n\nDespite the seemingly limited upside potential based on Wall Street rankings, Skyworks stock seems well-positioned to turn a corner this year, aided by the improving demand environment for the semiconductor sector.\n\nCheaply Valued\n\nSkyworks Solutions, at a forward P/E of 14.8, looks cheaply valued at a time when the chip sector is setting up for a breakout after two consecutive years of disappointing performance. For context, during the previous up-cycle in 2019 and 2020, Skyworks traded at average P/E multiples of close to 20. With the chip sector turning a corner today, it seems reasonable to expect Skyworks to enjoy an expansion in valuation multiples this year.\n\nThe quarterly dividend of 68 cents per share, coupled with stock buybacks, improves the investment appeal of Skyworks further.\n\nThe Takeaway: Skyworks is Cheap and Attractive\n\nSkyworks Solutions is nearing an inflection point, with the semiconductor industry projected to register positive growth this year after a disappointing 2023. Skyworks is strategically investing in new products and partnerships to drive earnings growth, and the company seems to be trading at an attractive valuation amid the continued demand stabilization in the chip sector.\n\nDisclosure",

        "title": "Why Apple is pushing the term 'spatial computing' along with its new Vision Pro headset",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — With Apple's hotly anticipated Vision Pro headset hitting store shelves Friday, you're probably to start to see more people wearing the futuristic googles that are supposed to usher in the age of “spatial computing.”\n\nIt's an esoteric mode of technology that Apple executives and their marketing gurus are trying to thrust into the mainstream while avoiding other more widely used terms such as “augmented reality” and “virtual reality” to describe the transformative powers of a product that’s being touted as potentially monumental as the the iPhone that came out in 2007.\n\n“We can't wait for people to experience the magic,” Apple CEO Tim Cook gushed Thursday while discussing the Vision Pro with analysts.\n\nThe Vision Pro also will be among Apple's most expensive products at $3,500 — a price point that has most analysts predicting the company may only sell 1 million or fewer devices during its first year. But Apple only sold about 4 million iPhones during that device's first year on the market and now sells more than 200 million of them annually, so there is a history of what initially appear to be a niche product turning into something that becomes enmeshed in how people live and work.\n\nIf that happens with the Vision Pro, references to spatial computing could become as ingrained in modern-day vernacular as mobile and personal computing — two previous technological revolutions in technology that Apple played an integral role in creating.\n\nSo what is spatial computing? It's a way to describe the intersection between the physical world around us and a virtual world fabricated by technology while enabling humans and machines to harmoniously manipulate objects and spaces. Accomplishing these tasks often incorporates elements of augmented reality, or AR, and artificial intelligence, or AI — two subsets of technology that are helping to make spatial computing happen, said Cathy Hackl, a long-time industry consultant who is now running a startup working on apps for the Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\n“This is a pivotal moment,” Hackl said. “Spatial computing will enable devices to understand the world in ways they never have been able to do before. It is going to change human to computer interaction, and eventually every interface — whether it's a car or a watch — will become spatial computing devices.”\n\nIn a sign of the excitement surrounding the Vision Pro, more than 600 newly designed apps will be available to use on the headset right away, according to Apple. The range of apps will include a wide selection of television networks, video streaming services (although Netflix and Google's YouTube are notably absent from the list) video games and various educational options. On the work side of things, videoconferencing service Zoom and other companies that provide online meeting tools have built apps for the Vision Pro, too.\n\nBut the Vision Pro could expose yet another disturbing side of technology if its use of spatial computing is so compelling that people start seeing the world differently when they aren't wearing the headset and start to believe life is far more interesting when seen through through the goggles. That scenario could worsen the screen addictions that have become endemic since the iPhone's debut and deepen the isolation that digital dependence tends to cultivate.\n\nApple is far from the only prominent technology company working on spatial computing products. For the past few years, Google has been working on a three-dimensional videoconferencing service called “Project Starline” that it draws upon “photorealistic” images and a “magic window” so two people sitting in different cities feel like they are in the same room together. But Starline still hasn't been widely released. Facebook's corporate parent, Meta Platforms, also has for years been selling the Quest headset that could be seen as a platform for spatial computing, although that company so far hasn't positioned the device in that manner\n\nVision Pro, in contrast, is being backed by company with the marketing prowess and customer allegiance that tend to trigger trends.\n\nAlthough it might be heralded as a breakthrough if Apple realizes its vision with Vision Pro, the concept of spatial computing has been around for at least 20 years. In a 132-page research paper on the subject published in 2003 by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Simon Greenwold made a case for automatically flushing toilets to be a primitive form of spatial computing. Greenwold supported his reasoning by pointing out the toilet “senses the user's movement away to trigger a flush” and “the space of the system's engagement is a real human space.”\n\nThe Vision Pro, of course, is far more sophisticated than a toilet. One of the most compelling features in the Vision Pro is its high-resolution screens that can play back three-dimensional video recordings of events and people to make it seem like the encounters are happening all over again. Apple already laid the groundwork for selling the Vision Pro by including the ability to record what it calls “spatial video” on the premium iPhone 15 models released in September.\n\nApple's headset also reacts to a user movements through hand gestures and eye in an attempt to make the device seem like another piece of human physiology. While wearing the headset, users will also be able use just their hands to to pull up and arrange an array of virtual computer screens, similar to a scene featuring Tom Cruise in the 2002 film, “Minority Report.”\n\nSpatial computing “is a technology that's starting to adapt to the user instead of requiring the user adapting to the technology,” Hackl said. “It's all supposed to be very natural.”\n\nIt remains to be seen how natural it may seem if you are sitting down to have dinner with someone else wearing the goggles instead of intermittently gazing at their smartphone.",

        "title": "Tim Cook pitches Apple’s new Vision Pro headset as a must-have for businesses despite augmented reality’s checkered history in the workplace",
        "content": "Apple Vision Pro: coming to an office near you.\n\nApple has largely built its success selling to individual consumers, but the tech giant is doubling down on its enterprise business, especially when it comes to its new mixed reality headset, CEO Tim Cook said on an earnings call with investors and analysts on Thursday.\n\n“We really concluded that we can do both,” Cook said.\n\nThe reason—a change in workplace habits that gives employees more say over which devices they use at work. “What has happened over the last several years is that employees are in a position in many companies to choose their own technology that is the best for them,” Cook said. “That is a huge advantage for Apple.”\n\nWhile Mac and iPad have long benefitted from this shift, the shiny new opportunity is with Vision Pro, which launches in stores on Friday for $3,500 each, he said. The headset offers access to more than 1 million apps, of which 600 were specifically created for the device. In the call, Cook cited a “very cool merchandising app” from Walmart, along with apps that employees from unnamed companies can use when working out in the field and for controlling equipment. Nike, Vanguard, SAP, and Bloomberg were also name-checked during the call as working to bring the Vision Pro to their customers and employees.\n\n“It’s some of the most innovative things I’ve seen come out of enterprise in a long time,” Cook said, adding “I think there will be a great opportunity for us in enterprise.”\n\nHowever, he avoided any specific predictions about Vision Pro sales, to businesses or otherwise.\n\nIn the past, companies selling smart wearable technologies have often pivoted to corporate sales after slow consumer adoption. For example, Meta tried to woo businesses into adopting its Meta Quest Pro virtual reality headset in 2022 with a slew of enterprise services, including integrations with Microsoft Teams and Windows 365. But the move doesn’t appear to have made a dent. Meta’s Reality Labs division, which includes revenue from Quest Pro, posted a record quarterly operating loss on Thursday. Meanwhile, Alphabet’s smart glasses product Google Glass, and once hot augmented reality startup Magic Leap, also pivoted in recent years to selling to corporations after sales to consumers stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn its fiscal first-quarter earnings on Thursday, Apple slightly beat Wall Street’s expectations for revenue and earnings, posting $120 billion in sales, up 2% from the same time last year, reversing four straight quarters of declines. Net income was $33.9 billion, up 13% from the same period  last year. However, the Greater China market—which is suffering from economic turmoil and a shift to cheaper Chinese-made phones—still presents a challenge, with sales in the region down 13% year-over-year.\n\nApple’s shares fell 3% in after-hours trading at $180.89 per share.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com",

        "content": "Earnings season is always an exciting time to be an investor, as companies finally pull the curtain back and unveil what’s transpired behind the scenes. The 2023 Q4 cycle looks to be another critical period, particularly as investors look to find further clues about what lies ahead in 2024 overall.\n\nOne company in particular, Meta Platforms META, saw its shares melt higher post-earnings, with investors swarming. On the contrary, Apple AAPL shares faced selling pressure. Let’s take a closer look at the releases.\n\nMeta Q4\n\nMeta has consistently posted robust earnings results lately, regularly exceeding our expectations and enjoying buying pressure following the releases. Concerning the report in focus, the technology titan generated $40.1 billion in sales, improving by a sizable 25% from the year-ago period.\n\nTop line results reflect a considerable acceleration, with the 25% jump penciling in the highest year-over-year growth rate in eight quarters.\n\nUndoubtedly to the likes of investors, Q4 costs and expenses fell 8% compared to the same period last year, and the company purchased over $6 billion in shares throughout the period. META’s improved operations have clearly led to significant benefits, with quarterly EPS of $5.33 well above the year-ago mark and easily surpassing the $4.83 Zacks Consensus EPS Estimate. Impressively, the company’s operating margin came in at 41%, crushing the year-ago figure of 20%.\n\nThe company’s platform also continues to expand, with Facebook daily and monthly active users growing by 6% and 3%, respectively. And its advertising business remains sound, with ad impressions delivered across its family of apps improving 21% year-over-year.\n\nMETA has consistently posted better-than-expected advertising revenue. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd to top off the robust results, the company unveiled its first-ever dividend, which is payable on March 26th to stockholders of record as of the close of business on February 22nd. Mark Zuckerberg on the results - ‘We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow. We've made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.’\n\nStory continues\n\nApple Q1\n\nConcerning headline figures, Apple posted quarterly revenue of $119.6 billion, climbing 2% year-over-year, and EPS of $2.18, up 16% from the year-ago mark and reflecting a record. Apple shares didn’t experience the same positivity as META, facing selling pressure post-earnings. It’s worth noting that the results snapped a four-quarter long streak of negative year-over-year revenue growth rates.\n\nNonetheless, there was much to like in the report, with Services revenue of $23.1 billion reflecting a record and jumping 11.3% from the same period last year. iPhone revenues also showed growth, with $69.7 billion in quarterly revenue 6% higher year-over-year and exceeding our consensus expectations by a modest 1.5%.\n\nInterestingly enough, iPhone results snapped a back-to-back streak of negative surprises. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nUnsurprisingly, Apple continued to flex its cash-generating abilities, posting nearly $40 billion of operating cash flow. Margin expansion was also prevalent, moving higher from 42.9% to 45.6%.\n\nThe negative reaction among shares could likely be attributed to worries stemming from demand in China. Revenues in China totaled $20.8 billion, moving 13% lower year-over-year as the company faces competition in the area.\n\nBottom Line\n\nEarnings season is always an exciting time. Beloved market titans Apple AAPL and Meta Platforms META revealed their results after the close today. META shares soared on news of a dividend and improved profitability, whereas AAPL shares faced pressure following worries about demand in China.\n\nFor a detailed analysis of overall Q4 expectations, I invite you to view our weekly Earnings Trends report >>> Q4 Earnings: Tech Flexes Strong Growth\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Strong Session; After Hours Earnings from AAPL, AMZN, META &amp; More",
        "content": "Market activity got especially buoyant today, even after starting the session in the green across the board. What looked to be a short-term rally petering out gained steam around 11 am ET to close at session highs, on a series of data ranging from better-than-expected manufacturing and construction spending to hopes of a cease-fire in Gaza. The Dow finished up +369 points, +0.97%, while the S&P 500 was +1.25%. The Nasdaq and small-cap Russell 2000 both ended the trading day +1.30%.\r\n\r\nS&P Manufacturing PMI for January outperformed expectations by 60 basis points to 50.7, easily above the 50-point threshold demonstrating growth, while ISM Manufacturing PMI came in at 49.1% — below that 50 threshold but nicely higher than the 47.2% analysts were estimating. Construction Spending nearly doubled expectations to +0.9% from +0.5% anticipated, matching the previous month’s total. And even though a cease-fire in Gaza was not reached today, some earlier reports may have led investors to be more optimistic on this prospect today.\r\n\r\nToday’s big news, however, is here after the closing bell: earnings reports from some of the biggest names, including three of the so-called “Magnificent 7” stocks: Apple AAPL, Amazon AMZN and Meta Platforms META. This last comes just a day after CEO Mark Zuckerberg was grilled on Capitol Hill about safety concerns for children on their social media platforms. We also see results from specialty apparel firm Deckers Outdoor DECK.\r\n\r\nApple reported fiscal Q1 results ahead of estimates on both top and bottom lines this afternoon: earnings of $2.19 per share beat the Zacks consensus by a solid dime, and were nicely ahead of the $1.88 per share reported in the year-ago quarter. Revenues of $119.58 billion outpaced the $117.6 billion expected. But weakness in China, and missed expectations in the iPad and Wearables groups are helping the stock dip -1.9% in late trading.\r\n\r\nAmazon is doing much better, with Q4 earnings of $1.00 on revenues of a clean $170.0 billion easily surpassed the 80 cents per share and $166.26 billion analyst were looking for. Revenue guidance for next quarter of between $138-143.5 billion is still within the earlier expectations, but Operating Margins on the retail side grew by a very solid +6.1%. AWS sales reached $24.2 billion — up +13% year over year but exactly in-line with estimates. Shares are up +8.5% at this hour.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms came in at $5.33 per share on earnings and $40.1 billion in revenues after today’s close in its Q4 report. However, there seems to be some discrepancy on the bottom-line here, in particular with the previous year’s $1.76 per share as reported by the company; we had $3.00. Daily Active Users (DAU) rose +6% for the year to 2.11 billion, and the company now offers its first-ever monthly dividend of 50 cents per share. Meta has also reduced headcount by -22% year over year.\r\n\r\nDeckers Outdoor brought the real prize of the afternoon, however, with earnings of $15.11 trouncing the $11.40 in the Zacks consensus, on revenues of $1.56 billion versus $1.44 billion expected. These are record numbers on both revenues and earnings. With inventories down during the 2023 holiday season, it appears Deckers has hit the sweet spot, with Gross Margins up at +58.7% and $1.6 billion in cash.  Shares are up a solid +4.87% on this news.\r\n\r\nTomorrow morning, the big news will be the U.S. non-farm payroll data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), which is supposed to bring in roughly 185K new jobs, with an Unemployment Rate ticking slightly higher to 3.8%. However, if yesterday’s ADP private-sector jobs report and this morning’s Jobless Claims data are any indication, we may see some room for BLS figures to hit below their target tomorrow.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "By Noel Randewich\n\n(Reuters) - Meta Platforms and Amazon.com added a combined $280 billion in stock market value late on Thursday after the Big Tech duo reported quarterly results that impressed investors, while Apple's value shrank by $70 billion after its results.\n\nMeta's stock surged over 14% to a record high $451 after the bell, elevating its market capitalization by $148 billion to $1.16 trillion after the Facebook owner declared its first-ever dividend.\n\nWhile dividends are associated with mature, slow-growth companies, Meta delivered a 25% jump in revenue to $40.1 billion for the December quarter, fueled by robust advertising and device sales.\n\nAmazon's stock jumped 8% after the company beat December-quarter revenue expectations on strong growth in online spending during the critical holiday shopping season. That put the online shopping and cloud-computing heavyweight's market capitalization at $1.78 trillion.\n\nApple's quarterly results beat analysts' expectations, but its sales in China missed estimates and its stock dipped 3.3%. Apple faces tough competition in China, which has worried Wall Street in recent months.\n\nInvestor optimism about generative AI drove rallies in the U.S. stock market's most valuable companies last year, with many hitting all-time highs in recent sessions.\n\nMicrosoft in January eclipsed Apple as the world's most valuable company, with investors viewing Apple as lagging in the artificial-intelligence race between Wall Street's tech heavyweights.\n\nAsked on an investor call about generative AI, Apple CEO Tim Cook said, \"We've got some things that we're incredibly excited about that we'll be talking about later this year.\"\n\nMicrosoft's lead over Apple in stock market value will probably grow over the next five years thanks to its early advantage in AI, 13 analysts consulted last week by Reuters unanimously agreed.\n\n\"For Apple to be able to accelerate growth, we would need either a material contribution from new products like the Vision Pro or a generative AI driven cycle to come through the iPhone 16,\" D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria said following its results.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple starts U.S. sales of its Vision Pro mixed-reality headset on Friday.\n\nIn its report after the bell, Meta said its 2024 capital expenditures would reach between $30 billion and $37 billion, a $2 billion increase over its previous plan, driven by investments in servers, some of which will be used for AI.\n\nChipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices both climbed about almost 2% in extended trade, while server maker Super Micro Computer added 2%.\n\nThe extended-trade surge in Meta's market capitalization was equivalent to more than five times the entire $26 billion value of smaller social media rival Snap Inc.\n\n(Reporting by Noel Randewich in Oakland, California; Editing by Matthew Lewis)",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. reported a deepening slump in China during the holiday quarter, even as total iPhone sales were stronger than expected and the company returned to revenue growth.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo QQQ Up in Late Trading as Meta Soars, Apple Falls: Markets Wrap Lewis Hamilton to Join Ferrari F1 Team in 2025, Leaving Mercedes Deutsche Bank Plans To Cut 3,500 Jobs And Lift Payouts\n\nSales in China dropped 13% to $20.8 billion in the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 30, the company said in a statement Thursday. That fell far short of the $23.5 billion predicted by analysts and was Apple’s weakest December quarter in the Asian nation since the first period of 2020.\n\n“We are not happy with the decline, but we know China is the most competitive market in the world,” Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said in an interview with Bloomberg Television’s Emily Chang.\n\nThe shares dropped more than 3% in extended trading after the report was released. They had closed at $186.86 in New York on Thursday, down 2.9% this year.\n\nApple is contending with cooling consumer spending in China and widening government bans of foreign technology. The struggles overshadowed an overall revenue gain of 2.1% to $119.6 billion. Analysts had predicted an increase of 1% to $118 billion on average.\n\nWith the growth, Apple avoided posting a fifth straight quarter of declines — a streak that would have been its worst since a tailspin in the 1990s. The iPhone was a bright spot during the period, exceeding analysts’ estimates.\n\nThe earnings report also comes on the eve of Apple launching the Vision Pro headset. The device vaults the company into its first major new category since 2015 while steering Apple into unfamiliar terrain: virtual and augmented reality. The $3,499 headset lets people watch 3D videos, play games and conduct more immersive meetings.\n\nStory continues\n\nChief Executive Officer Tim Cook also said that Apple will make an announcement this year on artificial intelligence features, confirming earlier reports by Bloomberg. With Apple’s tech peers pouring money into AI right now, investors have been eagerly awaiting an update from the company on this topic.\n\nRead More: Vision Pro Is Latest Bid to Prove Consumers Can Embrace Headsets\n\nFirst-quarter profit climbed 16% to $2.18 a share, topping estimates of $2.11. The iPhone, Apple’s biggest moneymaker, brought in revenue of $69.7 billion, compared with an average projection of $68.6 billion.\n\nThe latest model, the iPhone 15, was a more significant upgrade than some previous iterations — with its higher-end versions adding new materials and camera features. The company also had an easier time getting the product to consumers than during the holidays of 2022, when Covid lockdowns in China trigged supply-chain snags. There were no such hiccups this time around.\n\nApple’s services segment, which includes the App Store and streaming platforms, continued to outpace other divisions. It brought in $23.1 billion during the holiday period, up 11% from a year earlier. Still, that was just shy of the $23.4 billion estimated by Wall Street.\n\nAs Apple forewarned in November, the iPad was a weak seller during the holidays. Its revenue declined 25% to $7.02 billion. Analysts had predicted $7.06 billion on average.\n\nIt didn’t help that Apple didn’t release any new models in the last calendar year — the first time that’s happened since the iPad debuted in 2010. But the company is preparing to unveil a bunch of new iPads as early as next month, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nApple refreshed its computer lineup in October with three new MacBook Pro models and a new iMac — powered by speedier M3 chips. That helped sales grow slightly to $7.78 billion, but they still came up short of the $7.9 billion estimate.\n\nRevenue from the company’s Wearables, Home and Accessories segment — which includes the Apple Watch, AirPods and its TV set-top box — fell 11% to $11.95 billion. Those products didn’t get significant upgrades this year, which may have hampered sales. Apple also was hit with a US ban on sales of its latest smartwatches over a patent dispute, but that played out after the Christmas shopping season. The company ultimately had to pull a blood-oxygen feature from the devices.\n\nRead More: Why Apple Had to Disable Oxygen Sensor in Its Watches\n\nMore broadly, Apple is facing one of the most tumultuous periods since Cook became CEO more than a decade ago. It’s under more regulatory pressure than ever, with new European Union laws forcing it to change its App Store policies. And even with the sales growth last quarter, many of its biggest markets are maturing. Though the Vision Pro could open up a new opportunity, the first version of the product is probably too costly and cumbersome for most consumers.\n\nChina was the biggest question mark heading into the earnings. Apple’s iPhone won market share in the region last year, but sales have continued to slide. The country also is home to the company’s main manufacturing hub, adding to its importance for Apple.\n\n“We continue to see significant opportunity for us in China in the long term,” Maestri said in the interview.\n\n--With assistance from Emily Chang.\n\n(Updates shares in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nElon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday Chinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) came out with quarterly earnings of $2.18 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $2.09 per share. This compares to earnings of $1.88 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.\n\nThis quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 4.31%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this maker of iPhones, iPads and other products would post earnings of $1.39 per share when it actually produced earnings of $1.46, delivering a surprise of 5.04%.\n\nOver the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.\n\nApple , which belongs to the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry, posted revenues of $119.58 billion for the quarter ended December 2023, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.66%. This compares to year-ago revenues of $117.15 billion. The company has topped consensus revenue estimates four times over the last four quarters.\n\nThe sustainability of the stock's immediate price movement based on the recently-released numbers and future earnings expectations will mostly depend on management's commentary on the earnings call.\n\nApple shares have lost about 4.2% since the beginning of the year versus the S&P 500's gain of 1.6%.\n\nWhat's Next for Apple?\n\nWhile Apple has underperformed the market so far this year, the question that comes to investors' minds is: what's next for the stock?\n\nThere are no easy answers to this key question, but one reliable measure that can help investors address this is the company's earnings outlook. Not only does this include current consensus earnings expectations for the coming quarter(s), but also how these expectations have changed lately.\n\nEmpirical research shows a strong correlation between near-term stock movements and trends in earnings estimate revisions. Investors can track such revisions by themselves or rely on a tried-and-tested rating tool like the Zacks Rank, which has an impressive track record of harnessing the power of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nStory continues\n\nAhead of this earnings release, the estimate revisions trend for Apple: mixed. While the magnitude and direction of estimate revisions could change following the company's just-released earnings report, the current status translates into a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for the stock. So, the shares are expected to perform in line with the market in the near future. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIt will be interesting to see how estimates for the coming quarters and current fiscal year change in the days ahead. The current consensus EPS estimate is $1.59 on $95.32 billion in revenues for the coming quarter and $6.59 on $392.79 billion in revenues for the current fiscal year.\n\nInvestors should be mindful of the fact that the outlook for the industry can have a material impact on the performance of the stock as well. In terms of the Zacks Industry Rank, Computer - Mini computers is currently in the top 24% of the 250 plus Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperform the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nHP (HPQ), another stock in the same industry, has yet to report results for the quarter ended January 2024.\n\nThis personal computer and printer maker is expected to post quarterly earnings of $0.89 per share in its upcoming report, which represents a year-over-year change of +18.7%. The consensus EPS estimate for the quarter has been revised 0.8% higher over the last 30 days to the current level.\n\nHP's revenues are expected to be $13.56 billion, down 2% from the year-ago quarter.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Meta chief Mark Zuckerberg speaking yesterday during a US Senate Judiciary Committee hearing on child safety - Susan Walsh/AP\n\nMark Zuckerberg’s Meta will pay up to $50bn to shareholders after it posted record revenues, sending profits soaring by 200pc.\n\nRevenues at the social media giant behind Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp hit more than $40bn for the three months to December. Its shares surged more than 13pc in after hours trading on Thursday night.\n\nQuarterly profits climbed threefold to $14bn as Meta’s advertising sales staged a marked recovery after it implemented sweeping layoffs last year in a drastic effort to cut costs. Meta’s workforce shrunk by a total of 22pc, equivalent to more than 19,000 staff.\n\nMr Zuckerberg also announced the social network giant, which turns 20 this month, would pay its first-ever dividend as a public company of 50 cents per share - worth a total of $1.25bn. Meta said it would begin regular dividend payouts for the first time and would also buy back an additional $50bn from shareholders.\n\nThe strong results came just days after Mr Zuckerberg was accused by US senators of putting profits before users’ safety.\n\nEmails from within Meta published ahead of a Senate hearing this week showed how Mr Zuckerberg rejected pleas from Sir Nick Clegg, the company’s head of global affairs, to hire dozens of staff to help protect children on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMr Zuckerberg told investors on Thursday: “We had a good quarter as our community and business continue to grow.\n\n“We’ve made a lot of progress on our vision for advancing AI and the metaverse.”\n\nMeta revealed close to half the world’s population has signed up to join the social media empire, with nearly 4bn people now using at least one of its apps on a regular basis.\n\nWhile politicians have threatened a crackdown on social media apps, Meta’s shares have climbed to record highs so far in 2024, up 14pc. Meta is now worth more than $1 trillion.\n\nSeparately last night, Apple revealed its first rise in sales in more than a year as demand for its latest iPhones reversed a rare losing streak.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech giant revealed that revenues rose by 2pc in the final three months of last year to $119.6bn while profits rose by 13pc to $34bn.\n\nThe increase reverses four consecutive quarters of falling revenues, which had been Apple’s longest losing streak since the launch of the iPod two decades ago.\n\nIt comes despite declining sales in China, where the company has faced growing questions over its business.\n\nShares in the company dropped slightly in after-hours trading.\n\nSales of the iPhone, which counts for the majority of Apple’s revenue, grew by 6pc. Its services business, which includes its App Store and software such as Apple Music and Apple Pay, grew by 11pc. Sales of the iPad fell while those of Mac computers rose slightly. Sales of accessories such as AirPods and the Apple Watch also declined.\n\nChief executive Tim Cook said 2.2bn Apple products were now in use around the world\n\nThe figures come as Apple prepares to release its Vision Pro headset, the most significant new product released in Mr Cook’s 13 years in charge of the company, which goes on sale on Friday in the US.\n\nAmazon recorded its highest profit for two years amid a jump in trading over the Christmas period.\n\nThe company said sales rose by 14pc to $170bn in the fourth quarter of the year, in part due to growing sales outside the US.\n\nProfits rose from $300m a year ago to $10.6bn. This was its strongest profit since the end of 2021, when rising Covid cases meant most consumers resorted to internet shopping.\n\nThe growth in sales puts Amazon within touching distance of overtaking Walmart as the world’s biggest retail company by revenues.\n\nShares rose by 6pc in after-hours trading.\n\nThe results for the Silicon Valley giants came as job cuts continued to hit the industry. Video call app Zoom cut around 150 jobs, roughly 2pc of its workforce, while security app Okta laid off 400 staff.",

        "title": "Checkmate! Buying Qualcomm Stock Is a Winning Move in 2024.",
        "content": "If you want to bolster your portfolio’s tech-sector holdings but feel that the “Magnificent Seven” stocks are too pricey, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a perfect pick. A thorough Qualcomm stock analysis reveals a great investment opportunity. It checks all of the boxes, whether you’re interested in growth, a good value, or passive income.\n\nBesides, Qualcomm has a long-term arrangement with a famous “Mag-Seven” company. This partnership could keep Qualcomm stock afloat for years to come. Ultimately, Qualcomm proves to reluctant investors that not all large-cap technology companies are overpriced, and there are “magnificent” values if you know where to find them.\n\nQualcomm CEO Is Confident About Chip Supply and Demand\n\nAs you are probably aware, the demand for artificial intelligence (AI) chips has been quite intense. Qualcomm CEO Cristiano Amon recently acknowledged this, suggesting that AI-compatible chips are a “great tailwind” for the company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIndeed, Amon sees the generative AI trend as “one of the most exciting things” for Qualcomm. The demand is certainly there for AI-enabled hardware, but some investors may be concerned about whether there’s enough manufacturing capacity to meet that demand.\n\nOn that topic, Amon warned, “We’re going to have to double the total capacity of manufacturing of chips before the end of the decade.” Fortunately, the Qualcomm CEO assured, “[W]e think that there’s enough capacity,” and, “[R]ight now, we don’t have a capacity problem.”\n\nJust as the gen-AI phenomenon will benefit the “Mag Seven,” it will also benefit Qualcomm. Remember, Qualcomm manufactures a variety of tech-hardware components. So, if the demand for AI chips and other components grows, Qualcomm will have opportunities to scale up and generate significant revenue.\n\nApple Deal Could Put a Floor on QCOM Stock\n\nThere are plenty of data points that bolster the bull case for Qualcomm stock. For example, there a good value proposition here, as Qualcomm’s GAAP trailing 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.69x isn’t unreasonable at all. To provide some perspective, the sector median P/E ratio is 28.56x.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, Qualcomm offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.05%. This beats the technology sector’s average dividend of 1.025% – and by the way, some “Mag Seven” companies don’t pay any dividends at all.\n\nAdding to the value proposition of QCOM stock – and possibly putting a floor on its price – is Qualcomm’s extended partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Specifically, Qualcomm has a deal with Apple to supply chips for Apple’s smartphones and other products.\n\nThis deal is currently extended through 2026. Granted, it’s not an exclusive agreement, so Apple could also source these components from other suppliers. Nevertheless, the extended arrangement with Apple is a definite win for Qualcomm. Over the long term, it could provide some stability to the Qualcomm stock price.\n\nQualcomm Stock Analysis: Multiple Reasons to Buy Today\n\nWhat did our Qualcomm stock analysis reveal? First, not all mega-cap technology companies offer dividends, but Qualcomm does. Also, Qualcomm is not overvalued among tech-sector companies.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm’s CEO is confident about the company’s ability to meet the demand for AI-enabled hardware components. On top of all that, Qualcomm’s agreement with Apple should help to stabilize QCOM stock. Therefore, if you’re looking for a winning move in 2024, just start a share position in Qualcomm.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the 40 richest countries in the world by per capita net worth. If you want to skip our detailed analysis, then head on over to the 10 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth.\n\nGlobal Wealth: An Outlook\n\nThe richest countries in the world hold the majority of the global wealth and have the most billionaires per capita. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy has been shaken to its core and there are increasing risks each year. In 2022, there was a major setback to a consistent uptrend in the wealth of the household sector. According to Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report 2023, the net global household wealth fell for the first time in 2023 since the global financial crisis in 2008. The total net private wealth plunged by $11.3 trillion to $454.4 trillion at the end of 2022. The wealth per adult also fell by $3,198 to $84,718 per adult in 2022. One of the main reasons for the decline was the appreciation of the US dollar against foreign currencies.\n\nThe wealthier regions, including North America and Europe, faced the heaviest loss in global wealth. Both the regions together lost $10.9 trillion of global wealth in 2022. Asia Pacific recorded losses of around $2.1 trillion. While, Latin America stood tall among all the regions with a total wealth increase of $2.4 trillion in 2022. In terms of wealth gain, Russia, Mexico, India, and Brazil led the race with the largest wealth increases. Russia, Mexico, and India are also some of the wealthiest countries by per capita net worth. On the contrary, the US, Japan, China, Canada, and Australia faced the most losses in 2022. Along with the decline in total global wealth, overall wealth inequality also fell in 2022. The wealth share of the global top 1% plunged to 44.5% and the number of millionaires, as measured in US dollars, dropped by 3.5 million to 59.4 million in 2022. Global median wealth did increase by 3% in 2022 compared to a 3.6% drop in wealth per adult. Median wealth gives a more relevant update on the wealth of an individual. The global median wealth has increased five-fold this century, driven by rapid wealth growth in China.\n\nStory continues\n\nCredit Suisse projects global wealth to increase by 38% by 2027, reaching $629 trillion. While, the wealth per adult is expected to reach $110,270 in 2027, mainly driven by middle-income markets.\n\nCompanies from the Richest Countries\n\nRoche Holding AG (SWX:ROG), Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027), and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are the top companies based out of some of the richest countries in the world by per capita net worth.\n\nRoche Holding AG (SWX:ROG) is a leading multinational healthcare company based in Switzerland. The company operates under two divisions including pharmaceuticals and diagnostics. On December 29, 2023, Roche Holding AG (SWX:ROG) announced that it had entered into a definitive agreement to acquire LumiraDx Ltd’s (OTCMKTS:LMDXF) Point-of-Care technology. The transaction is expected to close by mid-2024 and Roche Holding AG (SWX:ROG) will pay a purchase price of $295 million with an additional payment of up to $55 million. LumiraDx Ltd’s (OTCMKTS:LMDXF) Point-of-Care technology solution will add to Roche Holding AG’s (SWX:ROG) centralized diagnostics portfolio and multiple disease areas.\n\nGalaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027) is one of the top hospitality and gaming companies in Hong Kong. On January 30, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027) reported that the company has been developing distinct tourism products for Macau’s government. Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027) is supporting the efforts to promote Macau as a “World Center of Tourism and Leisure” through its products. Since October 2023, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027) has introduced the GEG Sea Cruises to promote Macau’s land-sea tourism experiences. Recently, Galaxy Entertainment Group Ltd (HKG:0027) organized various charity sessions of Sea Cruises to encourage tourism in the country.\n\nOn January 8, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced the Apple Vision Pro will be available beginning February 2 at all the US Apple Store locations and Apple Store online. Vision Pro is Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) latest addition to its products. Vision Pro is a revolutionary spatial computer that combines the virtual world with the physical world and explores the powerful spatial experiences in visionOS. Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) CEO, Tim Cook, said:\n\n“The era of spatial computing has arrived. Apple Vision Pro is the most advanced consumer electronics device ever created. Its revolutionary and magical user interface will redefine how we connect, create, and explore.”\n\nThese were a few leading companies based out of some of the richest countries in the world. Now, let’s take a look at the richest countries in the world by per capita net worth. 40 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth\n\n40 Richest Countries in the World by Per Capita Net Worth\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo compile or list the richest countries in the world by per capita net worth, we analyzed data from Credit Suisse’s Global Wealth Databook 2023. Credit Suisse’s database calculates the wealth of countries, considering their financial and non-financial assets while subtracting the value of debt from it. We shortlisted the top countries with the highest wealth per adult in 2022 and ranked the list in ascending order of their wealth per adult. We have mentioned each country's GDP per capita to measure each country’s economic output per person. We have taken the GDP per capita data from the IMF database. The data for total wealth is also taken from Global Wealth Databook 2023.\n\nPer capita net worth is the total net worth of a country divided by its population. We have taken wealth per adult to precisely cover the population that is earning and bringing in capital to the economy. Per capita net worth will be lower than or equal to wealth per adult since it considers the entire population, including children who usually have minimal assets.\n\nBy the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds.

        "title": "Apple ends yearlong sales slump with slight revenue rise in holiday-season period but stock slips",
        "content": "SAN FRANCISCO (AP) — Apple snapped out of a yearlong sales funk during its holiday-season quarter, propelled by solid demand for the latest model of its iPhone and still-robust growth in a services division facing legal threats that could undermine its prospects.\n\nThe modest revenue growth announced Thursday as part of Apple’s October-December results ended four consecutive quarters of year-over-year sales declines. But the performance still may not be enough to allay recent investor concerns about Apple’s ability to rebuild the momentum that established it as the most valuable U.S. publicly traded company.\n\nAfter years of holding that mantle, Apple recently ceded the top spot to its long-time rival Microsoft, which has been elevated largely through its early leadership in artificial intelligence technology.\n\nApple is hoping to shift the narrative back in its favor with Friday’s release of its Vision Pro headset that transports users into a hybrid of physical and digital environments — a combination the company is promoting as “spatial computing.” But the first version of the Vision Pro will cost $3,500 — a lofty price tag analysts expect to constrain demand this year.\n\n“We are committed as ever to the pursuit of groundbreaking innovation,” Apple CEO Tim Cook said in a Thursday statement accompanying the quarterly results.\n\nDespite recurring worries that Apple may be entering a period of slower growth compared with its track record over the past 20 years, the Cupertino, California, is still thriving.\n\nApple’s revenue for its most recent quarter rose 2% from the same time in the previous year to $119.58 billion. The company earned $33.92 billion, or $2.18 per share, a 13% gain from the same time last year.\n\nAs usual, the iPhone accounted for the bulk of Apple’s revenue. Sales of the company’s marquee product totaled $69.7 billion in the past quarter, a 6% increase from the same time in the prior year. Those results include the latest iPhone that came out in late September, including a premium model that includes a special video recording feature designed for playing back on the Vision Pro.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s services division, which is tied largely to the iPhone, posted an 11% rise in revenue from the previous year to $23.12 billion.\n\nBoth the revenue and earnings for the quarter exceeded analysts’ projections, according to FactSet Research.\n\nBut investors appeared unimpressed with the showing as Apple’s stock price dropped 1% in extended trading after the numbers came out.\n\nWhile it has been consistently generating double-digit revenue growth, Apple's services division is under legal attack. The results of the legal challenges could siphon away a significant chunk of revenue flowing from a search deal with Google and commissions collected through the iPhone app store when consumers complete digital transactions on the device.\n\nApple’s agreement to make Google the default search engine on the iPhone and Safari browser — a deal that brings in an estimated $15 billion to $20 billion annually — is the focal point of antitrust case brought by the U.S. Justice Department that will shift into its final phase in May. Another antitrust case brought by video game maker Epic Games and new regulatory rules in Europe already have forced Apple to revise its commission system in the iPhone app store, although critics say the concessions are illusory and are pledging to push for even more dramatic changes.\n\nThe past quarter also pointed to faltering sales in China, a major market for Apple and an area that investors have been fretting about because of that country’s weakening economy and reports that the government there may prohibit its workers from buying iPhones. Apple’s revenue in China dropped 13% from the previous year to $20.82 billion.",

Traders are eager to see if Amazon can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its \"Buy With Prime\" service.\n\nMSCI's all-country world index closed up 0.67%. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.97%, the S&P 500 added 1.25% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 1.3%.\n\nFutures have pared bets for a rate cut in March to 37.5% from almost 90% at year-end 2023, but increased the likelihood of a cut or two to 96% when the Fed meets in May, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Fed's inflation fight got a boost on Thursday, with data showing U.S. worker productivity grew more quickly than expected in the fourth quarter to keep unit labor costs contained.\n\nLabor Department data also showed job market momentum is slowly fading, which could help to curb wage inflation. Other data showed first-time applications for unemployment benefits rose to a two-month high last week.\n\nThe dollar fell against the euro and yen, while sterling rebounded after a Bank of England meeting that sought more evidence of slowing inflation before it would cut rates.\n\nThe dollar index, a measure of the U.S. currency against six others, fell 0.52%. The euro rose 0.48% to $1.0868, the yen strengthened 0.32% to 146.42 per dollar and sterling was at $1.2744, up 0.47% on the day.\n\nEuro zone inflation eased as expected last month but underlying price pressures fell less than forecast, likely boosting the European Central Bank's argument that rate cuts should not be rushed.\n\nThe pan-European STOXX 600 index lost 0.37%.\n\nTreasuries rallied strongly, with 10-year yields slipping 10 basis points to 3.865%, amid jitters over regional U.S. banks after shares of New York Community Bancorp fell further on concerns about commercial real estate.\n\nThe KBW Regional Banking index fell 2.28%.\n\n\"If we didn't have the issue with New York Bancorp, where concerns about tight credit conditions clearly affected the profitability of that bank, then we would probably be talking about a different story for rates,\" said Paresh Upadhyaya, director of fixed currency strategy Amundi US in Boston.\n\nAsian markets were choppy overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares rose 0.2%, helped by Chinese blue chips that snapped a four-day slide, along with better surveys on home prices and manufacturing.\n\nJapan's Nikkei eased 0.8% as the yen gained.\n\nOil prices fell more 2% after false market speculation that Israel agreed to a Gaza ceasefire. A Qatar official told Reuters that Hamas has received a ceasefire proposal positively, but it has not yet responded to it.\n\nBrent crude futures plummeted $1.85 to settle at $78.70 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures fell $2.03 to settle at $73.82.\n\nGold firmed nearer a one-month high after data showed U.S. weekly jobless claims rose last week.\n\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.2% higher at $2071.10 an ounce.\n\n(Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Ros Russell, Richard Chang, Will Dunham and Angus MacSwan)",

        "title": "Amazon stock pops as earnings beat",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) reported fourth quarter earnings that beat analysts' expectations Thursday and delivered an optimistic outlook for the months ahead.\n\nThe stock climbed 4% higher in extended trading.\n\nNet sales came in at nearly $170 billion versus expectations of $166.2 billion. That's higher than the almost $150 billion the company generated during the same period in the prior year. The outlook for the current quarter also surpassed forecasts, with the company estimating an upper range of $143.5 billion.\n\nHere are some of Amazon’s most significant metrics compared to what Wall Street was expecting in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter, according to data from Bloomberg:\n\nRevenue: $169.9 billion vs. $166.2 billion expected ($149.2 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $1.00 vs $0.78 expected ($0.03 in Q4 2022) Amazon Web Services: $24.20 billion vs $24.22 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nOn Thursday the company unveiled a new shopping assistant dubbed Rufus, trained on Amazon’s product catalog and broader information from the web. The generative AI-powered tool can answer customer questions and recommend products on the Amazon mobile app. Amazon said a small subset of customers will initially be able to use the chatbot and then will widen its release to more users in the US.\n\nAmazon's results arrive just weeks after the company eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios and announced a major reduction in staff at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, laying off more than 500 people. Staff cuts across tech highlight the sector's painful climb down from an era of rapid expansion, as companies are still resizing and retreating from ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nAmazon sees the potential for AI development to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to provide vital infrastructure.\n\nStory continues The price of Amazon stock is shown on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2017, in New York. Amazon reports their earnings on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn September, the company launched its AI service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself.\n\nThat same month Amazon also said it would invest up to $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic as the biggest players in tech scramble for positioning in what they see as the coming age of the technology.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the biggest player in the cloud industry, claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

At his press conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell called a March rate cut \"unlikely,\" resetting market expectations of a dovish Fed pivot in the first quarter, and prompting a steep sell-off.\n\nThe KBW Regional Banking index fell 2.1%, weighed down by the 8.9% drop in New York Community Bancorp's shares after the company reported pain in its commercial real estate portfolio, sparking renewed fears over the health of U.S. regional lenders.\n\nStory continues\n\nFourth quarter reporting season is going full-bore, with 208 of the companies in the S&P 500 having reported. Of those, 80% have delivered consensus-beating earnings, according to LSEG.\n\nAnalysts now expect aggregate S&P 500 earnings growth of 6.4% year-on-year for the October-December period, an improvement over the 4.7% growth seen on Jan. 1, per LSEG.\n\nA raft of economic data showed rising productivity helping to cap labor costs, while an increase in announced layoffs and weekly jobless claims provided further evidence of softening in the labor market, which is viewed by the Fed as a precondition to assuring a sustainable downward path for inflation.\n\n\"We see these data, on the eve of the labor report tomorrow, as consistent with a healthy but moderating labor market,\" Northey added. \"(These reports) are consistent with our view of the economic path for 2024; that it will continue to grow, but at a slower pace.\"\n\nThe S&P 500 climbed 0.94% to end the session at 4,891.21 points. The Nasdaq gained 1.04% to 15,321.61 points, while Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 0.74% to 38,434.29 points.\n\nOf the 11 S&P 500 sector indexes, nine rose, led by consumer staples, up 1.59%, followed by a 1.42% gain in materials.\n\nMerck advanced 4.2% after the drug maker's upbeat fourth-quarter results.\n\nQualcomm fell 4.6% on concerns over Android sales in China.\n\nHoneywell was off 3.1% after the diversified industrial conglomerate provided a disappointing first-quarter results.\n\nAdvancing issues outnumbered falling ones within the S&P 500 by a 3.3-to-one ratio.\n\nThe S&P 500 posted 28 new highs and 5 new lows; the Nasdaq recorded 61 new highs and 103 new lows.\n\n(Reporting by Stephen Culp; Additional reporting by Ankika Biswas and Johann M Cherian in Bengaluru; Editing by Aurora Ellis)",

        "content": "On Tuesday, Google-parent Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) reported their quarterly results. While Alphabet disappointed Wall Street as its holiday-season advertising sales were short of expectations, Microsoft topped analyst estimates. On Wednesday, Microsoft also became the second-ever company worth $3 trillion, joining Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) with its value topping that of France’s GDP.\n\n2024’s Fiscal Second Quarter\n\nFor the quarter ended on December 31st, Microsoft reported revenue rose roughly 17.5% YoY to $62 billion, topping analyst expectations of $61 billion. Net income grew 33% YoY to $21.9 billion, or $2.93 per diluted share, also topping Visible Alpha’s estimates of $20.6 billion or $2.77 per diluted share. Azure drove the overall cloud revenue up 20%, with personal computing revenue recording a 19% increase, while the productivity and business processes revenue grew 13%. Although Google also topped estimates with its Google Cloud revenue of $9.2 billion, Microsoft Azure grew faster at 30%, leaving behind Google Cloud whose growth reaccelerated from the previous quarter, but 25.7% was still a slower growth rate compared to last year's comparable quarter when growth amounted to 32%.\n\nAzure Is The Star Of The AI And Cloud Front\n\nMicrosoft proudly touted that Azure AI has 53,000 customers, a third of whom are new to the service as they came on board last year. Microsoft attributed this success to its service offering top performance for AI training, inference and a diverse selection of AI accelerators that include both in in-house chip, as well as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD) and Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nBy the words of CEO Satya Nadella, Microsoft moved from talking about AI to applying AI at scale by infusing it across every layer of its activities and offerings. Microsoft took an early leadership in the AI race with its ongoing partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI as well as developing its own AI tools and hardware. Nadella also mentioned the company’s AI tools are being used by corporation giants such as Walmart (NYSE: WMT) and Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO).\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft shares rose 7% year-to-date, while last year, they recorded more than a 40% increase due to the company’s prospects on the AI front. Together with Apple, Nvidia, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA), these Magnificent 7 companies almost single-handedly pushed markets to new highs since 2024 kicked off. Together, the market cap of these seven stocks exceeds any country’s entire stock market except for the United States. As of last week, Nvidia and Microsoft alone made about 75% of the S&P 500’s gain this year. In a note that was published on Tuesday, Morgan Stanley believes that Microsoft’s play for AI “getting even stronger and therefore predicts more growth is ahead for the tech titan.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Meta to report Q4 earnings as generative AI takes center stage",
        "content": "Fresh off of testifying before the Senate that his social media empire doesn’t hurt kids, Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg will now face shareholders as his company reports its fourth quarter earnings after the bell on Thursday.\n\nMeta has been on a hot streak over the last 12 months, with shares rocketing 121% as of Thursday morning. In January, the company’s market capitalization once again eclipsed the $1 trillion mark. We’re only a month into 2024, but so far Meta’s stock has outperformed the likes of Apple (AAPL), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nBut if Meta is going to keep up its hot streak, it’s going to need to deliver on continued ad sales growth, which should keep the spotlight off of its continued investment in the metaverse and its Reality Labs business.\n\nFor the quarter, analysts are expecting Meta to post adjusted earnings per share of $5.05 on revenue of $39.01 billion, according to Bloomberg consensus data. That would mark a significant increase from the $32.2 billion in revenue the company generated in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnticipated advertising revenue is set to come in at $37.8 billion, up from $31.3 billion in Q4 2022. The number of Facebook daily active users is expected to top 2.07 billion, an increase from 2 billion last year. Family of apps daily active users should touch 3.11 billion, a sizable jump from the 2.96 billion the company reported in Q4 2022.\n\nMeta’s Reality Labs, however, will continue to be a burden on the company. The division, which is tasked with turning Zuckerberg’s vision of the metaverse into a reality, is expected to report operating losses of $4.1 billion. That, however, is down from the $4.3 billion the company lost on its endeavor last year.

(Photo by JOSH EDELSON / AFP) (Photo by JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nThe launch of Apple’s rival Vision Pro headset could create a jump in consumer interest in AR/VR headsets and generate a knock-on effect for Meta’s Quest line of headsets.\n\nBut Meta’s Reality Labs efforts have taken a backseat in investors’ minds to the company’s increased investments in generative AI. In January, Zuckerberg announced in an Instagram Reels post that the company’s long-term strategy was to develop general artificial intelligence and make it open source.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s no single definition of generative AI, but broadly speaking, it’s a kind of AI that can think and learn like a human. In other words, it’s capable of understanding a multitude of concepts rather than specializing in a certain field. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nIn his post, Zuckerberg also said Meta is building out its AI capabilities by spending billions of dollars on Nvidia GPUs.\n\nThe company is already using generative AI features for advertisers to help them build out ads, and its Meta AI chatbot is available through its various apps.\n\nNow the company needs to tell Wall Street whether those investments are beginning to pay off.\n\nDaniel Howley is the tech editor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Qualcomm Sees Modest 2024 Recovery After Glut; Shares Fall",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Qualcomm Inc., the world’s biggest seller of smartphone processors, is expecting a modest recovery for the industry in 2024, with phone shipments getting stronger but the market for internet-connected appliances remaining sluggish.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nDonald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier A $560 Billion Property Warning Hits Banks From NY to Tokyo Deutsche Bank Plans To Cut 3,500 Jobs And Lift Payouts Stocks Keep Pushing Higher as Oil Drops Below $75: Markets Wrap House Passes $78 Billion Business, Child Tax Break Bill\n\nPhone shipments, which declined in 2023, will be “flat to up slightly” in 2024, the company said Wednesday on a conference call following its fiscal first-quarter earnings report. Though phone manufacturers have mostly worked through excess inventory, oversupply remains a problem in Qualcomm’s second-largest business — providing chips for connected devices.\n\nThe shares fell as much as 5.7% to $140.09, marking the biggest intraday decline since September.\n\nIn an interview with Bloomberg Television, Chief Executive Officer Cristiano Amon said that concerns about inventory were overblown. The handset market is no longer struggling with a glut, and the market for internet-connected devices — a segment known as the Internet of Things — is passing its lowest point and will soon return to growth, he said.\n\n“Handsets are getting back to normal,” Amon said. New phones with artificial intelligence functions are exciting, but it’s still difficult to predict when they will capture the imagination of consumers and drive a spike in sales, he said.\n\nQualcomm sales will be $8.9 billion to $9.7 billion in the fiscal second quarter, the company said. That was in line with an average analyst estimate of $9.36 billion. Excluding certain items, profit will be $2.20 to $2.40 a share in the current quarter, versus an average projection of $2.26.\n\nInvestors have been looking for signs that consumers are upgrading their smartphones at a faster pace. On that front, Qualcomm had good news: Revenue from handsets gained 16% last quarter, compared with a 27% decline in the previous three months.\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm also said Wednesday that Apple Inc. extended a patent licensing agreement by two years. It now runs until March 2027. The chipmaker also signed a new agreement with Samsung Electronics Co., with the South Korean company agreeing to base future devices on Qualcomm processors.\n\nApple is the world’s largest smartphone maker — after passing Samsung last year — and will give further insights into the state of the industry Thursday. That’s when the company is due to report its quarterly results.\n\nWhile Amon is trying to lessen his dependence on the phone market — with forays into automotive and personal computer chips — Qualcomm’s earnings are still heavily influenced by demand for handsets, particularly in China.\n\nIn the fiscal first quarter, which ended Dec. 24, profit was $2.75 a share, excluding some items. Revenue was up 5% at $9.9 billion. Analysts had estimated profit of $2.36 and sales of $9.54 billion.\n\nThe Internet of Things remained a weak spot. Revenue from that business fell 32%. Qualcomm’s automotive sales rose 31%.\n\nThe San Diego-based company’s main product is a processor that runs many of the world’s best-known phones, including many of Samsung’s Galaxy line. It also sells the modem chips that connect Apple’s iPhone to high-speed data networks.\n\nAn additional portion of Qualcomm’s profit comes from licensing the fundamental technology that underpins all modern mobile networks — fees that phone manufacturers pay whether they use Qualcomm-branded chips or not.\n\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow and Caroline Hyde.\n\n(Updates with CEO comments starting in fourth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters Elon Musk May Have Lost More Than a $55 Billion Payday AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "title": "Apple Appears Poised for an Earnings Suprise: ETFs in Focus",
        "content": "All eyes are on technology giant Apple AAPL, which is set to release first-quarter fiscal 2024 results after market close today. Since Apple accounts for nearly 7% of the total market capitalization of the entire technology sector on the S&P 500 Index, it is worth taking a look at its fundamentals ahead of its quarterly results.\r\n\r\nApple has gained just about 3% over the past three months, underperforming the industry’s growth of 5%. The solid trend is expected to continue, given that the tech giant has reasonable chances to beat earnings estimates and saw a positive earnings estimate revision activity, which is generally a precursor to an earnings beat (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nThis has put investors’ focus on ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nInside Our Methodology\n\nApple has an Earnings ESP of +1.96% and a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). According to our methodology, the combination of a positive Earnings ESP and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), 2 (Buy) or 3 increases the chances of an earnings beat. You can uncover the best stocks to buy or sell before they’re reported with our Earnings ESP Filter.\r\n\r\nApple saw positive earnings estimate revision of a penny over the past 30 days for the fiscal first quarter. Analysts raising estimates right before earnings — with the most up-to-date information possible — is a good indicator for the stock. The Zacks Consensus Estimate indicates modest year-over-year growth of 11.2% for earnings and 0.4% for revenues. The company has a strong track record of positive earnings surprises. It delivered an average earnings surprise of 3.47% in the trailing four quarters.\r\n\r\nThe stock belongs to a top-ranked Zacks Industry (top 24%). Apple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.83 on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell etc.) made by 27 brokerage firms. The current ABR compares to an ABR of 1.80 a month ago based on 28 recommendations.\r\n\r\nOf the 27 recommendations deriving the current ABR, 15 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 55.56% and 11.11% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 57.14%, while Buy represented 10.71%.\r\n\r\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 24 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $206.08. The forecasts range from a low of $160.00 to a high of $250.00.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat to Watch\n\nOn the last earnings call, the tech giant offered a cautious outlook for the holiday quarter. Apple CFO Luca Maestri indicated that revenues in the holiday quarter are expected to be \"similar\" to last year, with revenues for Mac, iPad, and Wearables categories expected to \"decelerate significantly\" from the fourth quarter.\r\n\r\nApple stock has been struggling since the start of this year on concerns about iPhone sales, particularly in China. Two analysts — Piper Sandler and Barclays — downgraded the stock rating on worries about iPhone demand early this month. Added to Apple's challenges is the tepid forecast for its new product, the Vision Pro mixed-reality headset, which is set to be launched in the United States on Feb 2. Analysts predict that its impact on Apple's earnings per share will be minimal.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 64 securities in its basket, with Apple making up for 20.4% share. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has key holdings in software, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware, storage and peripherals.\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most popular and heavily traded ETF, with an AUM of $62.4 billion and an average daily volume of 7 million shares. The fund charges 9 bps in fees per year.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF manages $62.2 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 312 technology stocks. It currently tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Here, Apple accounts for a 21.5% share. Systems software, technology hardware storage & peripheral, semiconductors, and application software are the top four sectors.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, whereas volume is solid at nearly 494,000 shares (read: Tech Leads S&P 500 to Highs: Does Further Rally Await ETFs?).\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC)\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF is home to 303 technology stocks with an AUM of $8.8 billion. It follows the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index. Apple accounts for a 21.6% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF has an expense ratio of 0.08%, while volume is solid at 245,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW)\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index, giving investors exposure to 133 U.S. electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies. Apple makes up 15.8% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF has an AUM of $15 billion and charges 40 bps in fees and expenses. Volume is good as it exchanges 668,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK)\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market. It tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index and holds 82 securities in its basket, with Apple accounting for 14.8% of the total assets (read: 5 Best Top-Ranked ETFs of 2023 Set to Soar in 2024).\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF charges 7 bps in annual fees and trades in a good volume of around 337,000 shares a day on average.

        "title": "Tech earnings: What Apple, Amazon, Meta need to succeed",
        "content": "The next slew of Big Tech earnings includes Apple (AAPL), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta Platforms (META), all scheduled to report earnings on Thursday. After several tech giants fell short of advertising revenue expectations, what should investors expect from these next big three?\n\nYahoo Finance Tech Editor Dan Howley highlights what investors will be paying the closest attention to, including Apple's iPhone demand in China, Amazon's AWS segment, and Meta's AI strategy.\n\nFor more expert insight and the latest market action, click here to watch this full episode of Yahoo Finance Live.\n\nEditor's note: This article was written by Luke Carberry Mogan.\n\nVideo Transcript\n\nAKIKO FUJITA: Well, the pressure is on for the three Magnificent Seven companies set to report their latest quarterly results after the bell this afternoon. Investors will be scrutinizing every word from leaders at Amazon, Apple, and Meta after the first three Mag Seven members, Tesla, Microsoft, and Alphabet failed to impress investors. We have our very own tech reporter Dan Howley with us.\n\nDan, we should say expectations are sky high. We've learned that from the other companies that have reported so far. What should investors be watching this afternoon?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: Yeah, Akiko, expectations are sky high. I mean Microsoft had a great report and you saw shares fall off. And then as far as Google, Alphabet goes they missed on ad sales and you saw what happened. They were getting hammered as a result of that.\n\nBut as far as Apple, Amazon, and Meta, let's go over some of the big numbers that people are going to be watching. Revenue and earnings per share, $2.11 on $117.9 billion for Apple. That's the big number.\n\nBut the number that most people are going to be watching is iPhone revenue. That's expected to come in at $68.6 billion. That would be up from the $65.7 billion they reported in the same quarter last year.\n\nAnd that's important because we've been getting reports from different analysts saying that overall in China, iPhone 15 sales are sluggish. And there's a number of reasons for that-- a resurgent Huawei, which is offering high-end phones at a cheaper price that can rival Apple, as well as the slower economic outlook in China itself. So there's a lot of kind of rumblings there. There's also some issues with the Mac and iPad line.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs far as Meta goes, we're looking at earnings per share of $5.05 on revenue of $39 billion. The big number there that we're looking at is advertising revenue. That's expected to be $37.8 billion in the quarter up from $31.3 billion.\n\nAdvertising has really rebounded from Meta over the past few quarters. They seem to have figured out how to get around Apple's app transparency tracking or app tracking transparency. That really put a dent in their advertising, as well as the interest rate issues that we had seen where advertisers had pulled back.\n\nAnd then as far as Amazon goes, we're looking at just an EPS of $1.4 on revenue of $166 billion. And of course, the big item we're going to be looking at here is AWS, Amazon Web Services, with expected revenue of $24.2 billion. The generative AI, general AI conversation that we're seeing really does feed into cloud services like AWS.\n\nIf you look at what Microsoft had announced during its earnings, its Azure and general cloud services got a jump from AI. They said the intelligent cloud segment, which includes Azure, had a 6% revenue bump from AI. That was up from 3% in the prior quarter. So you're seeing AI take hold for them. We'll have to see now if generative AI and the spending that Amazon has done on its own chips, inferencing things along those lines, start to pay off for AWS.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: So Dan, it's interesting because these are three very different companies. Obviously, Meta based in social media then expanded into devices. Apple, you think devices, software. And then you have Amazon, a bit of consumer, a bit of everything. How fair is it to stack them up against each other?\n\nDAN HOWLEY: I think there's competing services across the mall. Advertising is a big piece of each of those three companies. You might not think of it with Apple, but they generate a lot of advertising revenue. Meta, they're chiefly advertising.\n\nAnd Amazon's advertising is huge now. It's a mega part of what they have to offer. And then there's other pieces where they compete with each other. Obviously, Meta and Apple are now going head to head starting tomorrow with the launch of the Vision Pro headset.\n\nFor Meta, that could be a good thing while Apple is getting all the fanfare because of the headset. It's interesting. It's a new Apple product that's generally going to generate a lot of buzz. It's $3,500, $3,499.\n\nA lot of people aren't going be able to afford that. And some analysts are expecting perhaps a knock on effect on Meta's headsets, the Quest 3, which is significantly cheaper, but offers an AR/VR experience like Apple's. It's not as good. The technology isn't nearly what Apple has to offer, but people can get a general sense of what AR and VR has to offer.\n\nI think the key thing for both of these companies when it comes to these devices is keeping people hooked. We've seen that Meta has had a problem with that, with some executives saying that people six months out don't necessarily stick around. And so for Apple, that's going to be a big deal. And then for Meta, if they do get that knock on effect, that's going to be a big deal.\n\nAnd obviously, generative AI is playing a part across the entire industry, Amazon being a big part. Meta is looking to get general artificial intelligence out, that's what Mark Zuckerberg said spending billions of dollars on NVIDIA AI chips. And Apple is reportedly expected to get into the generative AI game for consumers in the next version of iOS.\n\nSo they're working on that in the background. There's been reports of that for some time now. So they really do compete across a number of industries. It just feels like they're so different because of what the companies really are when you look at them as a monolith.\n\nRACHELLE AKUFFO: No, you raise a fair point there. I appreciate that breakdown, our very own Dan Howley.",

        "title": "Amazon earnings preview: Expect updates on Prime Video ads and the future of AI",
        "content": "Amazon is scheduled to post quarterly earnings after the bell on Thursday, joining two fellow trillion-dollar giants and rounding out a week defined by high expectations and disappointment over tech results. Amazon's turn at Big Tech’s wave of reports will likely offer updates on AI development and its lucrative cloud business.\n\nInvestors will be looking for details about the growth of Amazon Web Services, in addition to insight into the company’s burgeoning ads operations. Earlier this week Amazon’s streaming service, Prime Video, began playing ads alongside movies and shows as the default option for users, who can pay extra for an ad-free version. Analysts have noted the significant potential for ad growth given the massive scale of Amazon’s built-in audience.\n\nHere’s what Wall Street is expecting for some of Amazon's most significant metrics in the company’s fiscal fourth quarter:\n\nRevenue: $166.2 billion expected ($149.2 billion in Q4 2022) Adjusted earnings per share: $0.78 expected ($0.03 in Q4 2022) Amazon Web Services: $24.2 billion expected ($21.4 billion in Q4 2022) Advertising: $14.2 billion expected ($11.6 billion in Q4 2022)\n\nOverall, Amazon stock achieved muscular gains last year, climbing more than 80%. And just last week the stock hit 52-week highs. But the momentum has slowed since then as investors recalibrate on tech. Amazon will report alongside Apple (AAPL) and Meta (META) to wrap up Big Tech's quarterly reports.\n\nAmazon's showing arrives just weeks after the company eliminated several hundred roles across Prime Video and MGM Studios and announced a major reduction in staff at its video game livestreaming platform, Twitch, laying off more than 500 people. Staff cuts across tech highlight the sector's painful climb down from an era of rapid expansion, as companies are still resizing and retreating from ambitious investments made during the early stages of the pandemic.\n\nAmazon sees the potential for AI development to generate tens of billions of dollars for its cloud business. AI tools require huge amounts of data and processing power to train and run large language models and their applications, relying on cloud providers to provide vital infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn September, the company launched its AI service, dubbed Amazon Bedrock, which allows customers to build generative AI applications through existing models offered by Anthropic, Stability AI, and Amazon itself. The price of Amazon stock is shown on a screen at the Nasdaq MarketSite, Wednesday, Dec. 20, 2017, in New York. Amazon reports their earnings on Thursday, Feb. 1, 2024. (Mark Lennihan/AP Photo, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat same month Amazon also said it would invest up to $4 billion in the AI startup Anthropic as the biggest players in tech scramble for positioning in what they see as the coming age of the technology.\n\nAmazon Web Services, the biggest player in the cloud industry, claims about 30% of market share, followed by Microsoft (MSFT) Azure and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud. The trio collectively account for roughly two-thirds of the market.\n\nHow Wall Street will judge the performance of Amazon's cloud business depends in part on how it stacks up against Microsoft, its closest competitor, which reported cloud revenue earlier this week that beat estimates. But investors in recent days have applied a harsh rubric to tech earnings. Alphabet, another cloud and AI rival, exceeded expectations for its cloud segment. Investors, however, soured on the stock after the report, following lower-than-anticipated ad revenue.\n\nInvestors will also be looking for more detail on Amazon's vision for advertising. The company has roughly 96 million US Prime households, while a subset of that figure actively engages with Prime Video, according to MoffettNathanson. \"We strongly believe that Amazon’s decision to add advertising to Prime Video will be a disruptive force to commoditized advertising video on demand (AVOD) players, siloed connected TV (CTV) platforms and non-top 20 linear cable networks,\" analyst Michael Morton wrote in a note to clients last week.\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "The Road to a Trillion: 3 Stocks Next in Line for the Mega Milestone",
        "content": "“A billion here, a billion there, and pretty soon you’re talking real money.” While a trillion-dollar price tag is likely more common in today’s inflationary times, only a handful of companies have managed to attain that real-money status. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was the first to do so in 2018 but six other stocks have since attained trillion-dollar valuations.\n\nAs the market expands and businesses grow, we’ll likely see more stocks join this elite group of companies. But it’s more than just becoming trillion-dollar milestone stocks. The lofty price tag indicates a company that dominates its industry and wields incredible influence. What follows are three industry heavyweights that are on their way to commanding similar leadership over their respective fields.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to join Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as the next chipmaker worth $1 trillion, it’s going to have to nearly double in valuation. It’s worth $550 billion now so it’s more than halfway there. As it seems with most businesses these days, artificial intelligence (AI) will be how it achieves it.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBroadcom said generative AI represented close to $1.5 billion in the fourth quarter or 20% of total semiconductor revenue. Demand for its AI accelerators from hyperscalers, which are cloud service providers at scale, should drive networking revenue 30% higher in 2024.\n\nSemiconductors remain Broadcom’s bread and butter though. Apple recently signed a multiyear, multibillion-dollar agreement for the chipmaker’s 5G radio frequency components for Apple products. The tech giant accounted for 20% of all Broadcom revenue in 2022 and 2023.\n\nA third driver of growth for Broadcom will be its software business. It completed its acquisition of VMWare in November and will layer its business on top of the software operations it acquired over the years from CA, Symantec and Brocade. It now expects software will account for half of all revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom has become a well-diversified business. The semiconductor industry is very cyclical and the chipmaker has now smoothed out a lot of the volatility. It also lessened its dependence on Apple. It provides a straighter road for Broadcom to achieve trillion-dollar status very soon.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nA trillion-dollar bank might seem a difficult concept to grasp but JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is probably the first one that will achieve it. The bank is halfway there as well with a $504 billion valuation. If the economy can avoid any major tumults it might achieve it sooner than many imagine.\n\nThe high-interest rate environment we’re in will certainly benefit JPMorgan’s bottom line by accruing greater net interest income. Even as the Federal Reserve considers cutting rates it does not look like it will be in the five or six steps originally expected. Most analysts think there will be three at most. This is not some pie-in-the-sky wish-casting either. Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Betsy Graseck called JPMorgan “an underappreciated rate play.” She also looks for the bank to benefit from increased fees and efficiencies.\n\nJPMorgan has become a rock amidst the tempest of financial uncertainty. It’s much the way the bank’s namesake founder was the salvation of other Wall Street banks and the stock market after the 1907 panic that threatened to bring down the country’s entire financial system. It was JPMorgan that rescued First Republic bank during the regional banking meltdown a year ago.\n\nJPM further benefited from the crisis as depositors flocked to its bank helping to boost its total assets to almost $4 trillion. At the end of 2023, JPMorgan held $3.9 trillion in assets. That’s 20% greater than its closest peer, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). It solidifies the banking giant’s grasp as the biggest, most valuable financial institution.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last of the three stocks that will hit the trillion-dollar milestone is Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO). At a $511 billion valuation, the Danish pharmaceutical giant arguably could do it sooner than the other two.\n\nNovo Nordisk is leading the way forward with its twin glycogen-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) therapies for diabetes and obesity, Wegovy and Ozempic. Sales are rocketing higher and show no sign of letting up. Ozempic sales surged 66% in currency-adjusted rates while Wegovy went stratospheric with 420% gains. Based on the strength of the sales, Novo Nordisk now expects revenue to grow by as much as 26% this year with operating profits surging 29% higher.\n\nDemand for the drugs is so great Novo Nordisk has struggled to keep up. It’s employed third-party contractors to help and committed to spending nearly $9 billion in new capacity. It does have new competition in the space from Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY), which means the stock likely won’t maintain its torrid rate of growth. Share are up 65% in the past year.\n\nThe pharma stock just completed a 2-for-1 stock split in September after shares quadrupled in value over the past five years. It would require a smaller gain for NVO stock to reach $1 trillion but achieving it is not out of the question.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Munsif Vengattil and Aditya Kalra\n\nBENGALURU/NEW DELHI (Reuters) - Tata Group is in advanced talks with Taiwan's Pegatron to form a partnership to run an iPhone assembly plant the Indian company is building in the southern state of Tamil Nadu, two sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Thursday.\n\nTata is building the iPhone assembly plant in Hosur city, which will be its second such facility in the country. The move comes as Apple and its contract manufacturers are rapidly expanding their India operations.\n\nTata is in talks to form a joint venture with Pegatron for the Hosur plant - its first such initiative - that would help speed up its plans to start manufacturing, said the two sources, who declined to be named as the talks are private and the deal has not been closed.\n\nThe Taiwanese firm would provide technical and engineering support at the plant, the sources said.\n\nPegatron did not immediately respond to a request for comment outside business hours in Taiwan. Tata and Apple also did not immediately respond.\n\nTata's success is crucial to Apple's ambitions. The U.S. firm has been diversifying beyond China following COVID-19 disruptions and geopolitical tensions and the proportion of iPhones made in India is expected to reach 20-25% this year, from 12-14% in 2023, according to Apple analyst Ming-Chi Kuo.\n\nTata's new plant with Pegatron is expected to have 20 lines for iPhone assembly, one of the sources said, adding that the Indian firm would hold a majority stake in the joint venture.\n\n\"Tata cannot build everything from scratch,\" said the second source, explaining the rationale behind the tie-up.\n\nTata's first iPhone assembly plant is in the southern state of Karnataka which it took over from Taiwan's Wistron last year.\n\nIndependently, Pegatron already operates an iPhone assembly plant in Tamil Nadu and is in talks to add a second facility. It currently accounts for about 10% of Apple's iPhone output in India, with Taiwan's Foxconn accounting for most of the rest.\n\n(Reporting by Munsif Vengattil in Bengaluru and Aditya Kalra in New Delhi; Editing by Mark Potter)",

        "content": "*\n\nEuropean and China shares steady, S&P futures bounce\n\n*\n\nBank of England keeps rates on hold in unusual split\n\n*\n\nMarkets shift Fed rate cut timing from March to May\n\n*\n\nFed futures still see sizable easing over 2024\n\n*\n\nEarnings loom from Apple, Amazon and Meta\n\n*\n\nGraphic: World FX rates http://tmsnrt.rs/2egbfVh\n\n*\n\nBy Marc Jones\n\nLONDON, Feb 1 (Reuters) - Share markets were in recovery mode on Thursday as investors stuck to bets for sizable cuts in U.S. and European interest rates even if the kick-off dates might now be a little later than first hoped.\n\nA rare three-way split at the Bank of England had bamboozled Europe's traders but with Wall Street pointing higher after its biggest falls since September ahead of crucial Apple, Amazon and Meta results it was all still to play for.\n\nThe Euro STOXX 600 was also warming up after a morning dip in the red while the euro was sulking near a 6-week low ahead of euro zone inflation data due shortly.\n\nWednesday's Federal Reserve decision to hold U.S. rates at 5.25-5.5% was still a heavy influence too. The move itself had been no surprise, but it emphasised that rates would not be cut until it was more confident inflation was truly beaten.\n\nIn a media conference, Fed Chair Jerome Powell flatly stated a cut as early as March seemed unlikely, but also conceded that everyone on the committee was looking to ease this year.\n\nAt the Bank of England on Thursday, six of its nine rate setters had voted to keep borrowing costs at 5.25% but with two voting to hike and one voting to cut it was first three-way split since 2008 financial crash.\n\nMarket reaction was muted though, with the pound and British government bond yields rising modestly as investors slightly reined in bets on the extent of cuts over 2024.\n\n\"We continue to expect (UK) interest rate cuts later in the year, but there is unlikely to be an imminent change,\" State Street portfolio manager Mitul Patel said. Votes both for tightening and easing revealed an \"increasing divergence\" meanwhile.\n\nStory continues\n\nFollowing Fed chief Powell's comments on Wednesday, markets had actually doubled down on a May Fed move, pricing in 32 basis points of cuts - implying a 100% probability of 25 basis points and some chance of a 50 basis-point easing.\n\n\"Our view all along was that the market got a bit ahead of itself with the idea of March (Fed) cuts,\" said Beata Manthey, Head of European Equity Strategy at Citi.\n\n\"The important thing though is that we are heading for a decent number of cuts this year. We have five forecast in the U.S. which is significant, and in Europe (for the ECB) we have six.\"\n\nAPPLE EYED\n\nThe Fed effect pushed the dollar higher leaving it at loftiest level of the year against other world currencies. There was a 6-week peak against the euro too which was also under pressure from Sweden's crown after its central bank also held its rates again.\n\nWall Street was heading right back into tech earnings meanwhile and whether the red hot run of megacap stocks might be cooling after Google and Microsoft were both punished this week over their mounting AI development costs.\n\nApple's iPhone sales are expected to have seen the best growth in five quarters. But analysts see a tough year for the company in China and traders are eager to see if Amazon can cash in on its delivery heft by boosting fee revenue from its \"Buy With Prime\" service.\n\n\"Our market positioning model shows that the Nasdaq is meaningfully stretched to the long side,\" Citi's Manthey said. \"So the selloff yesterday didn't alarm me.\"\n\nInvestors also seemed to be wagering that the more the Fed delayed now, the more aggressive it would have to cut in the future given slowing inflation would sharply lift real rates.\n\nAs a result, Fed fund futures for December have priced in a further 11 basis points of easing this year taking the total expected to 141 basis points.\n\nLikewise, Treasuries rallied strongly as 10-year yields dived 12 basis points to 3.91% in the wake of the Fed decision. Some of those gains were then pared in Europe, nudging yields up to 3.94% versus 2.21% on German bonds and more than 20-year lows of 2.42% in China this week.\n\nBANK JITTERS\n\nThe rush into bonds had been further encouraged by renewed jitters over regional U.S. banks when New York Community Bancorp crashed 37% on Wednesday to the lowest in over two decades after posting a surprise loss.\n\nThat spilled over into other bank stocks and contributed to a sharp 1.6% pullback in the S&P 500, while the Nasdaq had already been pressured by falls from Google parent Alphabet and Tesla.\n\nS&P 500 futures added 0.3%, while Nasdaq futures firmed 0.4%.\n\nAsian markets had been choppy overnight. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific ending down 0.4% although sentiment was helped by a stabilisation in Chinese blue chips , along with some better surveys on home prices and manufacturing.\n\nJapan's Nikkei eased 0.8% as the yen gained. South Korea bounced 1.8% following upbeat trade data and a survey showing factory activity grew for the first time in 19 months.\n\nGold also gyrated in the wake of the Fed, and was last up 0.2% at $2,041 an ounce.\n\nOil prices pared some of the sharp losses suffered on Wednesday, as tensions in the Middle East helped offset concerns about oversupply and soft global demand.\n\nBrent futures edged back above $81 a barrel, while U.S. crude rose 74 cents to $76.63 per barrel.\n\n(Additional reporting by Wayne Cole in Sydney; Editing by Ros Russell)",

        "title": "PayPal's Plan to 'Shock the World' Has Begun to Take Shape",
        "content": "Over the past year, the technology complex of stocks has enjoyed substantial gains, significantly outperforming the technology-focused Nasdaq Index. Unfortunately, PayPal Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL) has severely underperformed all other technology stocks as it fell 24% over the past year while the Nasdaq Composite Index rose 34% over the same period.\n\nThe issues plaguing PayPal have been well documented, with the fintech giant succumbing to a wide range of endogenous and exogenous factors. The company has recently seen a rotation in its management, with Alex Chriss and Jamie Miller joining PayPal last year as CEO and chief financial officer.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with PYPL.\n\nThe new CEO did give some early glimpses of what changes to expect as PayPal transitions in 2024, but his clearest guidance on its pivot to growth was given as management announced a slew of customer-focused innovative features last week.\n\nAfter carefully reviewing the innovation roadmap and evaluating PayPal's financial statements, I believe the stock is undervalued.\n\nBusiness model recap\n\nThe foundational offering of PayPal was to provide users with digital wallets, enabling them to easily transact online. Over time, the company's aspirations to become a fintech super app saw it make many acquisitions to rapidly expand its reach into newer extensions of its core fintech market. Venmo and Paidy are some of its well-known acquisitions and integrated as part of its Consumer Checkout business. Braintree was another acquisition made by PayPal and integrated as part of its Unbranded Processing business. Consumer Financial Services and Merchant Services are two of its other business units that help PayPal facilitate over 22 billion global financial transactions. In addition, the financial payments giant also ventured into complementary businesses such as cryptocurrency trading and buy now, pay later, which has became hugely popular in the post-pandemic era.\n\nStory continues PayPal's Plan to 'Shock the World' Has Begun to Take Shape\n\nSince PayPal is in the business of facilitating financial transactions, it collects a take rate for facilitating transactions between parties. Therefore, growth in the volume of total payments it processes is paramount for its businesses. In addition, it may also collect additional fees based on certain products, such as loans, merchant credit, foreign exchange, etc. to process payments on its platform.\n\nPayPal is positioning itself to shock the world and pivot to growth mode again\n\nIn an interview with CNBC earlier this month, Chriss hinted at some innovation-focused strategies the company will be adopting this year that will shock the world.\" PayPal's management later followed up the interview by launching new innovative products at a special event a week later. While I believe the special event was a step in the right direction, I think the broader investor community would have benefited from some more direct, long-term financial guidance based on the product launches. Still, I think PayPal's management has received the feedback, and I firmly believe it will push management to issue more detailed guidance in the upcoming fourth-quarter 2023 earnings call.\n\nIn my view, a majority of the strategic direction was given by the CEO in the CNBC interview that I pointed to earlier in this section. The first milestone as part of management's transitional strategy is to focus on launching more customer-focused and merchant-focused products that drive higher transactions among PayPal's existing user base. Management's plan is to incentivize the existing user base by rewarding them with cash back. In addition, the company also plans to leverage the large warehouse of transactional and customer data and use artificial intelligence to personalize the customer's buyer journey experience with cash back incentives. Based on the third-quarter results that I have added below, I noticed a meaningful uptick of 15% year-over-year growth in the total payment volume. To me, these are some early but very encouraging signs of the fundamental health of the business. I mentioned previously that a higher TPV widens the scope of PayPal's take rate, which eventually drives up its margins. PayPal's Plan to 'Shock the World' Has Begun to Take Shape\n\nThe second milestone PayPal aims to achieve is higher usage among small and medium-sized businesses. Chriss is a veteran at building products and solutions for SMBs. Before joining PayPal, he led the product ecosystem for Inuit's (NASDAQ:INTU) Small Businesses and Self Employed group. On the recent earnings call, he underscored his commitment to focusing on the SMB market while further adding, small businesses are a passion of mine and This is not only important to PayPal and has been in the past, it's really been the lifeblood of the organization. Deploying more solutions for small businesses will allow PayPal to collect subscription fees and platform fees for all the solutions, such as marketing, credit and e-commerce solutions that the company has in the product pipeline for its SMB merchants.\n\nThe third milestone that Chriss covered in the CNBC interview was management's initiative to divest its businesses so as to focus on the core transaction processing businesses that generate margins for the company. In my opinion, PayPal attempted to hastily expand into emerging categories of the fintech market by acquiring companies that would not be margin-positive for the company. On the last earnings call, management announced it sold Happy Returns to UPS (NYSE:UPS) for $465 million for a meaningful profit. This year, I expect management to double down on their initiatives to divest parts of the business that are not contributing to the company's profit margins or core functions.\n\nThrough this year, I anticipate PayPal will be able to drive significant improvements in their margins based on the strategies Chriss alluded to in the interview.\n\nInvestors are severely discounting PayPal's value\n\nGiven that PayPal's margins have not been stable over the past two years, I will estimate its value using the reverse discounted cash flow model. Before I move over to free cash flow, I will note its balance sheet carries about $10.6 billion in a combination of senior notes and operating leases. A majority of the debt is senior notes, which it previously held, while a portion of the debt was acquired due to the nature of its BNPL business. I do not see this as a risk since PayPal holds about $11.5 billion in cash and short-term securities.\n\nMoving onto PayPal's free cash, I see management is guiding for more than $4.6 billion in free cash for fiscal 2023. Still, I will take the trailing 12-month free cash of $3.18 billion for my model. Assuming a terminal growth rate of 2% and a discount rate of 9%, I see the markets are currently pricing in an average annual free cash flow growth rate of 6.80% for the next 10 years at the current price level. PayPal's Plan to 'Shock the World' Has Begun to Take Shape\n\nWith the initiatives that management has planned for PayPal in 2024, I believe there is significant room for growth beyond the 6.80% that markets are pricing in at PayPal's current levels.\n\nRisks and other factors to consider\n\nThe single biggest threat to PayPal's entire business is the fierce competition in all the different segments of the fintech target market. Within its core digital wallet market, PayPal has already lost a significant share to Apple Pay (NASDAQ:AAPL), causing investors to lose faith in the company as an active user account. Apple Pay also competes with PayPal in the nascent but fast-growing BNPL market, which is also hotly contested.\n\nNewer players such as Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) and current BNPL market leader Klaarna already innovate at a rapid pace, while PayPal's direct competitor, Block (NYSE:SQ), acquired Afterpay to compete here. Block's Square competes with PayPal directly in many fintech market segments, such as digital wallets, cryptocurrency trading, transaction processing and merchant solutions. PayPal also operates in the e-commerce transaction processing market by processing transactions via its PayPal-branded checkout and lower-margin unbranded checkout solutions, powered by Braintree. Over the past few months, the company has been able to gain market share in this space, especially in the North American region, at the expense of other incumbents such as Adyen and Stripe. But it has done so at the cost of lower transaction margins by accepting a lower take rate, which is not healthy for the business.\n\nSince my valuation already prices in the worst, I do not expect any significant changes in PayPal's market position in each of these markets this year, but I will be monitoring this space since the fintech market is rapidly evolving.\n\nTakeaways\n\nBased on my analysis, I believe investors have priced in the worst for PayPal. Its recent customer innovation announcement did not resonate with the explicit long-term financial targets that markets were expecting, but I am encouraged by the CEO's outlook on his strategy for this year, leading me to believe the stock is undervalued as of today. PayPal reports its full-year 2023 earnings results next week.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big Tech’s struggle to meet lofty investor expectations this earnings season has taken air out of a record-breaking stock run. Pressure is now on Apple Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Meta Platforms Inc. to come through on Thursday.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nTrump Risks Losing More Than Half of Swing-State Voters If Found Guilty Deutsche Bank Plans To Cut 3,500 Jobs And Lift Payouts House Passes $78 Billion Business, Child Tax Break Bill Donald Trump Loses London Case Against Ex-MI6 Spy Over Kremlin Dossier Musk’s $55 Billion Pay Package Voided, Threatening World’s Biggest Fortune\n\nThe sector has led the S&P 500 lower this week after results from Microsoft Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Advanced Micro Devices Inc. were met with selling by traders. Investors had bid up the stocks to records on bets that artificial intelligence efforts are set to provide a big lift to profits and sales.\n\n“The market seems to want more and more from these companies,” said Quincy Krosby, chief global strategist of LPL Financial LLC. “The market knows it has gone too far too fast and is saying ‘unless you astound us, we’re going to bring you down a number of notches.’”\n\nBig Tech stocks powered the S&P 500’s rally into record territory in January, but if this week is to set the tone for the month ahead, signs are pointing to uncertainty. The tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Stock Index suffered its biggest drop in three months on Wednesday after earnings disappointed and Fed Chair Jerome Powell dashed hopes of a March interest rate cut. Futures pointed to a rebound Thursday, however.\n\nRead more: Microsoft, Alphabet and AMD Struggle to Meet AI Expectations\n\nApple’s results are top of mind for investors. The Cupertino, California-based company’s shares have reflected concerns over sluggish iPhone sales and its slow-moving approach to artificial intelligence.\n\nWall Street analysts expect Apple to report about $118 billion in revenue for its first fiscal quarter, 1% higher than the same period a year ago. If the company meets the estimate, it would mark its first revenue expansion after four-consecutive quarters of declining sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nA narrow return to growth would come despite global challenges for Apple, which include Chinese restrictions on foreign technology and antitrust scrutiny in Europe. While the firm earned its reputation as one of the Magnificent Seven of 2023, jumping nearly 50% and hitting a record as recently as December, the stock has struggled this year.\n\nAt Amazon, the focus will be on its Amazon Web Services business, as well as expectations for its advertising segment after rolling out ads on the Prime Video service in the US.\n\nAWS sales are expected to expand 12% to $24 billion of Amazon’s projected $166 billion in sales for the fourth quarter, according to the average of analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg. Operating profit is expected to nearly quadruple.\n\nFacebook-parent Meta Platforms is expected to deliver revenue of $39 billion in the fourth quarter, a 21% jump from the previous period. Of the three, the stock has posted the biggest gain in 2024, up 10%.\n\nThe company could begin to show some payoff from its AI investments, Bank of America analysts led by Justin Post wrote in a research note on Wednesday.\n\nThe long game\n\nOf course, even though tech stocks face a difficult setup in the coming weeks, it doesn’t necessarily signal that the sector’s market-leading rally is destined to end in the near future.\n\nThat’s because the top technology firms are still seen as safe bets for investors looking to protect their portfolios against a potential economic downturn or further geopolitical uncertainty - they have strong balance sheets and are expected to continue to grow earnings.\n\n“They are the destination in nearly any scenario,” because of the different macro backdrops they’ve navigated, said Krosby.\n\nAnd a pullback in Big Tech after all-time highs isn’t necessarily a bearish signal, especially if coupled with buying in smaller companies, showing a broadening of 2023’s rally. It could also provide bulls with opportunities to add to their positions.\n\n“These are still the stocks that you want to be in and it’s giving investors an opportunity to buy the dip,” said Jay Woods, chief global strategist at Freedom Capital Markets.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nNvidia Corp. climbed 24% in January, its biggest monthly jump since May, in a clear indication that the chip giant is continuing to benefit from the artificial intelligence frenzy that gripped Wall Street over the past year. The rally dwarfed the 1.9% gain the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 Index made in the same period.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nIn an unscripted scene during tense testimony Wednesday, Meta Platforms Inc. Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg apologized directly to the families of children who were victims of sexual exploitation on social media platforms. Elon Musk wants to deepen his links to Texas after a loss in court over his compensation at Tesla Inc. Universal Music Group NV, the world’s biggest record label, has begun pulling its artists’ music from TikTok after contract negotiations between the two companies failed to result in a new licensing agreement. Microsoft Corp.’s Xbox Game Pass has scored its biggest hit from an outside developer with Palworld, the viral sensation that’s earned the colloquial description of “Pokémon with guns.” Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. is considering selling its InTime department store arm, suggesting the Chinese internet company is rethinking a years-old ambition of dominating physical and online retail as it undergoes a broad restructuring. The Pentagon added China’s leading memory chipmaker and prominent players in AI, energy and automobiles to a list of companies it accuses of aiding the Asian nation’s military.\n\nEarnings Due Thursday\n\nPremarket\n\nPeloton Macom Allegro MicroSystems Rogers Communications Sirius XM Postmarket\n\nApple Amazon Meta Platforms Atlassian Coursera Microchip Gen Digital Open Text Dolby Labs DXC Technology Viavi\n\n--With assistance from Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChinese Students Abroad Struggle With Tuition as Economy Falters There’s So Much Data Even Spies Are Struggling to Find Secrets AI Is Helping Pick What You’ll Wear in Two Years AI Can Speed Drug Discovery.

        "title": "At least 30 journalists, lawyers and activists hacked with Pegasus in Jordan, forensic probe finds",
        "content": "Israeli-made Pegasus spyware was used in Jordan to hack the cellphones of at least 30 people, including journalists, lawyers, human rights and opposition activists, the digital rights group Access Now said Thursday.\n\nThe hacking with spyware made by Israel's NSO Group occurred from early 2020 until last November, Access Now said in its report. It did not accuse Jordan's government of the hacking.\n\nOne of the targets was Human Rights Watch's deputy director for the region, Adam Coogle, who said in an interview that it was difficult to imagine who other than Jordan's government would be interested in hacking those who were targeted.\n\nThe Jordanian government had no immediate comment on Thursday's report.\n\nIn a 2022 report detailing a much smaller group of Pegasus victims in Jordan, digital sleuths at the University of Toronto's Citizen Lab identified two operators of the spyware it said may have been agents of the Jordanian government. A year earlier, Axios reported on negotiations between Jordan's government and NSO Group.\n\n“We believe this is just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the use of Pegasus spyware in Jordan, and that the true number of victims is likely much higher,” Access Now said. Its Middle East and North Africa director, Marwa Fatafta, said at least 30 of 35 known targeted individuals were successfully hacked.\n\nCitizen Lab confirmed all but five of the infections, with 21 victims asking to remain anonymous, citing the risk of reprisal. The rest were identified by Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International's Security Lab, and the Organized Crime and Corruption Reporting Project.\n\nNSO Group says it only sells to vetted intelligence and law enforcement agencies — and only for use against terrorists and serious criminals. But cybersecurity researchers who have tracked the spyware's use in 45 countries have documented dozens of cases of politically motivated abuse of the spyware — from Mexico to Thailand, Poland to Saudi Arabia.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn NSO Group spokesperson said the company would not confirm or deny its clients' identities. NSO Group says it vets customers and investigates any report its spyware has been abused.\n\nThe U.S. government was unpersuaded and blacklisted the NSO Group in November 2021, when iPhone maker Apple Inc. sued it, calling its employees “amoral 21st century mercenaries who have created highly sophisticated cyber-surveillance machinery that invites routine and flagrant abuse.”\n\nThose targeted in Jordan include Human Rights Watch's senior researcher for Jordan and Syria, Hiba Zayadin. Both she and Coogle had received threat notifications from Apple on Aug. 29 that state-sponsored attackers had attempted to compromise their iPhones.\n\nCoogle's local, personal iPhone was successfully hacked in October 2022, he said, just two weeks after the human rights group published a report documenting the persecution and harassment of citizens organizing peaceful political dissent.\n\nAfter that, Coogle activated “Lockdown Mode,\" on the iPhone, which Apple recommends for iPhone users at high risk.\n\nJordanian human rights lawyer Hala Ahed — known for defending women's and workers rights and prisoners of conscience — was also targeted at least twice by Pegasus, successfully in March 2021 then unsuccessfully in February 2023, Access Now said.\n\nAbout half of those found to have been targeted by Pegasus in Jordan — 16 in all — were journalists or media workers, the report said.\n\nOne veteran Palestinian-American journalist and columnist, Dauod Kuttab, was hacked with Pegasus three times between February 2022 and September 2023.\n\nAlong the way, he said, he's learned important lessons about not clicking on links in messages purporting to be from legitimate contacts, which is how one of the Pegasus hacks snared him.\n\nKuttab refused to speculate about who might have targeted him.\n\n“I always assume that somebody is listening to my conversations,” he said, as getting surveilled “comes with the territory” when you are journalist in the Middle East. But Kuttab does worry about his sources being compromised by hacks — and the violation of his privacy.\n\n\"Regardless of who did it, it's not right to intervene into my personal, family privacy and my professional privacy.”",

(Operator Instructions) Please note, this event is being recorded. I would now like to turn the conference over to Tanny Shelburne, Senior Vice President of Investor Relations. Please go ahead.\n\nTanny Shelburne\n\nThank you, operator, and good morning, everyone. Today's call will be led by CEO, Bernard Kim; and President and CFO, Gary Swidler. They'll make a few brief remarks, and then we'll open it up for questions. \r\nBefore we start, I need to remind everyone that during this call, we may discuss our outlook and future performance. These forward-looking statements may be preceded by words such as we expect, we believe, we anticipate or similar statements. These statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, and our actual results could differ materially from the views expressed today. Some of these risks have been set forth in our earnings release and our periodic reports with the SEC. \r\nWith that, I'd like to turn the call over to BK.\n\nStory continues\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nThanks, Tanny. Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining today's call. As I reflect on 2023, I am deeply proud of the accomplishments and progress that we made as a team. Just 1 year ago, we introduced an entirely new operating structure with several new leaders put in place across Tinder, Hinge, MG Asia and E&E, and it's been working. \r\nTogether, we deepened our focus on execution and innovation, helping lay the foundation for sustained longer-term growth. At the same time, we recaptured financial momentum, ending the year with strong revenue growth and our third consecutive quarter of record AOI. \r\nBefore we dive into more detail regarding our ambitious plans and goals for this coming year, I wanted to take a moment to recognize Faye Iosotaluno as Tinder's new CEO, which we announced earlier this month. Faye has been an impactful leader at Match Group for several years, and most recently as COO of Tinder. Her intimate understanding of the online gaming category as well as her deep expertise in strategy and business development, among many other skills, are just a few of the reasons why I believe Faye is best suited to lead Tinder in its next chapter of growth. \r\nFaye is also supported by Tinder's strong management team, which we set in place last year, giving me the utmost confidence in their ability to execute together. The plans for Tinder reflect our shared vision, and I look forward to working with her (inaudible). \r\nAt Match Group, we come to work highly motivated every day to foster genuine human connections. But the tools and technologies that people use to connect, match and date today must evolve to meet modern expectations of today's daters. \r\nAnd as Tinder once did a decade ago, it's imperative that we boldly innovate to create engaging, joyful and exciting experiences for users on our apps. There are certain things that are table stakes for us. We need to continue to foster online communities where women, and all underrepresented groups of people can show up as their true authentic selves, feel safe and be respected. But this new generation of singles is digital-first and expect platforms like ours to allow daters to showcase their unique personalities in an engaging setting and be shown highly curated matches. In 2024, our road maps are shaped with this in mind. \r\nFirst, we are working to improve existing dating apps, beginning with our 2 largest brands, Tinder and Hinge. Leveraging AI, Tinder will focus on creating a more inclusive experience beginning with improving the Gen Z and women's experiences while solving for key user pain points across the dating journey. \r\nAt Tinder, Faye and her team are relentlessly focused on modernizing the existing experience. For example, take Tinder's effortless swipe feature. In 2024, Tinder plans to build on the swipe right and swipe left mechanism by adding in more discovery gestures to better align with today's behaviors and expectations. Not only will users be able to like as they always have, but now they will be able to swipe up to engage deeper in profiles and swipe down for a revamped new Explore experience. \r\nTinder is also working on several features that give women real and relevant experiences every time they come into the app. This will include increased trust and safety, more focused on the right primary photos and improved curation of recommendations. By continuously improving the product, building on what works while modernizing key features will produce an experience that aligns with what the next generations of daters are expecting. 2023 was a year of execution and increased product velocity for Tinder, which set a strong foundation. \r\nIn 2024, Tinder is adopting a fast-fail mentality, a strategy that prioritizes rapid experimentation and testing. This approach is all about agility. If a new idea or feature doesn't yield the anticipated results, the team is prepared to quickly pivot, absorbing valuable insights and move forward. We recognize that not every innovation will be a groundbreaking success. However, it's this very willingness to embrace risk and learn from failures that fuels our growth. And when we do strike gold, it not only elevates our business, but it sets a new standard for our users, which we will continually enhance. \r\nWe look forward to sharing more over time, but I am confident that these changes will meaningfully transform Tinder in 2024 and beyond as it builds on its roots and shapes a product experience that redefines dating yet again. Similarly, Hinge is leveraging AI to further improve its powerful experience by reimagining meaningful connection. Hinge envisions a focused and intentioned experience that places guidance at the heart of a dater's journey. \r\nHinge will aim to truly understand you and what you're looking for in order to introduce you to the right person sooner. This redesigned experience will utilize the vast treasure trove of insights on profiles, rich interactions and great dates that Hinge has collected over several years. Hinge will help users discover matches based on shared interests and highlight compatibility in addition to many other features with the ultimate goal of improving dating outcomes for its users. This work will begin in 2024, and I can't wait to share more as things progress. \r\nIn 2023, we established a central innovation team that has been making significant impact. In 2024 and beyond, the team will focus on launching disruptive new brands that will grow the category and bring in those who may not have previously tried a traditional dating app. Additionally, we're building internal technology capabilities in coordination with our central innovation teams to help improve our overall effectiveness as a company. While AI brings with it cost efficiencies and a potent optimization tool, we view it as far more than just that. AI has played an important strategic role at Match Group for years from trust and safety efforts to our matching algorithms. And I believe it will play an even larger role moving forward. \r\nAI enables us to bring groundbreaking improvements across a dater's journey. We expect it to touch every aspect of our apps by improving profile quality, discoverability and matching and even more importantly, creating an even safer environment for our users to connect in. The bets that we are making are bold, and large-scale changes like this do take time. However, we expect to make tangible progress through 2024 as we roll out AI-driven capabilities and feature enhancements within our existing apps, and as new AI-powered standalone apps begin testing in the marketplace. \r\nI am confident that early indications of momentum at Tinder, particularly from Gen Z and women, will be evident in the second half of the year as a result of consistent brand narrative, modernizing product and an ecosystem that celebrates human connection and inclusivity. Ultimately, we recognize that our ability to deliver revenue growth and free cash flow is what gives us the freedom to pursue these ambitious road maps. \r\nAs we push the boundaries of innovation, we will maintain financial discipline. We will grow revenues, maintain or enhance our margins and generate significant free cash flow, which will allow us to return capital to shareholders. 2024 is about both delivering on our short-term commitments and positioning our company for enduring long-term growth. We've always been at the forefront, adapting to technology shifts, and we'll continue to lead this wave of change. At the heart of our endeavors is an unwavering dedication to delivering products and services that delight our customers. \r\nAnd with that, I will turn it over to Gary.\n\nGary Swidler\n\nThanks, BK, and hello, everyone. Thank you for joining us this morning. Our business demonstrated strong financial performance again this quarter. \r\nTinder once again delivered double-digit year-over-year direct revenue growth as did the company as a whole. We achieved record quarterly AOI for the third consecutive quarter and record OI for the second consecutive quarter, further evaluating the steps we've taken to strengthen the business. \r\nMatch Group's total revenue for Q4 was $866 million, up 10% year-over-year, an acceleration from 9% year-over-year in Q3. For the full year, Match Group delivered total revenue of $3.4 billion, up 6% year-over-year with AOI of $1.3 billion, representing margin of 37%. Excluding the $40 million we received as part of the Google settlement, full year AOI margins would have been up 80 basis points compared to 2022, meeting our goal of flat or better year-over-year AOI margin. \r\nQ4 Tinder direct revenue was up 11% year-over-year at $493 million. Tinder RPP was up 21% year-over-year at $16.49 due to the effects of the U.S. price optimizations and weekly packages we rolled out earlier in 2023. We did see a continued pressure on users at Tinder, both in the U.S. and globally, during the November and December holiday months, resulting in a mid-single-digit year-over-year decline in new user registrations and reactivations in Q4. Q4 Tinder payers declined 8% year-over-year to 10 million, slightly below our expectations. For the year, Tinder delivered direct revenue of $1.9 billion, up 7% year-over-year with AOI margins in excess of 50%. \r\nOur Hinge brand continued to perform very well. Hinge direct revenue growth accelerated to 50% year-over-year, a further 6-point acceleration over Q3. Hinge Q4 payers were up 33% year-over-year to 1.4 million, while RPP of over $28 was up 13% year-over-year in Q4. \r\nFor the full year, Hinge delivered direct revenue of $396 million, just shy of our $400 million target primarily due to slower top-of-funnel growth in Q4 than we were anticipating. Historically, Hinge has not seen a seasonal slowdown during Q4 like many brands see. This Q4, for the first time, Hinge did see that seasonal slowdown. that said, Hinge has had a very strong start to 2024 in terms of top of funnel in every market and among virtually every age and gender cohort. So there's been a clear bounce back. \r\nMatch Group Q4 AOI was $362 million, up 27% year-over-year, including $40 million that was returned to us as part of the Google litigation settlement for margins of 42%. Excluding the $40 million, AOI would have been up 13% year-over-year, and margins would have been 37%. Operating income was $260 million in Q4 for a margin of 30%, 25% after adjusting out the impact of the Google settlement. Q4 2022 included an impairment of intangibles of approximately $100 million, and OI margin would have improved 3.5 points if not for the impairment in 2022. \r\nOverall expenses, including SBC expense, were down 11% year-over-year in Q4, down 5% excluding the Google settlement. Excluding the settlement, cost of revenue, including SBC expense, grew 5% year-over-year in Q4 and represented 29% of total revenue, down 1 point year-over-year. Excluding the settlement, App Store fees increased $17 million year-over-year, 20 basis points as a percent of total revenue in the fourth quarter. Selling and marketing costs, including SBC expense, increased $32 million or 25% year-over-year in Q4 primarily due to increased spend at Tinder. Selling and marketing spend was up 2 points as a percentage of total revenue at 18%. \r\nG&A costs, including SBC expense, declined 2% year-over-year in Q4 and 2 points as a percent of revenue to 12% as legal and professional fees declined by $11 million year-over-year. Product development costs, including SBC expense, grew 21% year-over-year in Q4 primarily as a result of higher compensation expense due to increased headcount at Hinge and Tinder and were up 1 point as a percent of total revenue at 11%. \r\nFor Q1 '24, we expect total revenue for Match Group of $850 million to $860 million, up 8% to 9% year-over-year. We expect FX to be a 2-point year-over-year headwind in Q1. At Tinder, we expect direct revenue to be $480 million to $485 million, up 9% to 10% year-over-year in Q1. Again, we expect FX to be a 2-point year-over-year headwind. We expect RPP and payer year-over-year trends to be broadly in line with what we saw in Q4 with Q1 demonstrating less than half the sequential decline in number of payers than we saw in Q4. \r\nAcross our other brands, we expect direct revenue of $355 million to $360 million, up 7% to 8% year-over-year. Within our other brands, we expect Hinge to deliver approximately $120 million of direct revenue in Q1, year-over-year growth of approximately 45%. We believe that macroeconomic conditions and consumers' willingness to spend has remained relatively stable since our last earnings call. We have not seen any additional impact on our subscription or ALC revenue. \r\nWe expect Match Group AOI of $270 million to $275 million in Q1, representing year-over-year growth of 6% and margin of 32% at the midpoint of the ranges. We expect overall Q1 marketing spend to increase by approximately $30 million year-over-year collectively at Tinder and at Hinge compared to the levels these brands were spending at in early '23 as we seek to reinvigorate user growth at Tinder and continue the stellar user growth at Hinge in both core and European expansion markets during our peak season in the first quarter. \r\nThat said, we continue to monitor closely for marketing efficacy and can pull back if we don't see the desired results. We entered 2024 with solid revenue momentum and believe we're positioned to deliver total revenue of between $3.565 billion and $3.665 billion, representing year-over-year growth of 6% to 9%. At Tinder, we expect direct revenue of $2.025 billion to $2.075 billion or growth of 6% to 8% year-over-year. We believe this revenue target for Tinder provides the new leadership with sufficient room to focus on ecosystem improvements, product improvements and user growth initiatives to drive sustainable long-term growth. \r\nOur outlook assumes modest improvement in Tinder user trends over the course of 2024 but not yet a return to year-over-year user growth. We expect payer growth to improve through the year, achieving positive sequential payer net adds in Q3 and positive year-over-year payer growth by Q4. Across our other brands, we expect direct revenue to be $1.480 billion to $1.530 billion or 6% to 10% year-over-year growth. Within our other brands, at Hinge, we expect direct revenue of $535 million to $545 million, which represents growth of 35% to 38% year-over-year with a continued focus on driving share gains in Hinge's core and European markets. \r\nWe've assumed FX to be a 1.5-point headwind to full year '24 total revenue growth. We expect 2024 indirect revenue of approximately $60 million, up approximately 8% year-over-year. \r\nFor 2024, our current anticipation is for AOI margins to be at least 36%. Our margin will largely depend on the various brands' levels of revenue growth and how we calibrate certain investments that are critical to achieve our organic growth plans. \r\nThere are several key investment areas that are impacting margins that we'd like to call out. The first is at Tinder in both product innovation and marketing. As we reinvent the Tinder experience, we're putting substantial incremental resources into product to improve the experience and cater better to women and Gen and in marketing to build a better brand narrative and higher awareness of the new and improved experience. For 2024, we estimate $30 million to $40 million in incremental Tinder expense from increased product innovation and marketing spend in '24 compared to '23. \r\nThe second is AI-related investments in key brands and the development of new AI-centric products as we believe AI can help improve our users' experience and bring resistors into the category as well as potentially expand our TAM. We have a long list of product features being rolled out at Tinder and Hinge as well as plans to test new and different products that leverage AI throughout 2024. Our current expectation is for incremental 2024 AI-related spend of $20 million to $30 million across Match Group. \r\nAnd finally, investment in Hinge. We're confident that Hinge can be a $1 billion top line business, and it has an ambitious plan over the next few years to build off its well-regarded product and the traction it has achieved in all markets entered. \r\nWhile we anticipate significant operating leverage in this business long term, during this hyper-growth phase, we're managing the business to roughly flat AOI margins in 2024. To ensure we're continuing to invest in the product innovation, expansion markets and brand to help us realize Hinge's full potential. In dollar terms, that means that $40 million to $50 million incrementally is going into Hinge's product and marketing in 2024 compared to 2023. \r\nAll 3 of these investment areas are elective and can be calibrated as this year proceeds. Because of the cost reduction actions and natural operating leverage of our business, we're able to target margins of at least 36% while reinvesting roughly $100 million into the 3 key investment areas, which we expect to not only help us deliver growth this year but position us for long-term success specifically to: one, achieve sustained user, payer and revenue growth at Tinder; two, to capitalize on Hinge's full potential; and three, to ensure that we're the ones who introduce the next great innovation in the business of connecting people. \r\nImportantly, we expect to begin to see tangible results from this investment this year, not necessarily full payback on a dollar basis. But as BK outlined, we expect to see better product experience at Tinder, including improved satisfaction among women and Gen Z, and Hinge [making] progress on delivering its revenue goals and expanding market share. We also expect to see AI-driven features in our core brands as well as (inaudible). We're positioned to make these investments and move our business strategically forward while holding our already attractive margins approximately flat year-over-year. \r\nAs some of you may know, Apple recently announced changes to their App Store fee policies in response to the upcoming implementation of the Digital Markets Act in the European Union on March 6. We continue to analyze these changes, and our preliminary estimate is an approximately $20 million annualized benefit. However, Apple's new policies are merely a proposal and could change materially over time. We expect any savings that we achieved from Apple's changes will help us meet or exceed our margin objective for the year. \r\nGiven the March implementation date, we don't anticipate significant Q1 impact. Our $20 million annualized estimate does not include the benefit from use of alternative app stores or payment processors nor have we included any benefits from policy changes in geographies outside the EU, which would be substantial for us. We have said before that the DMA was likely to lead to changes to App Store policies in the EU and likely globally. We have seen the first brick fall in this regard, and we expect more to come. This is in addition to the recent decision by the U.S. Supreme Court in the Epic versus Apple case and Epic's win versus Google in its antitrust case. \r\nWe have not included any further benefits from App Store changes in our outlook at this time as we want to watch how all of this continues to evolve, though we would point out that the $650 million we paid to App Stores in 2023 provides ample room for reduction. \r\nWe're pleased by the financial results we achieved in the back half of '23 in terms of both revenue growth and profitability. We have plans in place to deliver solid '24 financial performance while enabling marketing and product initiatives to lead to improved user growth and position the business for sustained long-term growth. \r\nWe continue to believe that Match Group provides a rare combination of revenue growth, stellar profitability and substantial free cash flow generation. We have plans in place to supplement our shareholders' return with significant return of capital via share repurchases or potentially other means. We believe few, if any, companies in our space offer this combination of attributes to shareholders. \r\nWith that, I'll ask the operator to open the line for questions.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) The first question today comes from Shweta Khajuria from Evercore ISI.\n\nShweta R. Khajuria\n\nBK, anything you can comment on Elliott's stake in the company and your conversations with them thus far? \r\nAnd then my follow-up is for Gary. Gary, could you please provide more color on your level of confidence in Tinder net adds turning positive in third quarter and a positive year-over-year payer growth in the fourth quarter?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nGreat. Thanks, Shweta, for the first question. We've had collaborative dialogue with Elliott over the past few weeks ever since we learned about their stake in the company. We are looking forward to continuing to engage with all of our shareholders, including Elliott.\n\nGary Swidler\n\nAnd then, Shweta, on your questions around Tinder net adds, I think as we said in the letter and in our remarks, we have high confidence that we're going to see sequential improvement in Tinder by Q3 on the net add side and that we will get some modest payer growth year-over-year by Q4. And that's a combination of a few things, most notably the product and marketing initiatives we have that are -- that have been put in place through the course of '23 and into '24, which we think will drive the level of growth we need to achieve those goals of sequential net adds in Q3 and then payer growth year-over-year in Q4. \r\nAnd it's a series of things, not just one specific thing that we're relying on or expecting to drive that. It's a series of improvements and initiatives that Tinder has in the plans. And so we think that will culminate in achieving the goals around payer net adds by the middle of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Lauren Schenk with Morgan Stanley.\n\nLauren Elizabeth Cassel Schenk\n\nJust looking back on 2023, what do you believe caused Tinder user growth to be negative despite the incremental marketing spend? And how will the marketing message evolve in 2024, if at all? And then just one on the 1Q EBITDA guide. It was about $25 million below the Street. Is that just the incremental marketing push you've been speaking about? Or are there other drivers there that we should take into account? And how should we think about the cadence of Tinder marketing spend through '24?\n\nGary Swidler\n\nYes. So I think it's important to understand what went on in '23 so that you can understand kind of the trajectory of the business. We put in place a new brand narrative to Tinder, something that we hadn't focused on for a long time. We finally did that in 2023. And when you try to put in place a brand narrative and start to tell that story, it takes time to build. And so it doesn't translate into user growth immediately. \r\nAnd in fact, what we saw in '23 was pretty good progress on the user growth side in the first half of the year, as a result in part of the marketing initiatives. I think we hadn't been in the market very effectively on the market side in a while. And so we did see some really good user growth improvement from, let's call it, February of last year until the middle of the year. \r\nAnd then in the second half of the year, the trends kind of reverted to where they had been, down kind of mid-single digits on the user side year-over-year. And while we saw that step back, we did continue to see movement in some key metrics that we focus on for the brand campaign, brand consideration and improvement in consideration, particularly younger women. And so we were satisfied that the brand campaign was doing what we expected it to do over the course of 2023. The campaign has been very [prenscient] with the target demographic, and it's been very well awarded by some of the ad publications. \r\nAnd so we're continuing to invest in that marketing campaign. We're continuing to do it in the key global markets. And we're trying to have an always-on philosophy so there's not gaps in the marketing. And that's what we've budgeted for, for this year. I would just point out though that marketing can only do so much. Tinder, like many of our brands, is a product-driven company. And so while marketing can help on the user growth side, the user growth really needs to be driven by product and product innovation. And marketing needs to be aligned with product to drive people back to the app or to reconsider the app or consider it for the first time once product has really innovated and improved. \r\nSo that is part of the plan for 2024. We are spending pretty heavily in Q1 on the marketing side, as you pointed out, because we do want to drive users back to the app after the refresh. And so that is part of the plan for the first quarter. I do think that people maybe didn't quite understand the magnitude of what we are planning to spend in the first quarter on Tinder marketing. I do think that accounts for maybe the gap in expectations versus what sell-side analysts had for the quarter. \r\nAnd so that -- and that plus a little bit of user softness that we saw in Q4, which leads to revenue softness and therefore, AOI softness as well are probably the 2 factors. We are planning to continue to spend heavily in the first quarter. I would say after that, the marketing cadence is probably pretty evenly spread throughout the rest of the year. But as we say, we're nimble on the marketing side. And to the extent we don't see the expected user growth trends or effectiveness of the marketing campaign, we can adjust and pull back. \r\nAnd so we're pushing hard in the first quarter at Tinder and frankly, at Hinge as well. And then we'll sort of recalibrate and see. But right now, I'd say it's spread pretty evenly the rest of the way.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Chris Kuntarich with UBS.\n\nChristopher Louis Kuntarich\n\nCan you just talk a little bit more about what those early learnings have been around the Tinder product refresh and how that is really tying into the marketing spend for Tinder that you're talking about this year?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nI'll take that one. Great question, Chris. The refresh in December was our first step in the product modernization that we're undergoing as a team. It's been less than 2 months since the refresh went live, and we're already seeing encouraging signs. For example, over 80% of our daily users are currently using dark mode. \r\nAnd as for prompts and quizzes, we're excited about the early adoption rates. Quizzes are already seeing a 15% adoption rate, and prompts are not that far behind. This is a strong indicator of user engagement, especially considering how recently these features were introduced. \r\nI'd like to add that it's important for us to remember that these features are optional. So not all users will adopt them, but their presence offers more ways for users to engage. Our approach last fall testing numerous features independently before combining them into a broader refresh has created tremendous learning across Tinder. These tests have taught us quickly to identify what works and what doesn't work, informing our fail-fast strategy for 2024. \r\nAnd as Gary mentioned, we are leaning in on our marketing strategy, However, it's crucial to leverage marketing to spot (inaudible) new product features. Therefore, we might adjust our spend levels to align with the rollout of these new features throughout the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Justin Patterson with KeyBanc.\n\nJustin Tyler Patterson\n\nGreat. Could you elaborate a little bit more about the Hinge slowdown that occurred during December and what drove the reacceleration? I know you talked about that we haven't really seen seasonality in Hinge before. So I'm curious how that seasonality compares to what you've seen towards some of your more mature apps in there?\n\nGary Swidler\n\nSure. Let me take that, Justin. So we do see seasonality in most of our apps, especially the larger ones, in the period in kind of November and December. That's typical. We see it at Tinder. We see it at other brands because users in many parts of the world tend to focus on the holiday season, and they pull back from their dating activities in that period. \r\nAnd then what we tend to see is right after Christmas through Valentine's Day, we actually see a very strong period. That's our peak season from right after Christmas to Valentine's Day when people start looking for love. And so that's kind of the cadence that we typically see in the business. \r\nWe haven't seen that historically at Hinge, but I think now that the business has achieved some reasonable level of scale in some of the core markets like the U.S., we are starting to see that seasonality like we do at Tinder and other brands. And so I'm expecting that we'll see that going forward. But 2023 was the first time that we've seen that. \r\nThe good news is that, that is in the rearview mirror for us at this point. Hinge got off to a very strong start in January, kind of picked off -- picked up where it had left off before the holiday period. \r\nWe've seen really good strength in all the geographies where it operates across all gender and age cohorts. And so we're very pleased with what's happened thus far in January. And that's very encouraging because when a brand gets off to a strong start in the peak season, it tends to bode well for its performance for the rest of the year. And so we're happy to see that, and we're looking forward to Hinge performing well in 2024.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from [Zach Morse] with Wolfe Research.\n\nUnidentified Analyst\n\nGreat. I appreciate the color on the Tinder's kind of product road map for this year that [what's included] in the letter. And I wanted to kind of focus more on this à la carte opportunity that you stated. So can you share any kind of preliminary details on the kind of new à la carte offering products that you have planned for the second half of this year? I mean how that may differ versus kind of what is currently offered in the app. And then do you see this more as a payer penetration or monetization driver for this year?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nZach, thanks for the question. We're going to hold back on diving into the specifics of our upcoming ALC offerings for competitive reasons. But what I can share, historically, our 2 main ALC features, Super Like and Boost, have been helping users gain more visibility and stand out. But we actually have not launched any new ALC features for a long time. We're now exploring additional ALC features that can bring even more value to our users. \r\nOur team will vigorously test new offerings to see what resonates most with our daters. And in this effort, we mobilize our portfolio of brands to partner and collaborate with Tinder on these tests. This approach is similar to how swipe up actually tested weekly subs to tune the right offering before we introduced them on Tinder and Hinge. This team effort will be instrumental in trialing some of these potential new features before we roll them out on Tinder. Expect to see a new ALC offering from us in the second half of this year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Benjamin Black with Deutsche Bank.\n\nBenjamin Thomas Black\n\nI guess with the new leadership in place, what, I guess, any difference should we expect in Tinder strategy? How should we think about things like product output velocity, marketing strategy? For instance, I think you guys also mentioned sort of the renewed focus on ecosystem improvements. And BK, now that you have a permanent successor in place at Tinder, how do you envision your role sort of evolving?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nThanks, Ben, for the question. Now over the last 18 months, Faye has been a real partner to me. She's so passionate about Tinder and knows the business and product inside out. \r\nWe've stabilized and returned Tinder to revenue growth. And I believe that Faye is only going to accelerate that momentum. The team is fully aligned and clear on their goals. \r\nFaye has been instrumental in shaping our road map. And now as CEO, she is pushing forward with modernizing the product, boosting development speed and bringing vital leadership. And her focus will be particularly in enhancing women's experience and the overall ecosystem health at Tinder. \r\nShe will share more of our plan later this year, but the core focus is clear: making Tinder more engaging for younger users and ensure superior experiences for women. \r\nNow as for my role, I have a ton of rewarding work to do across the portfolio. There's a wealth of exciting innovation sprint across Match Group that I'm deeply involved in. Now at the same time, I'm committed to maintaining a close and effective partnership with Faye and the Tinder leadership team. We will ensure that we continue to drive Tinder growth together as a team.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Mark Kelley with Stifel.\n\nMark Patrick Kelley\n\nGreat. I just have one, probably for BK. A lot of AI commentary in the note and in your prepared remarks. I guess my question is, is the goal to have like a unified AI infrastructure on the back end that will be utilized across the portfolio? \r\nOr do you think there are unique needs across each individual brand where it makes sense to maybe modify those AI capabilities? And I guess second to that, I know you gave us guidance for the full year in terms of margins, but any cost implications that we should be aware of?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nThanks, Mark. I was actually hoping that someone ask me about AI. And I want to just share some of my thoughts around AI. I mean I believe that AI is existential to the future of Match Group and our business. \r\nAI will help us create improved user experiences and will truly make our products better. And that puts us in a different category from other companies that are just looking at optimizing through AI and slight improvements. \r\nThis technology is revolutionary for dating, and we're bringing it to life across our entire portfolio. I envision AI to be felt through the entire experience, influencing everything from profile creation to matching and connecting for dates, literally everything. Our data as a team and deep understanding of dating and singles is a rich resource for informing our AI dating models internally. Our 2 biggest brands, Tinder and Hinge, have their own AI strategies tailored to its unique needs and listening to daters and what they want. \r\nNow we do have this central innovation team working across the entire portfolio on moonshot ideas and incubating new products. And our talented team at Hyperconnect is playing a crucial role in supporting all of these initiatives across the company. I'm really excited about this revolution going across the entire team. Gary mentioned in his comments that we are investing $20 million to $30 million in AI innovation. And I absolutely believe it's the right thing for us to do to drive enduring strength, better experiences and future growth for our business.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ygal Arounian with Citigroup.\n\nYgal Arounian\n\nJust one follow-up on the AI thought. And obviously, lots of talk around this here. And just trying to understand how much AI contribution is kind of embedded into the expectations for 2024. When you see it having a more meaningful impact? And maybe, at least, for this year, do you see it as more of a driver for payers or for RPP? Or does it -- can it contribute to both?\n\nGary Swidler\n\nWhy don't I jump in and take that one? So as BK said, we've got a lot of exciting AI initiatives planned for Tinder, for Hinge and for new products as well that we're going to roll over the course of 2024. So we do have very high expectations for delivery of all these products and features that we think they will enhance the user experience. \r\nAnd so I think it's logical to think that they would benefit RPP because it will be a better experience, people should see more value in the product and be willing to pay more. But I would tell you that at this point, given that it's still very early in the evolution of these various products and features, we haven't included any notable revenue in our 2024 outlook from the AI efforts. \r\nAs BK mentioned, we've put in all of the costs, which we've estimated at $20 million to $30 million, so we can go hire people, do the work to build out these different products and features and roll them out over the course of the year. But we are waiting on the revenue side. Now you might view that as a conservative assumption, and it very well could be. But I think at this point in time, it's the right thing to do. And we'll obviously continue to update what we're seeing from the AI initiatives as the year progresses.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Cory Carpenter with JPMorgan.\n\nCory Alan Carpenter\n\nAnything you would call out or highlight on the Tinder product road map that you think could be particularly impactful in driving that Tinder payer turnaround in second half? And Gary, just to clarify, the $20 million App Store benefit, is that included in the guide? Or is that something that would be upside?\n\nBernard J. Kim\n\nI'll take the first part of that question, Cory. We feel really good about the progress that we've made at Tinder over the past few months, and the results have aligned really well with our expectations. We've demonstrated Tinder's capability to deliver. They've achieved double-digit revenue growth for the last 2 quarters consecutively. And I'm really excited about the continued strong execution velocity and the product and marketing road maps for 2024. \r\nNow we acknowledge that Q4 was a large sequential payer decline, but we are optimistic about the future as we see these declines moderating. Looking ahead, we're confident that in Q3, Tinder payers will turn positive on a sequential basis. This confidence stems from marketing coupled with several product initiatives that are underway. Our key strategies include enhancing the visibility and value of our paid packages and dynamically showing the right offer to the right user at the right time. Now additionally, our monetization team is working on more market-specific conversion strategies and experimenting with unbundling certain premium features that currently sit behind a paywall.\n\nGary Swidler\n\nAnd then on the DMA question. Cory, we've got this margin floor in our financial outlook. And so the $15 million, that would probably accrue in 2024 because we're saying it's $20 million annualized. So if you say it's 3/4, let's call it, $15 million. That obviously helps us achieve our margin target or even gives us an ability to exceed the margin target as the year goes on. \r\nAnd so it's helpful in that regard to kind of push us maybe at the top end or higher than kind of what people might be expecting. And so it's definitely a positive from our perspective. \r\nObviously, we've got a lot of investment going on, and so we'll have to think about whether any of that should be reinvested. But ultimately, I do think it's a $15 million positive for the year.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Youssef Squali with Truist Securities.\n\nYoussef Houssaini Squali\n\nSo the company has been talking about steps to reduce duplicative functions and migrate the Evergreen & Emerging Brands onto one technology platform to consolidate the brands onto a single tech stack. Where are you in that process? What kind of cost savings or margin impact are you baking in, in 2024? And ultimately, how much do you anticipate to be deriving from that over time?\n\nGary Swidler\n\nSure. We haven't spent a lot of addressing that. So appreciate the question. What's been happening, and this is related to our E&E business, both the Emerging businesses and the Evergreen businesses, where we're trying to be more efficient. \r\nWhat we've started to do is centralize teams and reduce redundancies in various aspects of the E&E business. So if you look at the marketing function, you look at the customer care function, other aspects of their operations, we're reducing duplication. And that's leading to some savings this year and on an ongoing basis. So that's kind of the first piece of what's going on there. But the second and more important piece is that we've got a number of brands within that mini portfolio inside the company. We're consolidating the technology platforms onto a single technology platform. \r\nWe did a couple of the smaller brands last year. We're going to do a couple of more brands this year, and then we're going to do some of the bigger brands next year. So it's a multiyear process. And the reason for that is, it has customer implications. And so you have to be cautious. It's a complex and risky undertaking. And we want to do it right and not have any unexpected consequences. And so we're working kind of very deliberately and very carefully to make all of that happen. When those consolidations take place, we do see significant cost savings from them. And so that's where we really started to get the financial benefit. \r\nSo as I mentioned, we got a little bit as a result of what we did last year. We've got a little bit more as what I would do this year. And then the real benefits will accrue fully by 2026, where we'll see all the benefits of having one single platform, and we'll have reduced all of the various redundancies. I would estimate that there's probably a 10-point margin improvement in the E&E business once all of those cost savings are fully included. So that's a substantial amount of money on a business that is somewhere between $600 million and $700 million of revenue. \r\nAnd so that enables us to reinvest the savings into growth businesses around the company, whether that's into Tinder, whether that's at the Hinge or wherever we want to put it. That's the plan once those savings are achieved. So this is a pretty significant undertaking for the company. It gives us the ability to reinvest the dollars that are coming out as a result of the platform consolidations, and we're working very hard and carefully to make all of that happen.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Ross Sandler with Barclays.\n\nRoss Adam Sandler\n\nGreat. Gary, can we go back to the App Store fees topic in the DMA? So it sounds like, based on public statements anyway, that Spotify and Fortnite have very little interest in paying Apple anything for apps that are side loaded where there's direct billing in that app at least in Europe. So would you guys fall into that camp? And is that $20 million that you called out just from the fee changes that have been announced assuming that you actually have to pay them for these changes? \r\nAnd then -- and I guess the second question is, if Google kind of matches a similar fee structure and then this kind of becomes the global standard, what would that total number look like in some future state versus the 20 you called out?\n\nGary Swidler\n\nYes. So it's one of the reasons why, in answering Cory's question, is it included or not. There's still a lot of uncertainty around this. I think if you just do the straight calculation as we understand the policy changes that Apple put in place, you get to that $20 million number for a full year. \r\nBut I think there's still a lot of questions. As you point out, Spotify has raised questions and concerns. Microsoft has raised them. Others have raised them. And so you have to decide whether to opt into this or not. We have not yet done so. And so we're still considering what this all means, which is why just kind of putting it into the guidance or not is not exactly the way this all works. And so we're still looking at it, making sure we understand it. \r\nAnd frankly, if you understand the dynamics of all this, this is what Apple has proposed complies with the Digital Markets Act in Europe. The European Commission actually has to accept that this proposal complies and that and of itself is far from assured. And so I think that will continue to play itself out over the next weeks or months as we get to that March 6 deadline. So we'll see how this all plays out. \r\nFrom our perspective, the good news is that we expected the DMA to lead the changes on the App Store side, and we started to see that. And it's hard for us to fathom that it will end there because even if the changes that Apple has proposed are what goes into place in the EU, if you're a consumer in the U.S. or you're a consumer in the U.K. right next door to the EU. You start to wonder, \"Well, why are customers in the EU getting benefit, and we're not getting the same benefits?\"\r\nAnd so if you're the government in those jurisdictions, you'd say, \"Well, our citizens deserve the same benefits as what we're seeing in the European Union.\" And so that's why in my remarks, I said we think it's the first brick. I think there's more to come. And just so you have an order of magnitude in your mind, we probably get 5 or 6x the savings if the Apple changes as currently proposed were to be implemented in the rest of the world because while we have a relatively small percentage of our revenue in the European Union that comes from iOS. We've got a lot in the U.K. We've got a lot in North America. \r\nAnd so there's really significant benefits in those jurisdictions if these policy changes are made. So that's where the significant benefits to us really would be, either further changes to the policies or expansions of the geographies. And I think both of those things are very, very possible. The impact of further change on Google is not nearly as dramatic as the Apple side. I think that's where we could see really meaningful steps forward. And we're excited to see kind of where this goes because we've been waiting for this for a long time, and this is the first tangible movement that we've seen from the regulators. \r\nAnd as I mentioned in my remarks, that's on top of some of the other things that have happened from a court perspective, which look like they're going to open up the ability to use other app stores, which again is very significant for us or other processors for payments as well, which again is very significant for us. So there's a lot of moving pieces to this. What we can quantify today is the $20 million based on the changes that have been made, but I think you have to think a little bit more broadly about what's more likely to happen here over the next little while.\n\nOperator\n\nThe next question comes from Brad Erickson with RBC.\n\nBradley D. Erickson\n\nYes. One of the questions we've been getting from investors a lot lately is just given the impact you've seen on these pricing optimizations on Tinder, just curious if you'd ever consider any sort of like alternative path there on pricing in 2024, maybe rolling things back, et cetera, as a way to get payers back on earlier? \r\nAnd then maybe just to clarify as well, you talked about the RPP growth to Tinder, I think, looking out to the second half of the year. And it sounds like maybe AI could be having something to do with that. But then yes, you were pretty clear that like AI is not really in the forecast. Maybe if you could just reconcile that a bit.\n\nGary Swidler\n\nYes. Look, I think that we look at all of these different levers all the time. But as we've talked about many times, we're focused on increasing revenue, not specifically increasing revenue per payer or payers just for the sake of moving either of those KPIs. \r\nAnd so we remain focused with our north star on revenue. But as we prioritize things, we have the ability to focus a little bit more on payers and potentially make some more impact there because there's always choices to be made on the product road map. So we're mindful of the fact that everyone is very focused on what's going to happen with payers. We have enough in the road map to achieve the payer pivot in the third quarter as we described earlier and to get to payer growth in the fourth quarter. \r\nSo naturally, you would expect that over the course of the year, as the benefits of all the pricing optimizations and when these subscribers start to subside, we'll get to a better balance by the fourth quarter in terms of payer growth and RPP growth to equate to the revenue growth that we're expecting in the fourth quarter. So we will start to see this kind of normalize and become more balanced over the course of the year as things wash through. We're not going to go to sort of abnormal efforts to drive payers because I don't think that's healthy for the business. \r\nBut we are, obviously, cognizant of the various concerns around this. And I do think you will naturally see it become much more balanced as the year goes on. \r\nAll right. I want to thank everybody for joining us this morning. I think we're right at time. We appreciate it, as always. And we look forward to seeing everyone again next quarter. Thank you so much.\n\nOperator\n\nThe conference has now concluded.

        "title": "Powell's rate comments, tech giants to report - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell tempers expectations that the central bank will soon begin to slash interest rates, as he seeks further evidence that inflation in the U.S. is continuing to cool. The Fed also holds borrowing costs at 23-year highs after its latest policy meeting, but ditches prior language flagging the potential of additional hikes. U.S. stocks slip after the gathering, while investors gear up for a fresh batch of earnings from tech giants, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\n1. Fed's Powell tempers hopes for imminent rate cuts\n\nFederal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has poured yet another bucket of cold water on recent hopes that the central bank would soon start to cut interest rates.\n\nIn a press conference on Wednesday, Powell noted that a reduction as soon as March were not his \"base case\" despite growing signs of cooling inflation. Instead, Powell and other Fed officials said they want to gain \"greater confidence\" that price growth is indeed easing before they consider slashing borrowing costs.\n\nThe official statement from the Fed also said risks from full employment and low inflation were \"moving into better balance,\" while any mention of \"additional policy firming\" was removed completely. The language was translated by many to mean that the world's most influential central bank had finally called time on an aggressive tightening cycle that bumped rates up to more than two-decade highs.\n\nHowever, analysts at ING flagged that the Fed recognizes its credibility was damaged after it asserted that \"inflation is transitory\" in 2021 only to reverse course with significant rate increases over the next two years. \"The last thing the Fed wants to do is get it wrong again at a key turning point, loosen too soon, too quickly and reignite inflation pressures,\" the ING analysts said.\n\nMarkets have subsequently dialed down prior bets for an early spring cut of 25 basis points, with the CME Group's closely-monitored Fed Watch Tool now showing a 35% possibility of such a scenario. In late December, when traders were buoyed by surprisingly dovish Fed commentary following its previous meeting, that chance stood at 73%.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Futures edge higher post Fed decision\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed into the green on Thursday, as traders digested Powell's comments and looked ahead to a slate of megacap earnings (see below).\n\nBy 05:03 ET (10:03 GMT), the Dow futures contract had inched up by 47 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had gained 16 points or 0.3%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 95 points or 0.6%.\n\nThe main averages ended the prior session lower, as sentiment was dented by the diminishing expectations for a March interest rate cut and Powell's cautious statements. The benchmark S&P 500 shed 1.6% and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite dipped by 2.2%, while the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average fell by 0.8%.\n\nWeighing on equities was a slide in shares in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Both of the rival tech giants warned of rising costs needed to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, offsetting what were otherwise solid quarterly returns.\n\n3. Tech giants to report\n\nMega-cap tech stocks Amazon, Apple and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms all set to unveil their latest quarterly figures after the closing bell on Thursday.\n\nThe health of Amazon's AWS cloud computing division will likely be in focus, while analysts will be keeping an eye on Apple's iPhone sales and the advertising revenue Meta has generated with its Reels short-form video offering. The AI arms race could also be a major focus for analysts, as they attempt to gauge how much each firm expects to spend on developing the nascent technology.\n\nAlong with Microsoft and Alphabet, these companies make up five of the so-called Magnificent Seven stocks which have largely driven a rally in equity markets this year.\n\nElsewhere, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) reported a fiscal second-quarter profit that topped Wall Street estimates, although investors were concerned that the San Diego-based AI chipmaker is losing crucial market share in China. Shares were lower in premarket U.S. trading after they seesawed in after-hours dealmaking.\n\n4. Musk says Tesla to hold investor vote on Texas incorporation\n\nElon Musk has said that Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) will hold a shareholder vote on shifting its corporate registration to the U.S. state of Texas, after a judge in Delaware invalidated his massive $56 billion compensation package.\n\nJudge Kathaleen McCormick voided the pay package on Tuesday, arguing that it was an \"unfathomable sum\" that was ultimately unfair to investors and negotiated by a directors of board who appeared to be overawed by a \"Superstar CEO.\"\n\nMusk wrote on his X social media platform shortly after the ruling: \"Never incorporate your company in [...] Delaware.\" He later held a poll on X asking users if Tesla should incorporate in Texas, and more than 87% of over 1.1 million respondents were in favor of the shift.\n\nCiting the poll, Musk said on X that the electric carmaking giant Tesla will \"move immediately\" to put the decision to investors. Tesla already has a significant interest in Texas: the company switched its corporate headquarters from California to the southern U.S. state in 2021.\n\n5. Crude higher with OPEC+ meeting in focus\n\nCrude prices inched up on Thursday, as traders awaited the latest meeting of the OPEC+ oil group.\n\nBy 05:04 ET, U.S. crude futures traded 0.8% higher at $76.44 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed by 0.7% to $81.12 per barrel.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, is set to hold a meeting of the Joint Ministerial Monitoring Committee later in the day -- its first major gathering of 2024.\n\nThe meeting is not expected to result in any changes to production, particularly after the difficulties the group had in agreeing output cuts late in 2023.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nPowell's rate comments, tech giants to report - what's moving markets\n\nBank of England says rates 'under review' as inflation to dip below 2%\n\nAmer Sports set to return to public markets after discounted US IPO",

Valued at $188.04, AAPL faced strong YoY valuation growth in 2023, with the stock increasing 48%.\n\nThe technology industry is one already established in modern consumerism, with annual revenue expectations of 1.4 trillion in 2024. Projected to increase to $1.8 trillion in 2028, the industry has been labeled with a 6.75% CAGR for that duration. Apple, granted the largest tech-related market cap, holds a value of $2.99 trillion globally.\n\nIn 2023, the company reported a similar year to 2022, though it outcompeted key income metrics. Starting with revenue, Apple brought in a total of $383.3 billion, a slight decline from the year prior’s $394.3 billion. Despite the slight decline in performance, Apple consistently outperformed industry forecasts in revenue. Looking to net income in Q3 ‘23, Apple brought in $22.96 billion, or a 10.79% YoY growth. With additional net profit margins increasing, AAPL reported an overall positive financial performance.\n\nExpect AAPL revenue to take a boost in the upcoming quarter as a result of the all-new Apple Vision Pro, a spacial computing headset using virtual reality as a computer. Reaching a virtually untapped market, Apple has innovated a product with no industry competitors at the moment. Along with Apple integration and computing power, the tech company has developed a device that creates its own market. As AAPL shapes the market for this device, expect revenue to increase through the new source of income, as well as taking partial sales from the expansive virtual reality industry.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services is looking to take on Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence chips with a new offer to AI researchers.\n\nThe cloud computing unit of Amazon said on Tuesday that researchers who want to use its custom AI chip, Trainium, can get credits worth $110 million to use its cloud data centers as part of its Build on Trainium program.\n\nThe company’s Trainium chip is used for training AI models, and is an in-house competitor to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Amazon is making up to 40,000 first-generation Trainium chips available for program, which is focused on university-led research in generative AI, and counts researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nGadi Hutt, business development lead for AI chips at AWS, told Reuters that the company is taking a different strategy from Nvidia to get developers to use its chips, and is planning to publish Trainium’s instruction set architecture so customers can program the chip directly, instead of with software, which is what Nvidia’s chips need.\n\nBut despite preparations to roll out the next-generation of its in-house AI chips, Amazon “is going nowhere,” until Nvidia’s CUDA software “is no longer the control point of AI training,” and the cloud giant “iterates much faster,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note.\n\nAmazon will likely launch its in-house AI inferencing chip, Inferentia, at its re:Invent conference later this year, Windsor said, but he doubts “it will make much difference” to Nvidia’s dominance.\n\n“We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,” Dave Brown, vice president of compute and networking services at AWS, told the Financial Times. “But at the same time we think it’s healthy to have an alternative.”\n\nWindsor said Brown’s statement “is indicative of Nvidia’s market power, and all of its biggest customers are trying to reduce their dependence on it for training and inference and so far, they are having very little success.”\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is discussing another multi-billion dollar investment in AI startup, Anthropic, The Information reported. Amazon is reportedly asking Anthropic, which develops AI models rivaling those of OpenAI, to use servers powered by its in-house custom chips.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Walmart and Target are playing into Amazon's hands",
        "content": "Trips to retailers such as Target (TGT) and Walmart (WMT) have become a hassle, with everyday essentials locked up. Rising frustration over the practice is sending shoppers straight to Amazon (AMZN).\n\nNearly one in four shoppers abandon their purchases when they can’t easily access the products they need, according to a study from market research firm Numerator.\n\nFor years, stores have relied on glass-encased displays to prevent theft, particularly in high-demand categories like cosmetics, pharmaceuticals, and tech. This practice, known in the industry as “shrink,” aims to protect inventory.\n\nWhile the strategy might safeguard products, it’s also fueling customer frustration. As shoppers become more accustomed to the seamless experience of buying items online, locked shelves have started to feel like a major obstacle. That frustration is playing directly into Amazon’s hands. According to GlobalData, a data analytics and consulting firm, nearly $340 million in sales are lost due to locked-up items, while Amazon has seen nearly a $200 million jump in sales, as shoppers flock to its online platform.\n\nDuring Amazon’s earnings call on Oct. 31, executives said they planned to focus on lower-priced categories including groceries and personal care products, which it said were “resonating with customers.” In July, Amazon’s Prime Day event saw strong sales for essential items, such as protein shakes and trash bags.\n\nAmazon has long capitalized on the demand for convenience, and that trend isn’t limited to big-box retailers. Pharmacy giants Walgreens (WBA) and CVS (CVS) have also taken to locking up items, including medications.\n\nDuring October’s earnings call, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy pointed out the shortcomings of traditional pharmacies, which account for over 90% of prescriptions in the U.S., for their “forlorn physical venues,” where much of the inventory is “behind locked shelves.”\n\n“We think customers deserve better,” Jassy said, emphasizing that customers shouldn’t have to wait in line to get their medications only to find out about pricing at the register.\n\nWalgreens, in response to allegedly rising theft and operational challenges, recently said it would close 1,200 stores. The move could further exacerbate accessibility for customers, ultimately leaving them with fewer options.\n\nFor brick-and-mortar stores, the message is clear: If retailers don’t find ways to balance security and please customers, they risk losing business to competitors that offer an easier shopping experience. Whether retailers can rethink their security strategies and keep customers coming back remains to be seen.\n\nTarget, for example, has shown little interest in changing its security policies. In September, CEO Brian Cornell confirmed that items like deodorants and undergarments would remain behind glass cases for the foreseeable future.\n\nAmazon may not be locking up items in this way (at least for now), but it still faces stiff competition from Walmart, which has rapidly expanded it’s e-commerce business and recently hinted at the possibility that loyalty members would be able to unlock items with their smartphones. Walmart’s also pushing into pharmacy delivery, and like Amazon, it hopes to win big on convenience and speed.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) is making a big bet on low-cost essentials – and it’s apparently paying off.\n\nThe e-commerce giant says it’s upping its focus on everyday items in categories such as health, beauty, and groceries, while also accelerating delivery speeds to keep up with increasing consumer demand.\n\n“We’re continuing to lower prices and ship even more quickly,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said during the company’s earnings call on Oct. 31. “We can see this resonating with customers, as our unit growth continues to be strong and outpace even our revenue growth.”\n\nShoppers seem to be flocking to Amazon for essentials, driving a surge in sales that’s growing 50% faster than other product categories, according to Amazon’s CFO Brian Olsavsky.\n\nThese low-cost staples are a significant sales driver, Olsavsky explained. “When customers purchase these types of items from us, they build bigger baskets, shop more frequently, and spend more on Amazon.”\n\nHowever, Olsavsky also highlighted a key challenge: “It’s much harder to lower prices while still being able to make a profit.” Offering discounted items is easy in theory, but the real challenge is figuring out how to supply them in a way that makes economic sense for the business.\n\nAmazon’s recent Prime Day and Deals Days highlight the demand for discounts. With billions upon billions in sales, it’s clear that consumers are hunting for discounts that stretch their dollars further.\n\nStill, Prime membership growth has slowed. This helps explain why Amazon is sweetening the deal with some additional perks, such as unlimited grocery delivery for Whole Foods Market, Amazon Fresh, and local grocery partners at just $9.99 per month. Plus, Amazon claims it is on track to deliver its fastest speeds ever for Prime members worldwide. In September, it launchedSavor, a budget grocery line aimed at attracting price-conscious shoppers.\n\nAs consumers continue to be cautious about their spending, Amazon’s focus on cheaper items could keep it ahead of competitors like Target (TGT), Walmart (WMT), and discount grocer Aldi, all of which are racing to lower prices in response to changing shopping habits.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Donald Trump’s election victory sent the stock market skyrocketing, with key indexes surging on Wednesday. As a result, some of the wealthiest people on Earth found themselves billions of dollars richer.\n\nElon Musk, as usual, was the leader in this.\n\nThe world’s wealthiest person saw his net worth gain $26.5 billion by market close on Wednesday after Tesla stock rose almost 15%. Musk controls close to 13% of Tesla’s (TSLA) outstanding shares, although he may be able to buy more stock — at a serious discount — if his compensation plan is approved by the courts. So far this year, Musk has added $61.3 billion to his net worth, reaching $290 billion in total, according to Bloomberg’s Billionaire Index.\n\nHis close relationship with the president-elect is helping fuel the gains, with Musk planning to advocate for a national approach to regulating driverless vehicles. He’s eyeing some kind of government role, although it’s unclear whether he would take an official position.\n\nRead more: What Donald Trump’s election win means for stocks, the economy, and trade\n\nAmazon (AMZN) and Blue Origin founder Jeff Bezos and Oracle’s (ORCL) Larry Ellison, the second and fourth wealthiest people, respectively, also saw gains Wednesday. Bezos, who still owns 9% of Amazon stock, added $7.14 billion to his net worth, while Ellison — a Trump and Musk ally — added almost $10 billion to his own net worth.\n\nOther major beneficiaries among the top 10 wealthiest people alive include Microsoft (MSFT) founder Bill Gates, former Google (GOOGL) CEO Larry Page, Berkshire Hathaway’s (BRK.A) Warren Buffett, and former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer. Meta (META) CEO Mark Zuckerberg and LVMH CEO Bernard Arnault were the only losers after Wednesday, with Zuckerberg’s net worth dropping $81 million and Anault’s falling by $2.85 billion.\n\nNvidia’s (NVDA) Jensen Huang’s net worth gained $4.86 billion, adding to his massive wealth increase this year. In total, his net worthhas increased by $83 billion in 2024, making him the 11th wealthiest person alive.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) CEO Andy Jassy tried to reassure unhappy workers that ending remote work is not an attempt at a “backdoor layoff.”\n\nJassy told workers in an all-hands meeting Tuesday not to indulge theories about why Amazon implemented the new policy, which requires them to come into the office five days a week, saying it is the right decision for the health of the company.\n\n“A number of people I’ve seen theorize that the reason we were doing this is a backdoor layoff or we made some sort of deal with the city, or cities, and that’s why we were having people come back and be together more often,” Jassy said Tuesday, according to CNBC. “I can tell you both of those are not true.”\n\nThe new policy, which was announced in September and goes into effect at the start of 2025, was met with immediate backlash from employees. Online and in internal channels, employees sounded off on Jassy, and hundreds begged the company to reverse it.\n\nAmazon had little patience for employee malcontent. Amazon Web Services CEO Matt Garman said of the policy: “If it’s not for you, then that’s okay — you can go and find another company if you want to.”\n\nIn an open letter signed by more than 500 workers, employees disputed his claim that “nine out of ten” staff members are “excited” about the shift to a five-day in-office requirement.\n\n“We were appalled to hear the non-data-driven explanation you gave for Amazon imposing a 5-day in-office mandate,” the open letter stated, urging Amazon to rethink the policy, which they argue misrepresents their actual sentiments.\n\nGarman said the three-day-a-week policy didn’t work because people came on different days. He also claimed that most employees were excited to be working in person.\n\n—Francisco Velasquez contributed to this article.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta, testifies before the Senate Judiciary Committee on Jan. 31, 2024, in Washington, D.C. - Photo: Alex Wong (Getty Images)\n\nMeta’s (META) plan to join the tech race for nuclear power has reportedly been foiled by bees.\n\nA rare species of bee was found on land where the company was planning to put a nuclear-powered artificial intelligence data center, the Financial Times reported, citing people familiar with the matter. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg reportedly told employees during an all-hands meeting that the rare bees would further complicate a deal with an existing nuclear power plant to build the data center.\n\nAside from the bees, the potential deal would face environmental and regulatory challenges, people told the Financial Times. The tech giant is still looking for carbon-free energy deals to support rising energy demand from its AI development, and Zuckerberg is unhappy with the U.S.’ limited nuclear options, people told the publication.\n\nZuckerberg reportedly told employees that Meta would’ve been the first among its Big Tech peers to have nuclear-powered AI and that it would’ve had the largest nuclear plant for its data centers if the deal had worked out.\n\nMeta did not immediately respond to a request for comment from Quartz.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have all recently signed nuclear power deals as tech companies grapple with AI’s massive energy consumption. In October, Amazon signed three agreements “to support the development of nuclear energy projects,” including building “several” small modular reactors (SMRs). These “advanced” nuclear reactors have “a smaller physical footprint, allowing them to be built closer to the grid,” Amazon said.\n\nGoogle also announced in October that it had signed “the world’s first corporate agreement to purchase nuclear energy” from SMRs developed by California-based Kairos Power.\n\nIn September, Microsoft and Constellation Energy (CEG) — the owner of most of the U.S.’ power plants — announced a 20-year power purchase agreement that would restart the Unit 1 reactor on Three Mile Island.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

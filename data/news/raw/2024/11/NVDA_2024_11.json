        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) Web Services is looking to take on Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in artificial intelligence chips with a new offer to AI researchers.\n\nThe cloud computing unit of Amazon said on Tuesday that researchers who want to use its custom AI chip, Trainium, can get credits worth $110 million to use its cloud data centers as part of its Build on Trainium program.\n\nThe company’s Trainium chip is used for training AI models, and is an in-house competitor to AI chips from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (AMD). Amazon is making up to 40,000 first-generation Trainium chips available for program, which is focused on university-led research in generative AI, and counts researchers from Carnegie Mellon University and the University of California, Berkeley.\n\nGadi Hutt, business development lead for AI chips at AWS, told Reuters that the company is taking a different strategy from Nvidia to get developers to use its chips, and is planning to publish Trainium’s instruction set architecture so customers can program the chip directly, instead of with software, which is what Nvidia’s chips need.\n\nBut despite preparations to roll out the next-generation of its in-house AI chips, Amazon “is going nowhere,” until Nvidia’s CUDA software “is no longer the control point of AI training,” and the cloud giant “iterates much faster,” Richard Windsor, founder of research firm Radio Free Mobile, said in a note.\n\nAmazon will likely launch its in-house AI inferencing chip, Inferentia, at its re:Invent conference later this year, Windsor said, but he doubts “it will make much difference” to Nvidia’s dominance.\n\n“We want to be absolutely the best place to run Nvidia,” Dave Brown, vice president of compute and networking services at AWS, told the Financial Times. “But at the same time we think it’s healthy to have an alternative.”\n\nWindsor said Brown’s statement “is indicative of Nvidia’s market power, and all of its biggest customers are trying to reduce their dependence on it for training and inference and so far, they are having very little success.”\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is discussing another multi-billion dollar investment in AI startup, Anthropic, The Information reported. Amazon is reportedly asking Anthropic, which develops AI models rivaling those of OpenAI, to use servers powered by its in-house custom chips.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Chip stocks dragged down the Nasdaq on Monday despite gains in the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500.\n\nShares of Intel (INTC) were down by around 4.1% during midday trading, while Arm’s (SFTBY) shares were down over 5%. Broadcom’s (AVGO) stock was down by almost 3%, Qualcomm (QCOM) was down by around 2.2%, and Micron (MU) was down by around 3.5%.\n\nNvidia’s (NVDA) shares were down by 1.6%, while Advanced Micro Devices’ (AMD) stock faired slightly better, being down by around 1.3%.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s (TSM) U.S.-listed shares joined other chipmakers in the decline and were down by around 4.2%. The fall follows news that the U.S. has reportedly ordered the company not to send advanced artificial intelligence chips to China anymore.\n\nThe world’s largest chipmaker was told to stop shipping advanced AI chips to Chinese customers starting Monday, Reuters reported, citing an unnamed person familiar with the matter. The U.S. Department of Commerce told the Taiwanese chipmaker in a letter that it is imposing export restrictions on advanced chips made with the 7-nanometer process or smaller, the person said.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 saw green Monday as stocks continued a post-election rally sparked by former President Donald Trump’s victory over Vice President Kamala Harris. Bitcoin also surged on the election victory, reaching a record $84,000.\n\nWith Trump’s return to the White House, the chip war between the U.S. and China could escalate. Under Trump’s first administration, Chinese tech giant Huawei was placed on the U.S. Entity List in 2019 after the government determined it had “been involved in activities contrary to the national security or foreign policy interests of the United States.”\n\nOther Chinese semiconductor firms have been added to the list to restrict U.S. companies from sending equipment for advanced chip manufacturing.\n\nTSMC has also reportedly told its Chinese customers it is no longer manufacturing AI chips with the advanced 7-nanometer process or beyond starting Monday, the Financial Times reported, citing unnamed people familiar with the matter. The chipmaker reportedly made the decision to cut off Chinese firms to improve internal controls and in anticipation of updated U.S. export controls on chips sold to China by the outgoing Biden administration. TSMC is also reportedly worried about being targeted by the incoming Trump administration, which has accused Taiwan of stealing chip manufacturing from the U.S.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) shares plummeted more than 24% on Wednesday after the AI hardware company released a disappointing preliminary first-quarter report and failed to confirm a timeline for its actual first-quarter results. The San Jose-based company, which missed the deadline for filing its annual report, is also facing a potential Nasdaq delisting.\n\nThe company reported unaudited quarterly results on Tuesday after the market closed, leading to the sharp sell-off. This development follows the recent resignation of its auditor, Ernst & Young, which departed last week, citing disagreements over Super Micro Computer’s governance practices and board independence.\n\nOn Wednesday, the stock was trading near $21, marking a fresh 52-week low. Compared to its March peak of $123, the price has plunged over 82%, erasing over $55 billion in value.\n\nFor the quarter ending September 30, Super Micro reported net sales between $5.9 billion and $6 billion, falling short of analyst expectations, which had forecasted $6.45 billion. The company’s forecast for the December quarter also fell short of expectations, and it projected revenue between $5.5 billion and $6.1 billion, which was below the consensus estimate of analysts of $6.86 billion. Additionally, Super Micro expects adjusted earnings per share (EPS) to range from 56 cents to 65 cents, while analysts had anticipated EPS of 83 cents.\n\nSuper Micro is looking for a new auditor\n\nOn Tuesday, the company made no mention of Ernst & Young’s departure or any ongoing corporate governance concerns. However, CEO Charles Liang did confirm that Super Micro is actively working to hire a new auditor. It’s important to note that the company has not reported audited financial results since May.\n\nMoreover, the company is facing potential delisting from the Nasdaq. After receiving a non-compliance letter in September, Super Micro has until November 16 to submit a plan to Nasdaq to regain compliance, or it could face delisting for the second time in five years.\n\nSuper Micro has close ties to Nvidia\n\nThe company makes hardware that supports AI applications, thrived this year due to the high demand for AI, and entered the Fortune 500 at No. 498. As a key partner and reseller of Nvidia’s (NVDA) GPUs and other components, Super Micro integrates its technology into its servers to support AI workloads.\n\nSuper Micro CEO Charles Liang and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang are both Taiwanese immigrants and have a long-standing relationship. CEO Liang said on Tuesday that the company is working closely with Nvidia and that the demand is strong.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

Microsoft (MSFT) and Apple (AAPL) shares rose minimally by around 1% and 0.2%, respectively.\n\nMeta (META) was the only Big Tech company to see its shares fall; they dropped around 1.3%.\n\nChipmaker Nvidia’s (NVDA) shares were up 2.7% on Wednesday, boosting its market cap to $3.53 trillion to keep its spot as the most valuable public company in the world. Apple is just behind at $3.41 trillion.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company’s U.S.-listed shares were down around 3% on Wednesday. The chipmaker counts U.S.-based Nvidia and Apple as its major customers. But during an appearance on “The Joe Rogan Experience” podcast before the election, Trump accused Taiwan of stealing the U.S. chip industry. The president-elect also said he would impose tariffs on Taiwan’s chips and called the Biden administration’s U.S. Chips and Science Act “so bad.”\n\nIntel (INTC), which is expecting the largest Chips Act package so far (almost $20 billion in funding and loans), saw its shares rise over 4% on Wednesday.\n\nMeanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed more than 1,300 points at the market open, while the S&P 500 index rose 1.9%, and Nasdaq futures were up 1.8%. Before Trump was declared the winner, Bitcoin reached an all-time high above $75,000 on Tuesday night.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "On the eve of Election Day, the Dow Jones slid 150 points as investors held back, anxiously awaiting the results. The subdued stock activity coincided with a rally in safe-haven U.S. Treasurys, indicating that some investors are shifting toward lower-risk assets in anticipation of potential market volatility.\n\nBy mid-morning, the Dow Jones Industrial Average had dipped by 153 points, or 0.3%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq showed slight gains of 0.08% and 0.2%, respectively. The cautious trading reflects broader market sentiment, with investors balancing optimism against uncertainty ahead of the election outcome.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) is set to release its earnings report after the closing bell. Known for its advanced AI tools used by military and intelligence agencies, Palantir has become a prominent player amid the tech world’s ongoing AI surge. Moreover, this Thursday, investors will closely monitor the Federal Open Market Committee’s interest rate decision, as well as the subsequent press conference featuring Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nNvidia is about to replace Intel in the Dow\n\nNvidia (NVDA) shares rose over 1% in Monday morning trading as the AI chipmaker is set to join the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which comprises the 30 leading U.S. stocks. This inclusion marks a significant milestone for Nvidia and reflects its growing influence in the tech and AI sectors.\n\nTo make room for Nvidia, longtime Dow member Intel (INTC) will be removed from the index, signaling a shift in focus toward AI-driven growth. In response to the news, Intel shares fell by 4%. The reshuffling is set to take effect at the end of the week.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway is down after selling Apple stock\n\nWarren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion.\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period.\n\n— Rocio Fabbro contributed to this article.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

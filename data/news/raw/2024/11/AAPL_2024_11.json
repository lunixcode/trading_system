        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is back on top as the world’s most valuable public company ahead of the U.S. presidential election.\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares rose around 2.4% on Tuesday, pushing its market cap to $3.42 trillion and past Apple’s (AAPL) market cap of $3.37 trillion. The iPhone maker’s shares were up by around 0.4%.\n\nApple was able to defend the top spot at the market close on Monday after Nvidia briefly took over earlier in the day. In late October, Nvidia briefly overtook Apple after a record-setting stock rally, but ended the day below the tech giant. Nvidia will take over Intel’s spot in the Dow Jones Industrial Average at the end of the week.\n\nNvidia passed both Apple and Microsoft (MSFT) for the first time in June to become the most valuable public company in the world. Earlier in the month, the chipmaker reached the $3 trillion threshold for the first time. It became the first semiconductor company to reach a $2 trillion valuation after it reported record fourth-quarter earnings in February.\n\nNvidia’s South Korea-based chipmaking partner SK Hynix saw its shares surge on Monday after it said the U.S.-based chipmaker asked it to move supply of its next-generation, high-bandwidth memory chips up by six months.\n\nThe U.S. presidential election could have implications for Nvidia and other chipmakers which have come under tightening U.S. restrictions on selling to China under both the Trump and Biden administrations.\n\nIn October, the head of Dutch chipmaking equipment company ASML (ASML) said he expects more pressure on U.S. allies to curb chip sales to China.\n\n“If you look at the geopolitical landscape, I think it’s clear that the U.S. will continue to apply pressure on their allies for more restrictions,” Christophe Fouquet, chief executive of ASML, said. “The question is, what is right for the Netherlands? What is right for Europe?”\n\nThe U.S. finalized restrictions on investments in sensitive technologies in China by U.S. individuals and companies late last month. The rules cover three categories of technology: semiconductors, quantum computing, and artificial intelligence. Some investments are banned, while others require notice to the U.S. government.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Labor board accuses Apple of suppressing employee discussions",
        "content": "Apple has been accused by the National Labor Relations Board of trying to prevent employees from discussing pay equity and pressuring an engineer who attempted to circulate an online survey about wages to quit.\n\nIn a complaint issued last week by the NLRB's regional office in Oakland, federal labor regulators alleged Apple has unlawfully blocked discussion among workers in corporate offices by enforcing overly broad confidentiality rules and restricting their activity on the Slack messaging app and social media, as well as hampering their conversations with journalists.\n\nThe complaint alleges the company in 2021 barred employees from creating a Slack channel called #community-pay-equity and prohibited workers from discussing the financial incentives Apple uses to reach sales goals by claiming the topic included \"confidential and proprietary information.\"\n\nApple has publicly denied the allegations. \"We strongly disagree with these claims,\" a company spokesperson told Reuters. Apple did not immediately respond to a request for comment from The Times.\n\nAccording to the complaint, Cher Scarlett, an engineer at Apple, faced reprisals after she participated in Slack discussions about workplace discrimination, helped found a campaign called \"Apple Too\" modeled after the #MeToo movement that was meant to encourage employees to share their experiences with racism and sexism, and created an online employee survey about pay equity.\n\nInstead of addressing her requests that the company clarify its rules regarding pay discussions, NLRB investigators found Apple told an attorney representing Scarlett at the time that she needed to stop making social media posts, while also pressing her to go on medical leave and offering her a severance agreement. These actions by the company, the complaint said, unlawfully forced Scarlett to quit.\n\nApple managers allegedly threatened other employees who posted on social media and in Slack and spoke to the press about workplace concerns, according to the complaint. Some were interrogated about their involvement with Scarlett's pay equity survey and were told their activities were being monitored, and that they could be demoted, according to the complaint.\n\nIssuing the complaint represents the NLRB's first step in litigating the case after investigating an unfair labor practice claim submitted by employees and finding merit to the allegations. If a settlement with Apple is not reached, the case will be reviewed by an administrative law judge at a hearing scheduled for next June. The judge’s decision on what, if anything, Apple must do to address the issues raised in the complaint could then be appealed to the labor board in Washington and from there it could be appealed to federal court.\n\nThe NLRB's general counsel is asking for a court order that would require Apple to post notices in offices and electronically in Slack and email explaining the rights of employees, as well as to conduct training for managers, supervisors and employees. The NLRB is also looking to force Apple to reinstate Scarlett, compensate her for lost pay and issue an apology letter.\n\nThe complaint is the third in recent weeks to hit Apple.\n\nOn Sep. 27, the board's regional office in Los Angeles issued a complaint accusing Apple of requiring employees across the U.S. to sign overly broad confidentiality and non-compete agreements and adhere to sweeping policies on misconduct and social media that violated employees' ability to exercise their rights under federal labor law. The complaint stems from charges filed in 2021 by Ashley Gjovik, a former senior engineering manager at the company, who claimed that an email sent by Apple Chief Executive Tim Cook, in which he pledged to punish employees who leaked company information, had a chilling effect on workers' discussions of pay equity and discrimination.\n\nAnd on Oct. 9, the NLRB's office in Oakland issued another complaint alleging the company had maintained unlawful work rules and created an impression of surveillance, unfairly enforced policies and wrongly terminated an employee for their involvement in an open letter criticizing a technology entrepreneur Apple had hired. The complaint arose from claims made by Janneke Parrish, a former Texas-based product manager on Apple Maps and a leader of a #MeToo activist movement within Apple, who was fired in 2021.\n\nThe complaints by federal regulators highlight ongoing turmoil around organizing efforts by Apple employees both at the iPhone maker's corporate headquarters and at retail stores. In recent years the board has also lodged complaints that Apple interrogated its retail workers in New York about their union support and confiscated pro-labor fliers in a store break room, and similarly interrogated employees in an Atlanta store and told staff that they would be in a less advantageous position if they voted for a union.\n\nThe company has denied wrongdoing.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway is selling Apple stock and sitting on more cash than ever",
        "content": "Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A) has continued to sell off considerable stakes in several companies as it grows its cash pile to a record $325.2 billion.\n\nIn the third quarter, Berkshire sold $36.1 billion of stock overall, including from major holdings Apple (AAPL) and Bank of America (BAC), the company disclosed in regulatory filings Saturday. Meanwhile, it purchased just $1.5 billion of stock in that same period.\n\nBerkshire also added $48.3 billion to its cash hoard in the quarter, including by freezing stock buybacks — meaning it didn’t repurchase any shares of its own company.\n\n“Berkshire is a microcosm of the broader economy,” Cathy Seifert, an analyst at CFRA Research, told Reuters. “Its hoarding cash suggests a ‘risk off’ mindset, and investors may worry what it means for the economy and markets.”\n\nOther business leaders are already beginning to take Buffett’s focus on cash as a sign of caution. When CEO Jamie Dimon was asked about JPMorgan Chase’s (JPM) capital deployment plans on a call with analysts following the bank’s third-quarter earnings report last month, he pointed to the so-called “Oracle of Omaha” as an example — particularly during a “treacherous” geopolitical landscape.\n\n“Cash is a very valuable asset sometimes in a turbulent world,” he said. “And you see my friend Warren Buffett stockpiling cash right now. I mean, people should be a little more thoughtful about how we’re trying to navigate in this world and grow for the long term for our company.”\n\nIn the three months ending on Sept. 30, the sprawling, Omaha-based conglomerate shed roughly a quarter of its remaining stake in Apple to $69.9 billion — the fourth consecutive quarter of cuts to its holdings of the iPhone maker. That’s down by almost two-thirds from the $174.3 billion it owned at the start of the year and comes after Berkshire halved its Apple stake in the second quarter.\n\nDuring a question-and-answer session with Buffett at Berkshire’s annual shareholder conference in May, the 94-year-old investor said it’s “extremely likely” Apple remains Berkshire’s largest common stock holding — and that will stay that way unless something dramatic happens.\n\nLast quarter, Berkshire also dumped about $10 billion of its Bank of America holdings in a series of sales starting in mid-July. Bank of America CEO Brian Moynihan said at an event in September that while Buffett has been a “great” investor in the company, Moynihan doesn’t know why Buffett is offloading its long-term investment in the bank.\n\nApple’s shares are up 20% year-to-date, performing in line with the S&P 500. Bank of America stock is up 23% so far this year.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Each week, Quartz rounds up product launches, updates, and funding news from artificial intelligence-focused startups and companies.\n\nHere’s what’s going on this week in the ever-evolving AI industry.\n\nInfineon’s ‘world’s thinnest’ silicon power wafer Infineon’s “world’s thinnest” silicon power wafer - Photo: Infineon Technologies AG\n\nSemiconductor company Infineon (IFNNY) unveiled its new silicon power wafer this week that it says is the “world’s thinnest.” The new silicon wafers, which were developed for AI data centers, can reduce power loss by more than 15%, the company said, including for high-end AI server applications.\n\nThe silicon wafers have a thickness of 20 micrometers and a diameter of 300 millimeters — or a quarter of the thickness of human hair, Infineon said. The silicon wafers are also half as thick as current advanced wafers.\n\n“The new ultra-thin wafer technology drives our ambition to power different AI server configurations from grid to core in the most energy efficient way,” Adam White, who oversees power and sensor systems at Infineon, said in a statement. “As energy demand for AI data centers is rising significantly, energy efficiency gains more and more importance. For Infineon, this is a fast-growing business opportunity. With mid-double-digit growth rates, we expect our AI business to reach one billion euros within the next two years.”\n\nConversica’s AI agents Conversica’s AI agent - Image: Conversica\n\nConversational AI company Conversica announced updates to its AI agents this week that it says will help enterprise revenue teams increase revenue conversions.

Now, we’ll have the ability to reach an even wider audience and make an even bigger impact on the lives of creative people around the world.”\n\nThe agreement is subject to regulatory approval, Pixelmator said, adding that no material changes will be made to its Pixelmator Pro, Pixelmator for iOS, and Photomator apps for now.\n\nAI startup Sierra’s $175 million raise OpenAI chairperson Bret Taylor at the Vivatech show in Paris, France on June 15, 2022. - Photo: Thibault Camus (AP)\n\nConversational AI platform, Sierra, raised $175 million in its latest funding round this week, valuing it at $4.5 billion. The startup was co-founded by OpenAI chairperson and former Salesforce (CRM) co-CEO Bret Taylor.\n\nThe funding was led by Greenoaks Capital, and included ICONIQ and Thrive Capital as investors.\n\n“We think every company in the world, whether it’s a technology company or a 150-year-old company like ADT (ADT), can benefit from AI,” Taylor told CNBC. “We want to enable Sierra to address that market, and that means expanding internationally and to other industries.”\n\nEvogene and Google Cloud’s small molecule foundation model Evogene’s ChemPass dashboard - Image: Evogene\n\nEvogene (EVGN), a computational biology company that uses big data and AI for life science-based product discovery and development, announced a partnership this week with Google Cloud to develop a generative AI foundation model for small molecule design.\n\nThe collaboration will help Evogene’s ChemPass AI computational technology platform that “directs and accelerates the discovery and development of novel products based on small molecules.” The company will use Google Cloud’s Vertex AI, Google Compute Engine GPUs, and storage to create the foundation model.\n\nFor the latest news, Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.\n\nView comments",

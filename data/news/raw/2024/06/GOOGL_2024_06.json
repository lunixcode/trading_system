        "title": "June jobs report ushers in new quarter during holiday-shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "content": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.

BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The tech bull market sparked by innovations in generative AI in 2023 continued in the first half of 2024. Even when focusing on tech broadly rather than the industry's strongest performers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index yielded a total return of nearly 19%.\n\nKnowing that, investors may wonder which stocks could lead the way in the second half of the year. While the market offers no guarantees, the last two quarters of the year could be the time when some stocks begin to rise in earnest. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors deliver insights on stocks they believe investors should watch for the remainder of the year.\n\nAlphabet is positioned to leverage its search-market dominance into AI riches\n\nJake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. What I really like about Alphabet is that the company combines two of the most critical features of any outstanding stock: potential, best represented by its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and results, as seen in its consistent financial performance.\n\nLet's examine its potential first. Regarding AI, the sky is the limit for Alphabet. The company's latest AI-powered personal assistant, Google Assistant, offers many features to help people accomplish more. Through voice commands alone, users can:\n\nSet timers, create lists, and save locations and passwords. Call, text, and read emails aloud. Gather local information, such as weather, traffic, and directions. Answer general questions, such as \"how many grams in an ounce\" or \"what is 18% of $57.\" Find and play music, movies, or podcasts.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet can capitalize on its massive user base. As the most-visited website in the world, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day -- about one for every person on the planet. As such, Alphabet has a significant opportunity to make Google Assistant the preferred AI assistant. This could lead to substantial benefits for Alphabet in the future as it explores ways to monetize Google Assistant through a subscription model where users pay a monthly fee for premium features or an advertising model where companies pay to have their products or services recommended by the assistant.\n\nIn the meantime, Alphabet can rely on its already established businesses, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android, to keep \"bringing home the bacon.\" These businesses show consistent growth and profitability, adding to Alphabet's overall stability and investment potential.\n\nTo sum up, Alphabet could be the AI stock to watch in the back half of 2024 -- and beyond. Investors seeking a stock with an unbeatable combination of potential and results would be wise to consider it.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta stock isn't done riding the AI wave\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): Social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been on a rocket-like trajectory. Shares have risen 45% since January and are up an astonishing 326% since January 2023 when artificial intelligence began picking up steam. In just 18 months, Meta stock created the magnitude of wealth the broader market generally takes decades to achieve. I understand if people feel skeptical that Meta has more in the tank.\n\nYet, the fundamentals indicate that Meta could ride its current momentum through the latter half of this year. That's driven primarily by strong operating performance and a stock valuation that's still borderline cheap. Meta's core business is advertising to its billions of social media users. Meta impressively still gains users even though so many people already use its apps. Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew to 3.24 billion daily active users in the first quarter, a 7% year-over-year jump.\n\nDigital advertising continues to take market share away from older media formats like television and print, so Meta is also enjoying tailwinds there. Meta's ad volume was up 20% year over year in Q1. Lastly, Meta has started using AI to help companies advertise more efficiently, which helped increase Meta's price per ad by 6% in Q1. In other words, Meta benefits from multiple variables boosting its primary business.\n\nInvestors will need to see how Meta continues to perform in future quarters. Analysts are very optimistic; 2024 earnings-per-share estimates of $20.16 would represent 35.5% growth over 2023. Meanwhile, analysts believe Meta will grow earnings by an average of over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Given that healthy growth outlook, Meta stock remains arguably cheap at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.\n\nMeta is a world-class business that experienced severe adversity in 2022. The comeback has created eye-popping returns. While Meta's meteoric rise means there's probably far less upside than before, investors shouldn't jump ship too soon. There is still plenty of wind in its sails.\n\nIn the AI chip space, a rising tide could lift AMD\n\nWill Healy(Advanced Micro Devices): Given Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space, potential competitors are easy to dismiss at first glance.\n\nHowever, according to Allied Market Research, the AI chip industry is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. With Nvidia apparently struggling to meet current demand, it leaves an opening for competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nEven though Nvidia leads in the innovation battle, AMD has a history of catching up to and sometimes surpassing its competitors. Moreover, while a Nvidia AI chip costs around $30,000 to $40,000, AMD's $10,000 to $15,000 semiconductors will likely appeal to customers who are anxious to snap up any AI chips they can find.\n\nMore recently, investors largely overlooked AMD as its revenue of $5.5 billion in Q1 2024 grew by only 2% yearly. However, data-center revenue of $2.3 billion rose 80% over the same period. Moreover, it made up 42% of the company's overall revenue, a level comparable to Nvidia's percentage of data-center revenue at the end of fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) of 39%.\n\nFast forward to fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended April 28), and 87% of Nvidia's revenue came from its data center segment. With AMD's aforementioned 80% data-center growth, Nvidia's recent history shows how AMD could follow in its footsteps as AI chips become its dominant source of revenue.\n\nAlso, thanks mostly to AI chips, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% yearly in that quarter. Although AMD may or may not match that number over time, Nvidia's recent history describes what could happen to AMD's revenue growth as its AI chip sales accelerate.\n\nAdditionally, AMD holds a significant valuation advantage if looking beyond its misleading P/E ratio of 232. The company currently trades at a price-to-book value ratio of around 4.5. In comparison, Nvidia sells at 63 times its book value. This differential makes AMD stock a relative bargain, giving the stock room to run as the sale of AI chips becomes a more critical revenue stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "If I Could Buy Only 3 Stocks in 2024, I Would Pick These",
        "content": "Investors can own as many stocks as they want whenever they want, and thankfully so. After all, more stocks mean more diversification. In this vein, The Motley Fool suggests holding at least 25 different stocks at any given time.\n\nSometimes, though, it's eye-opening to think about which stocks you would buy if you could only buy a small number of them. Such an exercise forces you to identify the market's most promising risk-versus-reward scenarios.\n\nWith that as the backdrop, here's a rundown of the three names I would buy this year if I only had room and money to add another three tickers to my portfolio. (These picks, of course, only make sense for you if they improve your portfolio's diversification rather than making it less balanced.)\n\n1. MercadoLibre\n\nMercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) is often referred to as the Amazon of Latin America. It's not an unfair comparison, but it is an incomplete one.\n\nMercadoLibre is also akin to eBay, Shopify, and PayPal. Its wide lineup of tools has helped the company become South America's premier name in brick-and-mortar and e-commerce technology. The company facilitated nearly $41 billion in payments in the first quarter of this year while also serving as the middleman for $11.4 billion worth of sales of goods and services. Its subsequent revenue of $4.3 billion during the quarter was up 36% year over year, driving a 71% improvement in net income.\n\nAnd this is still just the beginning. In many ways, South America is now where North America was roughly 20 years ago, when high-speed internet was still relatively new and smartphones were still only an idea. In the same way that Amazon was in the right place at the right time with the right business model, MercadoLibre is positioned to capitalize on the region's brewing mobile-technology boom.\n\nAnd it is booming. Market researcher GSMA says 75 million people in South America became mobile internet users just within the past five years, while Canalys reports the region's smartphone shipments surged 26% year over year in the first quarter following the fourth quarter's growth of 20%.\n\nEven so, only 65% of the continent's population currently uses a wireless broadband-capable smartphone. The rest are coming around, though. GSMA believes South America's mobile internet penetration rate will grow to 72% by 2030, with most of those connections likely to be ultra-high-speed 5G by that point.\n\nBecause e-commerce grows in step with consumers' growing ability to be online, Americas Market Intelligence is looking for Latin America's e-commerce market to grow 24% this year, then by another 21% next year, and then match that pace again in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nMercadoLibre is arguably better positioned than any other name to capitalize on this growth.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nFew investors would deny that Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is still a force to be reckoned with. But plenty of people also seem to presume its highest-growth glory days are in the past. The search engine industry is fully matured, after all, and crowded with credible competition like Microsoft's artificial intelligence powered Bing.\n\nIf you don't think Alphabet has any growth engines left to rev, however, think again. Its cloud computing venture is an example. While still only a fraction of the size of Amazon's and Microsoft's cloud businesses, this segment still produced revenue growth of 28% during the first quarter of the year.\n\nBetter yet, Google Cloud is now consistently and meaningfully profitable, generating $900 million worth of operating profits in the three-month stretch ending in March. Mordor Intelligence expects the worldwide cloud computing market will grow at an annualized pace of more than 16% through 2029, so Alphabet's cloud segment holds tremendous profit promise.\n\nRatings agency Nielsen says the company's YouTube service is more watched within the United States than conventional streaming services like Netflix or Walt Disney's Hulu and Disney+. YouTube's top line improved 21% year over year in first quarter, as Alphabet continues to figure out how to make it a destination platform within the highly fragmented and often-unprofitable streaming space.\n\nGoogle Search's advertising business might not be as stagnant as some suspect, too. Its ad revenue grew more than 14% during the first quarter of the year, helped by the search engine's sustained reach. GlobalStats says Google still handles about 90% of the world's web searches, as it has for well over a decade.\n\nSo Alphabet looks as strong as it's ever been. The fact that shares are rallying despite plenty of well-voiced worries should tell you everything you need to know about what investors see for its foreseeable future.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nI would round out my limited number of stock picks for 2024 with a new position in Bank of America(NYSE: BAC).\n\nIt's not an easy name to get exciting about owning right now. The stock has underperformed since early 2022, dragged down by the economic malaise caused by sky-high inflation. Although high interest rates generally widen banks' profit margins, the subsequent trade-offs of that dynamic are diminished demand for loans as well as a greater number of loan defaults and delinquencies.\n\nBofA's provision for loan losses grew to $1.3 billion in the first quarter, while net interest income slipped 3% to $14 billion, dragging per-share profits down from $0.94 in the first quarter of last year to $0.83 this time around. Other business lines like corporate banking and investment management are also running into headwinds.\n\nLargely lost in all the noise, however, is that nothing about the banking industry's current challenges is new. This is a highly (and predictably) cyclical business tethered to an equally predictably cyclical economy.\n\nWe do not know exactly when inflation will finally abate or when the global economy will perk up again. We do know, however, we want to be positioned in BofA before it becomes clear that this recovery is happening. Like most stocks, this one tends to move predictively rather than reactively.\n\nIn the meantime, you're plugging into a ticker that's paying a healthy, reliable dividend. Although you can certainly find stocks with a bigger dividend yield than Bank of America's current forward-looking yield of a little more than 2.4%, this big bank is protecting its business and balance sheet in a way that ensures it will be able to continue funding its dividend payout as well as raise it.\n\nIts annualized dividend payment of $0.96 per share is less than one-third of this year's expected per-share earnings of $3.25, and even relatively less than next year's estimate of $3.59. That's a nice cushion for anyone seeking dependable investment income.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $21,765!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,798!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $363,957!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 24, 2024\n\nBank of America is an advertising partner of The Ascent, a Motley Fool company.

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Stifel initiates on Tesla; downgrade for Alphabet",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.\n\nAffirm Holdings\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Goldman Sachs launched coverage with a new analyst on Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) at Buy with a $42 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Goldman regards AFRM as a frontrunner in the provision of contemporary credit solutions for consumers, boasting a varied array of products tailored for point-of-sale financing and daily expenditures. The analysts are particularly taken with the sophistication of AFRM’s underwriting processes compared to its fintech counterparts, as well as the company’s consistent delivery of well-managed credit results, even amidst rapid growth that outpaces its peers. This success is attributed to AFRM’s approach to short-duration receivables and transaction-level underwriting, which enables the company to individually assess and underwrite various types of consumer spending. These include everyday purchases (“Pay now” via Debit), cash flow management or short-term financing (such as Pay-in-4), and more extended installment financing options (spanning 6-12 months or more), all facilitated through a single card-based product, the Affirm Debit+ card.\n\nIn contrast to traditional card issuers who have historically provided a single revolving credit line to cover these needs, AFRM’s method incurs significantly lower costs for the consumer and reduces credit risk for the lender by avoiding large open-to-buy balances. Goldman believes that AFRM’s precise underwriting grants it a competitive edge, enabling the firm to delve deeper into the credit spectrum and make inroads into the subprime/near-prime market segment—a challenging area for many established players to engage in sustainably. The analysts anticipate that this precision in underwriting will bolster AFRM’s position in the market and facilitate its continued growth and success.\n\nBuy at Goldman means “Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.\"\n\nHow did the stock react? Affirm Holdings opened the regular session at $31.02 and closed at $33.70, a gain of 12.82% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nPenn Entertainment\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Raymond James downgraded PENN Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:PENN) to Market Perform and removed their $20 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s the full story? The recommendation change follows a 21% increase in the company’s share price since May 20, which was influenced by activist pressure and merger and acquisition rumors. Initially, when coverage began, Raymond James posited that the stock’s potential was limited to approximately $20/share. This ceiling was attributed to ongoing discounts related to the interactive segment and the “penalty box” status, which were expected to continue until a clearer route to profitability in the interactive space was established or a significant strategic shift occurred.\n\nHowever, the path to profitability in the digital realm for PENN remains ambiguous, and no substantial changes in strategy, such as a complete sale of the company, appear imminent. Consequently, Raymond James advises investors to capitalize on the recent gains and seek more favorable risk-adjusted investment opportunities within the sector. The brokerage highlights Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) as its preferred choice, suggesting that it offers a more attractive investment profile compared to PENN under the current market conditions.\n\nRaymond James’ assessment reflects a cautious stance on PENN’s short-term prospects, emphasizing the need for clarity in its digital strategy and profitability outlook.\n\nMarket Perform at Raymond James means “The security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P 500 over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Penn Entertainment opened the regular session at $18.85 and closed at $18.26, a gain of 5.58% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nTesla\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, (well Tuesday after hours) Stifel initiated coverage on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) at Buy with a $265 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Stifel believes that TSLA is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2025-27+. In the near term, the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of its next-generation vehicle (Model 2) production, which will likely garner very strong demand. The Stifel analysts also believe TSLA’s AI-based Full Self-Driving initiative has the potential to generate significant value through sales of FSD, possible licensing agreements, and as a critical driver of longer-term RoboTaxi initiatives.\n\nNoteworthy near-term risks include delivery levels following lackluster 1Q24 results, as well as near-term EV adoption headwinds and the U.S. election. Stifel is initiating coverage with a Buy and a $265 target price.\n\nBuy at Stifel means “We expect a total return of greater than 10% over the next 12 months with total return equal to the percentage price change plus dividend yield.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Tesla opened the regular session at $186.69 and closed at $196.37, a gain of 4.81% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nQiagen\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Wolfe Research upgraded Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN) to Outperform with a $50 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wolfe Research has expressed increased confidence in QGEN’s prospects following the company’s compelling Corporate Management Day (CMD) presentation on June 17th. The brokerage is optimistic about QGEN’s ability to surpass its competitors in the upcoming year, as management has presented a credible strategy to achieve over 7% organic growth and an Operating Margin exceeding 31% between 2024 and 2028.\n\nThe current portfolio is particularly appealing due to its high percentage of recurring revenue, approximately 85%, alongside several medium-term growth catalysts and strong market positions. Additionally, Wolfe Research anticipates that QGEN’s latent-TB segment will remain unchallenged by new competitors in the near term, and they trust in the company’s disciplined execution, as demonstrated by initiatives like NeuMoDx.\n\nDespite these positive indicators, QGEN’s stock is currently trading at less than 20x the next twelve months’ P/E ratio, which is more than a 5x discount compared to its peers. This valuation leads Wolfe Research to believe that the shares are undervalued, presenting an attractive investment opportunity with limited downside risk. In light of this assessment, the brokerage has decided to revise its estimates for 2025 and beyond, reflecting a stronger belief in QGEN’s trajectory towards enhanced growth and profitability.\n\nWolfe Research’s analysis suggests that QGEN is well-positioned for future success, and its current stock price offers a favorable entry point for investors.\n\nOutperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Qiagen opened the regular session at $41.02 and closed at $41.10, a gain of 1.02% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) to Neutral with a $181 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet's to Neutral citing several areas of transitional risk that warrant cautionary observation. Key concerns include the potential impact of AI on search functionality, particularly the introduction of AI Overviews, which may temporarily disrupt search ad revenues. Additionally, there are indications of emerging competition from Bing, potentially leading to a loss of search market share. Moreover, the shift of search ad revenue towards retail media networks, influenced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others entering this space, is expected to accelerate, posing further uncertainties.\n\nAnother significant factor is Amazon's aggressive foray into video advertising, including the integration of ads on Prime Video and a robust upfront sales strategy, which could alter the dynamics of ad sales, particularly affecting Alphabet's YouTube platform. The research team also highlights the possibility of heightened capital expenditure (capex) for AI, driven by competitive pressures within the industry.\n\nIn light of these transitional risks, Rosenblatt suggests a cautious stance on Alphabet until clearer outcomes emerge from these developments. Monitoring how Alphabet navigates these challenges will be crucial in reassessing its investment outlook going forward.\n\nNeutral at Rosenblatt means “We believe that this stock’s performance will be in line with the average return of others in its industry over the following 12 months.“\n\nHow did the stock react? Alphabet opened the regular session at $184.17 and closed at $182.15, a decline of 1.76% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Stifel initiates on Tesla; downgrade for Alphabet\n\nRising trade policy uncertainty poses a downside risk to growth: Goldman Sachs\n\nExclusive-US prosecutors meeting with Boeing, crash victims as criminal charging decision looms, sources say\n\nView comments",

Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\n\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\n\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\n\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey’s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024. We picked the cloud computing stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 222\n\nGlobal tech giant Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) offers a wide range of products and platforms across various regions, including the United States, Europe, and Asia-Pacific. The company operates through three main segments one of which is Google Cloud. This segment caters to businesses, offering infrastructure, cybersecurity solutions, databases, analytics tools, and artificial intelligence (AI) services. It also includes Google Workspace, a suite of cloud-based communication and collaboration tools.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 2024, exceeding expectations.  Revenue reached $80.54 billion, reflecting a significant 15% year-over-year increase. Profitability also showed marked improvement. Net income rose significantly to $23.66 billion compared to $15.05 billion in Q1 2023. Earnings per share followed the positive trend, reaching $1.89, up from $1.17 in the previous year.\n\nAnalysts are positive on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), assigning a \"Strong Buy\" rating based on 38 recommendations in the past 3 months. The average 12-month price target for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock sits at $198.92, suggesting a potential upside of 8.29% from the current price levels.\n\nHere’s what Weitz Investment Management said about Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Mega-cap titans Meta Platforms, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon generated outsized gains and were the Fund’s top relative contributors for the past 12 months. Following our valuation discipline, we continued to methodically rotate from more fully priced stocks to those trading at healthier discounts to our value estimates. We trimmed more tech-adjacent winners during the quarter, including Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been the most notable trim over the past two quarters. In effect, we removed the heavy overweight layer of the position size, which had been in the 6% to 8% range for most of the last five years. Part of the decision simply reflected valuation prudence after an exceptional period where the stock price ran well ahead of our estimate of business value growth. Some of it was a reality check that Google’s core search business may be less clearly unassailable than it appeared to be five to seven years ago. Our team also has adopted a healthy “prove it” approach to management/culture, capital allocation and future returns on a robust investment cycle. While Alphabet may no longer warrant standout overweight status, the stock remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.”\n\nOverall GOOG ranks 3rd on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now to see the other cloud computing stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology, and many businesses are rushing to capture a piece of this rapidly expanding market. Research outfit Statista forecasts that the AI industry will grow from $136 billion in 2023 to $827 billion by 2030.\n\nAt this early stage of the AI revolution, it can be challenging to identify which companies will be able to successfully capitalize on the opportunities in it over the long run. But among the plethora of businesses battling for dominance in the space, three stand out as compelling AI stocks to buy and hold for years as that market grows: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon may be best known for its e-commerce business, but its use of AI is key to its ongoing success. For instance, the e-commerce giant created an AI tool to make it easy for third-party sellers to list their products on Amazon. They simply enter the URL of the appropriate page on their website into the tool, and AI automatically extracts the products to repost on Amazon's site.\n\nHelping third-party sellers is important since Amazon generates a substantial portion of its revenue from them. In Q1, the various fees Amazon collected from these sellers amounted to $34.6 billion of its $143.3 billion in revenue.\n\nThe firm is also leaning on AI as it develops new technologies. For example, Amazon used AI to develop a system that can accurately identify people based on the vein structures of their palms, so customers can now get their hands scanned and then use their palms to pay when shopping at its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods stores. Another example is its Alexa virtual assistant, which relies on AI to understand human speech and execute tasks.\n\nThe company's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides other businesses with the technology to build and run AI models. Customers are increasingly making use of these AI capabilities, which helped AWS achieve 17% year-over-year sales growth to $25 billion in the first quarter.\n\nAmazon's successes in harnessing AI have already allowed it to achieve a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate from AI, which suggests that these technologies could propel its business forward for years to come.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has aggressively pursued AI for years. Indeed, as CEO Sundar Pichai has said, \"We reoriented the company around AI.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence is part of the company's strategy to fend off competition and maintain its dominance in areas such as digital advertising, where it holds about 40% of the market compared to Amazon's 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet is using AI to improve its products and assist other businesses with creating AI models. For instance, AI has been injected into Google Search, Google Docs, and Google Cloud to improve these products and provide new capabilities, such as helping people to write emails.\n\nBut what truly makes Alphabet an attractive AI investment are the company's efforts to create amazing new technologies to solve society's greatest challenges. One example is its use of AI in its efforts to build the technology needed to harness nuclear fusion. Solving this problem would provide humanity with a nearly limitless clean energy source.\n\nAlphabet is capable of funding this type of research because it generates tremendous amounts of revenue and free cash flow. In Q1, its sales rose 15% year over year to $80.5 billion, and it produced $16.8 billion in free cash flow.\n\nThanks to its massive free cash flow, Alphabet can easily afford a dividend, and it finally rewarded investors with its first one ever in Q1 -- a $0.20 per share distribution. Dividends add to the return on your investments, and can provide passive income sources as well.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nAs a company focused on data analytics, Palantir is in a strong position to make the most of AI. That's because AI requires lots of data to successfully make decisions.\n\nBut harnessing AI isn't just about having a massive trove of data. AI requires that data to be organized and accurate. How can an organization do that?\n\nPalantir's solution is its Foundry Ontology system, which organizes and structures a customer's data by mapping properties and relationships across the data.\n\nAs CEO Alex Karp explained Palantir's approach and competitive advantage: \"We are differentiated because in order to actually make AI work, you need an ontology.\"\n\nPalantir's early efforts were focused on helping the U.S. government in its counterterrorism investigations. From that foundation, it has expanded into commercial markets, and last year, it launched the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nAIP has been a success, as illustrated by the U.S. Army choosing Palantir to assist in building its first AI-powered military vehicle.\n\nAIP helped drive the company's revenue up by 17% in 2023 to $2.2 billion. And in Q1 2024, sales rose 21% year over year to $634.3 million.\n\nPalantir's Q1 performance suggests its revenue growth rate is accelerating. As a result, management raised its full-year guidance and forecast that Q2 revenue would reach at least $649 million, up from the prior year's $533 million.\n\nWith cutting-edge tech in their possession and track records of success, Palantir, Amazon, and Alphabet look like good stocks to buy and hold for investors who want to benefit from the AI industry's coming years of growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks You Can Buy and Hold for the Next Decade",
        "content": "Investing in artificial intelligence (AI) seems to have become more challenging over the last few months. More than one year after generative AI stoked excitement for tech investors, specific stocks such as Nvidia, Super Micro, and CrowdStrike seem to have drawn most of the interest and have risen to nosebleed valuations.\n\nFortunately for investors who feel they missed out on these stocks, AI will likely be more than a flash in the pan. Thus, one can buy and hold specific AI stocks for the next decade with a reasonable expectation of earning significant returns. These three stocks should deliver for investors.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nAt first glance, investors might assume they've missed out on Palantir Technologies (NYSE: PLTR). The stock is up fourfold since its low in late 2022. Also, the recent revenue growth is unlikely to impress growth investors.\n\nNonetheless, investors may have yet to fully realize the game-changing potential of its generative AI product: the Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP). AIP builds on the analysis capabilities of its older Gotham and Foundry platforms. While those platforms also relied on AI, the productivity gains reported by AIP users have yielded eye-popping results.\n\nAfter attending AIP boot camps, companies seem to find multiple use cases. One prospective customer accomplished more in a day through AIP than a hyperscaler (like Amazon Web Services) might have achieved in four months, while another claimed to build 10 times faster with three times fewer resources. Such results seem to quickly lead to new seven-figure deals for Palantir.\n\nAs mentioned, results may take time. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue of $634 million rose 21%, which appears modest when comparing growth to its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 24.\n\nStill, its net income of $106 million is up more than sixfold from year-ago levels. If revenue growth starts to reflect the productivity gains and increased deal volumes driven by AIP, the stock price growth should accelerate significantly over the next few years.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nIn addition to up-and-coming AI companies, investors may also want to look at one of the pioneers in this field: Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet began using the technology in 2001 and became an AI-first company in 2016, employing the technology in all subsequent product releases.\n\nHowever, the rise of ChatGPT left investors with the impression that Alphabet had fallen behind its peers. For the first time in decades, Google's dominant search engine faced a credible competitive threat.\n\nStory continues\n\nNonetheless, before writing off Alphabet, investors should remember that it has released its own generative AI tool in the form of Google Gemini. Moreover, Google Cloud, which is the third-largest cloud company, ensures it will play a critical role in deploying this technology for clients. Cloud Infrastructure Market Share, By Company, Q1 2024\n\nFurthermore, Alphabet combined its research teams in April 2023 to form Google DeepMind. With $108 billion in liquidity backing its efforts, Alphabet is unlikely to stay behind in this field.\n\nFinally, at a price-to-earnings ratio of 28, it is cheaper than its mega-tech competitors. Between its breadth of experience in AI and its tremendous resource base, the Google parent will likely remain a force in the AI industry for a long time to come.\n\n3. VanEck Semiconductor ETF\n\nInvestors who prefer not to risk precious capital on the fortunes of a particular company may simply want to invest in most of the top chip stocks through the VanEck Semiconductor ETF(NASDAQ: SMH). Most of the companies within the exchange-traded fund (ETF) either design or manufacture AI-ready chips. Without this technology, AI would not have been possible.\n\nThis ETF invests around 20% of its assets in Nvidia, with an additional 13% in the leading chip manufacturer Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing. The rest of its holdings make up less than 10% of the fund each, though Broadcom, Advanced Micro Devices, and Micron are among the 26 stocks held.\n\nMoreover, it reported returns of 28% per year over the last 10 years. In comparison, the benchmark SPDR S&P 500 reported an average yearly return of 13% over the same period -- less than half the return of the VanEck ETF.\n\nFurthermore, VanEck's ETF expense ratio is 0.35%, slightly below the average expense ratio, which is 0.37%, according to Morningstar. Thus, the fund has delivered these outsized returns at an affordable price.\n\nIndeed, the fund does not guarantee it can match the 28% average annual return over the last 10 years. However, if one wants outsized returns with lower risk and without the work involved in finding such stocks, they will likely find both in the VanEck Semiconductor ETF.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "European Union's competition boss signals fresh AI scrutiny for Microsoft-OpenAI deal and Google",
        "content": "LONDON (AP) — The European Union is escalating its scrutiny of the artificial intelligence industry, including taking a fresh look into Microsoft's multibillion-dollar partnership with OpenAI, a top EU official said Friday.\n\nThe European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, started reviewing the deal last year to see whether it broke EU merger rules but dropped it after concluding Microsoft hadn't gained control of OpenAI, Margrethe Vestager, the commission’s executive vice-president for competition policy, said in a speech.\n\n“Microsoft has invested $13 billion in OpenAI over the years,” she said “But we have to make sure that partnerships like this do not become a disguise for one partner getting a controlling influence over the other.”\n\nShe signalled that the commission would take another tack to examine the deal, and the industry more broadly. It's using the bloc's antitrust rules, which target abusive behavior by companies that have a dominant market position.\n\nThe commission sent information requests in March to big AI players including Microsoft, Google, Facebook and TikTok, reviewed those replies and is “now sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI,” Vestager said.\n\nThe EU wants “to understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,” she said.\n\nA Microsoft spokesman said, “We appreciate the European Commission’s thorough review and its conclusion that Microsoft’s investment and partnership with OpenAI does not give Microsoft control over the company. We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have.”\n\nOpenAI didn’t respond immediately to a request for comment.\n\nThe stepped-up scrutiny highlights how European Union regulators have been pacesetters for the global push to rein in big tech companies, including the major AI players. The EU's led the field with its AI Act, which is set to take effect soon and is the world’s first comprehensive set of regulations for AI.\n\nVestager said the bloc was also concerned about consumer choices for foundation models, which is the technology that underpins generative AI systems like chatbots.\n\nShe said EU regulators have sent information requests “to better understand the effects of Google’s arrangement with Samsung\" to pre-install Gemini Nano on some devices from the South Korean tech company. Gemini Nano is the smallest version of Google's Gemini AI foundation model.\n\n\"And we have a number of other preliminary antitrust investigations ongoing into various practices in AI-related markets,\" she added.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe commission is also examining so-called “acqui-hires,” where a company buys another one mainly for its talent, such as Microsoft's hiring of Inflection AI's founder Mustafa Suleyman, and other top staff.\n\n“We will make sure these practices don’t slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,” she said.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is continuously making strong efforts to bolster its presence in India. This is evident from its latest fresh capital infusion of Rs 600 crore (about $72 million) into Amazon Pay India.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, the e-commerce giant strives to strengthen its digital payment app business in India. The digital payment market is booming due to the ongoing digitization and increasing adoption of cashless transactions.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report from Statista, the Indian digital payment market is anticipated to generate a total transaction value worth $254.6 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to reach $394.4 billion by 2028, seeing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.\r\n\r\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the aforementioned growth prospects on the heels of its increasing investment in its digital payment app.\r\n\r\nThe latest move brings its total investment in Amazon Pay to Rs 950 crore so far this year in India. The company made an investment of Rs 350 crore in February in its payments platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Amazon Pay is gaining popularity in the country on the back of the services that it provides, which include bill payments, unified payments interface (UPI) payments, wealth management, ticket booking and insurance premium payments.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Amazon Pay’s tie-ups with platforms like Bookmyshow, Makemytrip, Redbus, IRCTC, and Kuvera are positives.\r\n\r\nAs of May 31, Amazon Pay India had 67.5 million prepaid wallets and processed 623 million transactions worth over Rs 211 crore during the month.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nStrong Investments Aid Competitive Edge\n\nThe Indian digital payment space is highly competitive in nature, given the rapidly increasing number of UPI transactions, which is giving a significant boost to it.\r\n\r\nWith growing Amazon Pay investments, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ups its game against peers like Paytm, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Pay, Walmart WMT owned Flipkart’s PhonePe and Meta Platform’s META WhatsApp Pay.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAlphabet and Walmart are making concerted efforts to strengthen their presence in the booming digital payment market of India.\r\n\r\nRecently, Alphabet’s Google signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Payments Corporation of India to expand the use of Google Pay to other countries. This will allow Indian travelers to make payments in other countries via Google Pay.\r\n\r\nPhonePe is enjoying solid customer momentum on the heels of its digital wallet service, which allows users to make instant money transfers with UPI. In addition to PhonePe, Walmart’s Flipkart unveiled a UPI app called Super.Money, which offers up to 5% real cashback on transactions, pre-approved credit and fixed deposit accounts. Super.Money is currently in the beta stage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Meta is gaining steam with WhatsApp Pay, which is powered by BHIM UPI and processed by payment partners in India. The app allows users to make payments on the app using UPI apps, debit cards, credit cards and net banking.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon is well-poised to benefit from its expansion spree in India in the near term, as well as in the long haul. Its strengthening competitive position in the digital payment space of the country is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the company’s growing investments to bolster its e-commerce business in India are major positives. Last year, it announced a $15-billion investment in the country over the next seven years. Amazon strives to strengthen its infrastructure in the country with this. Moreover, its pledge to build digital centers in 100 cities and villages in India to help more than 10 million small and medium businesses come online remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s growing prospects in the booming India market are expected to aid its overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, reflecting growth of 11% from that reported in 2023.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) -Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI could face an EU antitrust investigation as regulators singled out their exclusivity clauses while Google's artificial intelligence deal with Samsung also triggered scrutiny.\n\nEU antitrust regulators will seek additional third-party views, EU competition chief Margrethe Vestager said on Friday.\n\nThe moves underscore the unease among regulators worldwide on Big Tech leveraging its dominance into the new technology, echoing the companies' market power in other sectors.\n\nVestager in March sent questionnaires to Microsoft, Google, Meta's Facebook and ByteDance's TikTok as well as other big tech companies related to their AI partnerships.\n\n\"We have reviewed the replies, and are now sending a follow-up request for information on the agreement between Microsoft and OpenAI. To understand whether certain exclusivity clauses could have a negative effect on competitors,\" she told a conference.\n\nReuters was first to report that EU regulators were building a case that could lead to an investigation into the partnership between the two companies.\n\n\"We stand ready to respond to any additional questions the European Commission may have,\" a Microsoft spokesperson said.\n\nMicrosoft's partnership with OpenAI will not be subject to EU merger rules because of the absence of control, Vestager said.\n\nWhile OpenAI's parent is a nonprofit, Microsoft has invested $13 billion in a for-profit subsidiary, for what would be a 49% stake.\n\nVestager also cited concerns about Big Tech blocking smaller AI developers from reaching users and businesses.\n\n\"We are also sending requests for information to better understand the effects of Google's arrangement with Samsung to pre-install its small model Gemini Nano on certain Samsung devices,\" she said.\n\nGoogle in January reached a multi-year deal with the South Korean company to embed its generative artificial intelligence technology in Samsung's Galaxy S24 series smartphones.\n\nVestager also said she was looking into \"acqui-hires,\" where one company acquires another mainly for its talent, as exemplified in Microsoft's $650-million acquisition of startup Inflection in March that allowed it to use Inflection's models and hire most of its staff.\n\n\"We will make sure these practices don't slip through our merger control rules if they basically lead to a concentration,\" she said.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; editing by Philip Blenkinsop and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s search and ad businesses are industry leaders. Similarly, the company’s role in the generative AI boom is gaining momentum. All in all, this positions it for success now and in the future, which makes Big Money investors happy.\n\nThe business metrics are pleasing too. GOOGL’s first-quarter revenue jumped 15% year-over-year to $81 billion on the back of ad and cloud business increases. It also sports a 40% operating margin for its Google Services business and owns a 91% share of the global search market.\n\nIt’s no wonder GOOGL shares are up 11% this year – and they could rise more. MAPsignals data shows how Big Money investors are betting heavily on the forward picture of the stock.\n\nBig Money Buying Alphabet Shares\n\nInstitutional volumes reveal plenty. In the last year, GOOGL has enjoyed strong investor demand, which we believe to be institutional support.\n\nEach green bar signals unusually large volumes in GOOGL shares. They reflect our proprietary inflow signal, pushing the stock higher: Source: www.mapsignals.com\n\nPlenty of technology names are under accumulation right now. But there’s a powerful fundamental story happening with Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet Fundamental Analysis\n\nInstitutional support and a healthy fundamental backdrop make this company worth investigating. As you can see, GOOGL has had strong sales and earnings growth:\n\n3-year sales growth rate (+19.9%) 3-year EPS growth rate (+33.5%)\n\nSource: FactSet\n\nAlso, EPS is estimated to ramp higher this year by +13.4%.\n\nNow it makes sense why the stock has been powering to new heights. GOOGL has a track record of strong financial performance.\n\nMarrying great fundamentals with our proprietary software has found some big winning stocks over the long term.\n\nAlphabet has been a top-rated stock at MAPsignals. That means the stock has unusual buy pressure and growing fundamentals. We have a ranking process that showcases stocks like this on a weekly basis.\n\nIt’s made the rare Top 20 report multiple times in the last year.

        "content": "Nike and Alphabet downgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nSeaport Research upgraded International Paper(IP) to Buy from Neutral with a $52 price target. The selloff after Suzano dropped its takeover pursuit provides a \"reasonable entry point\" into International Paper, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Guggenheim upgraded Guardant Health(GH) to Buy from Neutral with a $36 price target. Based on recent checks and an updated revenue model, the analyst's view has evolved on how Shield will ultimately be used as an every three year test for the colorectal cancer screening non-compliant market. BMO Capital upgraded SAP (SAP) to Outperform from Market Perform with a price target of $237, up from $218. The analyst believe the company has a high degree of visibility into bookings and revenues over the next few years, largely driven by conversion of its \"large and sticky\" installed base to cloud offerings. JPMorgan upgraded Digital Realty Trust(DLR) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $175, up from $150. The analyst sees the company as a substantial beneficiary of cloud and artificial intelligence demand for data center capacity. Citi upgraded Cincinnati Financial(CINF) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $135, up from $126. The analyst says share downside is limited by less workers' comp exposure, higher comp loss picks and material casualty reserving actions already taken.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Nike(NKE) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $79, down from $114. The company reported another disappointing earnings print and reduced outlook, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Stifel also downgraded Nike to Hold from Buy with a price target of $88, down from $117, to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $78, down from $125, at UBS, and to Market Perform from Outperform at Raymond James. Nike was also downgraded at Barclays and JPMorgan.  Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet (GOOGL) to Neutral from Buy with an $181 price target. The analyst sees \"multiple areas of transitional risk\" for Alphabet and recommends \"stepping back for a little while to see how the company handles it.\" William Blair downgraded Travelers(TRV) to Market Perform from Outperform and Chubb (CB) to Underperform from Market Perform, both without price targets. The casualty side of the insurance business is being hit by rising levels of claims and losses, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Argus downgraded Charles River (CRL) to Hold from Buy. The company continues to face headwinds to revenue growth due to cautious spending by the biotech industry, says the analyst. Wells Fargo downgraded Acuity Brands(AYI) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $260, down from $295. The analyst says capital deployment and non residential demand uncertainties are two key overhangs that will make it too difficult to argue for multiple expansion at this juncture.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nJMP Securities initiated coverage of Affirm(AFRM) with a Market Perform rating and no price target. Over the past few years, Affirm's business model has diversified and strengthened, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Baird initiated coverage of Synchrony Financial (SYF) with an Outperform rating and $56 price target. The firm calls Synchrony the number one domestic private label credit card platform, with tenured large retailer partnerships, and an experienced management team. Bernstein initiated coverage of Stellantis(STLA) with a Market Perform rating and $23.50 price target. After a significant re-rating in 2023, Stellantis shares have declined 30% since late March and following the recent capital markets day, the company faces increasing risks to near term results, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Guggenheim assumed coverage of Crispr Therapeutics(CRSP) with a Neutral rating and no price target. The firm says the company's ongoing global commercial launch of Casgevy, cell therapy expansion into autoimmune indication, and foray into cardiovascular via ANGPTL3 and other in vivo targets are the \"three pillars\" that underpin \"the CRSP 2.0 story.\" Scotiabank last night initiated coverage of PagerDuty(PD) with a Sector Perform rating and $23 price target. The company has moved from an incident management tool to help IT operations and developers quicken their mean time to resolution to a broader operations cloud, which has expanded its total addressable market and fostered cross-selling capabilities, the analyst says.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this company have returned +7.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 5.9% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +28.5%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31%. This estimate has changed -0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "MILAN (Reuters) - Italy is asking Google to pay 1 billion euros ($1.07 billion) in unpaid taxes and penalties, three sources with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday, seven years after the U.S. company settled a landmark tax dispute with Rome authorities.\n\n\"We comply with tax regulations in all countries where we operate, including Italy,\" a Google spokesperson said in a statement, in response to a Reuters query about the claim. \"We cooperate with the authorities.\"\n\nThe sources said Italy's Revenue Agency has started an adversarial process with Google which may end either with a settlement or with the opening of a judicial litigation.\n\nThe investigation was launched in December 2022, and the claims cover the years 2018 to 2022, one of the sources said.\n\nJust as in the previous investigation, the probe led by Milan prosecutors alleges that Google did not file and pay taxes on revenues generated in Italy, but this time the basis for the accusation is different, the sources said.\n\nIn 2017, Google paid 306 million euros because it was deemed to have a permanent establishment in Italy on the basis of its personnel operating in the country.\n\nNow the challenge has been mounted on the basis of the digital infrastructure it has in the country which allows it to operate and generate revenue. This is the same approach that was used in a recent Italian tax settlement with Netflix.\n\nTwo of the sources said that if a settlement is reached, the line of investigation will then be applied to all the multinational web companies that are been under the scrutiny of Milan prosecutors.\n\n($1 = 0.9342 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Emilio Parodi; Editing by Gavin Jones and Jan Harvey)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Google has added Cantonese to its Google Translate service, as part of its largest-ever expansion that saw 110 new languages being supported, aided by generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) technology.\n\nFrom Thursday, users of the app and browser versions of the Google tool can translate between 243 languages, including Cantonese, a Chinese dialect widely spoken in Hong Kong, Macau, parts of the southern Chinese province of Guangdong, as well as some Chinese migrant communities worldwide.\n\nGoogle Translate can process and generate both text and voice, meaning that users can type or speak in one language, then read or listen to the translation.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"Cantonese has long been one of the most requested languages\" for the service, Isaac Caswell, senior software engineer at Google Translate, wrote in a blog post. \"Because Cantonese often overlaps with Mandarin in writing, it's tricky to find data and train models.\"\n\nCantonese and Mandarin are both written in Chinese characters, but Cantonese has some differences in grammar, terms and structure.\n\nWith the help of the US tech company's PaLM 2 large language model (LLM), launched over a year ago, Google Translate can learn languages that are closely related to each other more efficiently, according to Caswell.\n\nThe rapid advancement of LLMs - the technology behind a new breed of intelligent AI tools such as OpenAI's ChatGPT and Google's Gemini chatbot - has set off a race among Big Tech companies and start-ups to roll out new service features and improve existing functions.\n\nGoogle on Thursday introduced its Gemma 2 LLM to researchers and developers, the second generation of a family of lightweight, open-source models that the company unveiled in February. Google said Gemma is built from the same research and technology used to create its flagship Gemini models.\n\nAs Microsoft, OpenAI's biggest investor, rushes to bake more advanced capabilities into its Edge web browser, Google on Wednesday brought five new features to its mobile Chrome browser.\n\nThey include short-cuts for local search results, a redesigned address bar, personalised search suggestions, trending search recommendations, and live sports updates.\n\nGoogle Translate now supports Cantonese. Photo: Screenshot alt=Google Translate now supports Cantonese. Photo: Screenshot>\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle Translate is not the first service to support Cantonese.\n\nThe translator tool of Microsoft's Bing search engine can already process Cantonese text and voice. LLMs from OpenAI can also translate Cantonese. SenseTime, one of China's AI pioneers, last month introduced a Cantonese LLM tailored for Hong Kong users, which will be made available for free locally.\n\nHowever, none of those services are as popular as Google among internet users in Hong Kong, where Google.com remained the most visited website as of last month, according to traffic tracker Similarweb.\n\nOther new languages introduced to Google Translate include Punjabi (Shahmukhi), the most spoken language in Pakistan, as well as the Hindi-related languages of Awadhi and Marwadi.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Advanced Micro Devices AMD shares have declined more than 8% in the past month, underperforming the Zacks Electronics-Semiconductors industry’s gain of 5.4% and the broader Zacks Computer & Technology sector's return of 5%. Its closest peer, chip behemoth NVIDIA NVDA, has gained 11% over the same time frame.\r\n\r\nBoth AMD and NVDA have been the darlings of investors, driven by the massive proliferation of artificial intelligence (AI) that has created a strong demand for GPU chips required to power AI models.\r\n\r\nHowever, in the past few weeks, market sentiment has been shifting from AI chip providers given the challenging macroeconomic environment and rising uncertainty over the upcoming Presidential elections. These factors have been an overhang on the share prices of chip providers.\r\n\r\nAMD has been particularly affected, given its much smaller size and GPU market share compared to NVIDIA. Despite having a solid portfolio, growing skepticism over its ability to dethrone NVIDIA, at least in the near term, has been an overhang on its share price movement.\n\nAMD Stock's One Month Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, the dip in AMD’s share price does open up opportunities for risk-tolerant investors. The AI space is expected to remain robust with increased spending by cloud computing providers like Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nAMD’s initiatives to expand its portfolio are making it well-positioned to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\n\nAMD’s Robust Portfolio Aids Long-Term Prospects\n\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap, which includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in the fourth quarter of 2024.\r\n\r\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA “Next” architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\r\n\r\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\r\n\r\nAMD is also benefiting from its strong partner base. At Computex, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition Hurts AMD\n\nNVIDIA’s strategy to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline intensifies competition for AMD. Moreover, initiatives by tech giants like Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms to build their own platforms for AI don’t bode well for AMD.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency.\r\n\r\nMeta Training and Inference Accelerator, which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads, supports new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research.\n\nAMD Stock Not So Cheap\n\nAMD stock is trading at a discount when compared to NVIDIA and at a slight premium to the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry. Its forward 12-month P/E of 36.84X is lower than NVIDIA’s 43X but slightly higher than the industry’s 34.83X.\r\n\r\nHowever, this is not attractive for growth-oriented investors in the near term, given this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s modest growth prospects. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAMD expects second-quarter 2024 revenues to be $5.7 billion (+/-$300 million). At the mid-point of the revenue range, this represents year-over-year growth of approximately 6% and sequential growth of approximately 4%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is pegged at $5.71 billion, indicating 6.54% growth year over year. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at 66 cents per share, down a couple of cents per share over the past 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Reuters) - Artificial Intelligence chatbot startup Character.AI said on Thursday it has launched a calls feature that allows users to have voice conversations with their AI characters, ratcheting up efforts to compete with rivals including OpenAI.\n\nAI-boom has prompted startups to release new features to their chatbots as competitors such as Microsoft-backed OpenAI, Google and Amazon.com-backed Anthropic are looking to gain market share by engaging new users.\n\nThe availability of free two-way voice calls on Character.AI's app has come following OpenAI's announcement on Tuesday that the ChatGPT maker's rollout of the advanced voice mode of its latest model GPT-4o is delayed by one month.\n\nCharacter.AI, co-founded by Noam Shazeer, who helped invent \"transformer\" AI architecture while at Google that underpins systems like Gemini and ChatGPT, enables users to create customized AI companions with specific personalities and values.\n\nThe Menlo Park, California-based startup said the new calls feature prompted more than 20 million calls from over 3 million unique users in its early rollout, suggesting a strong engagement.\n\nCharacter.AI launched Character Voice, a suite of features that allows users to hear characters speaking to them in one-on-one chats, for all users in March.\n\nAlphabet's Google was in talks to invest hundreds of millions of dollars in Character.AI last year, two sources briefed on the matter had told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Vijay Kishore)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Trend Of High Returns At Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Has Us Very Interested",
        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Firstly, we'd want to identify a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and then alongside that, an ever-increasing base of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. So when we looked at the ROCE trend of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) we really liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those that aren't sure what ROCE is, it measures the amount of pre-tax profits a company can generate from the capital employed in its business. To calculate this metric for Alphabet, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$97b ÷ (US$407b - US$77b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Alphabet has an ROCE of 29%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Alphabet compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Alphabet .\n\nWhat The Trend Of ROCE Can Tell Us\n\nThe trends we've noticed at Alphabet are quite reassuring. The numbers show that in the last five years, the returns generated on capital employed have grown considerably to 29%. The company is effectively making more money per dollar of capital used, and it's worth noting that the amount of capital has increased too, by 57%. This can indicate that there's plenty of opportunities to invest capital internally and at ever higher rates, a combination that's common among multi-baggers.\n\nOur Take On Alphabet's ROCE\n\nAll in all, it's terrific to see that Alphabet is reaping the rewards from prior investments and is growing its capital base. And a remarkable 228% total return over the last five years tells us that investors are expecting more good things to come in the future. Therefore, we think it would be worth your time to check if these trends are going to continue.\n\nBefore jumping to any conclusions though, we need to know what value we're getting for the current share price. That's where you can check out our  FREE intrinsic value estimation for GOOGL  that compares the share price and estimated value.\n\nStory continues\n\nHigh returns are a key ingredient to strong performance, so check out our free list ofstocks earning high returns on equity with solid balance sheets.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe major indexes may have only chalked small gains Wednesday, but while the generals were sleeping, the soldiers were on the march.\n\nAt the vanguard, moderate losses in large-cap energy and financials were offset by outsized gains in the consumer discretionary sector — thanks principally to Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThis seesaw theme has become a subtle but important market narrative. On days when AI isn't leading the charge, select pockets of strength keep the S&P 500 from more pronounced sell-offs — which itself is holding index volatility near multiyear lows.\n\nThe recent \"plunge\" in Nvidia is instructive.\n\nOnly Monday, the AI poster child closed down 13% from its record high. Surveying social media, you would think Wall Street was burning.\n\nBut during that harrowing three-day slump, a funny thing happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — up only 3% this year versus 14% for the S&P 500 — staged a comeback. Energy perked up, and biotech jumped as forgotten pockets of the market showed signs of life.\n\nThis seesaw-offsetting behavior is everywhere right now in lieu of correlations between even stocks in similar sectors. Stocks simply do not want to move in the same direction.\n\n\"This is a generationally weird US stock market,\" wrote Luke Kawa, a former director of investment solutions at UBS Asset Management Americas now at Sherwood Media.\n\nKawa was specifically referencing Tuesday's price action, in which the S&P 500 managed a 0.4% gain despite 384 of its components closing in the red — a new feat for a data set that goes back to 1996.\n\nSimilar \"firsts\" have been dotting the market statistics recently.\n\nBut none of this detracts from the argument — supported by ample research and history — that it's perfectly normal in a bull market to have gains concentrated in a few stocks.\n\nWinning stocks that enjoy a secular-themed rally get bigger and bigger until the move runs its course.\n\nIn a bull market, when leading stocks falter, other parts of the market that may not be generating hype-filled headlines can rise to the occasion. Sector rotation keeps volatility at the index level low as new winners offset losers. And then, at some point, the music stops and all sectors start selling off in unison, kicking off a new bear market.\n\nKawa tied this to the current market, writing that \"different major groups within the US stock market have been marching to the beat of their own drummers recently, and this dynamic has helped keep the stock market from lurching violently to the downside.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWe're not only currently seeing disparate returns among sectors and industries, but also inside them — even in the megacap tech stocks. In the past six months, if some of them, say Microsoft and Alphabet, are up, Nvidia and Apple might be down. The correlation between directional moves between pairs in this cohort is a scant 43%, Kawa noted.\n\nAll of this zigging and zagging keeps index-level volatility at bay, but Kawa lays out the major risk in this environment: a \"correlated shock\" that is distributed \"among these companies that control so much of US as well as global equity indices.\"\n\nThough the \"big drop\" remains the focal risk, divergences can persist longer than arbitrage investors can remain solvent (to turn an old Wall Street trope).\n\nIn fact, research by the data analytics team at BofA suggests that the current regime of low inter- and intra-sector correlation can persist for years. Stock correlations within the S&P 500 are at historic lows.\n\n\"Multiple years of decorrelation in the 90s as the internet bubble developed suggests that persistence of today's regime remains a risk,\" wrote BofA.\n\nAccordingly, the outsized bifurcation in returns between the chosen AI few and the rest of the market needn't end with a bang.\n\n\"Just because we’re in uncharted waters doesn’t mean we’re heading for a waterfall. It could end up being a lazy river,\" wrote Kawa. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks I'd Buy Right Now Without Hesitation",
        "content": "There's been a lot of fluctuation in the stock market this year, with tech stocks leading most of the movement. Excitement over budding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) has seen countless stocks skyrocket, with the S&P 500 up 15% year to date.\n\nAs a result, many stocks are currently trading at a premium, with some standouts including Nvidia and Amazon. These companies are leaders in AI and tech in general, with one dominating the chip market and the other a king in cloud computing. However, there are alternative and better-valued ways to invest in both industries that could deliver major gains in the coming years.\n\nSo, here are two no-brainer stocks I'd buy right now without hesitation.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) investors haven't had a lot of luck this year, with the company's stock down 38% since Jan. 1.\n\nThe decline follows a series of challenges for the company, from a personal computer (PC) market downturn to macroeconomic headwinds and trouble keeping up with rising competition. Wall Street has grown increasingly concerned about Intel's ability to turn things around. However, recent restructuring suggests a recovery could finally be underway, and it might be worth investing in before it's too late.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Intel's revenue increased by 9% year over year to $13 billion. The growth is a significant improvement from Q1 2023 when revenue tumbled 36% year over year.\n\nMoreover, Intel is making promising headway in AI. The company's data center and AI segment posted revenue gains of 5% year over year, while operating income rose more than 2,000%. Meanwhile, Intel has unveiled a range of new AI chips this year, including its Gaudi 3 accelerator and Xeon 6 processors.\n\nHowever, its expanding foundry business is what could grant Intel a highly lucrative position in AI. The company is heavily investing in chip manufacturing and building plants across the U.S. as it seeks to retake a dominant role in the industry and become the country's leading AI chip-fabrication company. The move comes just as AI chip demand is soaring, strengthening the company's long-term outlook. INTC PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAdditionally, this chart shows Intel is potentially the best value stock in the AI chip market. Its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) and price-to-sales (P/S) ratios are significantly lower than those of Nvidia and AMD, suggesting Intel's stock is the biggest bargain among the three companies.\n\nAlongside a promising shift in its business, Intel's stock is a no-brainer right now.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) has been somewhat overlooked in the media this year compared to peers such as Amazon and Microsoft. Its third-largest cloud-market share after both companies and some issues with its AI technology have seen critics question Alphabet's future and ability to compete with its rivals.\n\nHowever, the company remains a behemoth in tech and is trading at a bargain compared to its competitors, making its stock a compelling buy right now.\n\nAlphabet posted stellar earnings in Q1 2024. Revenue rose 15% year over year to $81 billion, beating Wall Street estimates by close to $2 billion. The company delivered a 14% increase in digital-ad sales from Google Services. Meanwhile, Google Cloud revenue climbed 28%, outperforming Microsoft's Azure and Amazon Web Services in cloud growth for the quarter.\n\nAlphabet is enjoying solid gains throughout its business. Potent brands like Android, YouTube, and the many products under Google have given the company almost endless advertising opportunities and could now bolster the company's AI products. The wide use of these platforms could be an asset in getting Alphabet's AI technology into the hands of billions of consumers.\n\nAs a result, I wouldn't bet against Alphabet's position in AI over the long term. It might seem behind some of its peers when it comes to the generative technology, but the company has the cash and brand loyalty to go far over the long term. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, data in the table above shows Alphabet's stock is a considerably better value than Amazon or Microsoft shares. The figures are impressive, considering Alphabet has delivered more stock growth than both companies since the start of the year.\n\nAlphabet's lower forward P/E and price-to-free cash flow make it one of the best-valued stocks in tech and a screaming buy this June.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Kevin Mandia is trying to find ways to make life harder for brazen hacking groups.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor Volkswagen Invests $5 Billion in EV Startup Rivian to Form Joint Venture FedEx Stokes Investors With Hint of a Freight Deal Nvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support A $100 Billion Bet on China’s Economy Sours as Warehouses Empty\n\nMandia announced in May that he’d step down as the chief executive at Mandiant, the cybersecurity firm that he founded in 2004, after it was acquired by Google Cloud in 2022. He’s now moving into the venture capital world as a general partner and co-founder of Ballistic Ventures, an investment firm that’s raised $660 million in funding to invest in a range of emerging security startups.\n\nAmid a spate of devastating ransomware attacks, widespread concerns about social media disinformation and increasing innovation from hacking groups, Ballistic is trying to find companies that will help stop that trend toward escalation, Mandia said. Recent hacking campaigns have crippled North American auto dealerships and caused outages at London hospitals, with hackers asking for ransom payments that have reached new highs in the tens of millions.\n\n“The criminal element in cyber has hit almost an intolerable level,” Mandia said in a recent interview with Bloomberg News. “With Ballistic we’re investing in defense and being faster at closing windows of insecurity.”\n\nMandia also stressed the importance of imposing “risk” and “pain” on cybercrime groups, including taking a more aggressive stance toward publicly identifying hackers. Flagging active misinformation campaigns, strengthening authentication as a means of safeguarding digital identities and conducting red-team exercises — where security researcher probe a client’s networks in order to proactively find vulnerabilities — all are means of doing that, he said.\n\n“If we just play defense, we’re just playing goalie,” Mandia said. “We’re always going to be reading headlines about people being taken advantage of.”\n\nEarly Ballistic investments include the risk management company Aembit and identity security firm AuthMind, among a list of other cybersecurity firms listed on its website. Ballistic also worked with Google Ventures, the investment arm of Alphabet Inc., to raise $34 million for the anti-misinformation startup Alethea.\n\nInvestors put over $9.6 billion into information security startups across 693 deals last year, according to PitchBook, even as the value of deals across the industry space gradually decreased from mid-2022 to January of this year. Other cyber-focused firms include Sequoia Capital, which has invested in companies like Chainguard and Okta Inc. Accel also has invested in CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. and the password manager 1Password.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt Ballistic, Mandia said he’ll tap into his Mandiant leadership experience to help founders trying to safeguard the internet.\n\n(Corrects the amount of money raised by Ballistic Ventures in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD’s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China’s Version of Henry Ford Musk’s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash Independence Without Accountability: The Fed’s Great Inflation Fail\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office",
        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has been accused of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products by the European Union (EU) regulators.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary finding, EU officials stated that Microsoft has breached the bloc's competition rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites for businesses.\r\n\r\nThe potential consequences for Microsoft are significant, with the company facing a possible fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenues, a staggering amount of $211.9 billion in revenues reported for fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThe investigation, initiated nearly a year ago, stems from a 2020 complaint by Slack, now owned by Salesforce CRM. Slack alleged that Microsoft's practice of automatically including Teams with its Office software suite gave the communication tool an unfair advantage, stifling competition in the market for remote communication and collaboration tools.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission's preliminary findings suggest that Microsoft's practices may have restricted customer choice and hindered innovation. Specifically, the EU body is concerned that Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically bundling it with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites since at least April 2019. Furthermore, the Commission believes that interoperability limitations between Teams' competitors and Microsoft's offerings may have exacerbated the situation.\r\n\r\nIn response to earlier concerns, Microsoft had already taken steps to unbundle Teams from its productivity suites in Europe and globally. (Read More: Microsoft Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny)\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commission deemed these changes insufficient, stating that \"more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition.\" As the investigation proceeds, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how software suites are packaged and sold in Europe, potentially affecting millions of users and reshaping the competitive landscape in the business productivity software market.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nEU Intensifies Crackdown on Big Tech\n\nThis case highlights the EU's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology companies, with recent actions against Microsoft, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, highlighting the bloc's determination to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have gained 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet’s growth of 22.4%, 28.4% and 8.1%, respectively. These cases underscore the growing tension between the EU's regulatory ambitions and the business practices of dominant platform providers.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Apple finds itself grappling with multiple regulatory challenges in the EU. The company faces its first charges under the bloc's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. This action strikes at the heart of Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem and could have far-reaching implications for its business model.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also facing increased scrutiny from EU regulators. The company is under investigation for potentially non-compliant measures related to the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing. The European Commission has expressed concerns that Google's current practices may not treat third-party services fairly in search results, a core issue in the ongoing debate about the power of dominant search engines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the European Commission has launched a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces, including the company's controversial core technology fee for developers. In response to these regulatory pressures, AAPL has taken the drastic step of announcing the blockage of certain features, including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing, for EU users, citing security concerns related to DMA compliance.\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft, the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences. If found in violation of EU antitrust rules, the company not only faces potential financial penalties but may also be forced to make significant changes to its product strategy and distribution model in Europe.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will need to carefully navigate its product development and marketing strategies to align with evolving regulatory expectations, not just in Europe but potentially worldwide.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL Waymo is leaving no stone unturned to expand its autonomous ride-hailing service — Waymo One — across the United States.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest move of finally making Waymo One available to everyone in San Francisco, CA.\r\n\r\nWaymo has been testing autonomous vehicles in the city since 2021.\n\nIts latest move marks the very first such expansion outside Phoenix, AZ.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nWaymo Expansion Efforts Boost Prospects\n\nPer a Precedence Research report, the global autonomous vehicle market is expected to reach $2.35 trillion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 35% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is well-poised to penetrate the booming autonomous driving space rapidly on the back of its strong efforts toward reaching out to more customers on the back of its robust driverless technology and expansion efforts.\r\n\r\nThe company’s multi-year partnership with Uber Technologies UBER to offer an autonomous driving experience to the latter’s customers in Phoenix, AZ, is a positive. This deal is in sync with the company’s deepening focus in Phoenix.\r\n\r\nGOOGL’s expansion of the operating area of Waymo One in Phoenix, which now includes rides to Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport, is a plus.\r\n\r\nWaymo’s effort to expand its operations to downtown Phoenix is noteworthy. It also rolled out a rider-only service in downtown Phoenix.\r\n\r\nApart from Phoenix, Waymo received regulatory approval to expand in Los Angeles.\r\n\r\nThe company is testing self-driving vehicles on the streets of Austin, TX, which was declared the fourth city for Waymo One last year. Waymo’s electric Jaguar I-PACE vehicles, which are equipped with advanced Waymo Driver technology, are being tested across 43 square miles in Austin, which includes the heart of downtown, Barton Hills, Riverside, East Austin and Hyde Park.\r\n\r\nWaymo is also testing its self-driving vehicles on the streets of Bellevue, WA.\n\nWaymo’s Expansion Gives Competitive Edge\n\nGrowing Waymo’s efforts are boosting Alphabet’s competitive position against its peers like Amazon AMZN and Baidu BIDU, which are making every effort to capitalize on the growth prospects in the autonomous driving space.\n\nAlphabet’s shares have also outperformed that of Amazon and Baidu on a year-to-date basis. GOOGL has gained 31.9% compared with AMZN’s return of 22.7%. BIDU has lost 25.6% in the same time frame.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s buyout of Zoox, a developer of autonomous ride-hailing vehicles, remains a major positive. The company’s launch of its first self-driving robotaxi strengthened its position in the autonomous driving space.\r\n\r\nZoox has been testing its autonomous vehicles in San Francisco, Las Vegas and Foster City. It intends to open an engineering office and operations facility, which will act as a base for its autonomous vehicle testing.\r\n\r\nIt also plans to establish a large-scale manufacturing facility for its autonomous vehicles. The facility will be located at Hayward Exchange @ 92, 25810 Clawiter Rd, which will expand Zoox’s presence in the East Bay.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Baidu is gaining from the strong momentum of the Apollo Go Robotaxi service across China on the back of its increasing availability in several cities and a growing number of rides.\r\n\r\nApollo Go is available in 10 cities, namely Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Chongqing, Changsha, Cangzhou, Yangquan, Wuzhen Water Town and Wuhan.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAlphabet’s growing autonomous driving initiatives, coupled with its dominant position in the search engine market, strong cloud momentum and robust generative AI capabilities, are expected to drive top-line growth in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $291.3 billion, indicating a year-over-year improvement of 13.6%. \r\n\r\nHowever, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company continues to face significant litigation across various regions. Regulatory scrutiny continues to worsen, with the competition commission issuing several statements of objections. Moreover, rising competitive pressure in the cloud computing and generative AI space are headwinds for Alphabet. These factors are turning investors bearish about the stock.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for earnings stands at $7.60 per share, which has moved 0.1% south over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple",
        "content": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple\n\nOn Monday, EU regulators found that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) violated the Digital Markets Act due to its lucrative App Store by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store. Regulators also revealed that they opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU. Apple responded that it is confident that the changes it made in the EU comply with the DMA.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Apple is defending itself against antitrust charges made by the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. In March, they sued Apple for using illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe new law designed to rein in tech giants and limit their power is already starting to give Big Tech legal headaches.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act that went into effect in March aims to limit the monopoly power that Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), ByteDance, and Meta (NASDAQ: META) enjoy by imposing more restrictive rules around competitive practices. Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly raised the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators. As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for abusing its market dominance in the distribution of music streaming apps, and is appealing the court’s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple’s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its pay or consent” model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers and will question if Meta is obtaining consent from users when intending to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Forget Just 1 AI Stock: This Trio Could Power Your Portfolio's Future",
        "content": "Putting all of your eggs in one basket is a recipe for disaster, as you could be wrong. This has been true for the artificial intelligence (AI) investment theme as well. While you've done fantastic if your sole pick was Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), it has been the opposite if your pick was C3.ai (NYSE: AI) (and if you use April 2023 as the starting point).\n\nBeing diversified is an important part of a well-balanced portfolio today. If you want to devote a section of your portfolio to AI, I urge you to consider a balanced approach, like investing in these three companies.\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nAI has generated such high stock returns over the past year because of its widespread effects. There are hardware companies, AI tool providers, and companies that provide the software needed to implement AI in a business. I'll choose one from each of those categories, as I think it provides a well-balanced AI investing approach.\n\nStarting with the hardware side, I chose Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM). While some may be shocked that I didn't choose Nvidia, I think TSMC also has a great investment thesis. Taiwan Semi is a chip foundry, which means it's an expert in fabricating chips designed by others. With a client list that includes Nvidia, AMD, Apple, and others, it's safe to say TSMC is a (if not the) top dog in its industry.\n\nAI is expected to greatly impact the company, as management believes AI-related products will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 50% for the next five years. By then, AI revenue should make up at least 20% of its total revenue. Furthermore, around a quarter of TSMC's business goes to making Apple products. The iPhone market has been poor recently, but Apple's latest announcement that its Apple Intelligence features will only be available on newer models should boost sales. This is great news for TSMC and further serves as a reason to buy the stock.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nFor AI tools, I chose Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Alphabet is primarily an advertising company, but its integration of AI with this product line is my reason for investing. While the rollout of its generative AI platform, Gemini, was far from smooth, it's starting to become a respected force in its field. Gemini can be used for nearly unlimited purposes but has already been deployed to assist clients in creating ads and summarizing results for Google search users.\n\nAlphabet also has a strong cloud computing offering with Google Cloud. Cloud computing is critical in AI because many companies don't have the financial resources to purchase an AI-dedicated server. So, they rent that computing power from a cloud computing provider like Google Cloud. Google Cloud is a top pick for companies working in AI and has captured 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies with greater than a $1 billion valuation) as customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. UiPath\n\nLastly, for software, I chose UiPath (NYSE: PATH). UiPath shareholders have had a bumpy path recently with the CEO departing and a lower immediate sales forecast, but the product it provides is still incredibly useful.\n\nUiPath's robotic process automation (RPA) software allows its users to automate repetitive tasks, improving productivity. While it's not an AI technology by itself, it incorporates multiple facets of AI, including generative AI. This further expands the number of tasks the software can automate, which expands its use cases.\n\nAdditionally, UiPath integrates with Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365, which is a key partnership, as that is one of the most common business tools used today. With many executives pushing their companies for practical AI use cases, UiPath's product stands out among the rest.\n\nAlthough UiPath may have stumbled, the long-term outlook for the RPA industry is bright. Grand View Research projects a nearly 40% compound annual growth rate in the RPA industry from now until 2030. With UiPath being one of the top names in this space, it's set to capitalize on this boom.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc.’s Google will work with CME Group Inc. to build a new cloud-computing network that will enable the exchange operator to shift its futures and options trading into the cloud.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nYouTuber Dr Disrespect Was Allegedly Kicked Off Twitch for Messaging Minor VW Latches Onto Rivian in $5 Billion EV Pact to Regain Momentum Trump Could Actually Lose Florida. Here’s Why. Nvidia Rout Takes Breather as Traders Scour Charts for Support Julian Assange Leaves Court ‘Free Man,’ Ending 14-Year Drama\n\nThe two firms will develop cloud and colocation facilities — space rented to clients for their own IT equipment — next to CME’s existing data center in Aurora, Illinois, executives said Wednesday. Construction will start later this year and the transition will happen in phases, they said.\n\nCME and Google began a 10-year alliance in 2021 to migrate data, clearing services and eventually trading into the cloud. As part of the agreement, Google made a $1 billion equity investment in the derivatives exchange.\n\n“This is a significant step forward in our partnership,” CME Chief Executive Officer Terry Duffy said in a statement.\n\nThe decision to keep the data center in the Chicago area comes after market makers and high-speed trading firms opposed a move elsewhere, according to people familiar with the matter. It highlights how difficult it would be for the exchange to move away from the region, which has seen a number of high-profile corporate departures in recent years including Ken Griffin’s Citadel, Boeing Co., and Caterpillar Inc.\n\nTraders like to have infrastructure near or in the data center to ensure information travels faster, giving them a slim advantage over others that aren’t nearby. Building out infrastructure elsewhere would take time and result in costs for firms, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the discussions are private. Talks between the exchange and traders included a potential move to Google data centers in Virginia and Ohio, the people said.\n\n“We decided to build the new facility in Aurora to ensure minimal disruption for our clients,” CME’s Duffy said.\n\n“This will maximize the opportunity for market participants to leverage a combination of specialized cloud services and existing investments in the area to drive differentiation and efficiencies,” said Rohit Bhat, managing director of capital markets, exchanges and digital assets at Google Cloud.\n\nCME said it will provide its clients with 18 months’ notice before the markets move to the new platform. The company’s cash markets will continue to operate in their current facilities, not moving to the cloud, it said.\n\nStory continues\n\nFirms that migrate trading to the new facility will also have access to Google’s cloud services including artificial intelligence tools and data analytics, CME and Google said. The matching engine, which links buyers and sellers in a trade, will move to the cloud.\n\nCME customers will be able to test cloud-based trading in the Dallas Google Cloud facility, which will eventually become a disaster-recovery center, the firms said.\n\nExchanges have long professed a goal of moving to cloud-based platforms as a way to reduce costs, but technology challenges mean the shift has been gradual. Modern trading of stocks, Treasuries, futures and other assets is incredibly fast — with the pace sometimes measured in nanoseconds, or billionths of a second — and exchanges try to ensure that all market players get price updates and other vital data at the same time.\n\nNasdaq Inc. partnered with Amazon.com Inc. to migrate its North American markets to the cloud from 2022, starting with one of its options exchanges and later an additional options and bond exchange. The two groups developed a cloud platform inside Nasdaq’s primary data center in Carteret, New Jersey.\n\nChicago-based Cboe Global Markets Inc. launched its own cloud-based market data streaming service in 2021, aiming to increase distribution of real-time information globally. It later partnered with Snowflake Inc., a cloud-based data management company, to focus on enhancing Cboe’s internal data and analytics capabilities, but not trading through the cloud.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Why BYD’s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China’s Version of Henry Ford Musk’s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash Independence Without Accountability: The Fed’s Great Inflation Fail\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Corporate IT spending isn't reflecting the AI boom: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nEveryone is so gaga for AI these days that whenever I encounter skepticism, it piques my interest.\n\nThat’s why Guggenheim’s latest note on IT spending caught my eye. Lead analyst John DiFucci calls for a “new normal” for software companies — a reality in which enterprise budget growth is not going to reaccelerate anytime soon. He based that outlook, in part, on data from tech researcher ETR that shows July IT budget growth expectations are about the same as last year’s.\n\nWhat about the AI spending boom? What about Nvidia’s parabolic sales increases as companies build up their data center firepower to build their large language models and prepare for the AI age?\n\nThat hasn’t made its way to software, DiFucci argues. That’s partly because of cost, and it seems partly because companies haven’t yet figured out what AI is useful for. (As I wrote recently, that’s the case with consumers as well).\n\nCorporations may end up spending on GenAI eventually, just not yet.\n\n“Most of the spending on AI is being done by AI companies and Public Cloud companies preparing to run AI workloads for AI companies,” DiFucci wrote. “That doesn’t mean that we won’t see that shift at some point, when corporations begin to purchase Copilots and other forms of AI en masse, or start to build their own LLMs as the cost to build and train them continues to decline. But that doesn’t seem to be the case right now.”\n\nWhat’s more, he said, companies don’t seem to be holding off on IT spending today in order to spend on AI tomorrow: “Given the uncertainty regarding what AI spending will be useful to corporations, we do not think that expectations for future AI spending is driving what appears to be a more challenging IT spending environment today.”\n\nThe “build it and they will come” approach on the part of companies like Microsoft, Alphabet, and Meta may well pay off down the line.\n\nBut despite some analysts’ insistence that this is the year that AI proves itself in practice (Forbes called this “the year of AI practicality”), it’s still unclear exactly how.\n\nTo DiFucci, that means about half of the software companies he covers may have to reset lofty AI-related revenue expectations. That includes firms like Palo Alto Networks, Salesforce, and Workday.\n\nAt the same time, there are many corporate leaders who will tell you (a little too eagerly, perhaps) how they — and their clients — are already using AI. But as Jefferies’ Brent Thill said earlier this year, it won’t be until 2025 that that revenue will start to materialize.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf corporate number-crunchers are keeping the purse strings tight, AI may have to prove its worth before they start spending.\n\nJulie Hyman is the co-anchor of Yahoo Finance Live, weekdays 9 a.m.-11 a.m. ET.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Bigger Than Nvidia in 2030",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already reshaping the corporate world. Chatbot applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT can instantly craft text, images, videos, and computer code on command, which could drive a productivity boom worth trillions of dollars across the global economy.\n\nDeveloping those AI applications wouldn't be possible without the data center graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). They contributed to an astronomical 427% increase in Nvidia's data center revenue in the recent quarter, pushing sales to a record $22.6 billion.\n\nThat growth is the reason Nvidia's valuation recently topped $3.2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nNvidia's incredible run won't last forever\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) describes the point when AI matches human intelligence across most cognitive tasks. Some researchers -- including one who worked for OpenAI -- believe AGI could be achieved as soon as 2027 given the lightning-fast pace of development.\n\nAs is the case with most technologies, the continued advancement of AI beyond that point could yield diminishing returns. In other words, the number of commercial workloads that could benefit from machine intelligence beyond AGI is probably quite small. If that's the case, data center operators won't have to buy every new version of Nvidia's GPUs because the pool of developers who want (or can afford) the performance increase will also shrink.\n\nThat could put the brakes on Nvidia's growth by the end of this decade.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management has been a consistent seller of Nvidia stock this year. Wood believes software companies could generate $8 of revenue for every $1 they invest in Nvidia's chips, so she feels that's where the next opportunity lies. Ark is joined by several billionaire fund managers who have also trimmed their Nvidia holdings recently.\n\nWall Street thinks Nvidia will generate $3.61 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026, giving its stock a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.2. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9 today, so if you believe Nvidia will trade at a market multiple over the long term, investors who buy the stock now will have to wait two years before its earnings catch up to the recent run in its stock price.\n\nOf course, Nvidia stock could also achieve a cheaper P/E ratio by falling. Whichever scenario plays out, here's why I think AI titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be worth more than the chip giant by 2030.\n\nStory continues Image source: Microsoft.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.3 trillion, Microsoft is already slightly bigger than Nvidia. However, if Cathie Wood is right about software being the next big AI opportunity, Microsoft is making all the right moves to extend its market cap advantage through the end of this decade.\n\nAfter announcing plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to create an AI assistant called Copilot. It's available with most of Microsoft's flagship software products.\n\nFor example, businesses can now pay an additional monthly subscription fee to access the Copilot-enabled version of 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more). With 400 million enterprise seats potentially eligible for that upgrade, it could translate into billions of dollars in extra annual recurring revenue for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform has also become a distributor of the latest AI models for tens of thousands of organizations. That includes 65% of the Fortune 500 companies that are using the Azure OpenAI Service to build their own AI applications, utilizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as a base.\n\nMicrosoft is on track to generate $244.9 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30), which is more than Nvidia is expected to generate nearly two years from now. Plus, Microsoft's current P/E ratio of 38.1 is a whopping 45% discount to Nvidia's current P/E ratio of 70.2. It's actually closer to where Nvidia's P/E ratio is expected to be in fiscal 2026, as I highlighted earlier.\n\nMicrosoft has a track record of success spanning almost five decades, and so long as the company continues to grow on the top and bottom lines, its market cap will likely increase in the coming years, whereas Nvidia faces downside risks.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is another $3 trillion giant, and it might also have an edge over Nvidia in the long run thanks to its incredible hardware and software ecosystem. There are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, led by the flagship iPhone, and the company will use that installed base to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nIt will achieve that through Apple Intelligence, which is set to launch in September within the new iOS 18 operating system. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, so it will feature industry-leading models that promise to transform Apple's existing software. For example, the Siri voice assistant will draw on the expansive knowledge of ChatGPT, and apps like Mail, Notes, and Messages will be overhauled with a host of new writing tools to help users draft content more quickly.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to drive a large upgrade cycle when the hotly anticipated iPhone 16 launches later this year, because rumors suggest it will feature a more powerful chip designed specifically for processing AI workloads. This will unlock a much faster experience for users who wish to lean on AI day-to-day.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to generate $386 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ending September 30), which is more than Microsoft and Nvidia combined in their current fiscal years. Plus, Apple trades at a P/E ratio of 32.2 at the moment, so it's cheaper than both of its $3 trillion peers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is already reaping substantial financial rewards from AI, Apple's AI story is only just beginning, and it could have much more long-term potential given the sheer size of its ecosystem. Image source: Alphabet.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. Google Search currently dominates the internet search industry with a 90% market share, but there have been concerns about AI applications like ChatGPT eroding its advantage. Simply put, chatbots offer a more convenient way to access information compared to traditional search, which requires the user to sift through web pages for answers.\n\nAlphabet responded to that threat by launching a series of AI chatbots of its own, culminating in the new Gemini models. Plus, the traditional Google Search experience now uses generative AI to provide users with text-based answers to their queries at the top of the page, saving them from visiting third-party web pages.\n\nThose two initiatives should protect the platform's dominance, and there was evidence of that in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue generated from Google Search increased by 14.3% compared to the year-ago period, marking the fastest growth rate in almost two years.\n\nPlus, Alphabet now offers Gemini to existing Google Workspace subscribers for an additional fee, where they can integrate it with Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more to help users boost their productivity with AI. It's similar to the way Microsoft is offering Copilot for 365, and it effectively creates a new recurring revenue stream for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet stock trades at a P/E ratio of about 27.5 right now, so not only is it much cheaper than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, but it's also cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index. If Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Alphabet stock looks like an absolute bargain right now compared to Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Futures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point mostly into the green on Wednesday after a rebound in tech stocks helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite end multi-day losing streaks in the previous session. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares spike in extended hours trading as the delivery group and global economic bellwether unveils an upbeat full-year financial forecast. Shares in Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) also surged, boosted by plans from Germany's Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to invest up to $5 billion in the electric truck maker.\n\n1. Futures broadly higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged broadly higher on Wednesday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite snapped three-day losing streaks in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:27 ET (07:27 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly flat, S&P 500 futures had gained 5 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 32 points or 0.2%.\n\nStrength in artificial intelligence semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big-name tech firms pulled both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite into the green on Tuesday. Shares in Nvidia climbed by 6.8%, recovering from a three-session sell-off, while the sector-wide Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 1.8%.\n\nChipmakers also gave lift to the S&P 500 Technology index, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also rose, pushing up the communications services index.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was the laggard, ending the trading day in the red after touching a one-month high on Monday.\n\n2. FedEx advances on upbeat outlook\n\nShares in FedEx surged by more than 13% in extended hours trading after the shipping giant revealed an upbeat outlook and unveiled plans for a $2.5 billion share buyback in its current financial year.\n\nThe Memphis-based company, whose results are considered to be a possible marker of the state of the global economy, said it now expects to deliver full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit. Analysts had called for an increase of 3%.\n\nEarnings in its 2025 fiscal period are also seen at between $20 to $22 per share, topping Wall Street's predictions of $20.92 at the midpoint.\n\nFedEx also reported a 7.2% uptick in income excluding items to $1.34 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter on revenue of $22.1 billion. CEO Raj Subramaniam called the returns \"unprecedented in this current environment,\" adding that the momentum is expected to \"continue in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nLogistics player DHL's (ETR:DHLn) stock price ticked higher in early European trading following FedEx's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Pool shares sink\n\nPool (NASDAQ:POOL) stock fell 7% on Tuesday after the swimming pool products distributor cut its earnings and revenues expectations, citing the impact of a downturn in consumer spending on big-ticket items like home improvement projects.\n\nOne of the sector's leading names, Lousiana-based Pool flagged that construction activity may slip by 15% to 20% this year. Sales year-to-date have also decreased by around 6.5% versus the comparable period in 2023, the company noted.\n\nThe firm warned that recent data suggests \"persistently weak demand for new pool construction\" following the end of the typical swimming pool high-season from late May to early June.\n\nPool's decline on Tuesday pulled down peers like pool supplies firms Hayward Holdings (NYSE:HAYW) and Leslie's (NASDAQ:LESL), as well as pool manufacturer Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM).\n\n4. Rivian shares soar as VW plans $5 billion investment\n\nShares in Rivian leapt in extended hours trading after Germany's Volkswagen announced a major investment plan in the American high-end electric truck group.\n\nThe partnership, which could see VW provide Rivian with as much as $5 billion in capital, aims to form a 50/50 joint venture for sharing knowledge on electric vehicle architecture and software. If the tie-up is completed, Volkswagen will gain \"immediate access\" to Rivian's current EV technology.\n\nA final decision on the establishment of the joint venture is still pending.\n\nThe move comes as VW looks to bolster its EV offerings during a time of intensifying competition from rivals in China and U.S. giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n5. Crude inches up\n\nCrude prices rose Wednesday, despite a surprise jump in U.S. stockpiles, as traders weighed geopolitical risks and confidence surrounding the summer driving season.\n\nBy 03:26 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.6% higher at $81.28 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.5% to $84.62 a barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories grew by around 0.9 million barrels in the week to June 21.\n\nThis was something of a surprise given expectations for a draw of 3 million barrels, but is largely being overlooked as investors anticipate inventory drawdowns during the peak third quarter demand season. The official numbers from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.\n\nBoth contracts are still sitting on strong gains over the past two weeks, as persistent geopolitical tensions – Israeli strikes on Gaza and Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries -- resulted in traders pricing a risk premium into oil prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets\n\nVolkswagen's $5 billion investment in Rivian boosts EV maker's shares\n\nBarclays: FOMO fever leaves positioning full, vulnerable to Tech faltering\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Will Google strike a deal with California news outlets to fund journalism?",
        "content": "California news publishers and Big Tech companies appear to be inching toward compromise on a controversial bill that would require Google and huge social media platforms to pay news outlets for the articles they distribute.\n\nAfter stalling last year, Assembly Bill 886 cleared a critical hurdle Tuesday when it passed the state Senate Judiciary Committee. Several lawmakers described the legislation as a work in progress aimed at solving a critical problem: The news business is shrinking as technology changes the way people consume information.\n\n\"I do believe the marketplace is the best mechanism to regulate industry,\" Sen. Tom Umberg (D-Orange), the committee chairman, said during a hearing on the bill.\n\nHowever, he said, the demise of journalism harms democracy: \"Thus, we have an obligation to find a way to support reasonable, credible journalism.\"\n\nRead more:Column: News business needs help in California. Is government the answer?\n\nThe legislation, known as the “California Journalism Preservation Act,” would require digital platforms to pay news outlets a fee when they sell advertising alongside news content. It calls for creating a fund that the tech firms pay into, with the money being distributed to news outlets based on the number of journalists they employ. Publishers would have to use 70% of the money they receive to pay journalists in California.\n\nUmberg noted that the bill does not specify an amount for the fund. He said it would be \"a very elegant solution\" for the parties involved to agree on what amount that should be.\n\nSen. Henry Stern (D-Calabasas) described talks as being \"closer and closer to the place where we could actually land some kind of deal.\"\n\nIn Canada, Google is paying $74 million annually into a fund for the news industry under a law similar to the one proposed in California.\n\nJaffer Zaidi, Google's vice president of global news partnerships, testified against the California proposal during a hearing in which news executives from across the state lined up to express support for the bill, while tech industry lobbyists lined up in opposition. The bill is sponsored by the California News Publishers Assn., of which the Los Angeles Times is a member.\n\n\"The bill would ... break the fundamental and foundational principles of the open internet, forcing platforms to pay publishers for sending valuable free traffic to them,\" Zaidi said.\n\n\"It puts the full burden of support on one or two companies, while shielding many other large platforms who also link to news from California publishers.\"\n\nHe said Google had shared a proposal for a different way to support journalism \"through targeted programs\" that would be funded by more companies than just the very largest platforms. The current version of the bill would apply only to Google and Meta, the parent company of Instagram and Facebook.\n\n\"We hope this can serve as a basis for a workable path forward together,\" Zaidi said. \"We remain committed to being here and constructively working towards an outcome.\"\n\nRead more:Why Google's lobbying in California skyrocketed this year\n\nThe bill's author, Assemblymember Buffy Wicks (D-Oakland), said she is \"aggressively trying to engage\" with companies that oppose the bill in the hopes that the sparring sides can reach an agreement that will allow the news industry to thrive.\n\n\"At the end of the day, I want the best solution to the problem,\" Wicks said.\n\nShe closed the hearing by talking about the role journalism has played in exposing problems that lawmakers wind up addressing in the Capitol, such as crafting new laws to extend the statute of limitations for sexual abuse lawsuits after The Times' investigation revealed a pattern of allegations against former USC gynecologist George Tyndall.\n\nThe bill now advances to the Senate Appropriations Committee. It will go to Gov. Gavin Newsom if it clears both houses of the Legislature by Aug. 31.\n\nSign up for Essential California for news, features and recommendations from the L.A.

Now with open access, anyone can request a ride on its app.\n\nThe company had opened access to everyone in Phoenix, Arizona without a waitlist in 2020.\n\nMountain View, California-based Waymo is a self-driving technology pioneer, which started its first U.S. driverless taxi service in 2020 over a decade after it was born in 2009 as a project inside Google.\n\nIn March, the company received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to start its Waymo One in Los Angeles and some cities near San Francisco.\n\nRivals including General Motors-backed Cruise and Amazon.com's Zoox are accelerating a race to succeed amid probes by auto regulators involving the performance of autonomous driving cars.\n\nLast month, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said it had learned of nine additional incidents raising concerns about the performance of Waymo self-driving vehicles.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Maju Samuel)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally — why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme — not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Tuesday?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) is significantly expanding its operations in response to growing demand in the AI, 5G, server, and data center markets.\n\nThe company remains engaged in its geographical expansion while maintaining Taiwan as its base.\n\nActer Group Co, a semiconductor equipment and chemicals supplier, is accelerating its overseas expansion, primarily focusing on Japan and Southeast Asia to support these demands.\n\nThe expansion is a strategic response to geopolitical risks and the need for diversified manufacturing sites, Taipei Times reports.\n\nAlso Read: What’s Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Monday?\n\nActer Group Co-President Wang Chun-sheng emphasized the company’s strategy to enhance its global footprint.\n\nActer’s significant clients include TSMC, United Microelectronics Co (NYSE:UMC), Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC), Nvidia Corp, and Alphabet Inc’s Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nIn addition to Asia, Acter is considering expansion projects in Mexico and the US, aiming to follow their clients’ geographical diversification.\n\nActer prioritizes Southeast Asia, Japan, and India for overseas expansion.\n\nLast month, Acter’s subsidiary, Rayzher Industrial Co, established a branch in Kumamoto, Japan, to support TSMC’s fab operations.\n\nRayzher is also planning a second overseas site in Germany, where TSMC will likely build a new 12-inch fab through a joint venture.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor gained 68% in the last 12 months.\n\nInvestors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via First Trust Nasdaq Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:FTXL) and SPDR S&P Semiconductor ETF (NYSE:XSD).\n\nTSMC Stock Prediction For 2024\n\nEquity research analysts on and off Wall Street typically use earnings growth and fundamental research as a form of valuation and forecasting. But many in trading turn to technical analysis as a way to form predictive models for share price trajectory.\n\nSome investors look to trends to help forecast where they believe a stock could trade at a certain point in the future. Looking at Taiwan Semiconductor, an investor could make an assessment about a stock's long term prospects using a moving average and trend line. If they believe a stock will remain above the moving average, which many believe is a bullish signal, they can extrapolate that trend into the future using a trend line. For Taiwan Semiconductor, the 200-day moving average sits at $120.13, according to Benzinga Pro, which is below the current price of $170.84. For more on charts and trend lines, see a description here.\n\nTraders believe that when a stock is above its moving average, it is a generally bullish signal, and when it crosses below, it is a more negative signal. Investors could use trend lines to make an educated guess about where a stock could trade at a later date if conditions remain stable.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrice Action: TSM shares traded higher by 1.51% to $170.35 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Ivan Marc via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Tuesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "When choosing stocks, investors sometimes like to follow the example of billionaires -- often despite not knowing the motivations behind such holdings. But these investment titans may have purchased shares at a lower valuation. In other cases, they might be sitting on years of dividend gains that are less meaningful to an investor today.\n\nUltimately, billionaires have their own reasons for buying and holding specific stocks. Yet, some of the holdings -- especially if recently purchased -- could be appropriate for smaller investors. Let's take a look at three such stocks right now.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAmid rising interest in AI, Google parent Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) has attracted the interest of billionaires such as Bill Ackman at Pershing Square Capital.\n\nIndeed, the recent public interest in AI was driven primarily by other companies. When the public saw the capabilities of OpenAI's ChatGPT, investors turned on Alphabet on the assumption that the longtime AI leader had fallen behind its peers.\n\nHowever, Alphabet has responded with its own generative AI product in Gemini. Moreover, it has long led the way in AI, having first introduced AI to its search engine in 2001. It became an AI-first company in 2016 and today drives AI innovation through Google DeepMind.\n\nFurthermore, its $108 billion in liquidity gives it the resources necessary to stay on top. At a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio, of 27, the stock also has the lowest earnings multiple among the tech megacaps, an attribute that likely attracted Ackman's attention and could bring higher returns as it catches up to its peers.\n\nAlibaba\n\nAnother intriguing stock is Alibaba(NYSE: BABA), which drew the interest of billionaire David Tepper's Appaloosa Management. Although it is the leading e-commerce conglomerate in China, its stock has suffered amid political turmoil. Alibaba is an American Depositary Receipt rather than an actual stake in Alibaba.\n\nSuch arrangements are only cause for concern if its home country has deteriorating relations with the U.S. Unfortunately, this has been the case with Alibaba, and it has lost value since its 2014 initial public offering (IPO) as a result. BABA Chart\n\nStill, the U.S. and China have much to lose if such an arrangement falters, making it more likely that Alibaba stock will survive.\n\nIndeed, Alibaba's revenue has increased almost 18-fold since between fiscal 2014 and 2024. Plus, its stock has traded in a range for the last two years. With rising profits and a P/E ratio of just 17, it sells at a massive discount to similar businesses in other countries such as Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nUltimately, Alibaba is not suitable for risk-averse investors. Still, if one can stomach the political risk, the stock could become a tremendous opportunity to buy an e-commerce conglomerate at a huge discount.\n\nSnowflake\n\nSnowflake (NYSE: SNOW) may be one of the more surprising choices of billionaire Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway as Buffett has often avoided IPO investments in the past.\n\nNonetheless, investors should watch Snowflake for its leadership in the data cloud market. Its product allows organizations to manage, store, and secure data in one central, cloud-based repository. So compelling is the software that Amazon has offered it to some of its cloud customers despite selling its own data cloud product.\n\nAdmittedly, investors had highly valued the stock before a slowing of earnings, and a sudden change at the CEO level rattled investors. However, in the first three months of fiscal 2025 (ended April 30), its net retention rate -- a measure of recurring revenue from existing customers -- stood at an impressive 128% as Snowflake's usage-based revenue model sometimes compels customers to spend more money on the platform.\n\nMoreover, amid a falling stock price, its price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is at a record low of 14. Hence, buying in this period of relative struggle may pay off for investors as more customers benefit from its data cloud product.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs mega-cap technology stocks continue to soar to new highs, the number of Wall Street analysts highlighting the “concentration of gains” problem are increasing. It’s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that “Big Tech” has  “largely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.” Krishna said that Q1 results showed the “ongoing dominance” of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\n“This makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,” Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen’s New AI Fund\n\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet “on and against” companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez. The fund’s expected launch date is later this year or early 2025.\n\nBillionaire Cohen is already ramping up his bets on AI. To see his AI investments this year, click 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nSince Krishna of Barclays talked about the rise of big tech funds and their concentration into AI, in this article we will take a look at the major AI stocks that form the portfolios of these funds and discuss their growth catalysts and long-term outlook. For that we first listed down all holdings of major tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and iShares Global Tech ETF and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Are Big Tech Funds Buying Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Stock?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nThe latest Barclays report suggests (unsurprisingly) that Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is one of the stocks Big Tech funds have been piling into. The stock has gained about 45% over the past one year. Morgan Stanley in a latest note said that Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) new AI features do not pose a threat to Alphabet’s “broad-based search.”\n\nBillionaire Ackman owns a $1.4 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). In his 2023 letter to investors, Ackman addressed the concerns around Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) amid the rise of AI language models:\n\nThe cumulative impact of AI and machine learning enhancements is perhaps most evident in Google’s core Search franchise. Google Search has evolved from its starting point as a simple results page with “10 blue links” and now provides summary answer snippets for informational and educational queries similar to AI chatbots without any of their latency. For more involved queries, for example, in travel, the company has developed specialized Google Flights and Hotels modules that offer consumers substantial utility and freedom to direct their discovery process. Innovation in Google Search has maintained its leading market position through multiple perceived “disruption” risks over time, including the platform transition from desktop-tomobile and competitive threats from social media and verticalized search. Likewise, we view the company’s integration of generative AI into a wider range of queries, not as a disruptive shift, but as a natural evolution of its Search product which will enhance the user experience and improve conversion for advertisers. We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model. The company’s stock currently trades at approximately 19 times forward earnings, a deep discount to its peers despite its similar rate of projected earnings growth.\n\nRead Ackman’s letter here.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +2.4% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.8% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 2.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 points to a change of +31% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.4%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia: 3 Tech Stocks Beloved by Billionaires",
        "content": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below. META Chart\n\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023). Top Tech Tech stocks owned by billionaires\n\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet\n\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\n\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\n\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\n\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\n\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\n\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\n\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below. META PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\n\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function. So-called hyperscaler data centers (many over 100,000 square feet) are expected to increase by over 100 annually for the next decade, according to one source, providing Nvidia with a long runway still.\n\nNvidia didn't disappoint in the first quarter, posting a 262% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $26 billion. Its data center sales exploded again to $23 billion, a 427% year-over-year increase. The 10-for-1 stock split also excited investors, although stock splits have no direct effect on the company's or shareholders' value.\n\nOf the 16 billionaire portfolios studied, Nvidia is in the top-10 tech holdings of 10, with several having it in the top three. However, new investors in Nvidia should consider the valuation before jumping in with both feet.\n\nIts current P/E is more than 70. This drops to 47 on a forward basis but still dwarfs Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) own lofty valuation.\n\nNvidia will have a long, prosperous future, but consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for a dip to accumulate shares now.\n\nMost billionaires didn't get wealthy by accident. These hedge funds study data, hire industry experts, and make shrewd stock buys. While investors should not blindly follow their lead, examining their top picks is a terrific place to get ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, NVIDIA, Hanesbrands, Amkor and Inseego",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 25, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Hanesbrands Inc. HBI, Amkor Technology, Inc. AMKR and Inseego Corp. INSG.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Growth Stocks to Buy for an Imposing Election Year Rally\n\nThe year 2023 was impressive for Wall Street. Heading into 2024, some bottlenecks, including geopolitical upheavals and stretched valuations, raised doubts about whether the rally will endure. However, major bourses shrugged off all these apprehensions and notched record highs.\n\nDow Jones Market Data stated that the S&P 500 is on pace to register its best performance in the first half of an election year since 1976. The broader index has shot up 11.3% this year. Similarly, the Nasdaq has soared 11.8% this year as the tech juggernaut rolls on. The 30-stock Dow has also traded in the green, advancing 3.5% year to date.\n\nInterest rate cut optimism amid easing inflation helped the stock market scale northward this year. Consumer price pressures loosened their grip on the economy, with the consumer price index (CPI) remaining flat in May. Last month, the CPI may have increased by 3.3% from a year earlier, but it is less than April’s rise of 3.4% and much less than the pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022.\n\nAdditionally, producer prices fell month over month in May, a tell-tale sign that inflation is receding. This means that the Federal Reserve will remain less hawkish, and is now widely expected to trim interest rates as early as fall. Interest rate cuts bode well for the stock market as they increase consumer outlays, reduce borrowing costs, and propel economic growth.\n\nBy the way, at the beginning of the year, market participants expected the Fed to trim rates at least six times this year. Now, the likelihood of a rate cut has been reduced to one by the end of the year. Even though it is unsatisfactory, the stock market has adjusted and kept climbing higher, banking on AI buoyancy. Digital disruption and AI have led to numerous technological progressions, boosting primarily tech company’s profit margins.\n\nMeanwhile, presidential election years tend to be good for stocks. Janus Henderson Investors noted that despite political changeovers, the S&P 500 in election years has generated an impressive average annual return of 9.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, with things predominantly looking up for Wall Street in 2024, astute investors should place their bets on solid growth stocks such as Alphabet Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Hanesbrands Inc., Amkor Technology, Inc. and Inseego Corp.\n\nThese stocks carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and a Growth Score of A or B, a combination that offers the best opportunities in the growth investing space. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks Rank #1 stocks here.\n\nAlphabet has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to cloud computing. Alphabet currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 11.9% over the past 60 days. GOOGL’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 31%.\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 12.1% over the past 60 days. NVDA’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.2%.\n\nHanesbrands engages in the design, manufacture, sourcing, and sale of apparel essentials for men, women and children. Hanesbrands currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 4.6% over the past 60 days. HBI’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 666.7%.\n\nAmkor Technology is the world's largest independent provider of semiconductor packaging and test services. Amkor Technology currently has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has moved up 9.2% over the past 60 days. AMKR’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 21.9%.\n\nInseegois a provider of software-as-a-service solutions for the Internet of Things.

INSG’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 92.3%.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Rishi Sunak and Labour leader Keir Starmer traded stark warnings about each other’s handling of the UK economy as the prime minister sought to turn around his Conservative Party’s fortunes ahead of next week’s general election.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nJain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi How Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show ‘Hot Ones’ Tech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap Nvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can’t Keep Up\n\nSunak said Starmer’s tax plans may have the same impact as predecessor Liz Truss, who roiled the financial markets with a package of unfunded tax cuts during her 7-week tenure. Starmer, for his part, said Labour would never inflict the same economic chaos on Britain as the former Conservative leader did, reminding voters of the impact her measures had on the cost-of-living crisis.\n\nThe exchange came after the Institute for Fiscal Studies said that the UK public is “voting in a knowledge vacuum” after both parties “ducked” hard choices on how to pay for their spending promises without raising taxes.\n\nUK Voters in ‘Knowledge Vacuum’ on Tax and Spend, IFS Warns\n\nWith just 10 days to go until Britons head to the polling booths, Sunak’s Tories trail Labour by more than 20 points in national polls — a gap that’s little-changed from when the prime minister called the vote on May 22. That’s left Starmer apparently on course to replace Sunak in Downing Street next week — something which Sunak appeared to concede when he likened his warnings now to those he made in his losing leadership bid against Truss.\n\n“I’m telling you again now, it all seems a bit familiar — if Keir Starmer is your prime minister, the economy is going to suffer, and all of you are going to suffer,” Sunak said in a Sun interview streamed live on Monday. “I was right then when I warned about Liz Truss,” he said, adding “that’s why all of you can trust me now when I also warn about the damage that Keir Starmer would do.”\n\nSunak has sought to build the Conservative campaign around warnings that Labour is planning unannounced tax rises totaling more than £2,000 ($2,500) per person over four years — a charge denied by the opposition. He reiterated the message that Labour would raise taxes on Monday.\n\nStarmer, for his part, has promised Labour won’t raise income tax, national insurance, value-added tax on goods and corporation tax, and Sunak’s previous warnings of tax-rises under Labour haven’t shifted the polls.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpeaking in his own Sun interview after Sunak, Starmer brought up Truss when asked if he planned to raise taxes, pointing to the damage her measures had done in forcing up mortgage rates.\n\n“I’m never going to let a Labour government do that, which is why everything is fully funded and fully costed,” Starmer said. He described the election as a “clear choice,” given public services had deteriorated over 14 years of Tory governance. “We’ve had 14 years of chaos, division and failure, and it’s not going to change,” Starmer said.\n\n(Updates to add IFS analysis, in third paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Why BYD’s Wang Chuanfu Could Be China’s Version of Henry Ford Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. rejected overtures by Meta Platforms Inc. to integrate the social networking company’s AI chatbot into the iPhone months ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Jain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show ‘Hot Ones’ Nvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can’t Keep Up Tech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\n\nThe two companies aren’t in discussions about using Meta’s Llama chatbot in an AI partnership and only held brief talks in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The dialogue about a partnership didn’t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\n\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\n\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn’t see that company’s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta’s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\n\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple’s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\n\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology — called Apple Intelligence — includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\n\nBut Apple’s chatbot technology isn’t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing for searches.\n\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company’s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn’t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\n\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Shopping’s new exec spent 15 years at Amazon: Here’s his plan to hijack Prime Day",
        "content": "For more than 20 years, Google executives haven’t been quite sure what they wanted their Google Shopping search portal to be when it grew up.\n\nA price comparison tool?\n\nAn actual product marketplace or online retailer that would compete with the likes of Amazon or Walmart or eBay?\n\nA combination of the two?\n\nFor now at least, it’s made up its mind. And one of its executives, a former Amazon leader named Sean Scott, is trying to make the case that “it’s fiscally irresponsible to start your shopping anywhere else other than Google,” as he said in a recent exclusive interview with Fortune.\n\n(If that “irresponsible” line sounds familiar, you might be an e-commerce nerd like me: Jeff Bezos once used a similar phrase in an annual shareholder letter, writing, “We want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member.”)\n\n“We don’t have inventory, we don’t take payment, we don’t ship anything, we are really neutral,” Google’s Scott continued in the interview with Fortune. “And we’re just at it to show customers the best prices on the web from any merchant.”\n\nCall Google the Switzerland of shopping. (Albeit a Switzerland where retailers and brands need to buy ads if they want to appear at the tippy top of search results.)\n\nThe timing of Scott’s pronouncement is not coincidental. In July, Amazon will host its annual two-day shopping event for Prime members, attracting attention not just from millions of shoppers around the web, but other merchants big and small that will also offer deals in an attempt to court some consumer attention. Scott knows the power of Prime firsthand; he worked at Amazon for nearly 15 years, including as a vice president overseeing the online retailer’s core shopping experience. He joined Google in the fall of 2023 to run the consumer side of Google Shopping after a three-year stint at PagerDuty.\n\nDuring Amazon’s Prime Day shopping extravaganza, Google searches for shopping deals actually surpass those related to travel or vacation, according to Scott.\n\nSo Google has been rolling out and expanding shopping features in its search engine to try to capitalize on the increase in shopping activity around the web thanks to Prime Day. It has rolled out a special deals section to highlight discounted items across the web, and has also expanded its price comparison tools, including a feature that will show shoppers special pricing that a retailer might be offering members of their rewards or loyalty programs.\n\nGoogle is also touting its price-tracking features, which give shoppers the ability to get notifications if a product’s price drops at an online retailer, and also track the price of goods over a 90-day period to understand if a deal that Amazon or another retailer is touting is actually a good deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Google, Amazon is both friend and foe. On one hand, Amazon remains one of the largest advertisers on Google, paying to place sponsored product listings at the top of Google search results to pick off shoppers that may have started their product search there rather than on Amazon itself.\n\nBut over the past decade, Amazon has become a product-search powerhouse itself, with more than half of online shoppers in the U.S. beginning product searches on the everything store and less than half on Google.\n\nAs that has happened, Amazon has built a massive advertising business within its own shopping empire, generating nearly $47 billion in revenue in 2023. Google’s core business, of course, is also advertising. A product search that begins on Amazon (or Walmart or Temu or Shein for that matter) is a product search that Google can’t monetize with ads. Part of the problem if you’re Google, or advantage if you’re Amazon, is that many Amazon customers that become reliant on the Prime shipping program don’t price-compare or shop around except, perhaps, on expensive items.\n\nMaybe more should. To be clear, Amazon has a reputation for low prices. Last year, for example, e-commerce analytics firm Profitero named Amazon the online retailer with the lowest prices for the seventh year in a row. (Note that a company like Temu wouldn’t be included in a research study like that one because it doesn’t sell brand-name goods across a wide selection of categories.)\n\nBut price-comparison research can indeed be worthwhile. I recently was in the market for an exciting purchase: an air filter for a furnace. For a variety of uninteresting reasons, I wanted to buy a single filter and not a multipack as I usually would. After wading through multipacks on Amazon’s search results page, I found a single filter for sale. It cost around $18.\n\nThat’s quite high, so I turned to Google. A quick search turned up a $6 filter being sold from a local Ace Hardware store, and a Pick Up Today badge further cemented my decision. Perhaps Amazon (or Walmart or another retailer) will show you a good price on many items, or the shipping speed you desire that matters more than saving money, but it’s hard to argue with the idea of clicking over to Google for a minute or two if the lowest price is what you seek.\n\nAnd yet, other new digital shopping tools continue to launch, especially as a result of the generative AI boom. A startup called Daydream, for example, recently announced a $50 million investment from venture capital firms including Forerunner Ventures. Daydream is run by well-respected industry veteran Julie Bornstein and says it is building an AI-powered search engine for products. Mass retailers like Amazon and Walmart are also testing gen AI shopping assistants to further personalize the product search and browsing experience.\n\nShoppers also continue to get inspiration from influencers on video platforms like TikTok (which sells goods through TikTok Shop), Instagram, and Google sister-site YouTube.\n\nBut Google is investing in AI-powered shopping tools as well, from a virtual try-on feature for various body types and skin tones, to product-recommendation features.\n\nIn the end, though, Scott maintains that the goal is a straightforward one.\n\n“We’re just trying to help the customer shop, opening your eyes to new selections and new merchants at great prices,” he said.\n\nAre you a current or former Google or Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) legal headaches mounted Monday with the news that European Union regulators found it violated a new law designed to rein in tech giants.\n\nThe EU’s European Commission said it informed Apple that the rules of Apple's lucrative App Store violated the Digital Markets Act by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\n\nThe regulator also announced it had opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny overseas comes as Apple defends itself in the US against antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold onto a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit; it has yet to comment on the new EU actions.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple’s stock up more than 1%.\n\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" — Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) — and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\n\nThe law’s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\n\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\n\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\n\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAnd that’s what regulators said Apple did. The logo of Apple is illuminated at a store in Munich, Germany, in 2020. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\n\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company’s global annual revenue. In Apple’s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\n\nApple doesn’t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category that includes the store’s revenue reached $85 billion that same year.\n\nThe EC’s announcement significantly broadened financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple’s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 Euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify, targeted Apple’s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\n\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Mega-cap titans Meta Platforms, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Amazon generated outsized gains and were the Fund’s top relative contributors for the past 12 months. Following our valuation discipline, we continued to methodically rotate from more fully priced stocks to those trading at healthier discounts to our value estimates. We trimmed more tech-adjacent winners during the quarter, including Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has been the most notable trim over the past two quarters. In effect, we removed the heavy overweight layer of the position size, which had been in the 6% to 8% range for most of the last five years. Part of the decision simply reflected valuation prudence after an exceptional period where the stock price ran well ahead of our estimate of business value growth. Some of it was a reality check that Google’s core search business may be less clearly unassailable than it appeared to be five to seven years ago. Our team also has adopted a healthy “prove it” approach to management/culture, capital allocation and future returns on a robust investment cycle. While Alphabet may no longer warrant standout overweight status, the stock remains one of the Fund’s largest holdings.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is leaving no stone unturned to expand its Search offerings in a bid to boost its web browsing traffic.\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet’s division Google recently announced the upcoming roll-out of public, searchable “profiles” in Search.\r\n\r\nGoogle will use these user profiles to accumulate reviews and search notes linked to one’s account and display them publically.\r\n\r\nThis upcoming addition will simplify users’ review management for movies and TV shows, providing control to make or delete reviews and edit or delete them privately.\r\n\r\nAlphabet strives to boost the user experience and functionality of its search engine with these public profiles.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Search Initiatives Aid Google Services\n\nPer a Dataintelo report, the global search engine market is expected to reach $507.4 billion by 2032, indicating a CAGR of 11% between 2024 and 2032. Alphabet is well-poised to capitalize on this solid growth opportunity on the back of its growing Search initiatives.\r\n\r\nAlphabet added a “Listen to this page” text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome, enabling users to hear texts on web pages. This new feature will support several languages including Arabic, Bengali, English, French, Chinese, German, Hindi, and Portuguese, to name a few.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s launch of Circle to Search allows users to now circle what they see on their Android screens, ask a question about an image or object in a video, and get an AI overview with Lens.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s growing focus to enhance its Search Generative Experience (SGE), which replaces traditional search results with AI-generated insights, is opening up new opportunities for advertisers as it introduced new ad formats, including Search and Shopping ads alongside Search results in SGE.\r\n\r\nThese efforts to boost users’ Search experience are expected to accelerate daily user activity on Search. This, in turn, will continue aiding Google in sustaining its dominance against the likes of Microsoft MSFT and Baidu BIDU, which are also making concerted efforts to boost their presence in the search engine market.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is benefiting from its launch of the AI-powered Bing search engine and Edge browser to deliver a better search experience, more complete answers, a new chat experience, and the ability to generate content.\r\n\r\nBaidu, on the other hand, has enhanced its search engine experience with the launch of its AI chatbot, ERNIE Bot, which can interact with people, answer questions and queries, assist in the creation, and help users obtain information and knowledge efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nWrapping Up\n\nA strong Search portfolio, along with its robust Android and YouTube offerings, will drive the Google Services segment’s performance, which has been a key growth catalyst for the company. Alphabet’s shares have rallied 28.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 24.6%.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Google Services segment increased 13.6% year over year to $70.4 billion, which accounted for 87.4% of the total revenues.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 11.92% in the past 60 days.\n\nZacks Rank & Another Stock to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nAnother top-ranked stock in the broader technology sector is Arista Networks ANET, sporting the a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

        "title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\n\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\n\nAlphabet's future position in AI\n\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\n\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\n\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\n\nFundamental and competitive analysis\n\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\n\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\n\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\n\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\n\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\n\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\n\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\n\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\n\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\n\nConclusion\n\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For those looking to find strong Computer and Technology stocks, it is prudent to search for companies in the group that are outperforming their peers. Amphenol (APH) is a stock that can certainly grab the attention of many investors, but do its recent returns compare favorably to the sector as a whole? Let's take a closer look at the stock's year-to-date performance to find out.\n\nAmphenol is a member of the Computer and Technology sector. This group includes 618 individual stocks and currently holds a Zacks Sector Rank of #11.

        "title": "3 Quantum Stocks to Buy Before the Masses Mobilize",
        "content": "AI is still the talk of the town, but prudent investors know when to look forward and seek new catalysts for the next technological breakthrough—and quantum computing is fast becoming the next big thing. Thanks to the potential to accelerate current computing technologies, the sector is slowly gaining traction, and keen-eyed investors are already looking for quantum stocks to buy.\n\nTo the uninitiated, quantum computing aims to utilize the law of quantum mechanics to increase computer calculation speeds by a factor of millions or even billions. However, the technology in its current form is not yet commercially viable, though remember, people said the same thing about AI a few years ago.\n\nThe opportunity lies here: companies are joining the quantum race, and many will eventually strike gold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s look at three quantum computing-related stocks that can get you front-row seats to the latest technological revolution—and the returns that come with it. To get my list, I used the following criteria to screen for companies operating in the quantum computing market:\n\nPositive YOY growth in full-year operating cash flow, A high percentage of revenue is spent on R&D.\n\nI sorted the list based on the R&D expense-to-revenue ratio from highest to lowest to find companies willing to bet the farm and win the race.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, everyone knows the tech giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, many may not be aware of its continuous success in breaking through the constraints of being just another online store.\n\nThe company has taken different paths in building its tech empire. Amazon Web Services, its metered, pay-as-you-go API, and on-demand cloud computing have seen some success. They also offer Braket Direct, a platform that allows researchers and software developers to reserve and utilize quantum computing technologies.\n\nAmazon also announced a quantum computing chip late last year that can reduce potential errors in computational processes by a factor of 100 (or 99% in layman’s terms). This is an incredibly important stride in quantum computing, as the increased computation speeds can result in increased errors.\n\nAmazon’s R&D spending, tagged as “Technology and infrastructure” in its financials, seems to be bearing fruit. It reached $85.62 billion in FY’23, representing 14.89% of its total revenue. In addition, the company’s operating cash flow grew from $46.75 billion to $84.95 billion—more than enough to spend on its quantum computing efforts. This makes Amazon one of the most attractive quantum stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is one of the biggest tech giants today and among several that stand at the forefront of modern technology.\n\nThe company is no stranger to innovation. Alphabet recently entered the AI arena with Gemini, a generative AI based on the multimodal large language models of the same name. While Gemini is still catching up to ChatGPT, the company’s efforts in quantum computing are a whole other story waiting to be told.\n\nSycamore, a quantum processor developed by Google’s Artificial Intelligence division, claims to have reached “quantum supremacy” by completing a task in 200 seconds that would take 10,000 years on a classical supercomputer. The company reached a significant milestone in 2023 after reducing logical qubit error rates to 10-2.\n\nAlphabet also launched XPRIZE, a global competition to develop quantum computing algorithms that can demonstrate problem-solving capabilities for real-world applications. Coupled with its long-term goal of building a one million-qubit supercomputer that could hasten the race towards quantum computing, real-life application may be just around the corner. Investors looking into quantum stocks to buy can’t go wrong with GOOGL.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet spent $45.43 billion on research and development, or 14.77% of its total revenue. During the same period, its operating cash flow grew from $91.49 billion to $101.75 billion.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnyone working in a corporate setting may have encountered International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) at least once daily. The company is famous for its hardware and software products in many corporate offices and businesses. However, there is more to what they do.\n\nIBM is a strong proponent of the development of quantum computing. In 2023, the company published a paper claiming it had developed a quantum error-correcting code 10 times more efficient than previously established methods. It also laid out a roadmap for quantum computing, showcasing its commitment to developing the technology.\n\nThe company also has a long-standing partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to accelerate quantum computing research, workforce development, and education in New York. This partnership unveiled the world’s first-ever IBM quantum computer in the university’s Voorhees Computing Center Chapel. It partnered with the University of Melbourne and released the Qiskit quantum computing software stack.\n\nIn 2023, the company allocated around 11.31% of its revenue to research & development. Meanwhile, IBM’s cash flow increased from $10.43 billion to $19.93 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford held long positions in AMZN and GOOGL.

        "content": "Apple's (AAPL) steering rules in its App Store marketplace are in breach of the European Commission's new digital competition law, the regulator said Monday while also opening a second probe into contract terms for developers. \r\n\r\nThe European Union's executive arm found the technology giant prevents app developers from informing consumers about alternative channels for offers and content outside its main app store, free of cost. The practice is an infringement of the commission's Digital Markets Act, which was launched in March and aims to ensure a level playing field in the digital sector.\n\nThe regulator first launched its probe into the iPhone maker in March and said it was also looking at Facebook parent Meta Platforms (META) and Google parent Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) for similar violations. Apple didn't immediately respond to MT Newswires' e-mailed request for comment. \r\n\r\n\"Our preliminary position is that Apple does not fully allow steering,\" Margrethe Vestager, executive vice president of competition policy, said in a statement. \"Steering is key to ensure that app developers are less dependent on gatekeepers' app stores and for consumers to be aware of better offers.\" \r\n\r\nApple now has the possibility to \"exercise its rights of defense\" and respond. The regulator will need to make a final decision on the company's compliance by March next year and could fine it up to 10% of its worldwide turnover if found guilty. There is a potential for the penalty to increase to as much as 20% in case of repeated violations.\r\n\r\nThe commission opened another probe into Apple's new contractual terms for third-party app developers on the App Store. It is examining whether the company's so-called core technology fee of 0.50 euros ($0.54) per installed app complies with the Digital Markets Act and if it has made it too difficult for users to install and download other app stores or apps on its iPhones.\r\n\r\n\"We are also opening a new case in relation to Apple's new business terms for iOS,\" Thierry Breton, commissioner for internal market, said. \"Without prejudice to Apple's right of defence, we are determined to use the clear and effective DMA toolbox to finally open real opportunities for innovators and for consumers.\"\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How to invest in AI as the rally continues",
        "content": "Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the AI rally. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to significantly influence equity market gains, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) contributing to 64% of the global equity market’s growth in total return terms in the past 18 months.\n\nNotably, chipmaker Nvidia became the largest listed company globally in June. Additionally, 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies mentioned “AI” in their first-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet data. Here’s how investors can seize the AI opportunity, according to UBS.\n\nNvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the split increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation, it does not change the company’s overall value. “Splitting the stock shouldn’t create economic value in theory, but it will make the company more accessible to smaller investors,” Morningstar technology equity strategist Brian Colello, explained.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said: “AI looks set to remain a key driver of equity market returns. We see opportunities in the enabling layer of the AI value chain and in vertically integrated megacaps.”\n\nSignificant investments are being directed towards AI, particularly at semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend approximately $200bn (£158bn) in the sector, a 35% increase over 2023, according to FactSet consensus. For this level of capital expenditure to be justified, AI use cases need to scale up significantly, UBS said.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nPotential applications span advertising, customer service, personal and coding assistants, R&D, cybersecurity, and more. However, AI-linked revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill AI justify the hype?\n\nUBS expects robust capital investment in AI to continue, driving strong earnings growth for companies within the enabling layer of the value chain. For instance, the Swiss bank expects earnings in the global semiconductor industry to rise by 50% this year and 25% in 2025. As the AI ecosystem expands, annual capital expenditure for the enabling layer could reach $331bn by 2027.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Apple, Bitcoin, Target and PepsiCo\n\nHowever, potential risks include the possibility of overcapacity in components like graphics processing units, custom chips, or memory if there’s a lack of significant model advancements or consumer/business uptake.\n\nThe AI value chain: three critical layers\n\nTo understand AI’s potential, UBS breaks down its value chain, comprising of three layers:\n\nEnabling Layer: Includes semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Intelligence Layer: Consists of large language models. Application Layer: Encompasses companies providing AI services for specific use cases, such as copilots and coding assistants.\n\nThe tech capex surge has primarily benefited the enabling layer. While fears of overcapacity could introduce volatility, this segment currently enjoys strong investment rates, offering a mix of attractive earnings growth profiles, competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway. UBS suggests focusing on semiconductor companies leading the AI infrastructure investments at data centres.\n\nMoreover, the AI investment landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major players.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\n“Over time, we expect the AI market to be dominated by an oligopoly of vertically integrated “foundries” and monolithic players along the value chain. So, alongside semiconductors, we also think investors should position in the oligopolies that are present across the entire technology stack, covering chips, cloud computing, and generative AI models and applications. We think these companies will be well positioned to navigate potential shifts in the competitive landscape in different parts of the value chain,” UBS wrote in its CIO 2H outlook.\n\nAI rally: China or US?\n\nWhile the US has seen the greatest benefits from the AI rally, UBS notes that China's tech giants remain undervalued, trading at similar levels as before ChatGPT's launch. Despite challenges like tariffs, export controls, and local regulations, China’s tech leaders are heavily investing in AI.\n\n“Ultimately, we expect China to develop an AI ecosystem that is distinct from that in much of the rest of the world. This should lead to significant monetisation potential for China’s AI giants,” UBS said.\n\nIs a company riskier than a country?\n\nThe market capitalisation of AI chipmaker Nvidia recently surpassed $3.3trn, more than double Switzerland’s entire blue-chip stock index and significantly more than China’s CSI 300. This raises questions about the risks of holding a single company versus a country-level index.\n\nWhile individual companies are generally more volatile, not participating in the returns these companies generate could pose a greater risk to investors’ wealth over time, according to the Swiss bank.\n\nInvestors should seek quality growth\n\nFinally, UBS said investors should focus on global quality wealth compounders—companies with a competitive edge, pricing power, and high barriers to entry. Such businesses, with a track record of disciplined capital allocation, strong balance sheets, and consistent profit growth, offer long-term sustainable value.\n\nQuality growth, often driven by structural growth themes like sustainable development, energy transition, and water scarcity, should be a core component of investors’ equity holdings, UBS added.\n\nWatch: Nvidia will remain dominant for next 3-5 years: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\\\">NVDA</a>) has reached<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-became-3t-company-133118501.html\\\"> a $3 trillion market capitalization,</a> surpassing Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\\\">AAPL</a>) to become the second most valuable company in the US. The company's success has been propelled by the continued excitement around artificial intelligence. However, questions linger about the sustainability of this growth trajectory.</p>\\n<p>Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton joins the Morning Brief to share his perspective on Nvidia's soaring valuation. While acknowledging that the current market dynamics might appear \\\"a little scary on the chart,\\\" Clinton believes that the AI rally is still in its early stages, and investors will continue to feel uneasy until the markets reach a point of being in a \\\"true AI bubble.\\\"</p>\\n<p>As Nvidia gears up for its highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split, Clinton highlights the company's ability to \\\"continue to show business momentum,\\\" a testament to its resilience and adaptability in the face of rapidly evolving market conditions.</p>\\n<p>However, amid the AI frenzy, Clinton raises a question: \\\"Can Nvidia maintain its dominant position, providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models?

The fines can rise to 20% in the event the offence is repeated, the EU said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\nThis is the first time the commission has levelled a formal accusation against a tech firm under the new rules, after opening the first Digital Markets Act (DMA) probes into Apple, Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) in March.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin was trading lower on Monday as the crypto market recorded its second-worst weekly drop of 2024 amid cooling demand for crypto ETFs.\n\nBitcoin has now fallen below $63,000 (£49,750), nursing steep losses over the past week as traders grew sceptical over the timing of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFor some analysts, the retreat in digital assets is a warning sign for broader risk appetite, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is at a more than one-month low, hurt by a six-day streak of outflows from US ETFs for the token.\n\nBitcoin hit a record of $73,798 in March but is trailing traditional assets such stocks, bonds and gold this quarter.\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nShares in Target were higher in pre-market trading as investors welcomed the announcement that the retailer plans to rolls out a new AI tool to improve productivity and growth.\n\nThe retailer said it would roll out its gen AI-powered chatbot, Store Companion, by August, giving its associates at its early 2,000 stores a tool that can “answer on-the-job process questions, coach new team members, support store operations management and more.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chatbot will be accessible via an app on handheld devices issued to store personnel, offering instant answers to procedural questions.\n\nRead more: 'How I built £100m bathroom business Plumbworld'\n\nTarget is the latest US retailer to announce that it plans to use AI to support its customers and frontline workers.

The latest offer valued the company at £3.1bn.\n\nCarlsberg now has until 19 July to make a firm offer for the tonic maker or walk away from the deal.\n\nWatch: Amazon is a top pick: Wedbush analyst on digital advertising<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN\\\">AMZN</a>) could be going through its own post-COVID \\\"Renaissance period,\\\" according to Wedbush Securities Equity Research <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-wedbush-bullish-trade-desks-202748336.html\\\">Managing Director Scott Devitt</a>.</p>\\n<p>Devitt joins Yahoo Finance's Market Domination, commenting on Amazon's reaccelerating growth in the digital advertising space. </p>\\n<p>\\\"What you're finding is these data repositories of media content are now being brought to life,\\\" Devitt tells Yahoo Finance. \\\"And that's going to continue to enhance the advertising models as these retail companies — some of which do it directly, like Amazon — providing their own demand-side platform for their retail media inventory to third party advertisers and many retailers that don't have the capacity to do that.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Yahoo Finance has been interviewing the top executives in advertising and creative marketing across industries at the 2024 <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/event/cannes/\\\">Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity</a>.</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mortgage-rates-slip-ai-stocks-173711756.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Market Domination.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/luke-carberry-mogan/\\\"><em>Luke Carberry Mogan</em></a><em>.</em>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MhjMqI35nKwmWN_tc4B6DA--~B/aD0zMzEzO3c9NTg4NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/1cc62730-2fe1-11ef-aa5b-305cef7d4833\",\"duration\":\"PT1M51S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/59a2bfe2-b155-3bea-8ead-73692323d694.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-top-pick-wedbush-analyst-120037979.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"59a2bfe2-b155-3bea-8ead-73692323d694\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Wedbush analysts believe the market is starting to recognize that with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence on the horizon, Apple’s “AI-driven super cycle is about to begin.”\n\nAccording to the investment firm, tech giants like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely need to integrate their AI models into Apple Intelligence, as Apple's iOS ecosystem, encompassing 2.2 billion devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, holds the keys to this vast market.\n\n“We expect developers over the next 6 to 12 months will build hundreds of generative AI-driven apps that will be key ingredients in the recipe for success for Apple as its technology stack creates the core building blocks of the consumer AI tidal wave we see coming starting with iPhone 16 in mid-September,” analysts wrote.\n\nApple’s partnership with OpenAI paves the way for developers worldwide to focus on iOS 18, creating numerous monetization opportunities for the iPhone maker, analysts noted.\n\nThey believe the market is underestimating the potential impact, estimating incremental high-margin Services growth of $10 billion annually for Apple. This partnership is expected to launch a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream, driven by both hardware and software.\n\nWedbush also pointed out that signs of iPhone stabilization are emerging based on recent supply chain checks in Asia, which bodes well for the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle. After a better-than-expected March quarter, optimism for iPhone growth is appearing in various markets.\n\nThe firm expects that June will mark the last negative growth quarter for China, with a growth turnaround expected to begin in the September quarter.\n\n“China remains the linchpin of growth for Apple and now this key region is set to see growth once again starting with iPhone 16 in our view,” it said in a note, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush: Apple AI-driven super cycle about to begin\n\nRXO to buy UPSâ€™s Coyote Logistics for $1 billion, shares surge\n\nItaly's Eni likely to finalise Enilive stake sale by year-end, CEO says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is in “a league of its own,” BTIG analysts said in a note released Sunday.\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares have recently traded approximately 100% above its 200-day moving average (DMA). According to BTIG, this is unprecedented, as the widest spread any U.S. company has ever traded above its 200 DMA while holding the position of the largest company was 80%, achieved by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in March 2000, marking its all-time high.\n\nJust like NVDA this time, Cisco also briefly surpassed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in March 2000 to become the world’s most valuable company.\n\n“While we fully recognize the fundamentals are much different this time around, in the last five years, NVDA is +4,280% compared to CSCO's +4,460% gain in the five years leading up to its peak,” BTIG analysts highlighted.\n\n“Over the last 18 months, NVDA is +827% which is actually double that of CSCO's 18-month gain into '00,” they continued.\n\nMore broadly, there have been significant inflows into large-cap tech and growth funds, suggesting a potential market froth following the recent run, BTIG noted.\n\nLooking ahead, the investment firm said it remains concerned about a potential near-term unwind of many year-to-date leaders. However, they also note that within the Magnificent 7, group, there is some dispersion, with stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) still appearing constructive and not overly stretched.\n\n“If the SPX is going to avoid a bigger pullback into July, bulls need to see continued rotation below the surface,” analysts concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia is 'in a league of its own,' BTIG says\n\nHyundai Motor's union in South Korea votes to strike\n\nChina wants EU to remove tariffs on EVs by July 4 as talks resume\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Warren Buffett Doesn't Own Nvidia. Here's How He's Profited From the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock's Big Gains Anyway",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and tech stocks go together like...well, they usually don't go together. The legendary investor typically avoids stocks that are out of his wheelhouse. And tech isn't his strong suit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett doesn't own a single share of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). So, has he missed out on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock's massive gains over the last few years? Not entirely.\n\nBuffett's direct ways of profiting from Nvidia\n\nAlthough Buffett doesn't own any shares of Nvidia, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio includes two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do. As a result, he has directly profited as Nvidia stock has skyrocketed.\n\nNvidia was added to the S&P 500 in 2001, replacing the beleaguered energy company Enron. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Berkshire initiated positions in two S&P 500 index ETFs -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). The conglomerate hasn't sold shares of either ETF since then.\n\nGranted, Buffett hasn't directly profited very much from Nvidia's gains via Berkshire's stakes in these two S&P 500 index ETFs. For one thing, Berkshire owns only small positions in the funds -- 39,400 shares of the SPDR ETF and 43,000 shares of the Vanguard ETF. These holdings comprise less than 0.1% of Berkshire's total portfolio. For several years, Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has also owned positions too small to move the needle much in both ETFs.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia makes up only 7.25% of the S&P 500, which is weighted based on market cap. When Berkshire first bought the two S&P 500 ETFs in late 2019, the AI stock had a much smaller weight than it does now.\n\nHow the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has indirectly profited from Nvidia\n\nBuffett has indirectly profited from Nvidia's remarkable rise, too. Exactly how he's done so requires some deductive analysis.\n\nLet's start with the fact that the stocks of the leading cloud services providers have performed exceptionally well recently. Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), whose Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud service platform, skyrocketed 81% last year and more than 20% year to date. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) stock jumped 57% in 2023 and is up almost 20% this year. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which operates Google Cloud, has seen its shares soar 58% last year and more than 25% so far in 2024.\n\nThere's no question that the AI boom, especially with the surging adoption of generative AI, has been a key factor in the performance of all three cloud stocks. Importantly, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are major customers of Nvidia. The three companies almost certainly wouldn't have been able to handle the increased demand for cloud services with Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think it's fair to say, therefore, that Nvidia is partly responsible for the share price gains experienced by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, how much of those gains can be attributed to Nvidia is hard to determine.\n\nSo, how does this tie in with Buffett? First, Berkshire owns 10 million shares of Amazon. Second, NEAM (Berkshire's subsidiary) owns positions in Alphabet and Microsoft. Third, all three cloud stocks are also key holdings of Berkshire's two S&P 500 index ETFs.\n\nYou might have made money from Nvidia in the same ways\n\nIt's possible (and perhaps even probable) that you're in the same position as Buffett -- profiting from Nvidia without owning the stock. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the largest ETF based on assets under management, while the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ranks third. Even if you don't own either ETF, your investment portfolio could include one or more other ETFs or mutual funds with positions in Nvidia.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are also widely owned stocks. You could either directly own some or all of them or own funds with stakes in the megacap stocks.\n\nTo be sure, these ways of making money from Nvidia aren't nearly as rewarding as owning shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker. But it could at least provide some consolation for investors who have kicked themselves for not buying Nvidia sooner. It also underscores one of the advantages of investing in S&P 500 index ETFs: Big winners like Nvidia garner increasingly higher weights in the index as their market caps grow -- and can make you more money in the process.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Will Alphabet Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2025?",
        "content": "Alphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stock has rallied by more than 40% over the past 12 months and is currently hovering near its all-time high. The tech giant impressed investors with the accelerating growth of its advertising and cloud businesses, a new $70 billion share buyback plan, and the approval of its first-ever dividend.\n\nThose positive developments somewhat allayed investors concerns about Alphabet's slower progress in the artificial intelligence (AI) market relative to its peers, but it is still overshadowed by Nvidia, which rallied by more than 210% over the past 12 months as the market's demand for its AI accelerator chips outstripped its ability to supply them. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nNvidia also surpassed Alphabet's market cap for the first time this year. As of this writing, Nvidia is worth $3.3 trillion while Alphabet is worth $2.2 trillion. But could Alphabet accelerate and overtake Nvidia again by the end of 2025?\n\nHas Alphabet overcome its near-term challenges?\n\nAlphabet generates most of its revenue from Google's advertising business, which includes its search and display ads, network ads, and YouTube. The rest of its revenue mainly comes from Google Cloud, the world's third-largest cloud infrastructure platform, as well as Google's subscription, platforms, and devices division.\n\nAlphabet's revenue only rose 10% in 2022 as concerns about the macroeconomic outlook led many companies to rein in their marketing and cloud spending. The company also faced stiff competition from Meta Platforms and ByteDance in the advertising market, and it seemed to struggle against Amazon and Microsoft in the cloud market. But over the past year, all three of Alphabet's core businesses warmed up again.\n\nMetric Q1 2023 Q2 2023 Q3 2023 Q4 2023 Q1 2024 Google advertising revenue growth (YOY) 0% 3% 9% 11% 13% Google subscriptions, platforms, and devices revenue growth (YOY) 9% 24% 21% 23% 18% Google cloud revenue growth (YOY) 28% 28% 22% 26% 28% Total revenue growth (YOY) 3% 7% 11% 13% 15%\n\nData source: Alphabet. YOY = Year-over-year.\n\nGoogle's advertising business recovered as rising sales for YouTube and search-based ads offset declining ad network revenues. Its cloud growth accelerated as it rolled out over a thousand new products and features, and it continued to expand its Gemini generative AI platform.\n\nGoogle's subscriptions, platforms, and devices segment also locked in more subscribers. As of the end of the first quarter of 2024, YouTube Premium and Music had reached 100 million global subscribers, YouTube TV hit 8 million subscribers, and Google One surpassed 100 million subscribers. Those expansions should widen the company's moat and reduce its dependence on ads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's outlook\n\nAlphabet could benefit from several tailwinds over the next three years. The macroeconomic environment could improve as the Fed cuts interest rates, which would likely lead to companies spending more money on its ads and cloud services again. The ban of TikTok in the U.S., which will take effect next January unless ByteDance sells its U.S. subsidiary, could drive more users to YouTube.\n\nBut it also faces tough challenges. It's struggling to make headway in the generative AI space, where its offerings aren't as impressive as those of Microsoft and OpenAI. The upcoming launch of Apple's  generative AI ecosystem could reduce the amount of revenue Google earns from ads displayed to users of Apple devices -- even though Google pays Apple billions of dollars each year to remain its default search engine. Also, Alphabet still faces ongoing antitrust and privacy probes in the U.S., Europe, and other regions.\n\nFrom 2023 to 2026, analysts expect Alphabet's revenue to grow at a compound annual rate of 11% as its EPS increases at a compound annual rate of 20%. Based on those estimates, which seem realistic relative to its past growth rates, its stock looks reasonably valued at 23 times forward earnings.\n\nIf Alphabet meets those expectations and trades at the same forward earnings multiple at the end of 2025, its stock price would have risen 30% to about $228, boosting its market cap to $2.9 trillion -- but that would still be below where Nvidia sits today. Nvidia will also likely keep growing as the AI chip market expands.\n\nLet's not compare apples to oranges\n\nAlphabet and Nvidia are both \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks, but they operate in different industries and have different business models. Alphabet is a top play on the digital advertising and cloud markets, while Nvidia is the leader in AI and gaming GPUs. So instead of wondering if Alphabet will become more valuable than Nvidia again, investors should focus on its macro, competitive, and regulatory challenges. If it resolves those issues, it should remain a solid long-term investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\n\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\n\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\n\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\n\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\n\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\n\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\n\nA user's hands typing a search query into a Google Search box, emphasizing the company's search capabilities.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 222\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is a global household name due to its variety of products such as Google Search, YouTube, and Gmail. The bulk of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s fortunes are because of its dominance in the global search engine industry and lucrative deals with firms like Apple that make Search the default platform on thousands of devices. Additionally, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is also a key player in the AI software industry, and its models compete with big ticket players such as the Microsoft backed OpenAI. Any threats to Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s dominance in Search, any alternative products by customers, and a shift in global use cases to AI that's not developed by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) could be bad news for the firm.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. The firm wasn't particularly worried about the technology giant losing its dominant status in the market. Here is what the firm said:\n\nDuring the quarter, we initiated a position in Alphabet Inc., the parent company of Google, the world’s largest search and online advertising company. Alphabet has over 90% market share in its core Google search business, it owns the world’s leading video platform, YouTube (which has over 2 billion users), a competitive cloud service provider, Google Cloud, a leading ad network, and optionality in a number of smaller subsidiaries like the autonomous vehicle company, Waymo.\n\nGoogle’s core search business continues to grow at a solid clip, and we believe it could structurally earn much higher margins than it does today as the company increases operating efficiency. Google Cloud should also continue growing in the healthy double digits for years to come given the relatively early stage of cloud adoption with $597 billion total cloud spending14 in 2023 out of worldwide IT spending of $4.7 trillion15, or around 13%. Additionally, YouTube has a long runway for growth, driven by the growing adoption of connected TV and the shift of advertising dollars from linear TV.\n\nWhen ChatGPT originally came out in November 2022, it appeared that Google was caught a bit unprepared for a potential change in the way people search. While the advancements of GenAI represent a risk to Google, we believe investors underappreciate the company’s positioning in AI and have assigned too high of a probability that the risk materializes. Alphabet owns the largest consumer training datasets (particularly across Search and YouTube), which in our view are important ingredients for competitive advantages in AI, it has massive user distribution (nine products with over 1 billion users each), long-standing AI research labs (DeepMind and Google Brain), top AI/ML engineering talent (Google invented the transformer AI architecture16, which is the basis for the modern LLMs including Chat GPT), a solid cloud computing division in Google Cloud, and deep pockets for investing in AI.\n\nOverall GOOGL ranks 4th on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Winners and 2 Losers From Apple's Latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Announcement",
        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week sparked a new interest in the stock and caused it to notch fresh all-time highs. However, there are a few winners and losers associated with its primary announcement about Apple Intelligence and its general take on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo, who are the winners and losers of this conference? The answers may surprise you.\n\nWinner 1: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTo me, there is a clear winner in this announcement: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi's business is already doing well, but it just got a catalyst. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, sales from Apple made up 26%, 23%, and 25% of TSMC's revenue, respectively. The smartphone business has struggled recently, but that could turn around quickly.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence will only be available for iPhone 15 models and newer, it isolates about 90% of iPhone users with an older generation. If Apple Intelligence becomes the latest must-have technology, it could ignite a new demand for iPhones.\n\nWith a large chunk of Taiwan Semi's revenue coming from this business, it would stand to benefit.\n\nWinner 2: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also a huge beneficiary of this announcement. Because Apple chose to partner with OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT), it selected the company that Microsoft has heavily invested in. This also validates its use of ChatGPT throughout its Microsoft Office suite, as it will create a fairly seamless experience for the millions of people who use Office products and iPhones daily.\n\nWhile the plan is for iPhones to run most of these workloads on the smartphones themselves, some of it may have to be outsourced to servers due to the arduous nature of the AI model. When that occurs, it will happen on Microsoft Azure servers because that's where OpenAI has run its technology. This will also serve as an increased revenue stream for Microsoft.\n\nLoser 1: Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Google's parent company, finds itself on the wrong side. Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, competes with ChatGPT. Apple could have chosen Gemini as the model to run its Apple Intelligence on, as it would have been a logical continuation of its partnership.\n\nThis breaks a tradition of Google and Alphabet working together -- the Google search engine is the default one on Apple products because Alphabet pays for it. Recently, this was the subject of an antitrust lawsuit, which may have influenced Apple's decision to choose ChatGPT over Gemini.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, Gemini isn't Apple's pick for its Apple Intelligence, and that's a lost opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nLoser 2: Apple\n\nMy last loser is Apple, which may come as a surprise. Apple will likely see a surge in demand for its iPhones, which will increase sales. But that's not the point I'm trying to make.\n\nApple is a massive company with resources few can dream of having. It has armies of software engineers and more than $60 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of the end of its fiscal second quarter (ended March 30). Yet, it couldn't make its own generative AI model in-house?\n\nThis shows how far behind Apple is in the AI race, as it was caught completely off guard. Because of its partnership with an external company, there will always be questions about data security and what information is being shared with other companies. If it kept that in-house, those questions wouldn't be as relevant.\n\nInstead, this could be the Achilles' heel of a product that otherwise seems solid. Although Apple will likely see increased sales, the long-term ramifications of not bringing this technology in-house could be problematic for Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks I'd Buy Over Nvidia Right Now",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is a great artificial intelligence (AI) stock. However, it has gotten a bit expensive from a valuation standpoint, which has some investors looking elsewhere for AI investments. I'm in that camp, but fortunately, plenty of AI companies are worth buying right now.\n\nTwo that come to mind are Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Adobe (NASDAQ: ADBE). Both companies' shares are trading at reasonable valuations, and both are always fantastic businesses.\n\nGenerative AI has been a huge technology shift for both companies\n\nAlphabet is better known by its former name, Google. For many years, it has been investing in its AI capabilities, and that is starting to pay off. The most noteworthy area is its generative AI platform, Gemini. Gemini is already being used for multiple purposes, including creating ads for clients, summarizing search results, and assisting developers in writing code.\n\nThe tech giant is also seeing strong demand in its cloud computing wing: Google Cloud. While many companies want to utilize AI, few have the computing power to create a model tailored to their business. Furthermore, buying a supercomputer to create one would be overkill, so they rent computing power from a provider like Google Cloud. Many generative AI start-ups have done this, as it is a more efficient use of capital. Among its client base are some of the hottest start-ups, including 60% of funded generative AI start-ups and 90% of generative AI unicorns (private companies with valuations above $1 billion).\n\nBy creating an ecosystem filled with AI tools, Alphabet has created a fantastic offering for anyone looking to develop and implement AI into a business.\n\nAdobe is another avid provider of AI tools, although it's tackling the digital media market. Its generative AI tools have cut down on the time needed to create media assets, and allow users to create images tailored to the viewer. Adobe is also innovating in the document space, where its conversational AI can read documents and answer questions related to their contents.\n\nWhile there were questions about whether Adobe might be out of touch in today's day of AI, its strong results in its fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended May 31, removed those concerns. Adobe exceeded its guidance on both revenue and earnings per share, and raised its revenue guidance for the year.\n\nAdobe is taking advantage of the new demand wave that AI is bringing, and it can also be purchased at a steep discount to its average historical valuation.\n\nBoth stocks are reasonably priced for their growth\n\nBoth stocks are trading at much more reasonable prices than Nvidia. Because there is so much change going on with both companies, I'll use the forward price-to-earnings ratio to gauge their valuations.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough Adobe popped after its latest earnings report, the stock is still valued below where it has traded over the past year. ADBE PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAlthough some may consider a valuation of 29 times forward earnings pricey, Adobe has consistently been one of the top performers in the market and has earned its premium.\n\nAlphabet, meanwhile, is even cheaper. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAlthough 23 times forward earnings is near the top of where Alphabet has traded this past year, it's still cheap from a broader market perspective. The S&P 500 currently trades at 22.1 times forward earnings, which means Alphabet barely carries any premium to the broader market.\n\nConsidering Alphabet's success and track record, it's still a phenomenal buy at these prices.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Adobe right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Adobe wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Nvidia's 'gravy train' could come to 'screeching halt' after a volatile trading week",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) stock went on a wild ride this week as shares reversed direction from all-time highs and Wall Street continued to debate how much more the chip giant can add to its record-setting rally.\n\n\"The stock's steep climb makes it vulnerable to profit taking, but we argue any volatility [is] likely to be short-lived,\" Bank of America wrote on Thursday. The bank reiterated its Buy rating and $150 price target, calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\n\nThe chipmaker, which briefly dethroned Microsoft (MSFT) as the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, saw its market cap edge lower on Friday to sit at around $3.12 trillion, below Microsoft's $3.33 trillion.\n\nPatrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance on Friday that investors should be watchful for signs of a pullback.\n\nWhile he said he doesn't see the status quo of Nvidia's dominance changing over the next six to nine months, investors should focus on \"the downstream profitability that people in the ecosystem are making or not making.\"\n\n\"These are the software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow. Because if those enterprises and those consumers aren't paying more for these new AI features, then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, like we saw in the internet bust,\" he explained.\n\nIncreased competition could also serve as a headwind to pricing power, Moorhead warned, as Nvidia competes with not only \"merchant silicon providers\" like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) but also \"homegrown ones\" from Amazon's AWS (AMZN), Microsoft's Azure (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, Sunday, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe flurry of AI investment has continued to boost optimism over Nvidia's growth rate. In its latest earnings, the company reported adjusted earnings that surged 461% year over year while revenue grew by 262%.\n\nIn addition to stellar earnings, Nvidia also completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10 and doubled its quarterly cash dividend — a move that's been echoed by other tech giants in recent quarters.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up about 200% over the last 12 months and more than 3,200% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained around 160%.\n\nBut despite its sky-high valuation, the case for $4 trillion has been building.\n\n\"I don't see any reason it couldn't get up to $4 trillion,\" Moorhead said. \"A lot of this is based on expectations because you look at the price to earnings ratio, it's pretty astronomical. And if we can see some positive signs from the downstream players...[I] don't see any reason why this couldn't get to $4 trillion.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, writing in a note to clients on Thursday: \"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\"\n\nIves said the AI revolution is a party that is \"just getting started,\" driven by the pace of data center spending by tech giants. He expects incremental AI spend to hit $1 trillion over the next decade with over 70% of enterprises ultimately heading down the AI use case path.\n\n\"Its 9pm in a party going till 4am with the rest of the tech world now joining,\" he said.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 26.4% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 26.1%. It is benefiting from the robust performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel, and its first-party web apps.\r\n\r\nYouTube is playing a vital role in driving Google Services prospects. The company is continuously expanding YouTube capabilities thereby enhancing user experience\r\n\r\nPer a 9to5Google report, Alphabet introduced a redesign for YouTube Music on the web. This redesign features a dual-column layout with album information displayed on the left and songs displayed on the right. It also adds a blurred background for a lively experience.\r\n\r\nGoogle also bolstered its YouTube Music capabilities with the addition of a new feature that remembers the last played song and allows quick playback. This quality-of-life change retains the docked player and Up Next queue for albums and playlists, allowing immediate playback.\r\n\r\nPartnerships are playing a key role in expanding YouTube Music’s adoption rate. Alphabet recently collaborated with Garmin GRMN to expand its reach to more platforms.\r\n\r\nThe YouTube Music app is now available on Garmin IQ Connect smartwatches. The app experience is similar to Wear OS watches, with users able to search their library for music and podcasts and a slick playing page with physical buttons for play, pause, and skip.\r\n\r\nGrowing YouTube Music efforts are helping Alphabet capitalize on solid growth opportunities present in the music streaming market, which, per a Grand View Research report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 14.4% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nMoreover, these would also aid Alphabet in narrowing down the gap with Spotify SPOT, which holds a dominant position in the music streaming market.\r\n\r\nPer a Statista report, Spotify retains its position as the leading player in 2023, with its market share based on subscribers being approximately 32%.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nOther YouTube Efforts to Note\n\nIn addition to YouTube Music, Alphabet is taking continuous strides to boost its overall YouTube capabilities.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the company’s latest Cast menu redesign of the YouTube app. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also expanded its YouTube Create video editing app for Android to 13 more countries, including Australia, Brazil, Spain, and the United States. The app simplifies short-form video creation for creators from various regions, eliminating the need for high-end computers and file transfers.\r\n\r\nGoogle partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON to further strengthen its YouTube business. This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription to watch content while on their machine.\r\n\r\nThese endeavors will continue expanding YouTube’s overall subscribers. In the first quarter of 2024, YouTube surpassed 100 million Music and Premium subscribers globally. YouTube TV recorded more than eight million paid subscribers in the same quarter.\r\n\r\nStrength in YouTube on the back of its robust portfolio and expanding partner base will, in turn, continue aiding Alphabet’s Google Services segment performance, which is the key growth driver of the company.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the Google Services segment increased 13.6% year over year to $70.4 billion, which accounted for 87.4% of the total revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nWe believe Alphabet’s strength in the Google Services Segment, coupled with its robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google’s mobile search and strengthening generative AI capabilities, make it an attractive stock for investors at the current level.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has remained unchanged in the past 7 days.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 21.82X compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry’s 22.41X.\r\n\r\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- OpenAI has bought Rockset, an enterprise search and analytics startup, marking the most significant acquisition to date for the high-profile artificial intelligence company. The ChatGPT maker said Friday that it plans to integrate Rockset’s technology to help business customers and developers make better use of their data on OpenAI’s platform. Some members of Rockset’s team will also be joining OpenAI. Terms of the deal were not disclosed. OpenAI is in a tight race with rivals such as Anthropic and Alphabet Inc.’s Google to build the most capable AI models and package them with compelling services that can be sold to businesses.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Alphabet, NVIDIA, Micron Technology, Vistra and CenterPoint Energy",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 21, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Micron Technology, Inc. MU, Vistra Corp. VST and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. CNP.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nEasing Inflation Paves Way for September Rate Cut: 5 Winners\n\nConsumer price pressures eased in May, thanks to a drop in gasoline prices that more than offset a dogged rise in shelter prices. The Labor Department stated that the consumer price index (CPI) held flat last month as inflationary pressure loosened its grip on the U.S. economy.\n\nFrom a year ago, the CPI nevertheless increased 3.3%. But it's still less than April's yearly rise of 3.4% and way less than the pandemic-era peak of 9.1% in 2022, the highest level since 1981.\n\nCore CPI, which doesn't consider the volatile fuel and food costs, also saw its monthly and yearly increase falling short of estimates. Core CPI's annual rate declined to 3.4%, a fresh three-year low, as transportation service prices dropped for the first time in May since 2021, and vehicle insurance prices fell following a sharp rise in the prior two months.\n\nProducer prices, meanwhile, dropped surprisingly last month, a tell-tale sign that inflation is subsiding. The producer price index fell 0.2% month over month in May, following an advance of 0.5% in April.\n\nThis is a tell-tale sign that the Federal Reserve will remain less aggressive with its monetary policy and won't be hiking interest rates this year. In reality, the Fed has kept interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting and is projecting one rate cut this year, preferably in September. The CME FedWatch Tool at present shows that 57.9% of market participants expect a quarter-point interest rate cut in the September meeting.\n\nNow, interest rate hikes are intended to curb consumer outlays and control inflation. But the latest dip in retail sales in May has shown that consumers are already feeling the burden of higher interest rates. Thus, it's widely expected that the Fed will trim interest rates as early as the fall, which is undeniably a blessing in disguise for tech stocks. This is because a tech company's cash inflows aren't impacted in a low-interest-rate environment. Moreover, interest rate cuts reduce the cost of borrowing and boost profit margins.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, a lower interest rate scenario bodes well for capital-intensive utility companies as it decreases their debt level and helps them pay off their dues and notch profits. This calls for investing in stocks such as Alphabet Inc., NVIDIA Corporation, Micron Technology, Inc., Vistra Corp. and CenterPoint Energy, Inc. at the moment. The stocks boast a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).

        "title": "A Look At The Intrinsic Value Of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nUsing the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity, Alphabet fair value estimate is US$200 Alphabet's US$176 share price indicates it is trading at similar levels as its fair value estimate Our fair value estimate is 3.1% higher than Alphabet's analyst price target of US$194\n\nHow far off is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will use the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model on this occasion. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nView our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe're using the 2-stage growth model, which simply means we take in account two stages of company's growth. In the initial period the company may have a higher growth rate and the second stage is usually assumed to have a stable growth rate. In the first stage we need to estimate the cash flows to the business over the next ten years. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nGenerally we assume that a dollar today is more valuable than a dollar in the future, and so the sum of these future cash flows is then discounted to today's value:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$80.4b US$92.2b US$108.8b US$122.5b US$129.5b US$135.0b US$140.1b US$144.7b US$149.1b US$153.4b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x17 Analyst x18 Analyst x11 Analyst x4 Analyst x2 Est @ 4.30% Est @ 3.72% Est @ 3.32% Est @ 3.04% Est @ 2.84% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$75.0k US$80.2k US$88.4k US$92.8k US$91.5k US$89.0k US$86.2k US$83.1k US$79.8k US$76.6k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$843b\n\nStory continues\n\nWe now need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all the future cash flows after this ten year period. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.4%. We discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$153b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.4%) = US$3.3t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$3.3t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$1.6t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$2.5t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Relative to the current share price of US$176, the company appears about fair value at a 12% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Alphabet as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.045. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Alphabet\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nLooking Ahead:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Instead the best use for a DCF model is to test certain assumptions and theories to see if they would lead to the company being undervalued or overvalued. If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. For Alphabet, there are three further aspects you should further examine:\n\nFinancial Health: Does GOOGL have a healthy balance sheet?

        "title": "Analyst Sees $1.2 Trillion AI Opportunity for Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)",
        "content": "We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers –  Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,  Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\n\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\n\nKey AI Predictions\n\nThe UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.\n\nBased on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) Best AI Stock With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”?\n\nA laptop and phone open to Google's services in an everyday setting.\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAccording to the latest UBS report, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) falls in all three layers of the AI value chain – enabling, intelligence and application layer. Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) is an AI enabling player because of its Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) and Google Cloud Platform, while Gemini makes it a key player in the intelligence layer. On the application layer, UBS believes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has an edge with its Duet AI assistant and advertising. All these catalysts make Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) a company that could benefit from the $1.2 trillion AI opportunity by 2027, UBS said.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Investors are buying into AI, and Musk, any way they can: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe broadening of the stock market rally hasn’t yet arrived as investors keep piling into (just about) anything AI touches.\n\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\n\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\n\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\n\nSo far this year, SMCI is up over 200%. Dell, which to some harkens back to a PC 1.0 world, has seen its stock nearly double.\n\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\n\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market’s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nThe Super Micro news has a clear Musk dimension, and part of the multi-CEO’s dynamism is that his businesses cross into different industries and are themselves interconnected. But since Tesla is the only public Musk company, most investors can only get in on his other ventures indirectly. If you can’t buy into xAI, why not acquire a piece of its suppliers? Elon Musk attends 'Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk' session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024, in Cannes, France. (Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) (Marc Piasecki via Getty Images)\n\nA similar dynamic is at play within the world of AI.\n\nThe AI rally extends beyond hardware manufacturers too. Investors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\n\nPowering the computer systems that train and run AI systems requires huge amounts of energy. Utility companies are catching a ride on the AI wave.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, which will include building and running data centers. In turn, power demand from US data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, in part because of AI, according to estimates from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nStory continues\n\nGetting in early is nice. But the AI frenzy is proving that getting in at all is more than enough. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Is TradingView the Best Stock Research Website for Informed Investing?",
        "content": "In this article, we will talk about the Best Stock Research Website for Informed Investing. For our detailed discussion, go directly to the 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks.\n\nWhen it comes to building a strong portfolio, retail investors conduct a great deal of research to learn about the macroeconomic climate, read up on the most recent stock market trends, become familiar with investing strategies, and observe the most notable actions of smart investors and elite hedge funds. A sizable portion of the investing community consists of retail investors, and they have access to a wealth of online information that can assist them in navigating the volatile stock market. According to Gallup’s survey, 162 million Americans, or 62% of adults in the United States, own shares in public companies. That is a 1% rise over 2023 and the highest percentage observed by Gallup since 2008. During the Great Recession, stock ownership declined and remained low for more than a decade, reaching lows of 52% in 2013 and 2016. Before 2008, the majority of Gallup surveys revealed that at least 60% of American adults owned stocks.\n\nToday, the stock market is very different from what existed at the time of the millennium. The internet has democratized information, resulting in increased  stock market involvement, which has been accelerated during the pandemic. Wall Street welcomed retail investors for the first time as a result of the pandemic, even though the global outbreak is primarily remembered for the deadly virus and lockdowns. In apoll, 15% of American stock market participants stated they started investing in 2020. The study additionally shows that these new investors tended to be more optimistic about their prospects for success in the stock market. A study revealed that 19.5% of all stock market shares exchanged in the first half of 2020 were made by individual investors. That is about twice as many trades by ordinary investors as there were in 2010, and it represents an increase of 4.5% over 2019. This occurred during the meme stock mania in 2021, which saw prominent businesses skyrocketing on the stock market as retail investors banded together on social media and purchased the shares in bulk.\n\nNotwithstanding the attraction of potential profits, new research from eToro indicates that many retail investors in the United States appear to be more afraid of losing money than they are of missing out on the next great opportunity. Rethinking Risk, research by eToro, finds that while 31% of US retail investors are driven by the fear of missing out on the next great thing, 61% of investors indicate that their investment strategy is shaped by the fear of losing money through immoderate risk. Their behaviors, however, reveal a different tale, as many retail investors continue to invest in risky assets, with 70% holding single stocks and 41% holding crypto assets in their portfolios. Additionally, this research shows that 62% of people who began investing in the markets now feel better about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these developments, the demand for easily available, reliable information to aid retail investors in their decision-making is rising. According to a survey conducted by BNY Mellon and the World Economic Forum on global retail investment, three-quarters of current retail investors said they would trade more actively if they had more opportunities to learn about investing along with personalized, goal-oriented stock guidance. Here's where trustworthy websites for stock research would come in very handy.\n\nSo let's look at the Best Stock Research Website for Informed Investing.  Is TradingView the Best Stock Research Website for Informed Investing?\n\nA fast-paced trading floor with brokers in motion with the Hong Kong stock exchange in the backdrop.\n\nMethodology:\n\nFor our list of the best websites to research stocks, we ranked them on the basis of consensus of several sources and reddit threads on the same topics. A website received one point everytime it appeared on a source, and we only selected websites that appeared at least thrice in our research. Furthermore, we also considered quantifiable factors in these websites that create substantial value for their audience and scored them additional points for that.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here)\n\nTradingView\n\nTradingView is a prominent online platform for traders and investors that offers a variety of tools and resources for researching financial markets, exchanging trading ideas, and placing trades. It provides real-time data and charts for commodities, FX, cryptocurrencies, equities, and other assets. In addition to following other traders and viewing their analysis and insights, users may design their indicators, methods, and trading alerts. TradingView is a tool for both new and seasoned traders because of its intuitive layout and extensive range of community features.\n\nOn January 13, TradingView reported that Google, a division of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), has signed a deal with a Berkshire Hathaway electric company to use geothermal energy to power its data centers in Nevada.\n\nAccording to a statement from Google, the planned agreement with NV electricity has been submitted to the Nevada Public Utilities Commission for approval, and it would help Google achieve its goal of powering its data centers and offices fully on carbon-free electricity by 2030. As per the announcement, Google will get around 115 megawatts of geothermal electricity through the energy supply agreement. This represents a 25-fold increase in the amount of improved geothermal capacity that Google presently has enabled. Geothermal electricity is produced from the earth's heat.\n\nNV Energy Chief Executive Doug Cannon stated, \"If approved, it provides a blueprint for other utilities and large customers in Nevada to accelerate clean energy goals.\"\n\nFor TTM and 2023, the YoY growth rates are around 3.50% and 8.68%, respectively.\n\nAccording to Insider Monkey’s Q1 FY2024 data, 165 hedge funds were long on Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the quarter, which decreased from 166 funds in the prior quarter. Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management is the largest stakeholder in the company, with 46.33 million shares worth $6.99 trillion.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nTradingView ranks 15th on our list, but if you want to check out what other websites are and where they rank, visit the 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks.

        "title": "Amazon is already disrupting the streaming advertising market — here's how",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) entered the ad-supported streaming space in January by defaulting all of its Prime Video subscriptions to ads. Just six months later, the tech giant's impact is already being felt.\n\nPrime Video subscriptions now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members—or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\n\nAmazon's entrance builds on the presence of Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS), which introduced their respective ad tiers in late 2022. That means an automatic expansion of ad-supported options for consumers — along with prospective ad buyers.\n\n\"There's no question it has created an excess of supply in the marketplace,\" Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week at Cannes Lions, an annual event for the global advertising and communications industry.\n\nBottom line: companies like Disney must work that much harder to lure advertisers to their platforms.\n\nMoffettNathanson estimated Prime Video could add over 50 billion impressions to the connected TV (CTV) market this year, \"an amount that is likely to dwarf a lot of the smaller players in the space\" as increased inventory simultaneously drives down the price for ads.\n\n\"Amazon knows how to gain market share and they know how to use price to gain market share,\" said Mark Douglas, CEO at MNTN, an ad tech company that specializes in the CTV space. \"That's one of the big things this week [at Cannes] — Amazon is being pretty aggressive in terms of lowering price.\"\n\nAd buyers have paid Amazon a reported cost per thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 and $35. The low price has forced competitors to follow suit. Netflix dropped its CPM rate from a previous $39 to $45 range last summer to roughly $29 to $35 currently, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Why can they do that and the rest of the industry considers that a problem is because Amazon has [a] big search advertising business and they can bring those advertisers over into Prime,\" Douglas said. \"They can monetize the content way better and bring down the price. That is the main dynamic at work right now.\"\n\n'It just raises the stakes'\n\nAmazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services due to its Prime delivery service and ability to keep consumers within its ecosystem. That's helped the company easily secure customer data and increase its targeting capabilities — both attractive to advertisers.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen previously told Yahoo Finance of Amazon's ads rollout. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for.\"\n\nBut there might be enough inventory to go around, especially as more consumers opt for ad-supported streaming options.\n\nAccording to subscription analytics platform Antenna, which released its second quarter \"State of Subscriptions\" report on June 13, more users are opting for ads, with 38% of overall accounts now choosing ad tiers.\n\nThose trends have continued to encourage the shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming, with MoffettNathanson predicting total advertising video on demand will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023.\n\n\"Platforms with the most inventory, least must-have content, and worst targeting capabilities are most at risk,\" the firm said. Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios, speaks onstage as Amazon debuts its inaugural upfront presentation at Pier 36 on May 14 in New York City. (Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for Amazon) (Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images)\n\nBut Douglas believes competitiveness will force the rest of the industry to adapt to Amazon's moves.\n\n\"There's a transformation underway,\" the executive said, explaining Amazon and other Big Tech companies concentrate on capturing overall market share rather than securing the highest price for a 30-second ad, the prior standard for traditional media buying.\n\n\"The rest of the industry is not set up for that. That's the problem,\" he said. \"Still, I actually don't think it's some big long-term threat where Amazon is going to eat everyone's lunch. In the near term it's accelerating trends that needed to happen anyway.\"\n\nBut, he cautioned, \"it's going to take thinking a little more like a tech company and a little less like a media company.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Mizuho: Apple-Affirm partnership could boost gross merchandise volume by 35%",
        "content": "Investing.com - Mizuho, a global financial services firm, released a promising analysis of the recent collaboration between Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM), Inc. and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay on Thursday, noting that the new partnership could drive an incremental Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) opportunity worth around $12 billion for Affirm, representing a potential growth of 35% compared to fiscal year 2025 consensus volume estimates.\n\nMizuho's analysis suggests that the recent surge in Affirm's stock price following the announcement of the Apple Pay partnership could be justified, as the potential upside is not currently reflected in the stock.\n\n⚠️Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to receive over 50% off!⚠️\n\nAnalysts estimate that Apple Pay represents about $265 billion of e-commerce payment volumes in the US. This estimation is based on a recent report by Worldpay, which stated that Digital Wallets accounted for around $750 billion in the US volume in 2023. The primary wallets included in the report were PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay, and Apple Pay.\n\nAfter subtracting an estimate for PayPal US Branded Checkout TPV, Mizuho suggests that the remaining $450 billion in volumes is split between Apple Pay and Google Pay. Using the approximate iPhone/Android mix in the US of 60/40 as a proxy, they estimate that the remaining e-commerce volumes consist of around $265 billion from Apple Pay.\n\nWith Worldpay's estimate for BNPL mix at around 5%, this implies a potential opportunity of converted Apple Pay volumes worth around $12 billion. This represents a potential upside of 35% to Affirm's consensus' FY25 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) estimate.\n\nMizuho maintains a 'Buy' rating for Affirm, with a price target of $65.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMizuho: Apple-Affirm partnership could boost gross merchandise volume by 35%\n\nUnitedHealth issues breach notification on Change Healthcare hack\n\nExclusive-Boeing nearing deal with supplier Spirit Aero after months of talks, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 25.5% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the industry’s growth of 21.2%. The outperformance can be attributed to the strong performance of the Google Services segment, which is mainly driven by Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel and its first-party web apps.\r\n\r\nA strong product portfolio and an expanding partner base are key growth drivers of the Google Services segment, which contributes to the majority of Alphabet’s total revenues.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, revenues from the Google Services business increased 13.6% year over year to $70.4 billion, accounting for 87.4% of total revenues.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s division, Google, is making concerted efforts to strengthen this segment further on the back of feature upgrades for its first-party web apps in order to increase their adoption among users.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, Google’s implementation of a Material 3 redesign for one of its first-party web apps, Google Photos, remains noteworthy. The redesign has placed Google Photos’ core gallery in an internal container with a white background, while navigation, search bar and navigation drawer are placed on a light blue background.\r\n\r\nEarlier, Alphabet also introduced a Material 3 redesign for the Google Pay web application to offer features like viewing payment methods saved to users’ accounts and allowing users to see their recent transactions by tapping on a card.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is also making feature additions to bolster its search, Android, YouTube and Pixel product portfolio.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nOther Google Services Efforts to Note\n\nAlphabet’s latest addition of a “Listen to this page” text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome testifies to the aforesaid fact.\r\n\r\nThis feature strives to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely boost the company's search engine.\r\n\r\nAlphabet boosted its Android offerings with the roll-out of a new Google Maps feature that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map.\r\n\r\nThis feature addition is aimed at improving the user experience for Android users by ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.\r\n\r\nGoogle also strengthened its Pixel portfolio with the launch of a “Lookup” reverse number shortcut feature on the Google Phone app for all Pixel devices. The shortcut feature, present in the Recents tab, will open Google Search with the number, including country code, placed in parentheses when users tap on it to expand an unsaved incoming call.\r\n\r\nExpanding partner base has also been a catalyst to the Google Services segment’s performance.\r\n\r\nGoogle partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON to strengthen its YouTube business. This partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription in order to watch content while on their machine.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are expected to accelerate daily user activity on Search, YouTube, Android, Pixel and first-party web apps in the Google Services segment, which, in turn, is expected to drive Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $291.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.6%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET and Badger Meter BMI, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nArista Networks’ shares have gained 30.6% in the year-to-date period.

        "content": "Investors searching for stocks that will grow their portfolio and provide a strong return on capital should pay attention to analyst ratings, particularly the ones placed on strong buy growth stocks. Analysts are selective about the stocks they give their highest ratings to and are growing increasingly picky as the market rallies to all-time highs.\n\nNot every stock is worthy of praise or a top rating. But some are, and analysts see their share prices continuing to rise even if they’ve already enjoyed big gains in this bull market. Analyst ratings can point investors towards quality stocks that will make for solid long-term investments and return big gains over many years.\n\nHere are Wall Street favorites: seven strong buy growth stocks for June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestment bank Morgan Stanley has named Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) stock a “top pick.” Morgan Stanley analyst Erik Woodring is encouraging investors to take advantage of Dell stock’s decline after the company reported its financial results at the end of May. “We’d take advantage of recent post-earnings underperformance to ‘buy the dip’ on a leading AI infrastructure player,” wrote Woodring.\n\nThe analyst reiterated an “overweight” buy equivalent rating on Dell stock and placed a $155 price target on the shares, although he says the price could reach $200, which would be nearly 40% higher than where it currently trades. Morgan Stanley isn’t the only Wall Street firm that’s bullish on Dell. The consensus view among 13 professional analysts is that Dell stock is a “strong buy.”\n\nAnalysts like the company’s opportunity with artificial intelligence and anticipate a global refresh cycle to drive personal computer (PC) and laptop sales.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG/GOOGL) a Google Pixel smartphone\n\nSource: Tero Vesalainen / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe consensus view among 38 analysts who cover the progress of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is that the technology giant’s stock is a “strong buy.” Among the analysts, 33 rate it a “buy” and five have a “hold” rating on the stock. There isn’t a single “sell” rating on Alphabet currently. The analysts also see upside for the company’s share price, with a median target that is 13% higher than current levels.\n\nThe analyst community sees Alphabet benefitting from two catalysts. The first is the company’s leading position in AI, especially with its DeepMind laboratory. The second tailwind is the return of online advertising, which has come roaring back. Alphabet is seen as a prime beneficiary of online ads through its Google search portal, and it is how the company makes most of its revenue. Analysts also like that Google Cloud is profitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nGOOGL stock has gained 43% over the last 12 months, including a 27% increase this year.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts are loving cryptocurrency miner Riot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT). Nine analysts collectively give RIOT stock a “strong buy” rating. The median price target on the company’s share is 70% higher than where it currently trades. The upside potential for the crypto miner appears huge, based on what Wall Street professionals say in their analysis.\n\nRiot Platforms is viewed as a likely beneficiary of the consolidation now taking place among crypto mining companies after the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) halving event this April. The halving event reduced the available supply of Bitcoin and the rewards for mining it by 50%, leading to a wave of consolidation among miners. Riot Platforms has itself launched a hostile takeover bid for rival Bitfarms (NASDAQ:BITF).\n\nRIOT stock has fallen 30% this year, with most of the decline coming after the Bitcoin halving. Analysts see the decline as a buying opportunity for investors.\n\nWalt Disney Co. (DIS) an image of mickey mouse on a yellow background to represent disney (DIS)\n\nSource: ilikeyellow / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts seem to feel that Walt Disney Co.’s (NYSE:DIS) stock has been punished enough. While the share price of the entertainment company has risen 12% this year, it is 28% lower than where it was five years ago. Today, the stock is trading at half its price when it peaked at an all-time high in March 2021. Despite the struggles, 25 Wall Street analysts rate DIS stock a “strong buy” and see the stock rising nearly 30% over the coming 12 months.\n\nAnalysts seem heartened by Walt Disney’s cost controls and the more sustainable growth of the company’s streaming platform. At the same time, theatrically released movies are making a comeback. The analyst community also seems to like the focus that Disney is putting on its theme parks, with plans to invest $60 billion into the parks unit over the next decade.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnalysts expect pharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) to continue outperforming. The 19 analysts who rate LLY stock give it a consensus “strong buy,” with 16 analysts labeling it a “buy” and three calling it a “hold.” Analysts, of course, are bullish on the company’s weight loss and diabetes drugs, which they expect to drive its sales for several years.\n\nHowever, analysts are also excited about Eli Lilly’s new Alzheimer’s medication, which just took a big step towards securing regulatory approval. A panel of independent advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended the new Alzheimer’s drug, Donanemab, clearing the way for the medication to receive regulatory approval later this year. The FDA almost always follows recommendations from its advisory panels.\n\nAnalysts say Donanemab gives Eli Lilly another blockbuster medication to drive its sales and share price further higher. LLY stock has risen 97% in the past 12 months.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) appears to be the stock of the moment after the microchip and semiconductor designer issued strong quarterly results, offered bullish forward guidance, and announced a 10-for-1 stock split. Analysts seem to love everything Broadcom is doing, rating the stock a “strong buy.” Although the stock has gained 67% year-to-date, the average price target on it is still 5% above current levels.\n\nThe increase in AVGO stock could accelerate going into the company’s stock split, scheduled for July 15. Analysts view Broadcom as a major beneficiary of the AI boom, with its high-demand microchips. At the same time, the company is also getting a revenue boost from VMware, the enterprise software company it acquired for $69 billion last year. The company and stock are firing on all cylinders.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A/BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s not often referred to as a growth stock, but analysts are extremely bullish on the more affordable Class B stock of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A/NYSE:BRK-B). Analysts rate the stock as a “strong buy” and see the share price rise by an average of 15% over the next year. If anything, analysts seem to feel that Berkshire’s Class B stock is undervalued at current levels.\n\nBerkshire’s stock hasn’t been a slouch. The share price is up 13% on the year, about matching the gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index. The stock doubled in the past five years. Analysts continue to like that Berkshire Hathaway is run by Warren Buffett, and also like the company’s diversified holdings, which include everything from railroads to insurers. Analysts also single out Berkshire’s fortress cash pile, which is expected to surpass $200 billion at the end of the current second quarter.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in GOOGL and LLY.

        "content": "Shares of Dell (DELL) and Super Micro Computer (SMCI) popped Thursday after xAI Founder Elon Musk said the companies are providing hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building.\n\nThe moves higher underscore Wall Street's excitement around AI technology.\n\nInvestors are clamoring to buy into AI businesses at every level of development, from major consumer-facing brands selling AI-powered apps to manufacturers providing the chips and servers powering the computing infrastructure.\n\nShares of Dell rose as high as 5% Thursday morning while Super Micro's stock climbed nearly 9%.\n\nDell's CEO Michael Dell set up the jump for his company's share price when he said in a post on X Wednesday, “We’re building a Dell AI factory with Nvidia to power Grok for xAI.\"\n\nMusk, who owns X, clarified a few hours later, that Dell would be assembling half the racks that are going into the supercomputer. In response to comments asking who would be building the remaining half, Musk replied \"SMC.\"\n\nThe AI announcement took place over the Juneteenth holiday, when markets were closed. But investors poured into the stocks the following session. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang has led the company as its market cap passed Microsoft on Tuesday, June 18, 2024, to become the most valuable company in the S&P 500. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nBoth Dell and Super Micro are working to capitalize on the immense growth surrounding AI technologies. Earlier this week Super Micro announced plans to expand facilities in Silicon Valley to bolster its AI business. And Dell reported last month that revenue from its AI servers more than doubled from the prior quarter.\n\nMusk is also trying to position his startup as a leader in AI, even as tech giants Microsoft (MSFT) and Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), which owns Google, have made major inroads. His AI enterprise raised $6 billion in series B funding, backers announced last month, reaching a valuation of $24 billion, as investors bet on the dominant tech platforms as well as upstart challengers in a rapidly escalating AI race.\n\nOther big names are getting in on the AI game, too. Apple (AAPL), whose leaders were reluctant share their AI strategy prematurely, unveiled the company's strategic vision earlier this month. They debuted the Apple Intelligence platform at the annual Worldwide Developers Conference, marking a major shift for the company, which will soon introduce a host of new AI-infused features to its operating systems and products.\n\nEven as the tech giants have enjoyed substantial share price gains riding the momentum of AI development, Nvidia (NVDA), the chipmaker that has become an icon of the AI rally, has outshined them all.\n\nOn Thursday Nvidia widened its lead as the world's most valuable company, after moving ahead of Microsoft earlier this week. Shares climbed more than 2%, benefiting from the Dell and Super Micro announcements. It's market cap stood at $3.42 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 20, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Microsoft MSFT, Alphabet GOOGL, Apple AAPL and Morgan Stanley MS.\n\nHow to Use AI and ChatGPT for Stock Trading\n\nMy mother was a senior trader and managing director at a big Wall Street bank for over four decades. During her long career, she witnessed and navigated several booms and busts, including Black Monday (the stock market crash of 1987 where the S&P 500 dove 20% in a single session), the internet boom of the late 1990s, and the Global Financial Crisis of 2008.\n\nThough booms and busts will always exist, one constant was the dizzying pace technological changes for stock trading. For example, back in my mother's early days, traders would send orders via a tubing system like you may see today at a bank. Because the internet did not exist, traders would need to rely on a ticker tape, shouting out orders across the room or on a phone.\n\nArtificial Intelligence and Stock Trading\n\nFortunately, my mother embraced new technology and continued to prosper with the advent of electronic trading. An open mind and a will to learn new technologies can give you a leg up over the market.\n\nFor example, the late Jim Simons successfully leveraged computers and algorithms to amass a fortune of more than $30 billion. Ken Griffin, the founder of Citadel, started his career by embracing satellite technology in his dorm room. By using a satellite, Griffin could obtain stock quotes faster than his competition.\n\nThe AI Revolution Is Here\n\nIn late 2022, OpenAI and Microsoft launched ChatGPT, a chatbot leveraging a large language model (LLM). Within months, ChatGPT grew like wildfire to become the fastest-growing consumer app in history, while several other mega-cap tech companies like Alphabet and Apple raced to catch up. To anyone paying attention, the next technological advancement is here.\n\n\"You adapt, evolve, compete, or die.\" ~ Paul Tudor Jones\n\nWall Street juggernauts like Citadel, Morgan Stanley and Bridgewater Associates are already investing in and embracing AI to gain an edge in the market. Though most investors do not have the same resources, smaller investors have their advantages, such as flexibility and liquidity. I believe investors should start learning to use this groundbreaking technology.\n\nHow to Use AI for Stock Trading\n\nThough I believe in embracing new technology, I also believe in only using it if it makes my life easier. Because ChatGpt is currently the most widely used AI program, I will use it for examples. Below are three ways I use AI for trading, including:\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Build an Indicator With AI\n\nFew investors probably realize that they can type a prompt into ChatGPT for a trading indicator and the chatbot will spit out a script and directions on how to add it to your charting platform in seconds. For this example, I typed into ChatGPT, \"Build a TradingView indicator that changes the color of the volume bar to bright green when the volume is more than double the 50-day average.\" Rather than taking hours to code, ChatGPT delivered the complex code within seconds, and all that is required from here is to copy and paste it into the platform.\n\n2. Portfolio Analysis and Stats\n\nIn being in the financial services industry for more than two decades, I have noticed that most amateur investors focus too much of their time on stock picking or finding the next hot tip when they should instead analyze themselves and their portfolio's metrics.\n\nLuckily for these investors, generating portfolio metrics is no longer tedious. For this exercise, I typed in, \"Use the following trade data to generate important stats about my stock portfolio: Total Trades: 52 Winning Trades: 39 Average Winner: 30.80% Losing Trades: 13 Average Loser: 9.97%\"\n\nWithin seconds, ChatGPT delivers important portfolio metrics such as win rate, loss rate and average gain per trade.\n\n3. Learn About Markets With AI\n\nAccess to AI is like having all the world's knowledge at your fingertips. Suppose you want to learn about a complex options strategy. Rather than searching for a book on the topic, you no longer need to leave your computer and can instead ask a chatbot like ChatGPT or Google's Gemini.\n\nAI and Robo Advisors\n\nThough AI is a net value add to Wall Street, it can also be used as a buzzword in a sales pitch for robo-advisor products. Before investing with a \"robo-advisor,\" investors should weigh the advisor's performance against benchmarks like the S&P 500 Index. What investors will discover is that most of these robo-advisors charge high fees to invest in an index-like portfolio.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe AI revolution is here, and investors should learn to leverage breakthrough technologies like ChatGPT and Gemini to gain an edge in the stock market.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Amazon's Dr. Angela Shippy wants to help AI transform the healthcare system",
        "content": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning roll out across virtually every sector of the economy, helping fuel the stock market to record highs, the biggest tech companies are racing to bring those efficiencies over to healthcare, a sector that spent $4.5 trillion in 2022.\n\nDr. Angela Shippy, a medical doctor turned executive at Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, is leading the charge for the world's biggest cloud provider. At Houston Medical Center, where Shippy previously saw patients, she now meets with hospital executives to discuss how tech can be incorporated into patient care.\n\n“I have the opportunity to really bridge that gap between what's happening day-to-day within healthcare organizations and technology that can help them really transform and really find the solutions to any pain points that they have,” Shippy said. An Amazon Echo Spot sits among the smart devices being studied in a lab at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass., on Oct. 14, 2021. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nShippy works directly with at least 700 healthcare providers across the country to expand their use of AWS-backed technology.\n\nAmong the tools are AI-powered rooms that transcribe conversations and take notes for doctors, Echo Dot devices that patients can use to order things like ice, and even virtual intensive care services, which decrease burnout in providers by allowing them to focus on patient care.\n\n“If we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow [care providers] to do what they truly love, then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control,” Shippy said.\n\nAWS is not alone in this effort. Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) said this earnings season they are investing another $16 billion in AI this year, a 31% increase from last year.

(Jordan Pettitt/PA Images via Getty Images) (Jordan Pettitt - PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlthough more than half of hospitals' total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field remains challenged by labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff.\n\nBecause of her previous work as a healthcare provider, Shippy is uniquely positioned as fluent in both the medical and tech worlds. Prior to joining AWS, she was the chief medical and quality officer at the Memorial Hermann Health System, where she used her affinity for technology to develop a COVID-19 dashboard at the height of the pandemic.\n\n\"I saw the power of technology, and how it would be used to transform healthcare,\" Shippy said. \"And that's really what made coming to a role like this at AWS possible for me because I saw what that transformation could really lead to.\"\n\nStory continues New technology allows doctors and care providers to interact with a virtual reality 3D heart. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne example of that transformation is a virtual reality headset that projects 3D images. The AWS executive donned the headset, which allowed her to flip and turn the three-dimensional beating heart of a hypothetical patient. “This patient is having a heart attack,” Shippy explained to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe 3D virtual heart is among the more futuristic tools in the hospital, but Shippy sees value in tools across the spectrum of technology. That vision and her experience during the pandemic informed her decision to move from health to tech — a leap of faith for a doctor who decided her career path at just 9 years old.\n\n“When ... somebody like me at 9 years old says, 'I want be a doctor. I want to help people,' that never goes away,” Shippy said. “Being from an underrepresented community or being in a community where maybe healthcare isn't like what you've seen in the Texas Medical Center today, we want to close those gaps.” Lead This Way\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "Are you hoping to become a self-made millionaire? It's certainly possible even if you're not a professional artist or athlete. The key for most ordinary people is just investing what you can when you can, picking the right stocks, and then leaving them alone long enough to let them do the heavy lifting.\n\nHere's a rundown of three magnificent stocks that have not only helped bunches of investors become millionaires, but will likely continue doing the same into the distant future.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nThere's nothing particularly exciting about The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO). Sure, it's the name behind the world's most popular soft drink. It also owns several other familiar brands, like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, and Dasani water, just to name a few. But the drinks industry is crowded, competitive, and limited in terms of growth potential.\n\nBut this market saturation doesn't really matter when you've perfected the art -- and science -- of convincing people to purchase your product over and over again, which is precisely what this company has done. From a brilliant combination of steady lifestyle branding efforts (most Gen-Xers and older folks still remember the \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\" jingle from 50 years ago!) to leveraging its sheer size when negotiating pricing, production, and product placement with its retail and bottling partners, Coca-Cola has become parent to several of the world's most recognized beverage brand names.\n\nInvestors have come along for the ride, too. A $10,000 investment in Coke stock 50 years ago would be worth roughly half a million bucks today. And that's just the stock's price appreciation. By reinvesting any dividends paid in the meantime into more shares of Coca-Cola, your initial investment would be worth over $2 million now. Slow-and-steady clearly wins the race.\n\nThe toughest part of owning a stake in this slow-moving dividend payer is, of course, remaining patient enough to let your reinvested dividends create enough of a cash-driving critical mass to matter. Not everybody is willing or able to simply wait and watch, trusting that big returns are in the cards.\n\nThis might help: The Coca-Cola Company has raised its dividend every year for the past 62 years. The split-adjusted quarterly dividend of $0.195 it was dishing out in 1994 has grown to $0.485 per share now. It's also worth remembering that there's never going to be a time when people don't get thirsty.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) doesn't pay a meaningful dividend. Its current yield stands at just under 0.5%. Rather, Google's parent has taken a more direct approach to turning its investors into millionaires. Since the company's initial public offering in 2004, shares have gained an incredible 7,000%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, the company's very best days are probably in the past. Search engines aren't exactly a high-growth business anymore, now that much of the developed world is already regularly online. It's also a crowded market, with alternative search engines like Microsoft's Bing getting traction.\n\nThat line of thinking looks past a couple of important realities regarding Alphabet, however.\n\nOne of these realities is the fact that while the search engine market is no longer a huge growth driver, that business isn't the only meaningful one Alphabet is in. YouTube now accounts for roughly one-tenth of the company's top line, and a little more than one-tenth of the company's total revenue comes from its still-young cloud computing arm. Alphabet's cloud arm only recently swung to an operating profit, and its bottom line continues to grow at a much faster clip than any of its other businesses. The market may be underestimating the near-term profit growth that's in the cards here.\n\nThe other detail worth drawing out is that while Alphabet's breadwinning Google already controls a commanding 90% of the world's search engine market -- according to numbers from GlobalStats -- there's actually still ample opportunity for above-average growth on this front. Market researcher Mordor Intelligence believes the so-called next-generation search engine market (improved by the addition of artificial intelligence, for instance) is set to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 15% through 2029. Alphabet's first-quarter search advertising revenue was also up 14.3% year over year.\n\nConnect the dots. Every time it seems like the company's out of opportunities, it finds a new lever or two to pull.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLast but not least, add Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to your list of magnificent stocks that have already minted lots of millionaires, but could continue making more.\n\nThe company doesn't need much of an introduction. It arguably launched the entire e-commerce industry once internet access became common in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Market research company eMarketer reckons Amazon controls on the order of a commanding 40% of the United States' e-commerce market. But, despite Amazon's dominance of North America's online-shopping landscape, eMarketer believes Amazon's share of this market is going to continue growing at least through 2025 rather than stagnating, or even shrinking.\n\nThat dominance is only part of the bullish argument for owning Amazon stock, however. Amazon is also the world's single-biggest cloud computing service provider, and this business is a beast. It accounts for more than 60% of the company's operating income,lifted again by its first-quarter revenue growth of 17%. Although it's well-developed already, Mordor Intelligence says the global cloud computing services market is on pace to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% at least through 2029.\n\nAmazon is finally firing on all cylinders on another front as well. That's international e-commerce. While this arm's regularly operated in the red (with the exception of the height of the coronavirus pandemic), it's been cutting its international business' operating costs and growing sales for a couple of years. Last quarter's international operating income of $903 million is the most profitable this unit's been since its record-breaking profit of $1.25 billion in Q1 2021. Only this time, there's room and reason for the trajectory to continue carrying both its sales and income upward. Data source: Amazon Inc. Chart by author. All figures are in millions of dollars.\n\nIn the meantime, Amazon remains North America's online shopping powerhouse.\n\nIt's unlikely Amazon stock will be able to repeat the 244,000% gain logged since its 1997 IPO over the course of the next 27 years. That certainly doesn't mean it can't continue outperforming the overall market, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 2 AI Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is up 30% over the last 12 months, kicking off a strong bull market. This market enthusiasm has significance for new investors, because the average duration of a bull market historically is 4.9 years, according to investment firm Stifel -- about three times longer than bear markets.\n\nMuch of the growth in the Nasdaq Composite in this bull market is related to enthusiasm for all things connected to artificial intelligence (AI). The potential of this evolving technology has investors and market traders excited. Investors who focus on buying reasonably priced AI growth stocks now could have several years of handsome gains to look forward to. Here are two quality AI growth stocks to buy today.\n\n1. Alphabet (Google)\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is using AI technology it's developing to generate significant improvements across its business, including improving search results for users on multiple platforms it operates and boosting ad performance for advertisers.\n\nAlphabet began investing in generative AI technology in 2016, and its latest iteration is Gemini, a series of AI models it plans to use to lay the groundwork for the company's future. Gemini can generatively process and produce text, images, audio, and video based on user prompts, and the enthusiasm among users is already driving substantial growth for the company.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how these latest AI efforts will actually affect Alphabet's financials, but its prior AI investments over the past two decades definitely help it maintain growth. The already huge tech company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 15% in the first quarter. It's also keeping tight control of operating costs, which led to robust earnings growth of 61% over the year-ago quarter. The company's strong fundamentals are generating so much excess free cash flow that management felt comfortable implementing its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share (which will result in an annual dividend yield of 0.45%) in addition to a $70 billion share repurchase program.\n\nGoogle's ad-based business earns very high margins that will be able to fund a growing dividend for years. The company earned $82 billion of net income on a trailing-12-month basis through Q1 -- up nearly threefold over the last five years.\n\nImportantly, this AI stock offers attractive value, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 based on this year's consensus earnings estimate. Analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 17%, so investors should expect the stock to deliver similar returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nAn improving digital advertising market is also boosting the operations of social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta is also a big user of generative AI models, which is driving more relevant content recommendations for users of apps like Facebook and Instagram and boosting ad performance.\n\nIn April, Meta introduced its open-source large language model called Llama 3. Llama is powering the new version of Meta AI, which enables users to get relevant answers across its family of social media platforms, and the positive early feedback suggests it will help Meta's apps drive higher user engagement.\n\nMeta said revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter. The strong growth was driven by a combination of a 20% increase in ad impressions and a 6% increase in average price per ad, suggesting advertisers are placing a high value on reaching the company's 3.2 billion daily users across its apps.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta is a highly profitable business that is starting to return capital to shareholders through dividends. Meta currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, bringing the annual yield to 0.4%. Its net profit continues to grow and reached $45 billion over the last year, so it has the makings of a quality dividend growth stock.\n\nThe current Wall Street consensus calls for earnings to grow 18% per year, which could lead to similar returns, as the stock trades at a very reasonable forward P/E of 25.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Undervalued Stock Could Join Nvidia in the $3 Trillion Club",
        "content": "There are currently only three S&P 500 stocks in the $3 trillion club: Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). All three are valued right around $3.3 trillion. With a market cap of just under $2.2 trillion, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) looks like the best candidate to join this exclusive club. The stock would need to rise just over 36% to get there. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nLet's look at three reasons why Alphabet looks poised to be the next stock to join the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet companies maintain dominant market positions\n\nAlphabet is the dominant leader in search with Google having an approximate 90% global market share. Search is a huge business that is still growing robustly, with Google search revenue up 14% year over year in the first quarter this year to $46.2 billion. While Microsoft has tried to challenge Google's dominance by adding new artificial intelligence (AI) features to its Bing search engine, so far this has not made a dent in Google's dominance.\n\nAt the same time, YouTube is also a video content leader with one of the most attractive models in the space. Given its user-generated content, the company doesn't have to pay the large upfront content fees of streaming services, instead sharing revenue with its creators. Despite a lackluster advertising market, YouTube's first-quarter revenue jumped 21% year over year to $8.1 billion. The company is just starting to better monetize its short-form videos, which is competing with the likes of ByteDance's TikTok and has a long runway to keep growing.\n\nMeanwhile, Google's fastest-growing segment is its cloud service business, which grew its revenue 28% year over year to $9.6 billion in Q1. Google Cloud holds the No. 3 position in market share for cloud services (behind 2. Microsoft's Azure and 1. Amazon Web Services) and the business has been a beneficiary of increased AI spending in the broader economy. As a business with a lot of fixed costs, Google Cloud just became profitable in 2023 and is now set to grow its profitability more quickly than revenue as the segment shows operating leverage.\n\n2. Alphabet is seeing an AI upside\n\nWhile Google Cloud has already been a big beneficiary of the increased interest in all things AI, other parts of its business are also benefitting. The company is incorporating its Gemini large language model (LLM) into various products including its Pixel smartphones and Workspace product suite. Gemini for Workspace, for example, will start as a $20-a-month add-on subscription built into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets that will act as an AI assistant that can do such tasks as monitor and track projects, organize information, help write proposals, and generate images and designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company has scaled back its use of AI search overlays for the time being due to some early flubs, it still represents a future opportunity. Google currently only serves ads for about 20% of its searches where the inclusion of ads is relevant to the search, so new ad forms for AI searches will be a big potential opportunity. The technology still needs to improve, but AI and AI-powered search are still very much in their infancy.\n\n3. Alphabet is an undervalued stock\n\nCompared to the stocks already in the $3 trillion club, Alphabet trades at the lowest valuation by far with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 23. Given its current growth and future prospects, the stock currently looks very undervalued. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet traded at the same 32.5 forward P/E multiple as Apple, its Class A shares would cost $245 and it would have a market cap of $3 trillion. Notably, Alphabet has been showing stronger revenue growth than Apple. In their most recent quarters, Apple saw its revenue decline 4% year over year, while Alphabet grew revenue 15%.

        "content": "We recently published a list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhen the AI revolution started with the launch of ChatGPT, investors started pouring money into a handful of companies that are leading AI technology development, thanks to their industry position and unending free cash flows. Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we’re all familiar with. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the “AI Big Ten” group.\n\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P’s large cap index. You can check out the latest list here: 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at the Big 10 AI stocks Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett highlighted in his report. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, as of the end of the March quarter. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024\n\nGoogle\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nBofA also named Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as one of the Big 10 AI stocks that are contributing to the overall market returns so far. The stock has gained about 28 so far this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother latest story around Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) making waves is Bank of America’s industry checks in the search engine market which found that Alphabet is still the market leader, with a whopping 95% share, with Bing’s search coming in at just 0.7%.\n\nBofA’s Justin Post said Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews had a role to play here:\n\n“After a consecutive eight months of decline, Google’s US Search market share increased m/m in May, which could suggest AI Overviews are aiding query growth and usage,” Post said.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) ranks 10th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Adobe ADBE is riding on the solid momentum of its family of creative, generative AI models, Firefly, which has been bolstering its generative AI strength for some time now. The company is continuously making efforts to expand its Firefly-powered solution offerings to deliver enhanced customer experience.\r\n\r\nADBE recently integrated Firefly-powered Generative Fill, Remove Background, Erase and Crop features into Acrobat, which are designed to allow customers to edit images directly in PDFs. The company also integrated the Firefly Image 3 Model into Acrobat in order to aid customers in generating images and adding those to their PDFs.\r\n\r\nCurrently, editing and generating images can be done in around 3 trillion PDFs in circulation using text prompts, which are powered by Firefly.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Adobe added features to Acrobat AI Assistant to let customers ask questions, get insights and create content from information across groups of PDFs and other document types, including Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint and text files. It also introduced enhanced meeting transcript capabilities in AI Assistant.\r\nThese new features make Acrobat the first PDF solution to offer in-app generative image capabilities. The latest move has added strength to Document Cloud offerings, which will likely contribute well to the Digital Media segment’s performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nIn second-quarter fiscal 2024, Digital Media generated revenues of $3.91 billion, which improved 11% on a year-over-year basis. Document Cloud contributed $782 million to revenues, which rose 19% from the prior-year quarter.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Digital Media segment will, in turn, aid Adobe’s overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 total revenues is pegged at $21.45 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.5%. The same for fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $18.13 per share, implying a year-over-year rise of 12.8%. The EPS estimate has been revised upward by 0.9% in the past seven days.\n\nAdobe Inc.

You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAdobe’s unveiling of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe unveiling of Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom, which is a powerful Firefly-backed tool that helps remove unwanted objects from any photo in a single click in a non-destructive manner, is a plus.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Adobe Express for Enterprise, which is powered by Firefly Image Model 3, is a positive.\r\n\r\nThe company also launched Photoshop’s web version, which is available via Firefly-powered AI tools, generative expand and generative fill.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition: A Risk\n\nAdobe has lost 12.4% year to date against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 14.4%. In the same time frame, the company has underperformed Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META, from which it faces stiff competition in the generative AI space.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which has gained 20.3% year to date, is benefiting significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google is capitalizing on the increasing demand for large language models with its most powerful AI model, Gemini. Solid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAlphabet shares have rallied 25.5% year to date.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms, which has returned 41.4% year to date, recently introduced generative AI features to assist businesses in creating and editing new ad content, making the process quicker and more efficient.\r\n\r\nThese features include image and text-generation capabilities, image variation, and the ability to create alternate iterations based on original creative, helping businesses reach their target audiences more effectively.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Google Invested in This Hot New Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock. Should You?",
        "content": "What's a tell-tale sign that a small artificial intelligence (AI) company has tremendous potential? When the small AI company attracts interest -- and money -- from a big AI company.\n\nThere aren't many AI companies on the planet that are bigger than Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Few have AI track records as impressive as Alphabet's. Its Google Brain (now part of Google DeepMind) invented AI transformer architecture -- the \"T\" in ChatGPT. Google DeepMind developed Go-playing phenomenon AlphaGo and AlphaFold, an AI system that predicts the structures of proteins.\n\nThe Google team no doubt recognizes innovative new AI technologies when it sees them. And Google is backing a hot new AI company that conducted its initial public offering (IPO) last week.\n\nThe latest AI IPO\n\nEric Lefkofsky founded Tempus AI(NASDAQ: TEM) in 2015 and continues to serve as its CEO. The company was originally called Bioin but changed its name to Tempus Health in 2015, Tempus Labs in 2016, and Tempus AI in 2023.\n\nLefkofsky is no stranger to starting new businesses. He co-founded Groupon and venture capital firm Lightbank in 2008. He also co-founded InnerWorkings, Mediaocean, Echo Global Logistics, and Pathos AI.\n\nTempus uses AI to provide what it calls \"intelligence diagnostics.\" Its diagnostics tests are contextualized for individual patients using their clinical data. The company believes that its approach can help physicians prescribe more effective therapies for patients and help researchers accelerate the discovery and development of new therapies.\n\nOn Friday, June 14, 2024, Tempus conducted its IPO on the Nasdaq stock exchange. The healthcare AI company's shares soared as much as 15% on the first day of trading and closed up almost 9%. Tempus AI's market cap now stands above $6 billion.\n\nWhy does Google like Tempus AI?\n\nGoogle's financial relationship with Tempus AI dates back to June 2020. Tempus issued a convertible promissory note worth $330 million to Google as part of an agreement to use Google Cloud. Nearly five months later, Tempus gave Google $80 million of preferred stock to partially satisfy its original promissory note.\n\nAs you might expect, Google doesn't always work out these kinds of financial arrangements with its small cloud customers. What did the tech giant see in Tempus to make it willing to strike this deal?\n\nI suspect Tempus AI's impressive growth was a key factor. The company's revenue jumped 183% between 2002 and 2023. Although Tempus remains unprofitable, its adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) are trending in the right direction.\n\nStory continues\n\nTempus AI's customer base underscores how much value its technology offers. Its products have been used by roughly 95% of the top 20 biggest public biopharmaceutical companies in the world. Tempus has partnerships with more than 200 biopharma companies. More than 7,000 physicians and over 65% of U.S. academic medical centers have used Tempus AI's products.\n\nShould you buy this hot new AI stock?\n\nRisk-averse investors probably won't like Tempus AI. Its stock could be highly volatile. As mentioned previously, the company isn't profitable.\n\nHowever, Tempus estimates that its oncology and neuropsychiatry genomics products target a total addressable market of over $70 billion. The addressable market for the company's data and services products is at least $119 billion. Tempus thinks that its AI applications products focusing on algorithmic diagnostics could have a long-term market opportunity could be bigger than all of its other product lines combined.\n\nThe use of AI in healthcare diagnostics is still in its early innings. Tempus AI has already proven that it can succeed in this market. It has a seasoned management team. Google's financial backing also says a lot. I think this hot new AI stock looks like a good pick for aggressive investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Tempus Ai right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Tempus Ai, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Tempus Ai wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 26.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 10.3%. The company is benefiting from strong Google Services segment driven by search, YouTube, Pixel and particularly Android. Hence Google is making continuous efforts to bolster its Android features.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from Alphabet’s latest user interface (UI) redesign for one of its Android apps, Google Messages. The redesign presents a full-screen \"Select recipients\" UI with five recent conversations, a search button and a contact list. Users can select multiple conversations, select profile avatars and share individually by tapping the \"Next\" FAB.\r\n\r\nAlphabet further strengthened its Google Messages app with an upgrade that allows users to edit a Rich Communication Services message, enabling 15 minutes for typo correction. Users can edit the original message by long-pressing the pencil icon in the toolbar, and the original message can be viewed by long-pressing the overflow menu.\r\n\r\nThese efforts will enable Google to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global mobile messaging market, which, per a Future Market Insights report, is expected to reach $443.53 billion by 2033, indicating a CAGR of 15.9% between 2023 and 2033.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nExpanding Android Offerings Aid Google Services\n\nAlphabet has been making concerted efforts to bolster other Android apps like Google Wallet, Google Maps and Google Photos, among others, in addition to Google Messages, in a bid to strengthen the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently introduced a new Notifications feature for its Google Wallet app. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.\r\n\r\nAlphabet also announced a feature on Google Maps that shows entrances for buildings to some select users, addressing the issue of navigating to specific building portions on the map. This feature is aimed at improving the user experience and ensuring accurate directions for businesses or locations.\r\n\r\nAlphabet launched a free version of Magic Editor for Google Photos, allowing Android users to manipulate images, resize, and erase parts, apply background pre-sets and select with tap, circle, or brush.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nAll the above-mentioned endeavors to bolster its Android app offerings will, in turn, boost the Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Google Services segment is expected to continue aiding Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.2%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.5% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank & Other Stocks to Consider\n\nCurrently, Alphabet carries a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\r\n\r\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are Arista Networks ANET, Badger Meter BMI and Dropbox DBX, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 at present.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Byrna Technologies, CareCloud, American Superconductor, Alphabet and NVIDIA",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 18, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Adobe Inc. (ADBE), Byrna Technologies Inc. BYRN, CareCloud, Inc. CCLD, American Superconductor Corporation AMSC, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\n5 Top Tech Stocks to Win Big with Nasdaq on a Roll\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite eked out a fifth straight record close on Jun 14 as the tech juggernaut rolled on. The tech-laden index increased by 0.1% to close at 17,688.88, powered by gains in Adobe Inc. and other tech behemoths. This year, the index has soared 17.8%, much more than the 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average's meager gain of 2.4%.\n\nLast week, tech stocks were among the few to have emerged as winners despite being in overbought territory. This doesn't mean that tech stocks will face a looming downward trend. Quite the reverse, tech stocks are well-poised to scale upward, banking on interest rate-cut optimism.\n\nAfter rapidly increasing in the first quarter, consumer and wholesale price pressures have eased in recent times. For May, the consumer price index showed no month-over-month increase, while the yearly increase of 3.3% was less than the analysts' estimate of a 3.4% annual rate. The monthly and annual increase in core CPI that eliminates the volatile food and energy costs, too, fell short of estimates.\n\nWholesale prices unpredictably declined last month, a tell-tale sign that inflation is pulling back. The producer price index declined 0.2% month over month in May, following an increase of 0.5% in the prior month. This means that the Federal Reserve won't be raising interest rates this year and will remain less aggressive. Lest we forget, inflationary pressure since the coronavirus pandemic compelled the Fed to implement a series of interest rate hikes.\n\nNonetheless, in the recent two-day monetary policy meeting, the Fed has kept its benchmark fed funds rate unchanged and has projected an interest rate cut this year. Rate cuts, by the way, are a blessing in disguise for tech stocks. This is because a lower interest rate environment doesn't impact a tech stock's future cash inflows. Additionally, interest rate cuts decrease borrowing costs, which boosts profit margins.\n\nHence, banking on these positives, it's judicious for astute investors to place their bets on tech stocks listed on the Nasdaq that can make the most of the index's current upward journey. Some of the notable names are Byrna Technologies Inc., CareCloud, Inc., American Superconductor Corporation, Alphabet Inc. and NVIDIA Corporation. They have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nByrna Technologies is a non-lethal technology company. Byrna Technologies currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 7.1% over the past 60 days. BYRN's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 27.8%.\n\nCareCloud provides healthcare technology solutions. CareCloud currently has a Zacks Rank #2. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 158.6% over the past 60 days. CCLD's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 112.4%.\n\nAmerican Superconductor is a leading energy technologies company. American Superconductor currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 66.7% over the past 60 days. AMSC's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 400%.\n\nAlphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. It offers various products and platforms across the globe. Alphabet presently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.1% over the past 60 days. GOOGL's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 31% (read more: Bill Ackman's Favorite \"Magnificent 7\" Stock is a Big Winner).\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit, or GPU. NVIDIA currently has a Zacks Rank #1. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has increased 12.6% over the past 60 days. NVDA's expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 106.2%.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "If I Could Only Buy 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, This Would Be It",
        "content": "Choosing just one artificial intelligence (AI) stock to have in your portfolio is nearly impossible. Few companies are perfectly dedicated to AI, but a lot of them have their fingers in AI as well as other areas, so just by having a well-balanced portfolio, you'll end up owning multiple AI stocks.\n\nBut if I had to choose one, it would be Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet's AI ecosystem reaches nearly all areas\n\nSome may find it interesting that I didn't pick Nvidia, the undisputed king of AI hardware. Or maybe you'd expect me to choose Microsoft because it partnered with the company many consider to be in first place in the generative AI race, OpenAI.\n\nHowever, I think Alphabet represents a nice compromise between these two spectrums.\n\nFirst, Alphabet kept the development of its generative AI model in house. This is critical, as problems will eventually arise with any model. (For Alphabet's Gemini, several problems already arose and were corrected.) For tech giants like Microsoft or Apple to not develop their own generative AI model seems a tad lazy and could potentially cause them problems down the road. I think Alphabet's strategy gives it a leg up on many of its competitors.\n\nOn the hardware front, Alphabet is a major buyer of Nvidia graphics processing units, but it also developed its own chips that are tailor-made for training and running AI models. While Nvidia's GPUs are fantastic for general-purpose AI training or workloads, clients can get better performance if they use hardware developed with AI model training in mind. That's where Alphabet's Google Cloud tensor processing units (TPUs) enter. Because TPUs were specifically created to run AI workloads, they are more efficient and faster than Nvidia's GPUs for training AI models.\n\nHowever, workloads must be set up in a particular fashion to benefit from using TPUs, so Nvidia GPUs will continue to be popular (which is why Google Cloud has so many of them). But as businesses become more familiar with creating AI models, Google Cloud's TPUs may see a surge in popularity. With this hardware only available to Google Cloud customers, it gives Alphabet another layer of AI exposure.\n\nAlphabet is also an avid user of AI. It long used AI to understand website content to increase the probability that Google's search results are giving users what they are looking for. Additionally, it has used AI to identify patterns to better target their ads to their viewers.\n\nLastly, Alphabet has many tools for the developers of AI models. This is critical, as any developer who uses Alphabet's tools will likely be locked into Alphabet's ecosystem, which will allow Alphabet to extract maximum value from them.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese are just some reasons why I believe Alphabet is a top AI stock to own. But the price at which you can buy it now is also compelling.\n\nAlphabet's stock doesn't carry a big price tag\n\nUnlike many of the other companies I've mentioned, Alphabet isn't trading at an outrageous premium. Because many tech companies are experiencing drastic changes to their bottom lines thanks to AI-related demand, let's use the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to assess their relative valuations. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nBy using the S&P 500 as a broad market index to compare these valuations, we can get an idea of how expensive they are compared to the broader market. With the S&P 500 trading at 21.7 times forward earnings, Alphabet is hardly given a premium compared to the other three.\n\nWhile Nvidia is in a league of its own regarding growth, Alphabet's growth rates are similar to Microsoft's and much faster than Apple's, making it a much more attractive stock to own.\n\nAlphabet is a fantastic AI stock, no matter how you assess it. While a proper portfolio is filled with many stocks, Alphabet would be at the top of my shopping list if I had to choose just one.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AI enthusiasm prompts 3 Wall Street banks to raise stock market forecasts",
        "content": "The excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has yet to run its course on Wall Street.\n\nThree analysts recently upgraded their forecasts for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) amid early signs that investments in generative AI are driving earnings growth at large-cap tech companies.\n\nOn Sunday, Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 6,000 from 4,750, noting the \"AI revolution is in the early innings.\" Emanuel's target is the highest on Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200 on Friday. Goldman highlighted that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCiti's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, struck a similar tone, boosting its end target to 5,600 from 5,100 on Monday. The analysts noted that the market would have trended toward their prior target had it not been for outsized performance from large-cap tech.\n\n\"The generative AI influence as an ongoing incremental growth driver is permeating the US equity environment right now,\" Chronert wrote.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the S&P 500's nearly 15% gain this year is attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia, according to Citi.\n\nIf this \"megacap exceptionalism\" continues, Goldman's model shows the S&P 500 could end the year at 6,300. This would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\"\n\nBarclays head US equity strategist Venu Krishna currently holds a 5,300 call on the S&P 500 but also noted that continued outperformance from tech provides upside risk to his target and could result in a bull-case scenario with the S&P 500 ending the year above 6,000.\n\nKrishna told Yahoo Finance that he's been asked for more than a year whether a small group of stocks can continue to drive the market higher.\n\n\"The answer is yes, it is possible,\" Krishna said. \"We are in that environment.\" A sign for a Nvidia building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMarket concentration\n\nThe top-heavy market has some concerned that the rally is too narrow. However, strategists say this shouldn't deter investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnider noted it's important for investors to remember that if the trend of large-cap tech leading the S&P 500 higher continues, a narrow rally with only a few stocks leading the market higher is a feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\n\"This is part of the beauty of the S&P 500 ... When a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now.\"\n\nThere is also risk AI enthusiasm has driven stock valuations too high. JPMorgan chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic, who has stuck by Wall Street's most bearish year-end S&P 500 target of 4,200, noted on June 3 that equity valuations are \"rich\" while sentiment is \"near highs.\"\n\nAnd Kolanovic has a point. Emanuel at Evercore ISI pointed out that with the S&P 500 trading above 20 times its forward earnings estimates, the index is \"expensive\" on a historical basis. But what sticks out to Emanuel is how long stocks can stay at those levels.\n\nThe S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio crossed 20 143 days ago, per Emanuel. In the 2021 economic reopening frenzy, the S&P 500 traded at similar valuation levels for 614 days. During the dot-com boom, the S&P 500 lasted at those levels for 737 days.\n\nEmanuel notes this shows that \"high valuations can remain higher for longer.\" And with that could come further returns.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Don't count software out of Gen-AI - Goldman",
        "content": "Investing.com - A number of high-profile software companies offered up weak forward-looking guidance during the last quarter’s earnings season, but Goldman Sachs has advised investors not to rule the sector out of the excitement surrounding Gen-AI.\n\nThe influential investment bank noted the unusual strength in fourth-quarter results of 2023 for several software companies coinciding with expectations for rate cuts and slowing inflation. Those expectations changed very sharply in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offered up reasonably healthy numbers last week, but the likes of Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) recently forecast disappointing first-quarter product revenue on expectations that customers would cut back on spending in an uncertain economy.\n\nThis news came despite accelerating hyperscaler growth, raising the question of whether the issues driving weaker demand are cyclical or structural.\n\nHyperscalers are large cloud service providers, which can provide services such as computing and storage at enterprise scale, and include the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe divergence between hyperscaler acceleration and deceleration in enterprise software has been notable, said analysts at Goldman Sachs said, in a note dated June 3, as the hyperscalers have been able to invest considerable amounts of incremental capital in order to generate revenues from generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI).\n\n“We estimate the incremental capital spending above regular cloud CapEx to be in the annual run rate of $60 to $80 billion. This has driven an estimated incremental Gen-AI related revenues in the $14 to $16 billion range,” Goldman said.\n\nThe global software industry is now pushing $700 billion and is one of the largest capital spending items, if not the largest, which makes it susceptible to high cost of capital.\n\nThere is a reasonable case to be made that new AI priorities have pushed aside consideration for more mature well-established spending items, the bank added. Software has always been about productivity and now a cognition aspect has been added, which changes the value proposition and sales cycles as a result.\n\nThis raises the question whether hardware is finally disrupting software, after software dominated for much of the last decade.\n\nTo answer this, Goldman pointed out that tech cycles tend to follow a pattern - at first, the cycle is about infrastructure build out. Then there are platforms that allow the best use of that infrastructure, while providing building blocks to build next generation applications, and the final leg is the build out of applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In order for any tech cycle to be successful, there has to be a killer application,” Goldman said, citing enterprise resource planning in the late 90s, search and e-commerce during the dot-com bubble, and cloud applications following the Great Financial Crisis.\"\n\n“In each of these cycles the value creation started with the infrastructure layer and moved to platforms and applications,” Goldman said. “In the case of generative AI, we are still waiting for a killer application or a few that can produce results at scale for different end user domains, be it front office, middle office or back office.”\n\nWhile the pace of Gen-AI technology continues to evolve, it is not quite to the point where the killer applications are obvious today.\n\nA big difference in this cycle of generative AI is that while the incumbents in the prior client server cycle were slow to adopt the cloud, the application software incumbents in this cycle, be it Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP (ETR:SAPG), Oracle, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Adobe, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) or Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), are developing Gen-AI products with a heightened sense of urgency.\n\nAdditionally, data will be a critical element for the success for an AI company, and the data incumbency advantage enjoyed by companies like Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Snowflake cannot be taken too lightly.\n\nApplication software companies are trading at cyclically depressed valuation multiples, the bank said, and it is a concerning time.\n\n“We do believe that in the short-term, the cyclical aspect of higher rates, if alleviated, will cause buying cycles to ease up and therefore the demand picture for the group should get better in the subsequent quarters,” Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe companies that take generative AI technology architectures more seriously and are open to the thorough examination and re-architecting of their platforms will end up being successful.\n\nAfter all, a surprising amount of the shareholder value creation from 2010 to 2020 came from incumbent software companies such as Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit, and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), who embraced the changing technology and business models much to the surprise of investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDon't count software out of Gen-AI - Goldman\n\nSnap launches AI tools for advanced augmented reality\n\nGoldman: Mixed signals in labor market could impact rate cuts path\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its Harmony mobile operating system, underscoring its growing confidence in competing with Apple Inc. in the world’s largest smartphone arena.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan S&P 500 Hits 30th Record of 2024 as Megacaps Rally: Markets Wrap These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company is weighing a commission lower than the typical 30% cut that Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google take for payments made via their mobile stores for things like apps, games, movies and music subscriptions, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei has kept Harmony OS fee-free until now, as an enticement to bring developers and publishers on board.\n\nFor games in particular, which account for the majority of mobile app store revenue, Huawei has been discussing a fee of about 20% with developers, the people said. They asked not to be identified as the information is private. Rival Android store operators in China, such as Xiaomi Corp., charge as much as 50% on in-game purchases. Huawei has not yet made a final decision and its plans could still change, according to the people.\n\nHuawei’s imminent move suggests the Chinese tech conglomerate feels it has grown its user and developer base to the point where it can begin collecting rent. The company shifted to its in-house Harmony OS after US sanctions cut it off from working with Google, the proprietor of Android.\n\nA company spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe envisioned commissions would still place Huawei’s 4-year-old Harmony ecosystem below market competitors. The company has to convince both users and app makers to embrace its third option, after Apple’s iPhone software and Google’s Android, though it has made strong progress over the past year with its return to prominence in China’s premium market.\n\nHuawei has seen increased demand for its 5G smartphones after it released the Mate 60 Pro with an advanced China-made chip last year. Its net profit rose 564% in the first quarter as it took market share from Apple and others. Its Harmony OS also overtook iOS in terms of market share in China in the January-March period, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui, Zheping Huang and Ben Scent.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump’s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn Coke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) closed the most recent trading day at $177.24, moving +0.25% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.49%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.95%.\n\nThe internet search leader's stock has climbed by 0.41% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.05% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.71%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.85, up 28.47% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $70.55 billion, indicating a 13.67% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.60 per share and revenue of $295.53 billion. These totals would mark changes of +31.03% and +15.21%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.63% higher. As of now, Alphabet holds a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 23.25. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.68.\n\nInvestors should also note that GOOGL has a PEG ratio of 1.33 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Services industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.13.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 94, positioning it in the top 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups.

        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) closed the most recent trading day at $178.78, moving +0.23% from the previous trading session. This move lagged the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.77%. Meanwhile, the Dow gained 0.49%, and the Nasdaq, a tech-heavy index, added 0.95%.\n\nThe company's stock has climbed by 0.61% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 3.05% and lagging the S&P 500's gain of 3.71%.\n\nAnalysts and investors alike will be keeping a close eye on the performance of Alphabet Inc. in its upcoming earnings disclosure. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.87, up 29.86% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $70.55 billion, indicating a 13.67% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $7.69 per share and revenue of $291.26 billion. These totals would mark changes of +32.59% and +13.55%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Alphabet Inc. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. As a result, we can interpret positive estimate revisions as a good sign for the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research reveals that these estimate alterations are directly linked with the stock price performance in the near future. To exploit this, we've formed the Zacks Rank, a quantitative model that includes these estimate changes and presents a viable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Within the past 30 days, our consensus EPS projection has moved 0.62% higher. As of now, Alphabet Inc. holds a Zacks Rank of #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Alphabet Inc. is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 23.19. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 22.68.\n\nInvestors should also note that GOOG has a PEG ratio of 1.32 right now. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Services industry held an average PEG ratio of 2.13.\n\nThe Internet - Services industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. Currently, this industry holds a Zacks Industry Rank of 94, positioning it in the top 38% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nBe sure to follow all of these stock-moving metrics, and many more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Big Tech Wants Nuclear Power But Doesn’t See Role as Investor",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Big technology companies including Microsoft Corp. and Google are eager to see more nuclear energy feeding their power-hungry data centers, but are far less willing to provide the capital needed to pay for a growing interest in reactors.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan S&P 500 Hits 30th Record of 2024 as Megacaps Rally: Markets Wrap These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid\n\nWhile artificial intelligence and data centers are expected to boost power consumption in the US for the first time in a generation, the companies that need the energy told attendees at the American Nuclear Society’s annual conference that they’re poorly positioned to help develop new reactors.\n\nBuilding reactors, especially plants using new technologies, comes with high costs and high risk, according to Briana Kobor, head of energy market innovation at Alphabet Inc.’s Google. The big tech companies may be willing to pay a reasonable premium for clean energy that’s available around the clock, but they’re not willing to invest in the firms building those plants.\n\n“We are advocates for nuclear power,” Kobor said during a panel discussion Monday at the Las Vegas conference. “The entities best suited to take on timeline risk and construction risk are not the offtakers.”\n\nThe discussion comes a day after billionaire Bill Gates said he’s willing to invest billions in a next-generation nuclear plant in Wyoming. TerraPower LLC, which is backed by the co-founder of Microsoft, broke ground on the facility last week.\n\nGates’s support will be key, yet the project underscores the risk that comes with nuclear power. TerraPower expects to complete the reactor in 2030, two years behind the schedule the company laid out when it announced its plans in 2021. Meanwhile, in Georgia, Southern Co. finished in April the first new US nuclear power projects in decades, seven years behind schedule and about 150% over budget.\n\nTechnology companies should focus on their strength, building data centers, and rely on utilities to deliver the power, said Adrian Anderson, general manager for energy and sustainability at Microsoft.\n\nIf a data center needs clean wind power, the operator should reach out to a utility, not a wind-turbine provider. “The notion that individual buyers should be assessing nuclear technology for risk is a ridiculous concept,” Anderson said during the panel.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere are dozens of companies developing new reactor designs, but they are going to need significant financial support to move their technologies from the research stage to a commercial power plant. Despite their shared goal of seeing more reactors in service, big tech companies aren’t likely to be big financial backers, according to Peter Freed, who stepped down in June from his post as director of energy strategy at Facebook’s parent Meta Platforms Inc.\n\n“The notion that technology companies are going to come in to write a check and save the day is misguided,” said Freed.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump’s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn It Will Take More Than US Bargaining Power to Cut Drug Costs Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cybercriminals are demanding payments of between $300,000 and $5 million apiece from as many as 10 companies breached in a campaign that targeted Snowflake Inc. customers, according to a security firm helping with the investigation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas S&P 500 Races Toward 30th All-Time High of 2024: Markets Wrap\n\nThe hacking scheme has entered a “new stage” as the gang looks to profit from the most valuable information it has stolen, said Austin Larsen, a senior threat analyst at Google’s Mandiant security business, which helped lead Snowflake’s inquiry. That includes auctioning companies’ data on illegal online forums to try to pressure them into making payments, he said.\n\n“We anticipate the actor to continue to attempt to extort victims,” Larsen said.\n\nSnowflake, a cloud-based data analytics firm, said on June 2 that hackers had launched a “targeted” effort directed against Snowflake users that used single-factor authentication techniques. The company declined to comment on any specific customers.\n\nThe hacking group used stolen login details to access the Snowflake accounts of as many as 165 Snowflake customers and steal data, Larsen said. It has used the stolen information in attempts to extort money from five to 10 of Snowflake’s customers, he said. It wasn’t immediately clear which of Snowflake’s clients have been affected.\n\nMandiant has attributed the attack to a group it calls “UNC5537,” with members based in the US and Turkey. Larsen said members of the gang have made death threats against cybersecurity experts investigating it. In one case, UNC5537 used artificial intelligence to create fake nude photos of a researcher to harass them, Larsen said.\n\nMandiant said it was investigating the “possibility” that a UNC5337 hacker collaborated with a diffuse cybercriminal group known as “Scattered Spider” on at least one intrusion within the past six months, however the nature of such a relationship remains murky. Cybersecurity vendor CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. assigned the Scattered Spider name to the group, which functions as a loose community.\n\nIllicit data brokers are now seeking prices above typical black-market rates for the data stolen from Snowflake customers, possibly in the hopes of pressuring the affected firms to pay a ransom, Larsen said. Snowflake has said it plans to close its internal investigation into the hacking campaign and that it hadn’t detected any unauthorized access into its customers’ servers in recent days.\n\nStory continues\n\nTicketmaster owner Live Nation Entertainment Inc. said it had discovered “unauthorized access” within a third-party cloud database, which a person familiar with the matter said was hosted on Snowflake.\n\nSince then, Pure Storage Inc. has also disclosed that it experienced a breach of a Snowflake workspace. Advanced Auto Parts said it was investigating reports that the company may have experienced Snowflake-related issues.\n\nMandiant plans to release new guidance on Monday to help companies investigate data theft linked to the hacking campaign, according to a draft of the report reviewed by Bloomberg.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump’s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy It Will Take More Than US Bargaining Power to Cut Drug Costs\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "If you're an investment manager and you tout the stocks you own, it's called talking your book. I try not to do too much of it in this column. But once a year I write about the stocks I own personally and for most of my clients.\n\nHere we go with the 2024 version. To begin with, I'm naked in two of the 11 industry sectors recognized by Standard & Poor's -- real estate and utilities. I believe that the problems in commercial real estate will take at least another year to work out, and I can't find any utilities I like.\n\nHere are my holdings in the remaining nine sectors.\n\nCommunications\n\nI have only one holding here: Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL). It falls into this sector because it owns Google and You Tube. In addition it owns Waymo, a leader in self-driving cars, and Deep Mind, a firm specializing in artificial intelligence.\n\nConsumer Discretionary\n\nI own Meritage Homes Corp. (NYSE:MTH). I believe that the demand for single-family houses is at least a million units higher than the supply, which will become clear if and when mortgage rates come down a peg.\n\nConsumer Staples\n\nTwo holdings here: Cal-Maine Foods Inc. (NASDAQ:CALM) and Costco Wholesale Corp. (NASDAQ:COST). The former is the largest U.S. egg producer. The latter was the pioneer in big-box retailing with a membership structure.\n\nCal-Maine is debt free and pays a rich dividend in good years. Costco has grown profits at better than a 12% annual clip over the past decade.\n\nEnergy\n\nEnergy was the star sector in 2022. It also roared in the early 2000s, and I did so well in the sector then that I'm probably more emotionally attached to it than I should be. I own Diamondback Energy Inc. (NASDAQ:FANG) and TotalEnergies SE (NYSE:TTE). Total is based in France and is active in solar and wind as well as oil.\n\nFinancials\n\nOn the large end, I own shares in Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK.B), Warren Buffett (Trades, Portfolio)'s redoubt. I agree with the consensus opinion that Buffett is a genius. In addition, I think he's assembled a good succession team.\n\nOn the small end, I hold International Money Express Inc. (NASDAQ:IMXI), which helps Latin Americans working in the U.S. to send money to their relatives back home.\n\nIndustrials\n\nOver the years, I've often been partial to industrial stocks, and right now I have seven in my model portfolio. General Dynamics Corp. (NYSE:GD), a leading defense contractor, appeals to me because of the palpable threats from China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.\n\nSterling infrastructure Inc. (NASDAQ:STRL) has been my biggest success in recent years. It has quintupled. I don't expect such dramatic gains from here on, but I do think some further advance is likely, since the U.S. needs better bridges and tunnels.\n\nStory continues\n\nMatson Inc. (NYSE:MATX), an ocean shipper based in Hawaii, is up 61% in the 12 months through June 14. Again, I expect future gains to be more moderate.\n\nSnap On Inc. (NYSE:SNA) provides tools to car repair shops. I bought it a little over two years ago. I still like it, but am considering a possible sale, since electric cars require less maintenance than traditional gasoline-fueled cars.\n\nI've made small allocations to a trio of agricultural stocks. Agco Corp. (NYSE:AGCO) make tractors and sells all sorts of farming supplies. FMC Corp. (NYSE:FMC) produces fungicides, herbicides and insecticides. Lindsay Corp. (NYSE:LNN) does irrigation systems.\n\nMaterials\n\nPrimarily because of high international tensions, I own a little gold in the form of SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD), an exchange-traded fund that represents ownership of the physical metal.\n\nTechnology\n\nThe tech sector has led the market for most of the past five years. Here my clients and I carry six stocks: Apple Inc. (AAPL), Arista Networks Inc. (ANET), Jabil Inc. (JBL), KLA Corp. (KLAC), Lam Research (LRCX) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (TSM).\n\nAs a value investor, it's always been hard for me to find cheap stocks among the tech names. But I am willing to pay a little extra for good companies in this sector.\n\nCorrection\n\nIn my 2023-24 stock picking contest, Dorfman's Three-Stock Derby, I overlooked one entry. Richard La Chapelle, a retired English teacher from Escanaba, Michigan, should have placed second with an 81.60% return.\n\nHe picked Nvidia Corp. (NVDA), up 144%, Palantir Technologies Inc. (PLTR), up 75%, and Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), up 26%. Currently he says he is lighter than usual in stocks, partly because the market often struggles during Presidential election years.\n\nDisclosure: Katharine Davidge, my wife and a portfolio manager at my firm, owns Nvidia and Microsoft personally and for her clients.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, and a syndicated columnist. His firm or clients may own or trade securities discussed in this column. He can be reached at jdorfman@dorfmanvalue.com.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 26.7% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 10.3%. The company is benefiting from the strong Google Services segment. It is making concerted efforts to bolster this segment further on the back of strengthening Google Chrome and Android features.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are evident from Alphabet’s latest addition of a “Listen to this page” text-to-speech feature on Google Chrome for Android. The feature will open on Android’s three-dot overflow menu, tapping on which will open a sheet UI with a timeline scrubber, rewind/fast forward buttons, playback speed adjustment, highlight text & auto-scroll, and voice options.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s roll-out of “Minimized Custom Tabs” for Google Chrome on Android remains noteworthy. These tabs shrink webpages into Picture-in-Picture windows, enabling multitasking and seamless transition between native apps and web content.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are expected to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser. This, in turn, will continue to aid Google in capitalizing on growth opportunities present in the global search engine market, which, per a Dataintelo report, is expected to witness a CAGR of 11% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nMoreover, growing Chrome efforts will aid Alphabet in sustaining its dominance in the global search engine market against its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making concerted efforts to rival Alphabet in the same market.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft's Edge browser is gaining popularity as it offers a modern, fast and intuitive experience compared to Chrome. It uses AI and a refreshed design, offering a personalized and straightforward experience. Edge also enables secure browsing with features like Microsoft Defender SmartScreen, Password Monitor, InPrivate search, and Kids Mode. It also provides usability features like smart shopping AI pop-ups.\r\n\r\nApple, on the other hand, is testing an upgrade of its Safari web browser with UI tweaks, advanced content blocking, and Intelligent Search. The software, expected to launch in 2024, will feature a new user interface, a \"Web eraser\" feature and AI-driven content summarization tools.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution",
        "content": "With a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds the title of the largest publicly traded company globally. Following its acquisition of OpenAI, the software giant has aggressively expanded its customer base and significantly enhanced its overall performance. The company's shares have surged in recent quarters, surpassing expectations and delivering substantial returns. I expect this trend to persist, as Microsoft continues to lead in the artificial intelligence space and invest heavily in new AI initiatives, building on the success achieved with OpenAI.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nFigure 1: Microsoft shares have surged since late 2023 Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nMicrosoft has strategically positioned itself ahead of its competitors through massive research and development spending, large acquisitions and strategic partnerships with external companies. These maneuvers have provided the company with a competitive edge, enabling it to outshine rivals and roll out AI services to end users more quickly and effectively. The intensifying competition between Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) updated Gemini and OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 underscores the evolving landscape of generative AI. As more multi-modal interactive platforms are launched, it is clear we are witnessing a three-horse race in the generative AI arena. Microsoft is likely to benefit temporarily from its early investments in OpenAI, solidifying its position as a leader in the field.\n\nThe driver behind Microsoft's cloud dominance\n\nMicrosoft is actively deploying AI-as-a-service features on its Azure cloud computing platform, which has become one of the company's largest revenue generators, surpassing even its Office software suite. The launch of Azure in 2010 marked a pivotal change in the company's revenue trajectory. Seven years post-launch, it saw significant revenue jumps, largely driven by the success of Azure. This trend continues today, with Microsoft's cloud computing services contributing substantially to its financial growth.\n\nFigure 2: Azure has been the key driver of Microsoft's revenue growth Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nGiven Azure's significant contribution to Microsoft's revenue, it is crucial for the company to continuously attract new customers to sustain the expected growth. Microsoft is well-positioned to achieve this, as evidenced by Azure's capture of 25% of the cloud market, even as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has seen a slight decline in market share. The ongoing cloud super-cycle and the generative AI boom have been key factors in Azure's growing market share, which now stands at 25%, gradually closing the gap with AWS, which holds 31%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFigure 3: Azure inches closer to market leader AWS Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith the increasing demand for cloud services and AI capabilities, Microsoft is poised to continue exceeding market expectations. Azure's robust performance and strategic advancements ensure it remains a critical component of the company's overall success, reinforcing its leadership in the rapidly evolving cloud and AI industries.\n\nStrategic moves\n\nMicrosoft made headlines with its substantial acquisition of a significant stake in OpenAI back in 2019, initially investing $1 billion. Since then, the company has invested an additional $10 billion into this partnership. Beyond this major investment, it has also made several other notable investments in cloud computing and AI in recent months.\n\nJust in the past two months, Microsoft announced a series of strategic investments: $2.9 billion in Japan to open a research center in Tokyo, $1.5 billion in the United Arab Emirates for a stake in AI company G42 and infrastructure and $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to build a manufacturing-focused AI research lab, among others. More recently, the company announced it they will invest $3.2 billion to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Sweden over a two-year period. Additionally, Microsoft's venture capital fund, M12, has taken positions in several private AI companies. One of the most notable moves was a $650 million stake in Inflection AI, co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Suleyman, a prominent figure in the AI space, is now the head of AI at Microsoft.\n\nFigure 4: Generative AI to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032 (according to a Bloomberg study) Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSouce: Bloomberg\n\nWith the generative AI market expected to exceed $1 trillion in value within the next decade and global IT spending is forecasted to grow at 8% this year, Microsoft is well-positioned to scale its business significantly. These strategic investments provide the company with numerous catalysts to drive growth and solidify its leadership in the AI industry for the foreseeable future.\n\nFinancial performance and outlook\n\nIn its earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, which was released last month, Microsoft reported a remarkable 17.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $61.90 billion. The company's GAAP earnings per share were $2.94. The operating margin expanded significantly from 42.30% to 44.60%, demonstrating substantial improvement for a company of its scale. This growth was achieved despite costs associated with the acquisition of Activision and an accounting change related to the useful life and depreciation of certain data center equipment. Both the top-line and bottom-line results exceeded expectations.\n\nFigure 5: Third-quarter earnings summary Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nA key driver of this performance was the accelerating growth of the Intelligent Cloud segment, Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing business, which saw a 21% year-over-year increase to $26.70 billion, with operating margins expanding to 46.80% (up 4 points). Additionally, search and news advertising revenue grew by 3.30% year over year to $3.13 billion, aided by the market share gains of OpenAI-powered Bing, which reached 3.64% of the search engine market as of April 2024. As a result of these strong performances, Microsoft's quarterly levered free cash flow increased from $13.50 billion to $16.90 billion, despite a $4.30 billion increase in capital expenditures.\n\nFigure 6: Intelligent Cloud segment revenue and operating income performance Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nRevenue growth is crucial for Microsoft's future success, particularly as the costs of training new AI models and improving Azure, its primary AI delivery method, continue to rise. The company has demonstrated robust growth over the past few years, with mid-teens growth in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Microsoft is expected to continue exceeding expectations, with projected revenue of $64.40 billion, indicating 14.60% year over year expected growth. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to grow from $2.69 to $2.93, reflecting improved operating leverage. A significant driver of this growth is its flagship AI product, Copilot, which has been instrumental in scaling subscriptions and generating sales. As Copilot gains traction, Microsoft has announced new functions for its AI assistant, which could create new streams of recurring revenue. Additionally, the integration of GPT-4o into Bing is expected to attract more users and expand Microsoft's share in the search market. Bing recently captured over 10% of the search market, suggesting that Google's monopoly is being challenged.\n\nAccording to management guidance, full-year operating margins are expected to increase by over 2 points despite cloud and AI investments, the impact of the Activision acquisition and changes in useful life accounting. This margin expansion highlights Microsoft's efficiency and disciplined cost management, with expectations for continued growth in cloud and AI investments next year, which are high-margin revenue streams. The same trajectory of margin improvement is anticipated into 2025, driven by these factors.\n\nBeyond the impressive revenue and margin figures, Microsoft's free cash flow is a standout financial strength. The company is cash-rich with an $80 billion cash pile supporting its acquisition and talent hiring strategies. Last 12 months free cash flow generation reached $70.57 billion (up 22.90% sequentially), enabling aggressive partnerships and M&A activities, including the recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. While there was a reduction last year, the company is on track to outperform and increase its free cash flow this year, providing ample resources for future acquisitions. The gap between cash from operations and free cash flow has widened as management has invested heavily in cloud and AI infrastructure, suggesting that FCF could expand much faster in the medium to long term once the infrastructure build-out is completed.\n\nFigure 7: CFO, FCF and capex progression  Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nMicrosoft has committed substantial resources to research and development and capital expenditures, with last 12-month R&D expenses of $28.19 billion (up 3.20% sequentially) and capital expenditures of $39.54 billion (up 51.9% sequentially). These investments ensure Microsoft remains well-capitalized to pursue growth opportunities. Management's commitment to sustaining momentum in the cloud and AI business is evident from the rapid ramp-up in investments in these areas.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, Microsoft had $80 billion in cash and short-term investments and $65.44 billion in long-term debt. The company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio stands at 0.60, indicating strong financial health and the ability to pay down its long-term debt efficiently.\n\nThoughts on valuation\n\nAlthough Microsoft has significant potential upside if its generative AI goals go according to plan, the stock is currently not the most affordable despite being a sensible long-term investment. It is important to note long-term plays often require substantial time to yield returns. Despite the numerous growth catalysts in its favor, the current share price offers little margin of safety to warrant a bullish rating at this juncture. While Microsoft's business has performed exceptionally well and is likely to continue thriving, there are questions about whether it is prudent to purchase shares at the current levels. Various valuation methods indicate that none provide a sufficient margin to justify buying at the current price. Even with aggressive estimates for Microsoft's growth rates, margins and free cash flow generation, it is challenging to justify a long position solely based on fundamentals.\n\nFigure 8: Microsoft's current valuations lack sufficient upside margins Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: valueinvesting.io\n\nFurther, Microsoft might face more intense competition in its AI business from both large companies within the Magnificent Seven and smaller, emerging players. Although the tech company is perceived as an AI leader today, this may not hold true five or 10 years from now. Additionally, economic uncertainties persist, with inflation remaining high and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates still on the table. Microsoft's substantial spending on building its cloud platform and AI tools could be viewed unfavorably by investors if the economy deteriorates.\n\nGiven these factors, I am not assigning a buy rating to Microsoft's shares at the current price. Therefore, I recommend a hold on the stock and will monitor the price action closely. Should there be any negative movements while the current fundamentals persist, it might swing my recommendation to a buy at a lower price.\n\nConclusion\n\nMicrosoft's impressive financial performance, strategic investments in AI and cloud computing and robust growth outlook underscore its potential for long-term success. However, given the current valuation and economic uncertainties, the stock lacks a sufficient margin of safety to justify a bullish rating at present.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 3.8% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +29.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.5% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.69 points to a change of +32.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.6%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.71 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates indicate +13.6% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mega-cap technology stocks will see a \"material\" increase in expenditures in 2024 as they push to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities.\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, the analysts predicted that Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will see annual capital spending on servers and equipment jump by 43% compared to the prior year to $91 billion. Overall estimated expenditures will rise by 35% year on year to $145 billion, the analysts projected.\n\nOf the three companies, the BofA analysts said they expect Meta to spend the most as a percentage of revenue, adding that the investment \"should ensure [its] AI capabilities are best of breed.\" Investors will subsequently be keen to see if Meta can churn out any new products from its AI spending, the analysts noted.\n\nThey said markets should also be looking for employee reductions at these firms to help offset the impact of the higher expenditures, with the rate of workforce growth tipped to slow to an average yearly uptick of 3%. From 2016 to 2022, headcount grew by 26% on average.\n\nDespite forecasting the surge in spending, the analysts retained their positive view of the AI cycle for the tech industry, saying they anticipated that average free cash flow margins for Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon will be stable in 2024 and expand in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMega-cap tech stocks to see steep jump in annual spending on AI equipment - BofA\n\nEU regulators to decide on Bunge and Viterra's $34 billion deal by July 18\n\nEarnings call: MSC Industrial Supply revises full-year outlook amid sales dip\n\nView comments",

In contrast, the profit forecast for the other 495 stocks in the index have been reduced by 5%.\n\nConsensus 2024 forecasts imply a 31 percentage point gap between EPS growth for these five stocks and the median S&P 500 firm (37% vs. 6%), Goldman said, but this gap is expected to narrow to 8 percentage points in 2025 and 4 percentage points in 2026.\n\nThe bank now expects the current bottom-up consensus 2025 EPS estimate will be lowered by just 2% through year-end, half the average historical revision.\n\n“We expect revisions to consensus S&P 500 EPS estimates will continue to be milder-than-average through year-end given the upward revisions to mega-cap tech earnings that have already taken place this year,” the bank said.\n\n“However, we maintain our earnings forecasts for 2024, as we believe consensus margin estimates for next year remain too optimistic.”\n\nLooking ahead, the bank's valuation model suggests the S&P 500 P/E will be 20.4x by year-end, 3% below the current multiple of 21.1x. Strong consensus 2025 earnings growth and a roughly unchanged real yield imply a year-end 2024 fair value P/E multiple of 15x for the equal-weight S&P 500.\n\nThe election remains a key risk to the S&P 500 level and falls between our 3-month and year-end forecast horizons, the bank said.\n\nHistorically, during election years index volatility has increased before the election and the S&P 500 index has declined by 4% between late October and early November. Nevertheless, volatility typically subsides and the index rebounds to an even higher level following the election.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks edged higher; BOE meeting, inflation data due this week\n\nUBS sets aside $900 million to repay investors in collapsed Greensill funds\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liberal States in the US and in this article, we will talk about 20 Most Liberal states in the US.\n\nOverview of Liberalism in the United States and Its Stronghold in Massachusetts\n\nThe United States has been a major proponent and defender of liberal values globally, although its commitment to upholding these values has fluctuated over time. Since the 1930s, modern liberalism in the US has been associated with support for a regulated market economy, expansion of civil and political rights, and government programs aimed at promoting social welfare and equality. Key achievements of this liberal tradition include the New Deal policies under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Great Society programs under Lyndon B. Johnson, and landmark civil rights legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe University of Richmond claims that political usage of the term \"liberalism\" dates back to the early 1800s. It first appeared in 1810–1811 when a group of Spanish Cortes dubbed themselves \"Liberales\" and promoted an open, tolerant society with less intervention. The phrase then made its way to France and Great Britain, where, by the 1840s, the Whigs had transformed into the Liberal Party.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center research, conservatives want big homes in rural or small-town settings, preferably with other members of their own religious community. Liberals, on the other hand, want thriving urban environments with compact housing, pedestrian-friendly streets, and a diversified populace. According to the survey, 35% of consistently conservative people prefer small towns, while 41% of people prefer living in rural areas. On the other hand, 46% of consistently liberal people would rather live in the city. In both groups, about 20% prefer living in the suburbs.\n\nAs the most liberal state in the union, Massachusetts has always supported the Democratic Party in presidential elections since 1964, with 35% of its citizens identifying as liberal. Only 16% of Massachusetts lawmakers' votes in 2020 reflected conservative viewpoints on topics including corporate tax increases and abortion access, according to a report by the Center for Legislative Accountability, making them the most liberal in the country.\n\nMajor Liberal Companies\n\nCompanies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), among others, are known for their liberalism. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports LGBTQ+ rights and offers comprehensive benefits for transgender employees. In 2022, Amazon's global activities resulted in a total tax contribution of $77.99 billion across different regions. Amazon has invested over $530 billion in the U.S. over the past decade, creating 1.6 million indirect jobs. Small and medium businesses make up 60% of Amazon's product sales, creating an estimated 2.2 million jobs. In Q1 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s net sales increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and AWS revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% year-over-year, up from 13.2% in Q4 2023. Their Advertising revenue grew over 23% year-over-year to $11.7 billion in the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has often been portrayed as a progressive and liberal company, particularly after its controversial ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick in 2018. In the 2018 election cycle, Nike employees and its PAC contributed $424,000 to Republicans compared to only $122,000 to Democrats. This means 78% of Nike's political contributions went to the Republican party. Over the past decade, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)has consistently given a majority of its political donations to Republicans, ranging from 59% to 76% in various election cycles. In 2024, Nike Inc. spent $410,000 on lobbying efforts. Nike’s Greater China revenue grew 12% in Q1, with Nike Direct up 10% and Nike Stores up 12%.\n\nLast but not least, Google, the tech giant and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), has long been perceived as a liberal-leaning company, particularly due to its employees' political contributions favoring Democratic candidates and causes. In the 2022 election cycle, the Google Inc. PAC contributed $452,000 (52.83%) to Democratic candidates and $401,500 (46.93%) to Republicans. This trend has been observed in previous election cycles as well, with Google employees donating $207,650 to federal candidates in 2004, primarily favoring Democrats. In Q1 2024 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s total revenue was $80.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Their Google Services revenue was $70.4 billion, up 14% YoY, Google Cloud revenue was $9.6 billion, up 28% YoY, and YouTube Ads revenue was $8 billion, up 21%. YoY. The Most Liberal State in the US\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we ranked the most liberal states based on their liberal-to-conservative ratios, using the percentages available from 2019 due to the absence of more recent data. For example, if a state has 35% of its population identifying as liberal and 21% as conservative, the ratio is calculated as 35/21, resulting in approximately 1.6. States with the highest ratios are considered the most liberal.\n\n1. Massachusetts\n\nLiberal-to-Conservative Ratio: 1.60\n\nMassachusetts tops the list for being the most liberal state in the US. 35% of the state's population identifies as liberals which is the highest in the country. In contrast, only 21% identify as conservative. The state has liberal policies on abortion rights, with the procedure legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also has strict gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban and regulations on purchasing and licensing firearms. The state is largely known for its robust social safety net, including universal healthcare coverage through its healthcare reform law that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act. Both U.S. Senators from Massachusetts are Democrats (Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey).\n\nTo learn about other most liberal states in the US, you can check out our detailed report 20 Most Liberal States in the US.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI come to you today from a hotel room at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in France, readying to drop a ton of on-air, investor-friendly content for Yahoo Finance this week alongside esteemed colleague Rachelle Akuffo.\n\nWe'll be catching up with companies in attendance, including Spotify (SPOT), Pinterest (PINS), Meta (META), and Google (GOOG).\n\nKeep up with the action from Yahoo Finance here.\n\nNow, while I am on the topic of tech meets beach and loud music...\n\nThere have been lots headlines the past several weeks on Silicon Valley increasingly tossing support to former President Donald Trump (which has upset many on the left).\n\nNoted tech entrepreneur David Sacks threw a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco earlier this month that reportedly netted millions for his presidential campaign.\n\nBefore that, on May 30, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire uncorked a lengthy post on X, voicing support for Trump.\n\n\"I just donated $300k to Trump. I’m prepared to lose friends. Here’s why. Back in 2016 I had drunk the media Kool-Aid and was scared out of my mind about Trump. As such I donated to Hilary Clinton’s campaign and voted for her. By 2020 I was disillusioned and didn’t vote — I didn’t like either option. Now, in 2024, I believe this is one of the most important elections of my lifetime, and I’m supporting Trump,\" Maguire wrote.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk — who has increasingly warmed up to Trump — responded to the post by saying, \"I think you are right.\"\n\nSomewhat of an interesting reply, considering the Biden administration has bent over backward to turbocharge the EV industry — of which Musk and Tesla are still viewed as the leaders.\n\nAt first glance, Silicon Valley elites' public support of Trump after his latest bout of legal troubles seems surprising.\n\nJoe Biden won California in the 2020 presidential election by about 30 points. This marked the fourth consecutive election that the Democratic nominee has surpassed 60% of the votes in the state.\n\nNext, the Biden administration has doubled down on investing in semiconductor manufacturing in the US. That has lifted sentiment on the tech industry's future and arguably added another layer of bullishness to its stocks.\n\nAnd last but not least, the stock market continues to hit records under Biden. Meaning: The wealthy in Silicon Valley have become even wealthier!\n\nStory continues\n\nBut when it's all said and done, maybe this Trump back-slapping shouldn't surprise anyone.\n\nThese are forward thinkers thinking forward, considering how to protect their immense wealth (and it is, in fact, immense, as this new data from San Jose State University shows), their businesses, and their investments.\n\nA lot of them foresee tougher regulation under a Democratic president, especially as AI speeds ahead and puts jobs at risk.\n\nIt's not my position to say if they are wrong or right; I just want to share how some of these folks I chat up are thinking right now.\n\nTake the level-headed veteran tech entrepreneur Max Levchin, CEO of Affirm (AFRM), who came to the US from Ukraine as a teenager.\n\nHe has long stayed out of making public statements on politics but did bring up a fair point in the Opening Bid podcast this week (listen here) that may reflect the sentiment of many in the Valley.\n\n\"I pride myself in staying out of politics for pretty good reasons. I think one of the things that I learned pretty early on in Affirm is what we have appeals to both sides of the aisle,\" Levchin said. \"San Francisco leans left of left, left of center — and yet you're building products that are going to get used by someone in a MAGA hat.\"\n\nLevchin adds he will never host political fundraisers at his home.\n\nExpect others in the Valley to, however, as it appears to be a good wealth-protecting business tactic. morning brief image\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

Both of their market caps hover around $3.3 trillion.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Apple could be left in the dust in the race to develop AI technology. Its Siri AI assistant seemed almost antiquated compared to new large language models (LLMs).\n\nHowever, Apple's recent launch of new generative AI capabilities has changed the narrative. Some think the new Apple Intelligence features might even spark an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nMicrosoft has benefited tremendously from its relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant's cloud business has especially grown thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind. The company's introduction of AI-powered Copilot+ PCs should also provide a nice boost to its operating system sales.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is nipping at Apple's and Microsoft's heels with a market cap of around $3.2 trillion. The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has been the poster child of the AI boom over the last 18 months. Nvidia's forthcoming rollout of its Blackwell GPU architecture could keep it at the top of the AI chip market.\n\nWe could say that Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are in the second tier of megacap AI stocks. Alphabet's market cap is around $2.2 trillion, while Amazon's is slightly under $2 trillion.\n\nBoth companies, like Microsoft, are cloud service providers. Generative AI could be the strongest growth driver for the cloud so far. Both Alphabet and Amazon are using AI to increase revenue in their core non-cloud businesses (search for Alphabet and e-commerce for Amazon). They're also hoping to be winners in self-driving car technology -- Alphabet with its Waymo unit and Amazon with Zoox.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) lags behind the other AI leaders with a market cap of close to $1.3 trillion. The company uses AI extensively throughout its social media apps, including Facebook and Instagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted in late 2023 that AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext in the club\n\nWhich AI companies are in the best position to join these six in the $1 trillion club? My votes go to Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nBroadcom's market cap now stands close to $780 billion. The stock surged last week after the semiconductor maker reported great fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. Revenue jumped 43% year over year, driven primarily by its acquisition of VMware and strong demand for its networking products in AI data centers.\n\nThe company also announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. Although this split won't impact Broadcom's underlying business, it could make the stock more attractive to retail investors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's market cap of around $740 billion isn't too far behind Broadcom's. The company makes chips for many of the top AI leaders, including Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom.\n\nAs its name indicates, the company is based in Taiwan. However, it expects to begin production at its first advanced chip fabrication facility in Arizona next year. It's also building another fab plant in that state, with plans for a third. These investments could cement the company's status as the go-to chipmaker for the world's best AI companies.\n\nAre Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor smart picks?\n\nWhile I predict Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor will be the next AI stocks with market caps of $1 trillion or more, I don't know how long they will take to reach that threshold. But I think both are smart stocks to buy right now for aggressive growth investors.\n\nIncome investors and value investors will probably want to look elsewhere. Neither stock is cheap. Although both pay dividends, their yields are only in the ballpark of 1.4% -- not enough to entice many income investors.\n\nIf you're looking for growth, though, and don't mind potential volatility, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could be great fits. I expect both stocks to continue to beat the market in the coming years as the adoption of AI increases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "We can probably all agree that the world will look different in 2034. However, much will likely remain more or less the same as it is today.\n\nFor example, I expect Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will still be one of the world's biggest and most influential companies. Despite my optimism about the AI chip leader, though, I don't think it will be the biggest company in the world. I predict these three stocks will be worth more than Nvidia 10 years from now.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranked as the world's largest company based on market cap throughout most of the last decade. It lost the top spot for a while and even fell into third place behind Nvidia for a brief period. However, Apple is again neck and neck in vying for the No. 1 position. I predict it will firmly hold this perch in 2034.\n\nYou might say Apple was a sleeping giant for a while with generative AI. The company didn't jump on the bandwagon like several other technology leaders did after OpenAI released its wildly popular ChatGPT. That's no longer the case.\n\nSome viewed Apple's new AI functionality that was revealed at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this week as underwhelming. On the other hand, many investors seemed to see Apple Intelligence (the name the company gave to its generative AI products and services) as a likely catalyst for a new iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nOne thing is certain: Apple is no longer asleep at the wheel with anything AI-related. I fully expect that the company will dominate edge AI (running AI on devices rather than in the cloud). I would also bet that its services business will continue to grow rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has gone back and forth with Apple as the world's largest company. Although I don't think Microsoft will ultimately hang on to the top spot, I expect the company to remain larger than Nvidia 10 years from now.\n\nProbably the biggest reason for my prediction about Microsoft is its relationship with OpenAI. The huge tech company's impressive gains since early last year have been largely due to its integration of OpenAI's large language model (LLM) throughout its product lineup. I expect OpenAI to remain one of the leading innovators in AI. As a result, I think Microsoft will continue to profit from its relationship with the AI pioneer.\n\nI also look for Microsoft's cloud unit to have more sources for AI chips in the future, including its own custom silicon. If I'm right, this should boost the company's profitability as the laws of supply and demand work their magic on lowering chip prices. As Microsoft's earnings go, so go its stock price and market cap -- at least over the long term. In addition, increased competition could prevent Nvidia from dethroning Microsoft and Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap lags well behind Nvidia's right now. Since I've included the stock on this list, I obviously anticipate that will change. Why?\n\nFor one thing, Alphabet's Google DeepMind rivals OpenAI. I think the two leaders will remain neck and neck in advancing AI over the coming years. While some see AI as an existential threat to Google Search, I predict Alphabet will be successful in blending search with generative AI. Its Google Cloud business should also benefit from new sources of AI chips, just as Microsoft will.\n\nI like the prospects for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car unit. By 2034, Waymo could be a significant growth driver for the company with the rising adoption of robotaxis.\n\nAlphabet could also achieve major breakthroughs in quantum computing over the next 10 years. Google Quantum Computing believes it could achieve its goal of developing a \"useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" within this decade.\n\nThis could make Alphabet an even more formidable player in AI because of the ability of quantum computers to process data much faster than traditional computers.\n\nDon't count Nvidia out, though\n\nAlthough I predict Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet will be bigger than Nvidia 10 years from now, I wouldn't count Nvidia out. My assumption is that other chipmakers will be in a better position to challenge it over the coming years. If the company continues to out-innovate all of its rivals, though, that might not happen.\n\nI think Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are great stocks for long-term investors. But Nvidia is, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $794,196!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Cyril Ramaphosa was reelected as South Africa’s president, hours after his African National Congress agreed a power-sharing deal with business-friendly opposition parties.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nSouthwest Plane Plunged Within 400 Feet of Ocean Near Hawaii Wells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for ‘Simulation of Keyboard Activity’ Yes, Everyone Really Is Sick a Lot More Often After Covid Bump Stock Ban Tossed Out by Supreme Court in Gun-Rights Win Beaches on Singapore’s Sentosa Island Closed After Oil Spill\n\nRamaphosa won 283 of the votes cast by members of National Assembly on Friday night, and Economic Freedom Fighters leader Julius Malema 44. Parties including the Democratic Alliance and Inkatha Freedom Party supported the incumbent’s candidacy for another five-year term, and in exchange will be allocated cabinet posts and key positions in the legislature.\n\n“This is a historic juncture in the life of our country, which requires that we must work and act together to entrench our constitutional democracy and the rule of law, and build a South Africa for all of its people,” Ramaphosa said after his election in Cape Town. “It is with this in mind that I declare that I accept the mission you are giving me.”\n\nThe FTSE/JSE Africa All Share Index rose 0.9% on Friday following the formation of the broad alliance, while the rand gained as much as 0.7% to 18.305 per dollar.\n\nSouth Africa has been in political flux since May 29 elections, when the ANC lost its parliamentary majority for the first time since it took power three decades ago, garnering slightly more than 40% of the vote. While the ANC proposed the country be ruled by a broad alliance known as a government of national unity, former President Jacob Zuma’s new uMkhonto weSizwe Party and the leftist EFF refused to join, leaving the DA, IFP and other smaller parties as its members.\n\nThe 400-member assembly earlier elected the ANC’s Thoko Didiza, a former agriculture minister, as speaker and the DA’s Annelie Lotriet as her deputy. Ramaphosa is due to be inaugurated on June 19 and announce his cabinet soon thereafter.\n\nThe participants are united in their shared respect for the constitution, and will work together to grow the economy, create jobs and tackle crime, DA leader John Steenhuisen said in a speech on the party’s YouTube channel. Positions in the cabinet and legislatures will be allocated broadly in proportion to the parties’ share of seats, although appointments have yet to be discussed, he told reporters.\n\nThe makeup of the ruling coalition has buoyed financial markets because the new administration is likely to back Ramaphosa’s efforts to rein in state debt and tackle power shortages and logistics snarl-ups that have hobbled Africa’s biggest economy. The exclusion of parties that support land expropriation and the nationalization of mines and banks will also help shore up investor sentiment.\n\nStory continues\n\nA framework for the new government is still being worked out, and it’s unclear which small parties will join, with the situation still “very fluid,” ANC Secretary-General Fikile Mbalula said in an interview.\n\n“The next phase will be to form a national dialog with all parties in the government of national unity in which policy will be hammered out,” said Corne Mulder, chief whip of the Freedom Front Plus, the seventh-largest party. These discussions won’t include any changes to the constitution.\n\n“We may have an interim cabinet until that national dialog is concluded,” Mulder said. “Although Ramaphosa wants to reduce the size of the cabinet, he may be forced to keep it at the current numbers in order to accommodate everybody.”\n\nThe durability of the governing coalition will be put to the test over coming months, given the historically fractious relations between its members.\n\nThe ANC has previously sought to portray the DA as representing the interests of big business and South Africa’s White minority, and has in turn been accused of governing ineptly and failing to tackle endemic corruption. And the ANC and IFP fought an undeclared civil war in the 1980s and 1990s that was fueled by the apartheid regime and claimed thousands of lives before a truce was declared.\n\nPower-sharing at municipal level has also been problematic. Control of several of South Africa’s main cities that are ruled by multiple parties has repeatedly changed hands as allegiances have shifted, and the instability has caused the delivery of water, refuse removal and other services to grind to a near-halt.\n\nSign up here for the twice-weekly Next Africa newsletter\n\nOne of South Africa’s most experienced politicians, the 71-year-old Ramaphosa will play a central role in trying to ensure the new administration runs smoothly and endures. He trained as a lawyer, co-founded the National Union of Mineworkers and established a reputation as deft negotiator when he led the historic talks that ended apartheid and produced the nation’s first democratic constitution.\n\nHe was appointed president in February 2018 and faced the formidable tasks of fixing an economy hamstrung by years of mismanagement, policy uncertainty and an energy crisis, addressing a chronic lack of jobs and tackling the graft that became institutionalized during his predecessor’s tenure.\n\nHe made some headway, firing a number of officials implicated in corruption and instituting several reforms, but power shortages, inept state institutions and the coronavirus pandemic have hindered efforts to engineer a turnaround.\n\nYou can follow Bloomberg’s reporting on Africa on WhatsApp. Sign up here.\n\n--With assistance from Arijit Ghosh and Monique Vanek.\n\n(Updates with Ramaphosa’s comments in third paragraph.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the one major mistake to avoid with your Roth IRA. Check out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nBuilding a Million-Dollar Roth IRA\n\nAccording to a survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), individuals think they need at least $1.8 million to live a comfortable retirement. Based on the figure, it is safe to say that the average American, who has only $120,300 saved up for their retirement, is in for a bumpy ride if they don’t start saving up. Thankfully, there are quite a few ways through which an individual can stack up a million dollars in retirement. One such example is through a Roth IRA.\n\nA Roth IRA is a special type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in which an individual pays taxes on their contributions, and then receives all future withdrawals tax-free. Many individuals believe that contribution limits imposed by the IRS make it difficult to build up a fat nest egg for retirement through such accounts. However, that’s where they are wrong. This is because with consistency, and with the power of compounding, it is quite easy to be a retirement millionaire yourself.\n\nSo how is it possible to raise over a million dollars in your Roth IRA? More importantly, why is a million-dollar Roth IRA so attractive to retirees? The answer lies in its tax-free withdrawals. Since a Roth IRA requires after-tax contributions, an individual who has amassed over a million dollars in retirement will be able to enjoy it tax-free in their retirement years.  However, there are many things that can go wrong with a Roth IRA. For this reason, we have compiled a list of all the mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA. Before we move on to that, let’s get back to the question: how to build a million dollar Roth IRA account?\n\nWhich Stocks to Add to Your Retirement Portfolio\n\nWe at Insider Monkey recently compiled a list of the Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. To compile the list of the top 5, we ranked the holdings of Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023 and chose the top 5. These top stocks were chosen based on hedge fund sentiments, where the top consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on our list, the top five growth stocks to buy and hold on to are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The top growth stock to buy and hold is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the world’s largest personal computing operating system provider. The company boasts strong financials and significant growth potential, with Azure, AI integration, and its diversified business model being the key drivers of the company’s revenues and profitability. Undoubtedly, the stock is a strong buy and hold, with shares having popped up 35% since May 2023. Posting its Q3 2024 earnings, the company’s revenue rose by 17% year-over-year to $62 billion, $1 billion higher than analyst expectations. One Major Mistake to Avoid with Your Roth IRA\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, we consulted a number of sources such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Bankrate, Investopedia, and District Capital Management, to name a few. A consensus approach was adopted to choose the top 11 mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, with one point awarded each time it was recommended by a source. Mistakes have been ranked in an ascending order based on the number of times recommended.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nHere are the 11 Mistakes to Avoid with Your Roth IRA:\n\n1. Failing to Invest Your Roth IRA Funds\n\nBased on our methodology, one major mistake to avoid with your Roth IRA is failing to invest your Roth IRA funds. A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account where an individual contributes their after-tax dollars. However, many individuals believe contributing to a Roth IRA is an investment in itself when it is not. Just because an individual contributes to a Roth IRA doesn’t mean that the money is automatically invested. In fact, an individual must go into the account, select the investments, and then manage them. This is the best advice for a Roth IRA. Some popular investments for Roth IRAs are stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), Target-date Funds (TDFs), and Real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, it is not allowed to invest in collectibles in a Roth IRA. This includes automobiles, artwork, stamps, rugs, and other items.\n\nCheck out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best AI travel apps; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n25 Popular Small Towns to Live in the USand 11 Best Travel-Sized Fragrances For Your Next Vacation.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Google CEO Sundar Pinchai testified briefly Friday at the federal financial conspiracy trial surrounding buzz-to-bust startup Ozy Media, countering founder Carlos Watson's alleged claims that the search giant once sought to buy Ozy.\n\nGoogle did consider hiring Watson for a high-level news executive job in 2021 and putting $25 million into Ozy in something of a tradeoff for luring him away, Pinchai told jurors.\n\n“Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,\" he explained.\n\nBut “did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.\n\n“No,” replied Pinchai, who heads Google and parent Alphabet Inc.\n\nHe said he had been introduced to Watson at a conference and then in a video interview for a possible Google job interacting with news outlets. Neither the hire nor the $25 million investment ultimately happened.\n\nAccording to prosecutors, Watson later told another prospective investor that Pinchai himself had extended a nine-figure offer to buy Ozy. The Mountain View, California-based company produced TV programs, podcasts and a music-and-ideas festival before falling apart in fall 2021 amid questions about whether it had flagrantly misrepresented its audience reach, deals and finances.\n\nWatson and Ozy Media have pleaded not guilty to charges including conspiracy to commit fraud. He has said that he built a robust and real company, didn't con anyone and is being singled out for prosecution when he made, at most, entrepreneurial “mistakes.”\n\nDefense lawyers have blamed any misrepresentations on Ozy co-founder Samir Rao, saying he is falsely implicating Watson in hopes of avoiding prison himself. Rao pleaded guilty to identity theft and conspiring to commit fraud, and he is awaiting sentencing.\n\nHe testified earlier in the trial that his “moral compass” got scrambled by ambition, desperation to keep the company going and “Carlos’ deep belief that failure was not an option and we had to do whatever it took.”\n\nAmong other deceit, Rao infamously posed as a YouTube executive — even using a phone app to disguise his voice — in order to champion Ozy to Goldman Sachs investment bankers on a February 2021 call.\n\n“It was one of the most disturbing calls that I have ever been on in my career,” Goldman executive Hillel Moerman testified Friday, calling the episode “a surreal experience.”\n\nRao testified that he did the phone trick to back up a false claim that YouTube was paying for Watson’s eponymous talk show. Rao said Watson was with him during the call, texting him about what to say: “I am a big fan of Carlos, Samir and the show,” read one text that was shown to jurors.\n\nStory continues\n\nDefense lawyer Ronald Sullivan Jr. has said Watson came into the room during the call, realized “a live train wreck” was unfolding and tried to get Rao to end the conversation.\n\nOn the other end, Moerman thought the putative YouTube exec's voice seemed obviously “off,” among other clues that made the Goldman bankers suspicious, he recalled Friday.\n\nOne of his colleagues soon called the actual executive at YouTube, which is owned by Alphabet. The ruse unraveled. So did the potential for a Goldman investment.\n\n“We had been lied to,” Moerman explained to the Brooklyn federal court jury.\n\nGoldman Sachs did keep advertising with Ozy after the episode, according to Rao's testimony.\n\nWatson told Goldman and Ozy’s board that Rao had suffered a mental health crisis. Rao told jurors he was taking antidepressants at the time but wasn't having a psychiatric break.\n\nView comments",

Rao, who’s pleaded guilty, testified earlier this month that it was part of his and Watson’s scheme to fool investors into thinking Ozy was profitable.\n\nPichai on Friday told the jury in Brooklyn, New York, federal court that an acquisition of Ozy was never discussed but that Google did consider hiring Watson as head of its news programming. A $25 million investment in Ozy would have been part of that deal.\n\n“Mr. Watson was a critical part of Ozy Media, and we were considering making an investment in the company to make the transition easier,” Pichai testified.\n\n“Did you ever offer to purchase Ozy Media for $600 million?” prosecutor Dylan Stern asked.\n\n“No,” Pichai said.\n\nIn his trial opening statement, Stern said Watson used the fake Google offer to attract another Ozy investor following the incident with Goldman.\n\n“When the Goldman deal fell through, Watson found another victim and lured them into investing $20 million into Ozy by telling them that the CEO of Google himself had offered to purchase Ozy for hundreds of millions of dollars,” Stern said. “That was a lie. But Watson did not let the truth stand in his way.”\n\nThough Watson allegedly claimed to have a far-reaching relationship with the Google boss, Pichai said they only spoke twice. The first was a conversation of “just a few minutes” at a conference, while the second was Watson’s job interview on Feb. 25, 2021, weeks after the Goldman call.\n\nWatson didn’t get the job.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - Alphabet's (GOOG) Google must face trial on U.S. antitrust enforcers' claim that the internet search juggernaut illegally dominates the online advertising technology market, a federal judge ruled on Friday.\n\nU.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia, denied Google's motion during a hearing, according to court records.\n\nGoogle had argued for a win without a trial, saying that antitrust laws do not block companies from refusing to deal with rivals and that regulators had not accurately defined the ad tech market.\n\nCourt papers did not specify what reasons the judge provided at the hearing. Motions like the one Google filed are only granted where a judge determines there is no factual dispute to send to trial.\n\nBrinkema is scheduled to preside over trial in the case on Sept. 9.\n\n\"We look forward to setting the record straight,\" a spokesperson for Google said.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Department and a coalition of states sued the tech giant last year, claiming it was unlawfully monopolizing digital advertising and overcharging users. The lawsuit seeks primarily to break up Google's digital advertising business to allow for more competition.\n\nThe regulators convinced Brinkema on Friday to block a former FBI agent who acted as a cybersecurity consultant for Google from testifying as an expert at the trial.\n\nGoogle notched a win in the case last week when Brinkema allowed the trial to go forward without a jury, after the company settled claims that its conduct harmed the U.S. government.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

(AP) — A federal judge on Friday said the government's antitrust case against Google over its advertising technology will go to trial in September, rejecting both sides' request to rule in their favor as a matter of law.\n\nThe Justice Department and Google had been expected to make their arguments seeking summary judgment in the lawsuit next week. But at a hearing Friday in federal court in Alexandria on unrelated issues, U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema told both sides that it's clear the case has to go trial.\n\nA judge grants summary judgment only when the facts are not in dispute and a decision can be rendered as a matter of law. But Brinkema said it's clear that numerous facts are disputed.\n\nHer ruling was not unexpected.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges that Google violated federal antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising.\n\nThe Justice Department had initially sought a jury trial to decide the case, but last week Brinkema canceled the jury trial and replaced it with a bench trial, meaning she will decide whether Google has broken the law.\n\nGoogle is awaiting a verdict from another judge in the District of Columbia over whether its popular search engine constitutes an illegal monopoly.\n\nThe trial is set for Sept. 9.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL is steadily moving toward attaining its zero-carbon goals.\r\n\r\nReportedly, its division Google partnered with NV Energy, a utility company owned by Berkshire Hathaway, to power its data centers located in Nevada with geothermal electricity.\r\n\r\nGoogle strives to boost the amount of carbon-free geothermal electricity from 3.5 megawatts to 115 megawatts into the local power grid for its operations over the next six years.\r\n\r\nNV Energy entered a purchase agreement with advanced geothermal developer Fervo Energy in order to execute the underlined deal.\r\n\r\nGoogle-NV Energy partnership is subject to state utility regulators’ approval.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nZero-Carbon Efforts Gain Steam\n\nGoogle, which has been carbon-neutral since 2007, is leaving no stone unturned to achieve net-zero emissions across all of its operations and value chain by 2030.\r\n\r\nThe company aims to reduce 50% of its combined Scope 1, 2, and 3 absolute emissions before 2030.\r\n\r\nGOOGL plans to invest in nature-based and technology-based carbon removal solutions to neutralize its remaining emissions.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company’s huge investments in wind and solar energies remain noteworthy. Google's global operations are powered by 64% carbon-free energy, including wind and solar.\r\n\r\nIts transition to geothermal energy remains a major positive as the energy uses naturally occurring underground heat to produce renewable electricity, unlike solar and wind energies, which depend on the availability of sunshine and wind.\r\n\r\nGoogle’s shift from fossil fuels to clean energy is anticipated to reduce costs in the near and long terms, which is a plus.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe carbon-free drive is gaining strong traction across the technology sector.\r\n\r\nNot only Alphabet but companies like Amazon AMZN, Microsoft MSFT and Lam Research LRCX are also taking initiatives to lower overall carbon footprints and cut energy bills substantially.\r\n\r\nAmazon is known as the biggest corporate investor in renewable energy. Its growing investments in the projects have accelerated the pace of its journey toward powering its infrastructure with 100% renewable energy. The goal was initially targeted to be met by 2030, which is now expected to be achieved by 2025. In 2021, the company reached 85% renewable energy across its business.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is gathering steam to become carbon-negative by 2030. Further, MSFT aims to remove all green gas emissions by 2050.\r\n\r\nLam Research is committed to reaching its goal of carbon net-zero emissions by 2050 and operating business on 100% renewable energy by 2030.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nIn this era, environmental, social and governance factors have become crucial for building a sustainable business. Now, investors worldwide not only look at how much a company is capable of generating high profits but also consider how much its business is sustainable for the future.\r\n\r\nGiven this scenario, Alphabet, which sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), remains well-poised to gain investor optimism on the back of its growing efforts to reduce its carbon footprint. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nAlphabet has gained 25.6% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s return of 10.2%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG): The Best Undervalued AI Stock to Buy in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market’s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI.  SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank’s CFO, who said the bank’s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a “break from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.”\n\nIn this backdrop it’s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what’s happening in the AI space.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can’t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nGongTo/Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nBank of America analyst Michael Hartnett last week pointed to the concentration of gains phenomenon on the market, saying if we remove the “Big Ten” stocks from the equation, the S&P 500’s gain so far this year shrinks to just 3.6%. This “Big Ten” group also includes Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nAnother latest story around Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) making waves is Bank of America’s industry checks in the search engine market which found that Alphabet is still the market leader, with a whopping 95% share, with Bing’s search coming in at just 0.7%.\n\nBofA’s Justin Post said Alphabet Inc’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews had a role to play here:\n\n“After a consecutive eight months of decline, Google’s US Search market share increased m/m in May, which could suggest AI Overviews are aiding query growth and usage,” Post said.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential Alphabet, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOG but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nShares of this internet search leader have returned +0.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +4.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 3.4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +31%. This estimate has changed +0.4% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $295.53 billion and $329.71 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +15.2% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Netflix and CVS Health have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL –June 14, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Netflix NFLX, as the Bull of the Day and CVS Health CVS, as the Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on GitLab GTLB, Alphabet GOOGL and NVIDIA NVDA.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nNetflix is considered a pioneer in the streaming space, evolving from a small DVD rental provider to a dominant streaming service provider. The stock has enjoyed positive earnings estimate revisions across the board, landing the stock into the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nIn addition to favorable earnings estimate revisions, the stock resides in the Zacks Broadcast Radio and Television industry, currently ranked in the top 26% of all Zacks industries. Let’s take a closer look at how the company currently stacks up.\n\nNetflix\n\nNetflix recently enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period.\n\nConcerning headline figures, the company’s sales climbed 14% year-over-year, whereas EPS jumped 80% partly thanks to margin expansion. Shares faced pressure post-earnings initially but have since recovered, up 7% overall over the last three months.\n\nNFLX’s growth outlook continues to remain bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 52% EPS growth on 15% higher sales.\n\nPeeking ahead to FY25, consensus expectations presently allude to a 20% pop in earnings on a 12% increase in sales. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Growth.\n\nIt’s critical to note that the company’s initiatives, such as its password-sharing crackdown and ad-supported tiers, have led to strong membership growth – NFLX's latest subscriber account totaled 269.6 million, reflecting a 16% jump year-over-year.\n\nBottom Line\n\nInvestors can implement a stellar strategy to find expected winners by taking advantage of the Zacks Rank – one of the most powerful market tools that provides a massive edge.\n\nThe top 5% of all stocks receive the highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). These stocks should outperform the market more than any other rank.\n\nNetflix would be an excellent stock for investors to consider, as displayed by its Zack Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nZacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) stock CVS Health is the largest retail pharmacy chain in the United States. The company operates in four main segments: health care benefits, health services, pharmacy and consumer wellness, and corporate/other. Though CVS is a household name, has been in business for more than 60 years, and is highly profitable, the company’s stock is facing several bearish headwinds that are company-specific and industry-wide.\n\nStory continues\n\nRetail Theft Plagues Pharmacy Industry\n\nSince 2018, the amount of lost retail revenue due to theft has grown each year consecutively and soared overall. For example, in 2018, retailers lost about $50 billion to theft. By 2024, projections call for retail theft losses to balloon to more than $130 billion and a whopping $143 billion by 2025. According to Capital One Financial (COF), “Retailers lost $112.1 billion in gross revenue and $84.9 billion in fraudulent sales returns in 2022.” Meanwhile, “The average shoplifting incident cost retailers $461.86 in 2020.”\n\nIndeed, there is plenty of time and room for the political blame game. However, as investors, we must focus on what is going on and how it will impact the market while leaving the politics to the dinner table. Brazen organized retail incidents are becoming commonplace. What’s worse, shoplifters are caught roughly 2% of the time and arrested 1% of the time. The troubling trend is leading to higher expenses and worse profit margins.\n\nAs a result, CVS and its main drugstore competitor, Walgreens Boots Alliance (WBA), have closed numerous stores in hard-hit areas of the country, such as California and New York. However, customers are turning away from brick-and-mortar drugstores in several open locations. In heavy crime zones like Manhattan, customers must flag down associates to gain access to the growing number of items locked behind protective glass. Instead of accepting the frustrating situation, many retail customers are taking their e-commerce business elsewhere\n\nPoor Medicare Advantage Rating Squeezes CVS Profits\n\nMedicare Advantage ratings, or Medicare Star Ratings, measure the performance of Medicare Advantage Part D plans. In 2023, CVS suffered a signficant setback when its largest MA plan, Aetna National PPO, saw its rating plunge from 4.5 to 3.5 stars.\n\nBecause of the headwinds above, year-over-year revenue growth at CVS has plunged since 2020.\n\nRelative Performance of CVS Shares Trending Down\n\nCVS shares are down-trending and underperforming the general market by a wide margin – a sign of relative price weakness.\n\nBottom Line\n\nDrugstore giant CVS faces numerous bearish headwinds, which are industry and company-specific. Investors should avoid shares over the next 6-12 months.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nDoes GitLab's (GTLB) Growing Clientele Make the Stock a Buy?\n\nGitLab is benefiting from an expanding clientele, driven by the strong adoption of its DevSecOps platform.

        "title": "Is Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock's Recent Performance Being Led By Its Attractive Financial Prospects?",
        "content": "Most readers would already be aware that Alphabet's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock increased significantly by 24% over the past three months. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. Specifically, we decided to study Alphabet's  ROE in this article.\n\nReturn on equity or ROE is an important factor to be considered by a shareholder because it tells them how effectively their capital is being reinvested. Put another way, it reveals the company's success at turning shareholder investments into profits.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Alphabet is:\n\n28% = US$82b ÷ US$293b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. Another way to think of that is that for every $1 worth of equity, the company was able to earn $0.28 in profit.\n\nWhat Has ROE Got To Do With Earnings Growth?\n\nSo far, we've learned that ROE is a measure of a company's profitability. Based on how much of its profits the company chooses to reinvest or \"retain\", we are then able to evaluate a company's future ability to generate profits. Assuming everything else remains unchanged, the higher the ROE and profit retention, the higher the growth rate of a company compared to companies that don't necessarily bear these characteristics.\n\nAlphabet's Earnings Growth And 28% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Alphabet has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.4% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Alphabet's moderate 18% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nAs a next step, we compared Alphabet's net income growth with the industry, and pleasingly, we found that the growth seen by the company is higher than the average industry growth of 6.0%. past-earnings-growth\n\nThe basis for attaching value to a company is, to a great extent, tied to its earnings growth. The investor should try to establish if the expected growth or decline in earnings, whichever the case may be, is priced in. This then helps them determine if the stock is placed for a bright or bleak future. Has the market priced in the future outlook for GOOGL? You can find out in our latest intrinsic value infographic research report.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Alphabet Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nSummary\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Alphabet's performance. In particular, it's great to see that the company is investing heavily into its business and along with a high rate of return, that has resulted in a sizeable growth in its earnings. With that said, the latest industry analyst forecasts reveal that the company's earnings growth is expected to slow down. Are these analysts expectations based on the broad expectations for the industry, or on the company's fundamentals?

        "title": "AI startup Perplexity wants to upend search business. News outlet Forbes says it's ripping them off",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI has raised tens of millions of dollars from the likes of Jeff Bezos and other prominent tech investors for its mission to rival Google in the business of searching for information.\n\nBut its AI-driven search chatbot is already facing challenges as some news media companies object to its business practices and tech giants Google, and now Apple, are increasingly fusing similar AI features into their core products.\n\nPerplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has spent much of the past week defending the company after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story but without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission. Forbes said it later found similar “knock-off” stories lifted from other publications.\n\nThe Associated Press separately found another Perplexity product feature inventing fake quotes from real people, including a former elected town official from Martha’s Vineyard falsely quoted to say he didn’t want the Massachusetts island to become a destination for marijuana.\n\n“I never said that,” said Bill Rossi, a former member of the island town of Chilmark’s select board.\n\nSrinivas told The Associated Press that his company is trying to build positive relationships with news publishers that ensure their news content “reaches more people.”\n\n“We can definitely coexist and help each other,” he said.\n\nAsked about Forbes, he said his product “never ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else’s content,” in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies’ AI systems generate.\n\n“We are actually more of an aggregator of information and providing it to the people with the right attribution,” Srinivas said. But, he added, “It was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source. We took that feedback immediately and updated changes that day itself. And now the sources are more prominently highlighted.”\n\nPerplexity also revealed this week that it has been seeking revenue-sharing partnerships that would pay news publishers a portion of Perplexity’s advertising revenue each time an outlet’s news content is referenced as a source.\n\nRandall Lane, chief content officer of Forbes Media, called the dispute an “inflection point” in the conversation about AI.\n\n“It’s a case study in where we’re heading,” Lane told the AP. “If the people who are leading the charge don’t have a fundamental respect for the hard work of doing proprietary reporting, and keeping people informed with value-added content, we’ve got a big problem.”\n\nStory continues\n\nA self-described “AI bull” who believes that the technology could help make many news organizations more efficient, Lane said the dispute between Perplexity and Forbes is important because it is a “metaphor for what can happen if the people controlling the AI don’t respect the people doing the work.”\n\nPerplexity bills itself as a search engine while “acting like a media company and publishing a story” that only Forbes had reported, Lane said.\n\n“The whole thing was very disingenuous. And what we didn’t hear was, ‘Oops, yeah we messed that one up and we need to do better,’” he said. “Instead, it was just putting out more content, little tweaks to the model and treating journalism like it’s just a commodity to be manufactured.”\n\nSrinivas, a computer scientist and former AI researcher at OpenAI and Google, co-founded Perplexity in the summer of 2022, not long before the AI image-generator Stable Diffusion and OpenAI’s ChatGPT began sparking the public's fascination with the possibilities of generative AI.\n\nInspired, in part, by his childhood love of Wikipedia, he described Perplexity to the AP as “like a marriage of Wikipedia and ChatGPT” that can instantly answer a person’s questions without the “huge cluttered mess” of Google’s conventional search results.\n\n“You ask a question, you get an answer with clean sources, and there’s like three or four suggested (follow-up) questions and that’s it,” he said of Perplexity. “That way people’s minds can be free from distractions, and they can just focus on learning and digging deeper.”\n\nThe company sells a subscription for premium features and is planning to start an advertising-based service as it grows its user base.\n\n“We are not profitable as a company today, but we are also more sustainably run than foundation model companies because we do not train our own foundation models,” which requires huge amounts of computing power, he said.\n\nPerplexity relies on existing AI large language models such as those built by OpenAI, Anthropic and Meta Platforms, the parent company of Facebook; and then “post-trains” them.\n\n“We shape them to be really good summarizers,” he said.\n\nIt’s not always clear where the summarized information is coming from. One Perplexity feature called Writing — which enables a user to “generate text or chat without searching the web” — produces lengthy and unsourced commentary, often in the style of a news article. Tests of the feature by an AP reporter asking it to write about the lack of marijuana on Martha’s Vineyard led it to produce a 465-word document that resembled a news article and included fabricated quotations from the former town official and another real person.\n\nThe AP is not repeating the false quotes in order to avoid perpetuating misinformation. Srinivas said that the Writing feature of Perplexity is a “minor use case” that was intended for helping to compose essays or correcting grammar when primary source information isn’t needed. He said it's “more prone to hallucinations” — a common problem with AI large language models — because it isn't tethered to the web search capabilities of Perplexity's core product.\n\n“There is no doubt that generative AI is upending journalism, content creation, and search,” said Sarah Kreps, director of Cornell University’s Tech Policy Institute.\n\nShe pointed to Google’s new, Perplexity-like approach that summarizes answers based on information pulled from crawling the web, as an example. That, too, led to false information and forced Google to make adjustments to the product after its public release.\n\n“But their whole model of advertising is based on sending people to websites,” she said in an email. “Why will people go to websites if they can have the one-stop-shop of the answer in the AI output?”\n\nSrinivas claimed to the AP that “a lot of people get referrals from Perplexity, and I’m happy that they’re getting referrals from a new player in the internet.\"\n\nFor now, much of that benefit may be aspirational. Perplexity’s worldwide user base has grown rapidly this year to more than 85 million web visits in May, but that barely registers compared to the billions of users of ChatGPT and other popular platforms from Microsoft and Google, according to data from Similarweb.\n\nThe debate demonstrates the “uncertain and challenging times” for online content creators in general and journalism in particular because aggregators only work if publications such as Forbes exist, said Stephen Lind, an associate professor at the University of Southern California’s Marshall School of Business.\n\nUsing AI as a synthesizing tool works for widespread dissemination of information until “you run out of originals,” he said.\n\n“There are whole companies or whole applications that are also doing this, where they are rolling out new services without fully thinking through the implications or best practices or safeguards because they’re rolling out applications for industries that maybe they’re not native to,” he said.\n\nLind said it’s good that companies like Perplexity are “taking at least some steps to course correct when an industry or a user pushes back.” But some of the changes should have been baked in from the beginning, he added.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock",
        "content": "In this article, I will outline three of the reasons why I hold a bullish position on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. These reasons are tailwinds in advertising spending, cloud potential, and the stock’s reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet has performed relatively well in 2024, delivering nearly twice the return you would have received by investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This performance aligns with the company’s growth expectations, particularly in its key markets, such as advertising, where AI innovations in Google Search are being incorporated.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that certain segments, such as the cloud, are overlooked by the market when assessing Alphabet’s future potential. This might be why the stock is traded at reasonably valued multiples compared to other major tech companies.\n\nPoised to Benefit from Tailwinds in Advertising Spending\n\nAlphabet currently holds the title of the most dominant advertising company globally, and the digital advertising sector is poised for significant growth in the years ahead.\n\nAccording to projections, digital advertising spending worldwide is expected to surge from $679 billion in 2023 (with 40% specifically in search advertising) to $965 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%. With Alphabet leading the pack in digital advertising, it stands to reap substantial benefits from this upward trajectory.\n\nDigital advertising offers distinct advantages over traditional linear advertising. It enables more precise measurement of results and facilitates targeted advertising to specific audiences, rendering it a more appealing option with significantly higher returns from both business and marketing perspectives.\n\nGoogle Search, with its commanding market share in the search engine sector, and YouTube, boasting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, are pivotal assets bolstering Alphabet’s competitive edge. The incorporation of generative AI features, such as products leveraging LLMs (large language models) to match ads to relevant searches, enables users to find answers to more complex queries and increases usage and satisfaction with the results.\n\nGoogle Cloud Potential\n\nAccording to Alphabet’s management, the Google Cloud segment and YouTube are anticipated to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by 2024.\n\nIn pursuit of this goal, the company has committed to investing in infrastructure, especially servers, nearly doubling its capital expenditures to $12 billion in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Despite the Google Cloud segment operating at a loss in recent years due to reinvesting all profits into growth, Alphabet’s cloud computing business remains in a growth stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the segment reported an operating margin of 9% and generated $900 million in operating income in Q1 2024 (see below), this likely has not yet translated into free cash flow, in my opinion (Alphabet doesn’t disclose the segment’s free cash flow figures). Source: Alphabet’s Q1-2024 Report\n\nFor comparison, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS boasts an operating margin of around 37%. As Alphabet strives to enhance the efficiency of Google Cloud through its investments, achieving margins akin to AWS could result in the company generating billions in annual operating income from this segment. This would represent a significant source of profit beyond its core search business.\n\nA Fairly Priced Big Tech Stock\n\nDespite a 26% increase in its stock price year-to-date, Alphabet maintains a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its main big tech peers.\n\nConsidering a consensus that implies roughly 30% EPS growth for Alphabet this year, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23x, which is the lowest among its “Magnificent 7” peers. This includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which trades at 25x and is much more discounted than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the member of this group that’s trading at the highest multiple of 67x.\n\nWhen considering cash flows, Alphabet’s price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio over the trailing 12 months stands at 20x, slightly above Amazon’s 19x and Meta’s 16x, based on its $2.19 trillion market cap. Despite this, I still find this valuation reasonably justified. Alphabet continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, which should drive future expansion. However, these investments negatively impact short-term cash flows, resulting in a higher P/CF multiple.\n\nRegardless, Alphabet has strong net profit margins (nearly 26%), an effective monopoly in its core search business, and a pristine balance sheet within an industry approaching a trillion dollars in value and continuing to grow. These factors would typically justify a higher valuation multiple, but that is not necessarily the case for Alphabet right now.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish about the future of Alphabet stock, with the consensus rating being a Strong Buy, and 32 out of 37 analysts recommending buying GOOGL. The average GOOGL stock price target is $197.67, implying upside potential of 12.2%.\n\nAmong the bulls, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth asserts that GOOGL deserves a Buy rating due to confidence in the company’s ability to enhance its products with generative AI technology. This enhancement is anticipated to significantly boost revenues, supported by the company’s ability to invest in key growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, thanks to its strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere are numerous reasons to maintain a bullish stance on Alphabet that extend beyond just three factors. Still, to reiterate, I firmly believe that the company’s dominant position and its ongoing investment efforts in search will yield significant returns as the industry continues to experience robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, I find that other segments, such as cloud computing, are still undervalued by the market, and there is substantial potential for value creation as investments lead to even stronger cash flows in the future.\n\nWhen considering these factors alongside the company’s attractive valuation compared to other big tech firms, I maintain a highly bullish position on Alphabet stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman recently made headlines after reports suggested he plans to take his investment firm public as soon as next year. A Wall Street Journal report said the 58-year-old billionaire was selling a stake in Pershing Square to investors as part of a funding round that could value the firm at about $10.5 billion. According to data from WSJ, Pershing Square managed over $16 billion in assets as of the end of April. The publication said Ackman has told investors that he plans to at least quadruple assets under management.\n\nAckman has run a concentrated portfolio for years. As of the end of the March quarter this year, his portfolio was worth over $10 billion, with just seven stocks. And yet Ackman made $610 million last year, coming in at the seventh position in Bloomberg’s annual list of the best-paid hedge fund founders.\n\nIn 2022, Ackman, who writes long and fiery posts on Twitter, announced that he was done with activist investing and was taking a “quieter approach.” In 2023, Pershing Square Holdings generated strong NAV performance of 26.7% versus 26.3% for its principal benchmark, the S&P 500 index.\n\nAckman talked in detail about the fund’s returns and future strategy during his 2023 letter to investors:\n\n“While our investments in hedging and asymmetric instruments have been enormously profitable, we could have done better. In each of the three black swan events of the last 20 years, we had an early and highly variant view of the likely impact and probability of their occurrence and had identified and invested in instruments that offered profits many times their cost. In retrospect, we should have invested more and achieved even greater profits without risking materially more capital.”\n\nFor this article we scanned Ackman’s Q1 portfolio and picked his top six stock holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Billionaire Bill Ackman's Best Stock to Buy in 2024?\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire Bill Ackman’s Q1’2024 Stake Value: $1,427,771,711\n\nBillionaire Ackman owns a $1.4 billion stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). In his 2023 letter to investors, Ackman addressed the concerns around Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) amid the rise of AI language models:\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cumulative impact of AI and machine learning enhancements is perhaps most evident in Google’s core Search franchise. Google Search has evolved from its starting point as a simple results page with “10 blue links” and now provides summary answer snippets for informational and educational queries similar to AI chatbots without any of their latency. For more involved queries, for example, in travel, the company has developed specialized Google Flights and Hotels modules that offer consumers substantial utility and freedom to direct their discovery process. Innovation in Google Search has maintained its leading market position through multiple perceived “disruption” risks over time, including the platform transition from desktop-tomobile and competitive threats from social media and verticalized search. Likewise, we view the company’s integration of generative AI into a wider range of queries, not as a disruptive shift, but as a natural evolution of its Search product which will enhance the user experience and improve conversion for advertisers. We continue to believe Google is one of the most advantaged and scaled players in AI with an unmatched business model. The company’s stock currently trades at approximately 19 times forward earnings, a deep discount to its peers despite its similar rate of projected earnings growth\n\nRead Ackman’s letter here.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the company is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Google saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024. You can visit Billionaire Bill Ackman's 2024 Portfolio: 6 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Snowflake to Close Probe Into Cyberattack Targeting Clients",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc. plans to close its own investigation this week into a hacking campaign that ensnared as many as 165 of its customers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for ‘Simulation of Keyboard Activity’ Apple to ‘Pay’ OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad’s Reaction Was Remarkable. US Producer Prices Surprise With Biggest Decline Since October Gavin Newsom Wants to Curb a Labor Law That Cost Businesses $10 Billion\n\nThe cloud data and analytics company hasn’t detected any unauthorized access into customer accounts since early last week, Chief Information Security Officer Brad Jones, said in an interview with Bloomberg News. The company said on June 2 that hackers had launched a “targeted campaign” directed against Snowflake users that used single-factor authentication techniques.\n\nThe full scope of the data theft among Snowflake customers remains unclear. Cyber firm Mandiant, a unit of Google Cloud that’s helping Snowflake investigate the incident, said Monday that it had informed 165 “potentially exposed organizations” about their possible vulnerability. Only a handful of customers such as Live Nation Entertainment Inc., Pure Storage Inc. and Advanced Auto Parts so far have suggested that they experienced Snowflake-related issues.\n\nHackers used stolen credentials that were available in places like cybercriminal forums to access customer accounts, which lacked security measures such as multifactor authentication, Jones said. The attackers didn’t access a file of Snowflake logins, but rather used stolen usernames and passwords to infiltrate the accounts, assuming that people reuse their credentials, he said.\n\nSnowflake doesn’t have visibility into how much customer data was stolen, Jones said. The company has been working with law enforcement, in addition to Google’s Mandiant and CrowdStrike Holdings Inc., to look into the matter.\n\nJones said the hacking campaign underscores that many threats are preventable. “We have a broader challenge in the security community and enterprises that a lot of people aren’t nailing the basics,” he said in a reference to multifactor authentication.\n\nSnowflake became aware of the hacking effort on May 22, Jones said. The company blocked IP addresses linked to the hackers, working with commercial virtual private network vendors to do so, he added. Mandiant’s investigation began in April 2024 when it learned about leaked database records that the cyber firm later determined originated from a Snowflake customer account.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf customers failed to take action to secure potentially impacted accounts, Jones said, Snowflake locked those accounts to prevent further authorized access.\n\nThe company plans to release tools later this month that help customers accelerate adoption of security measures such as multifactor authentication, which requires someone to verify their identity in two or more ways before gaining access to their account.\n\nSnowflake charges customers based on much they use the product — also known as consumption. This includes when they remove data from the system. Jones said that “no significant consumption” occurred as a result of hackers gained unauthorized access to customer accounts.\n\n“It’s not like they were doing heavy computation on the data, just retrieving it,” Jones said when explaining why the hackers didn’t cause any meaningful additional Snowflake costs for customers.\n\nLast week, Ticketmaster owner Live Nation said it had discovered “unauthorized activity” on a third-party cloud database. A person familiar with the situation said the account was hosted on Snowflake. On Friday, Advanced Auto Parts also that it was investigating reports that that it was involved in a “security incident related to Snowflake.”\n\nSnowflake declined to comment on any specific customers.\n\nMandiant determined that a hacking group called called “UNC5537” was responsible for the attacks and that the gang hadn’t used “novel or sophisticated tools” to carry out the hack. Instead, the report said the hackers exploited the “large lists of stolen credentials” that “exist both for free and for purchase” on the dark web. Most suspected members of the gang are based in North America, researchers said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple's Intelligence aims to get users to pony up for new iPhones",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) kicked off its big push into generative AI with the debut of its Apple Intelligence platform at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday.\n\nBut if you own an iPhone 15 or older, you’re out of luck.\n\nApple says you’ll need an iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max or future iPhone to take advantage of the software. That’s because the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are the only iPhones with processors powerful enough to handle the AI platform.\n\nAnd despite coming out at the same time as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with older, less capable chips.\n\nThat’s certainly a letdown for people who bought an iPhone 15 this year expecting it to stay updated with the latest software for at least more than a year.\n\nApple, however, wins by ensuring that anyone who wants to use Apple Intelligence and doesn’t have its top-of-the-line phones will need to pay up or go without.\n\nCashing in on AI hype\n\nApple is taking a more holistic approach to generative AI than its peers, spreading its Apple Intelligence software out across its existing apps like Photos and Messages and improving the functionality of apps like Siri, which will now be far more responsive and intelligent thanks to both Apple’s AI models and help from OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nIt’s an enormous upgrade, and one the company hopes will make older iPhone users want to upgrade sooner than later. Apple CEO Tim Cook attends the annual developer conference event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., June 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nSee, one of Apple’s biggest problems is that its phones last a long time. IPhones get years' worth of security and operating system updates. And unless their batteries die or their screens crack, users hold on to them without feeling the need to upgrade every year.\n\nAccording to a 2023 survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, 61% of iPhone users had their previous iPhones for two or more years. Another 29% held onto their previous phone for three years or more.\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt, meanwhile, says that a recent analysis of 7,500 smartphone users from the US, UK, China, Germany, and Japan found that the average age of consumers’ iPhones is 21 months, up from 19.9 months last year.\n\nBy only bringing its AI features to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, Apple is incentivizing users to ditch their older phones for newer offerings more quickly, speeding up the usual replacement cycle.\n\n“With the advent of Apple Intelligence, we see replacement cycles shrinking, creating a stronger replacement dynamic,” BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nStill, Apple Intelligence isn’t even available to users yet, and a big part of whether it will drive any sales comes down to how Apple delivers on the promises it made about the software during WWDC.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe’ve seen companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announce and debut their own AI offerings only to have to rework or pull them back following consumer pushback. Microsoft had to make changes to its Recall feature before it even hit the market over concerns that it presented a security risk.\n\nRecall is designed to take screenshots of what you’ve been doing on your PC so you can go quickly and easily access it. But security researchers said it could lead to hackers being able to view your data with ease.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, had to address problems with its AI Overview for Search that told users it was alright to do things like add glue to pizza to keep the cheese from sliding off and eat rocks.\n\nApple will need to ensure that its own AI products don’t run into similar problems, which could keep some users from upgrading.\n\nNow the company just has to wait and see how well its Apple Intelligence works during its early beta periods. We’ll learn how many people actually want to buy their next smartphone based on the software when it lands later this fall. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Apple Is Positioned for Growth",
        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares pick up since March, after significantly trailing behind the rest of the big tech sector. Despite a sharp recovery, the stock is currently 2% below its all-time high. Comparatively, shares are underperforming the market by about 6% in a year that has generally been very favorable for other major tech companies.\n\nFigure 1: Apple shares sharply recover following lackluster performance\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ACN. Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\n\nThis underperformance can be attributed to Apple's lackluster growth since 2021, with declining revenue in five of the last six quarters on a year-over-year basis and several quarters of declining net income. This revenue slump has been primarily driven by poor macroeconomic conditions. However, the overall industry environment for smartphones and PCs is improving, which should support the company's product sales in 2024 and 2025. Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, several catalysts could drive Apple's performance. These include the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the reveal of Apple's generative artificial intelligence initiatives, new product launches (such as the iPad and Mac) and the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nI will explore these factors in more detail as I explain why I believe Apple is an appealing option, contrary to current investor sentiment.\n\nA resilient tech titan poised for growth\n\nFigure 2: iPhone revenue stagnation since 2021, substantial update incoming Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nApple is no longer a legacy tech play that's falling behind, but rather a company with an incredible moat that should be relatively immune from disruption at the hands of new AI tools and applications. Plus, with continued services growth and a potentially improved upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16, I think the stock could be ready to move higher in the coming months. It is true that growth has slowed over the last few years, but the revenue stagnation since 2021 was largely due to incremental updates in iPhone models, which have not driven substantial upgrade cycles.\n\nAs such, many are expecting this coming year's update to be more substantial, between the potential for iPhone 16 to outperform and continued organic growth in services, I believe that Apple's revenue and net income should continue trending up and to the right over the medium term. Being more than three years away from the last strong release positions, the company is pretty well ahead of the iPhone 16, and that's even without the generative AI contribution. So a potential OpenAI partnership, improvements to Siri and other exciting AI features in photo editing, writing, music and more should be more than enough to create a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic advantage\n\nWhile it is still uncertain who the ultimate winners and losers of the generative AI opportunity will be, one thing is clear: even a decade from now, users will likely access these apps through Apple's hardware and devices. This is exemplified by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) paying Apple $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser. This stability and competitive advantage present a highly attractive opportunity for Apple. Moreover, the company is well-positioned to benefit from new AI market entrants monetizing their apps through the App Store. As these entrants scale and seek a broad audience, the App Store remains one of the best platforms for it. With its monetization model, Apple is perfectly positioned to take a fee in return for providing this reach. As AI apps grow and monetize, this could significantly bolster services revenue growth. Apple is set to capitalize on the AI revolution, potentially unlocking a robust new revenue driver for its subscription ecosystem.\n\nAt the very least, we believe Apple will not experience material downside from being perceived as lagging in AI. All eyes are on the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, which started on June 10. Meeting expectations, the tech giant introduced its AI plans, which include a suite of tools it calls Apple Intelligence. In addition to the anticipated rollout of iOS 18, these generative AI capabilities could serve as a robust positive catalyst for the company going forward.\n\nFinancials\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Apple reported revenue of $90.80 billion, down 4% from the prior year but meeting the consensus expectations of $90.40 billion, which assured investors. Product revenue was $66.90 billion, a 10% decrease year over year primarily due to the one-time impact of iPhone channel inventory replenishment from the previous year. Last year, Apple managed to fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter's Covid-19 supply disruptions for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. Excluding this one-time impact, revenue would have been up 1% from the prior year, with iPhone revenue remaining flat. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% and aligning with consensus expectations.\n\nThe challenges faced by Apple's product segment are likely temporary, influenced by the harsh macroeconomic environment. Households across the developed world are contending with elevated inflation and high interest rates, which impact discretionary spending. However, demand for its products is expected to rebound as monetary policies across developed countries begin to ease. The April consumer price index showed a downtrend in the U.S. after a one-off spike in March.\n\nFigure 3: Second-quarter 2024 revenue and margin performance Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nAdditionally, Apple's gross margin improved, with the total gross margin percentage increasing to 46.60% from 44.30% in the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by a different services mix and cost savings. This improvement underscores the company's ability to manage costs effectively even in a challenging environment.\n\nRevenue and margin outlook\n\nI have bullish expectations for Apple's revenue outlook, driven by several key factors. The company's strategic push into AI, including the anticipated launch of iOS 18 with generative AI capabilities, is expected to significantly enhance its product offerings. This integration will likely boost demand for new devices and applications, driving overall revenue growth. Additionally, I expect the upcoming product launches to stimulate substantial consumer interest and drive higher sales. With improving macroeconomic conditions, including easing inflation and lower interest rates, I expect a recovery in consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth.\n\nFigure 4: Strong margins despite weak macro conditions Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nIn terms of margins, I expect strong growth, driven by Apple's expanding services segment. The services revenue increased by 14% year over year in the second quarter, contributing significantly to the company's overall margins. The high margins associated with services like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, compared to hardware sales, are expected to continue driving overall gross margin expansion as the Apple ecosystem expands through products like the Vision Pro. Further, as AI applications scale and monetize, services revenue will see exponential growth, contributing to higher margins. For the third quarter of 2024, I expect revenue to grow in low single digits year over year (in line with consensus and management expectations), with gross margins projected between 45.50% and 46.50%.\n\nFinancial strength and strategic opportunities\n\nApple boasts an unrivaled ecosystem and a balance sheet loaded with cash, giving it the ability to develop or acquire virtually any product. This combination of a strong ecosystem and a significant cash reserve presents substantial opportunities for the company. While Apple has not introduced a groundbreaking product recently, its potential to create another must-have item remains high.\n\nThere is ongoing speculation about potential deals, such as a partnership with Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) or an acquisition of Disney (NYSE:DIS). Although these transactions may or may not materialize, Apple's financial strength makes such moves plausible. Recently, Apple announced a $110 billion buyback, which aligns with its history of significant share repurchases, including previous authorizations of $90 billion and $100 billion. This marks the sixth consecutive year with buybacks exceeding $70 billion. Additionally, Apple has consistently increased its dividends annually for the past 12 years, recently raising the dividend by 4% to 25 cents per share for the current quarter. These actions underscore the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and innovations.\n\nValuation perspective\n\nFigure 5: Discounted cash flow valuation Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Author's calculations\n\nIn evaluating Apple's future potential, we can consider several key drivers that contribute to its positive outlook. The anticipated product launches are expected to drive substantial consumer interest and sales. The growth in services revenue, fueled by the integration of AI capabilities into offerings like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, will further bolster the company's financial performance. As AI applications scale, they will significantly enhance user experiences and engagement, contributing to a robust and profitable services ecosystem. Moreover, the improving macroeconomic conditions, such as easing inflation and lower interest rates, are expected to revive consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth. The expanding Apple ecosystem, characterized by the seamless integration of hardware, software and services, will continue to attract and retain a large user base, driving sustained revenue growth.\n\nThe valuation model indicates a fair share price of $223.50, representing an upside potential of 15.80% from the current share price of $193. This projection is underpinned by a constant growth rate of 6.10%, which is supported by Apple's historical compound annual growth rate over the last three decades. The company's ability to leverage its strong operating history and financial flexibility to integrate AI capabilities positions it well to capitalize on the AI revolution. This revolution is expected to add trillions of dollars to the global economy through increased productivity, and Apple is poised to be a significant beneficiary. My confidence in the company's ability to improve its FCF margin, projected to rise to 24.30% by 2028, is based on its historically strong operating leverage and efficient cost management. Given these factors, I believe Apple presents an attractive opportunity with significant upside potential.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nApple is well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability, driven by its strategic integration of AI capabilities, robust product pipeline and expanding services ecosystem. The company's financial strength and operational efficiency provide a solid foundation for navigating economic fluctuations and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities. With a proven track record of innovation and shareholder value creation, Apple remains a compelling investment opportunity. Given the anticipated revenue and margin growth, alongside improving macroeconomic conditions, I am confident if will continue to deliver strong financial performance and drive long-term value for shareholders.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

NV Energy will then sell the electricity to Google, under an agreement that still needs to be approved by state regulators.\n\nUnlike solar and wind facilities, geothermal plants can operate around the clock, using water heated by underground rocks to generate electricity with no carbon emissions. Fervo uses horizontal drilling within geothermal reservoirs to increase output.\n\nData centers are consuming an increasing amount of electricity, posing a problem for tech companies that have set goals to reduce their planet-warming carbon emissions. The electricity that Google agreed to buy from NV Energy and Fervo could power about 86,000 homes.\n\nHyperscalers — as the biggest data center owners like Google, Microsoft and Amazon are known — have all set climate goals and are facing internal and external pressure to deliver on them. Those lofty targets include decarbonizing their operations, including data centers. Google, for example, has a goal to run entirely on carbon-free energy around the clock by 2030, according to its website.\n\n(Story updates with tech company climate goals in last paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses.  To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control.  A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\n\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”\n\nThe FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,  13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\n\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Billionaire Israel Englander's Top Stock Pick for 2024?\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander’s Stake Value:$820,337,453\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is apparently in a no-holds-barred fight against competitors in the AI race that according to many threatened the bread and butter of Google its search business. However, many analysts believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making a big turn and will continue to grow. Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology founder, while talking to CNBC last month, said that the present for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is looking “real good” amid revenue growth, leadership’s harsh stance against those “making trouble” insider the company, dividends and buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest data analyzed by Bank of America shows that across all devices, Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) market search in search actually gained half a percentage point in May on a MoM basis. BofA analyst Justin Post said this shows Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews are “aiding query growth and usage.”\n\nAnalysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating the company’s growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet’s 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 8th on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The broader U.S. equity markets closed at fresh highs on each day this week, driven by solid job additions and a cooling inflationary trend. The markets were also buoyed by the Federal Reserve’s decision to keep interest rates unchanged in its latest policy meeting.\r\n\r\nWhile the consumer price index remained flat in May compared to a broad-based expectation of a 0.1% monthly increase, the U.S. economy added 272,000 jobs. The better-than-expected job additions portrayed robust labor market conditions and strength in the economy. However, the optimism was partially marred by the Fed’s decision to have only one rate cut this year, contrary to an earlier pledge to cut the same thrice in 2024.\r\n\r\nAs investors employ a wait-and-see approach in a classic example of “backing and filling” in the market, they can benefit from “cash cow” stocks that garner higher returns. However, identifying cash-rich stocks alone does not make for a solid investment proposition unless it is backed by attractive efficiency ratios like return on equity (ROE). A high ROE ensures that the company is reinvesting cash at a high rate of return. ABB Ltd ABBNY, Suzano S.A. SUZ, PulteGroup, Inc. PHM, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Banco de Chile BCH are some of the stocks with high ROE to profit from.\n\nROE: A Key Metric\n\nROE = Net Income/Shareholders’ Equity\r\n\r\nROE helps investors distinguish profit-generating companies from profit burners and is useful in determining the financial health of a company. In other words, this financial metric enables investors to identify companies that diligently deploy cash for higher returns.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ROE is often used to compare the profitability of a company with other firms in the industry — the higher, the better. It measures how well a company is multiplying its profits without investing new equity capital and portrays management’s efficiency in rewarding shareholders with attractive risk-adjusted returns.\n\nScreening Parameters\n\nIn order to shortlist stocks that are cash-rich with high ROE, we have added Cash Flow greater than $1 billion and ROE greater than X-Industry as our primary screening parameters. In addition, we have taken a few other criteria into consideration to arrive at a winning strategy.\r\n\r\nPrice/Cash Flow lesser than X-Industry: This metric measures how much investors pay for $1 of free cash flow. A lower ratio indicates that investors need to pay less for a better cash flow-generating stock.\r\n\r\nReturn on Assets (ROA) greater than X-Industry: This metric determines how much profit a company earns for every dollar of asset, which includes cash, accounts receivable, property, equipment, inventory and furniture. The higher the ROA, the better it is for the company.\r\n\r\n5-Year EPS Historical Growth greater than X-Industry: This criterion indicates that continued earnings momentum has translated into solid cash strength. \r\n\r\nZacks Rank less than or equal to 2: Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) stocks are known to outperform irrespective of the market environment.\r\n\r\nHere are five of the 10 stocks that qualified the screening:\r\n\r\nABB: Headquartered in Zurich, Switzerland, ABB offers electrification, motion and automation products and solutions for diverse customers in utilities, transport and infrastructure sectors across the globe. The company’s solutions leverage engineering know-how and software to optimize operations and accelerate industrial transformation.\r\n\r\nIt has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 8.5%. It has a VGM Score of B. ABB carries a Zacks Rank #2. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nSuzano: Headquartered in Salvador, Brazil, Suzano produces and sells eucalyptus pulp and paper products. With more than 90 years of experience, this vertically integrated firm is one of the largest producers of paper and graphic products in South America. \r\n\r\nThe company offers coated and uncoated printing and writing papers, paperboards, tissue papers and lignin. Suzano sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nPulteGroup: Based in Atlanta, GA, PulteGroup engages in homebuilding and financial services businesses, primarily in the United States. The company conducts operations through two primary business segments – Homebuilding – which accounts for the lion’s share of revenues, and Financial Services. \r\n\r\nPulteGroup has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.6% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 12.5%, on average. It sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nAlphabet: Headquartered in Mountain View, CA, Alphabet is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, it has evolved from primarily being a search engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others. In the online search arena, Google has a monopoly with more than 94% of the online search volume and market. Alphabet has witnessed an increase in search queries, resulting from a rise in user adoption and usage, primarily on mobile devices, continued growth in advertiser activity and improvements in ad formats.\r\n\r\nThe company has a long-term earnings growth expectation of 17.5% and delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 11.3%, on average. Alphabet sports a Zacks Rank #1.\r\n\r\nBanco de Chile: Headquartered in Santiago, Chile, Banco de Chile provides various banking services to customers in the Latin American country. These include deposit accounts, loans, payment-related cards and insurance solutions. The company also offers services such as cash management, treasury, financial advisory, trade finance, leasing, factoring, payment, payroll, collection, mutual fund management, securities brokerage, currency trading, investment management, collection, securitization and capital markets services.\r\n\r\nIt delivered a trailing four-quarter earnings surprise of 7.1%, on average. Banco de Chile carries a Zacks Rank #2.\r\n\r\nYou can get the rest of the stocks on this list by signing up now for your 2-week free trial to the Research Wizard and start using this screen in your own trading.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks to Buy That Are Actually Churning Out Revenue",
        "content": "It has been less than two years since ChatGPT 3.5’s release opened the capital floodgates for AI. Yet, in that short period, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) briefly surpassed Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap of $3 trillion, having increased its valuation by 643% since November 2022. While this trend amplifies the investing thesis, which AI stocks should you buy?\n\nIn particular, which companies have demonstrated clear-cut integration of AI to generate revenue and boost their bottom line?\n\nInvestors should consider these companies’ business models in the future to avoid relying on the “AI” buzzword alone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nRecently, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) tweaked its terms-of-use agreement. Although negatively received, it revealed trends that investors should account for. After transitioning to subscription model and cloud dependence, the company became a software as a service (SaaS) platform.\n\nDeparting from the traditional software licensing of one-time purchases allowed Adobe to boost its revenue stream and valuation drastically. The new licensing update enabled the company to access user-generated content hosted on Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\nConsidering Adobe’s existing rollout of AI algorithms, such as Content-Aware Fill and Sensei, this translates to Adobe utilizing those algorithms to further “improve services” by scanning vast amounts of user data, despite some caveats. This development is beneficial for existing and new Adobe shareholders.\n\nFirst, high-profile protestations of individuals do not have a strong history of impact. In the case of Adobe, this is even less pertinent because of the underlying mechanic. Namely, localized deployment of AI is not feasible for the vast majority of users. In turn, as they rely on cloud-powered AI tools, they become better owing to the network effect.\n\nBecause Adobe’s market share in the app development market is substantial, at around 60%, that network effect is also substantial. Conversely, in this cutthroat sector, Adobe’s services are likely to be superior to those of its competitors, making ADBE one of the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nAdobe has already proven its business model by consecutively beating EPS estimates since Q2 23 except Q1 (only -1.12% surprise), so the company will likely hold and expand its status as a content-generating hub. At its present price of $465.43, ADBE stock is close to its 52-week low of $433.97 per share. Nasdaq’s forecasting puts the average ADBE price target at $615.85 12 months ahead, while even the low estimate of $445 is near the present price level.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAvailable as American Depositary Shares (ADS), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) incorporated AI even more so than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). As the Chinese equivalent to Google in the advertising and search engine arena, Baidu branched out to cloud services, smart homes, autonomous ride-hailing, augmented reality (AR) and healthcare.\n\nSimilar to Google’s creation of its vast app ecosystem, Baidu is cementing its position by releasing the framework for generating AI chatbots depending on users’ needs. In April, Baidu’s CEO Robin Li noted that Ernie (akin to ChatGPT) exceeded 200 million users.\n\nBreaking barriers to entry in creating custom bots, Baidu unleashed three pillars of the rapidly growing ecosystem – ModelBuilder, AgentBuilder and AppBuilder. More importantly, Baidu lacked ideological commitments, which resulted in Google’s Gemini launch debacle.\n\nIn Q1 earnings delivered mid-May, Baidu’s revenue increased 1% YoY, with quarterly net income growing 110% to $755 million. The company beat its EPS estimates for the last four consecutive quarters, with the latest surprise of +27.89%. From the present price of $95.89, BIDU stock is poised for significant growth to $155.06 per share, according to Nasdaq’s forecasting.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nExactly one year ago, in June 2023, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) decided to invest $3 billion into AI over the next three years. Building on its previous AI patents and expertise in client solutions, the global consulting company is scaling for the future.\n\nIn particular, through Accenture’s Center for Advanced AI, the company is heading its R&D division for generative AI. Considering that many chatbots have a confabulation problem, Accenture’s high credibility among Fortune Global 500 companies is likely to carve its own AI ecosystem, making it a strong candidate for investors looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nFor fiscal Q2 2024 earnings delivered in March, Accenture broke its record on new bookings at $21.6 billion. The company’s net income increased by 10.3% to $1.71 billion. That was despite the decrease in revenue in Financial Services (-6%) and Communications, Media & Technology (-7%) and 10 bps decrease in operating margin.\n\nHowever, the 10% growth in Health and Public Service revenue made up for it, resulting in $1.99 billion in free cash flow vs. $2.33 billion in the year-ago quarter. At its present price of $288.40, ACN stock is close to its 52-week low of $278.69. Nasdaq’s average ACN price target falls to a significant upside of $372.28, with the low estimate near the current level of $275 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – June 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Microsoft Corp. MSFT, Apple Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and CompX International Inc. CIX.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Analyst Reports for Microsoft, Apple and Alphabet\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc, as well as a micro-cap stock CompX International Inc. The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.8% vs. +23.7%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +13.5%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+28.4% vs. +22.2%). The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers, cloud regions and availability zones will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.\r\n\r\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on the company’s search engine. Growing momentum across Google’s mobile search is contributing further. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of CompX International have outperformed the Zacks Office Supplies industry over the past six months (+18.2% vs. +10.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $292.45 million have a strong cash and marketable securities balance of $75.6 million as of Mar 31, 2024, ensures robust liquidity for operations and growth.\r\n\r\nCompX International also consistently pays dividends, with a recent 20% increase. The Security Products segment saw a 9% year-over-year sales increase in the first quarter of 2024, indicating strong demand. Efficient cost management in the Marine Components segment and aligning inventory with market conditions reflect operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, CompX faces a challenging 2024 outlook, particularly in the Marine Components segment, due to reduced demand and OEM customers cutting production. Security Products’ sales are expected to be lower, as a significant government project from 2023 is not anticipated to recur. Also, intense competition and dependency on key customers pose additional risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CompX International here >>>)\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Larry Ellison’s fortune grows $14 billion overnight, making him the seventh-richest person on earth",
        "content": "Oracle's founder and largest shareholder, Larry Ellison, has jumped two spots on the Bloomberg Billionaires Index after the tech behemoth posted a bumper outlook this week.\n\nOnly yesterday Ellison's net worth was $138 billion but overnight that leapt $14 billion to $152 billion.\n\nThat's largely because the 79-year-old entrepreneur owns more than 40% of the cloud applications business, which saw its shares surge 13% on June 11 after the company posted positive year-end financial results.\n\nAs a result of his sudden increase in wealth Ellison jumped past two other tech titans on Bloomberg's Billionaires Index: former Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer and the founder of Google parent company Alphabet, Sergey Brin.\n\nWhile Ballmer and Brin have both seen boosts to their wealth so far this year ($21.2 billion and $27.2 billion respectively) it hasn't been enough to stay ahead of Ellison, whose fortune has ballooned by $29.1 billion in 2024 alone, taking it to a record high.\n\nThe reason for their collective riches growing so exponentially is Silicon Valley's favorite term: artificial intelligence.\n\nTurning first to Oracle, in its bumper outlook released Tuesday, CEO Safra Catz said the organization had signed \"the largest sales contracts in our history—driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models.\"\n\nCatz, who previously held the role of CFO at Oracle, continued: \"Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong AI demand to push Oracle sales… even higher.\n\n\"In Q4 alone, Oracle signed over 30 AI sales contracts totaling more than $12.5 billion—including one with OpenAI to train ChatGPT in the Oracle Cloud.\"\n\nAs well as the OpenAI contract, Oracle is also working more closely with Microsoft—a backer of the ChatGPT maker—and Google. During the earnings call, Ellison said: \"As customers continue to choose and use multiple clouds, hyperscalers like Microsoft and Google are responding by interconnecting their clouds.\n\n\"Oracle recently signed an agreement with Google to interconnect our clouds… We expect the Oracle database to be available within the Google Cloud in September this year.\"\n\nEllison's not the only one\n\nOthers with Big Tech ties have also seen their wealth spike this year thanks to—you guessed it—AI. Across the board the super-rich have seen at least $150 billion added to their fortunes courtesy of the tech.\n\nTake Brin, who owns 41.8% of Alphabet's Class B stocks—per the company's 2023 proxy statement—and CEO Sundar Pichai, who owns 227,560 Class A shares. Both individuals have seen their fortunes grow thanks to the disruptive technology, with Pichai now nearing billionaire status thanks to his salary package and stock awards.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet's stock has surged this year—up 28% for the year to date at the time of writing—but has bounced particularly when earnings have shared positive AI news. On April 25, in one example, the company announced its Q12024 results and said it was \"well under way with our Gemini era\" and was continuing to establish itself as an AI leader.\n\nThe market liked what it heard, and shares opened 15% higher the day following the announcement compared to the morning prior.\n\nThe story is the same for Ballmer and Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates. In April, Gates's wealth grew $2 billion off the back of an earnings call which mentioned AI 50 times, as CEO Satya Nadella revealed a raft of new AI deployments. He said: “We have the most powerful AI infrastructure, and it’s being used by our partner, OpenAI, as well as Nvidia and leading AI startups like Adept and Inflection to train large models.\"\n\nAfter the call Microsoft shares logged their best single-day percentage hike since November 2022. Analysts also pointed out the shares reached a milestone on an absolute basis—they had previously never risen more than $19.77 in a single session, until they did at the end of April.\n\nElsewhere Meta founder Mark Zuckerberg's wealth has grown thanks to a combination of his \"year of efficiency\" and his adventures in artificial intelligence. In January, Zuckerberg outlined a raft of measures to streamline the company and in February outlined a wider artificial intelligence strategy—since then his wealth has grown from $63 billion to $181 billion, per Bloomberg's Billionaires Index.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – June 13, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Apple, Inc. AAPL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL, Netflix, Inc. NFLX and Broadcom Inc. AVGO.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nA.I. Optimism Powers Nasdaq to Hit Fresh All-Time High: 5 Picks\n\nThe tech rally has been helping Wall Street hit fresh records this year. On Jun 11, the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 closed at fresh all-time highs for the second straight day.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq closed 0.9% higher at 17,343.55 points on Tuesday, as the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence continued to make investors optimistic about the AI space.\n\nYear to date, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 15.5% after soaring 43.4% in 2023, recording its best year since 2020.\n\nTech stocks have been performing particularly well after a not-so-impressive 2022 as higher interest rates weighed on growth stocks. However, tech companies have since rebounded and powered Nasdaq into the winning zone.\n\nThis year’s rally is particularly being driven by stocks focused on AI, particularly generative AI, which has also been helping the broader market.\n\nOptimism Surrounding AI Powering Nasdaq Rally\n\nWhile AI experts' opinions, particularly on the future of generative AI, are divided, the excitement around this field has been enormous in the past year. Many believe that AI is still in its early stages and that its full potential has yet to be realized.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. has been a frontrunner in generative artificial intelligence (AI) and has been central to the surge in interest in this field.\n\nIts shares have soared 211.9% in the past 12 months and 144.2% year to date.\n\nThe company’s CEO, Jensen Huang, recently unveiled the company's new AI chip architecture, dubbed \"Rubin,\" at an industry conference in Taipei. He also announced plans to release a high-performance version of the Blackwell chip, called the Blackwell Ultra, in 2025.\n\nThe Rubin architecture will include new GPUs designed for AI systems, CPUs, and networking chips.\n\nNVIDIA’s solid progress in the generative AI space has seen several tech giants trying to get a prominent footprint in that area. On Tuesday, Apple, Inc. unveiled a series of new AI-powered features backed by a deal with OpenAI.\n\nAlso, the advancement of smart devices is supporting the field as they require computing and learning abilities for tasks like face detection, image recognition and video analytics. These functions require high processing power, speed, memory, low power consumption, and improved graphic processors and solutions, which are all favorable conditions for the semiconductor industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the semiconductor industry is experiencing a strong recovery as a result, following a period of challenges until the first half of 2022.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in Nasdaq stocks such as Alphabet Inc., Netflix, Inc. and Broadcom Inc., which have strong potential in 2024. These stocks have a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy) and assure good returns. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nAlphabet Inc. is one of the most innovative companies in the modern technological age. Over the last few years, GOOGL has evolved from primarily being a search-engine provider to cloud computing, ad-based video and music streaming, autonomous vehicles, healthcare providers and others.\n\nAlphabet’s expected earnings growth rate for next year is 31%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the past 60 days. GOOGL presently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nNetflix, Inc. is considered a pioneer in the streaming space. NFLX has been spending aggressively on building its portfolio of original shows. This is helping Netflix sustain its leading position despite the launch of new services like Disney+ and Apple TV+, as well as existing services like Amazon Prime Video.\n\nNetflix’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 52.2%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 7.5% over the past 60 days. NFLX currently sports a Zacks Rank #1.\n\nBroadcom Inc. is a premier designer, developer and global supplier of a broad range of semiconductor devices with a focus on complex digital and mixed signal complementary metal oxide semiconductor-based devices and analog III-V-based products. AVGO’s semiconductor solutions are used in end products such as enterprise and data center networking, home connectivity, set-top boxes, broadband access, telecommunication equipment, smartphones and base stations, data center servers and storage systems, factory automation, power generation and alternative energy systems, and electronic displays.\n\nBroadcom’s expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 11.4%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current-year earnings has improved 0.3% over the past 60 days. AVGO currently carries a Zacks Rank #2.\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "US stock futures mixed; hawkish Fed, soft inflation send differing messages",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digested hawkish messages from the Federal Reserve as well as benign consumer prices, with more economic data due.\n\nAt 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT), Dow Jones Futures fell 155 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat and Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 100 points, or 0.5%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a largely strong session, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite hitting all-time highs and closing at records. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outlier, closing 0.1% lower.\n\nFed strikes hawkish chord, CPI inflation falls\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates steady as widely expected on Wednesday. But Chair Jerome Powell surprised markets by stating that the central bank was now set to cut rates only once this year, down from a prior estimate in March for three cuts.\n\nThe change in the Fed’s stance came as more members saw signs of higher inflation in the country, with some policymakers also calling for no cuts this year. The central bank also raised its inflation outlook for the year.\n\nBut the Fed’s hawkish messaging was somewhat offset by data showing consumer price index inflation eased slightly in May.\n\nThe May producer price index is due later in the session and is set to offer more cues on overall inflation, while the weekly jobless claims numbers will add details about the labor market.\n\nBroadcom shines\n\nThe rech sector has been in the spotlight this week, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a slew of new AI features for its flagship devices, and that it was also partnering with OpenAI to implement some of the features, and cloud giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) announced AI partnerships with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThis focus is set to continue Thursday, as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) surged over 12% premarket after the chipmaker clocked bumper earnings on AI demand. The firm also announced a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nElsewhere, Dave&Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock fell 10% after the company’s first-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gained 5% after CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post that shareholders are backing his $56 billion pay package and a move by the electric vehicle giant to reincorporate in Texas from Delaware.\n\nCrude slips on stockpile build\n\nCrude prices fell Thursday after a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories dented expectations of growing demand in the world's largest consumer.\n\nBy 06:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1% lower at $77.75 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.9% to $81.89 per barrel.\n\nStory continues\n\nGovernment data, released on Wednesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 3.7 million barrels in the first week of June, against expectations for a draw of 1.2 million barrels.\n\nOutsized builds in distillates and gasoline stockpiles also drove up concerns that fuel demand was not picking up with the summer season as expected.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed; hawkish Fed, soft inflation send differing messages\n\nVirgin Galactic shares tumble on reverse stock split announcement\n\nReaction to Musk's post on voting for his $56 billion Tesla pay package\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Seeking a 20%+ Dividend Yield? Check Out the FEPI ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI)",
        "content": "Even in a world where interest rates are higher than they were a few years ago, a yield of over 20% still stands out no matter what type of environment we are in, and that’s exactly what the REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI) offers investors.\n\nI’m bullish on this newer, still under-the-radar dividend ETF from REX Shares based on its gargantuan yield, attractive monthly payout schedule, and portfolio of highly-rated tech stocks.\n\nWhat Is the FEPI ETF’s Strategy?\n\nFEPI’s strategy is to own large-cap tech stocks (the 15 stocks in the Solactive FANG Innovation Index) and write covered calls against these holdings in order to create enhanced income potential.\n\nIt’s a strategy that has grown in popularity in recent years, as similar funds like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) have grown into some of the market’s most popular ETFs.\n\nEssentially, FEPI sells covered calls against its holdings and uses the options premiums it receives from selling these calls in order to pay its holders a monthly distribution. This can be a great strategy for generating steady and above-average income, as evidenced by FEPI’s frequent payouts and large yield. These large-cap tech stocks drive considerable investor interest and feature plenty of volatility, so they are particularly well-suited for generating attractive options premiums.\n\nThe downside of this strategy is that FEPI holders potentially sacrifice upside from capital appreciation because if its holdings climb above the strike price for the calls it is selling, FEPI holders miss out on this additional upside.\n\nFor example, FEPI’s top holding is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This is a theoretical example, but let’s say FEPI sells one contract of June 21 Nvidia calls with a strike price of $130 for a $120 premium. In this hypothetical example, the fund benefits by receiving a premium of ~$120 from the buyer of the options for selling these calls, which it can distribute to its holders.\n\nHowever, if the shares of Nvidia rise above $130 on the closing date, to $150 for example, the fund is contractually obligated to sell these shares to the buyer of the call for the contracted price of $130, meaning that it didn’t benefit from any of the appreciation of $20 per share past the strike price.\n\nHowever, if the shares of Nvidia stay below the strike price, the fund managers can sell new calls against them and repeat the process all over again to continually generate consistent income.\n\nAs long as investors understand these potential tradeoffs and accept the fact that they will likely miss out on some upside from price appreciation from time to time, this can be an attractive and effective strategy for generating considerable income on a monthly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMassive Yield\n\nIt’s important to note that the level of FEPI’s monthly payout is not set in stone, and the fund doesn’t guarantee that it will make a monthly payout.\n\nThat being said, since launching in October 2023, the fund has been remarkably consistent so far, making a payout each month — the smallest of these was $1.09 in April. We covered FEPI shortly after it launched last year, writing that it had the potential for significant payouts, and this has largely played out.\n\nMany websites will list FEPI’s yield as 14.9% — which is still incredibly attractive — but that doesn’t tell the whole story. This is its yield on a trailing 12-month basis, and the fund only launched late last year, so it has only made seven months of payments thus far.\n\nLooking at the yield on a forward basis paints a clearer, though imperfect, picture. Using the fund’s most recent payout of $1.16 in May as the monthly payout going forward, the fund boasts a massive distribution yield of 25.2%. Even if payouts decrease slightly from May’s level and fluctuate, this yield will still be very high.\n\nIt’s hard to understate just how outsized this yield is. The S&P 500 (SPX) yields just a meager 1.4%, while 10-year treasury bonds yield a risk-free 4.4%. Even FEPI’s aforementioned peers, like JEPI and JEPQ, yield 7.7% and 9.8%, respectively, on a forward basis (using the same methodology as above).\n\nConcentrated Holdings\n\nFEPI owns 15 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 67.8% of its portfolio. FEPI is not very diversified and is highly concentrated, but diversification is not the fund’s goal.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of FEPI’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, FEPI’s portfolio consists largely of the highly-rated large-cap technology stocks that have powered the market higher in recent years, such as Nvidia and its fellow magnificent-seven stocks, fellow chipmakers Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and a handful of other tech names.\n\nThese holdings are highly rated by TipRanks’ proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Eight of FEPI’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores, and three, Broadcom, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), feature “Perfect 10” Smart Scores.\n\nFEPI boasts an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nHow Much Does FEPI Charge?\n\nOne downside of FEPI is that its expense ratio of 0.65% is fairly pricey. An investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay $65 in fees annually. However, this is an actively managed fund with a fairly complex strategy, so the higher expense ratio is not necessarily surprising. If the fund can continue to deliver monthly payments to holders and maintain such a high yield, then few investors will complain about the expense ratio. However, if FEPI falters, then more investors will begin to question its expense ratio.\n\nNot Without Risks\n\nAs discussed above, investors in the fund are potentially forgoing some upside from price appreciation in exchange for this large yield.\n\nBeyond that, this is a fairly new fund and strategy, so it remains to be seen if its strategy will pan out over time or if it will be able to continue paying out this much over the long term.\n\nLastly, the fact that the fund is highly concentrated and heavily exposed to just one part of the market, large-cap tech, exposes investors to considerable risk if this segment of the market suffers.\n\nIs FEPI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FEPI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst FEPI stock price target of $59.89 implies 8.7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Standout Investment for Income Investors\n\nEven in a world of higher yields, FEPI’s yield of over 20% stands out. I’m bullish on the ETF based on this massive yield and its monthly payout schedule, as well as its highly-rated portfolio.\n\nAs long as investors understand and are comfortable with the fact that this big-time yield comes with the tradeoff of potentially leaving a portion of potential upside from capital appreciation on the table, then FEPI can be a good option for generating monthly income. For this reason, I wouldn’t necessarily allocate my whole portfolio toward FEPI, but I believe it can be a useful tool for generating income within a diversified portfolio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google was hit with a complaint by Austrian advocacy group NOYB on Thursday for allegedly tracking users of its Chrome Web browser, an issue already on EU antitrust regulators' radar.\n\nThe U.S. tech giant is phasing out the use of third-party cookies that advertisers use to track consumers in order to protect consumer privacy.\n\nIt has introduced a set of tools called the Privacy Sandbox to block covert tracking techniques and limit data sharing with third parties while developers and publishers can measure ads without tracking individual users.\n\nChrome users are asked whether they want to turn on the ad privacy feature or not to prevent being tracked.\n\nNOYB (none of your business) said the feature allows Google to track users within the browser, and that the company should first seek users' consent as required under European Union privacy rules.\n\n\"People thought they were agreeing to a privacy feature, but were tricked into accepting Google's first-party ad tracking. Consent has to be informed, transparent and fair to be legal. Google has done the exact opposite,\" NOYB founder Max Schrems said in statement.\n\nThe group on Thursday filed a complaint with the Austrian data protection authority.\n\nNOYB has filed scores of complaints with EU and national privacy watchdogs against big tech companies for alleged privacy infringements.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Mark Potter)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - Google has entered into an agreement with Berkshire Hathaway electric utility NV Energy to power its Nevada data centers with advanced geothermal electricity, the U.S. technology company said on Wednesday.\n\nThe deal, which has been sent to state utility regulators for approval, would increase the amount of carbon-free geothermal electricity injected into the local power grid for Google's operations to 115 megawatts from 3.5 megawatts in about six years, Google said in a statement.\n\nThe agreement comes as the world's biggest technology companies hunt for massive amounts of electricity to power their rapidly-expanding data centers, or giant computer warehouses, needed to support technologies like generative artificial intelligence and cloud computing.\n\nThe partnership advances Google towards its goal of running on entirely clean energy by 2030.\n\nSo far this year, Google has announced plans to spend at least $4 billion to build or expand data centers in Indiana, Missouri and Virginia.\n\nGoogle's global operations were powered by 64% carbon-free energy, including wind and solar, according to the company's latest environmental report.\n\nThe partnership with NV Energy is a new way that companies with very large emerging electricity loads and climate goals may get their power in regulated power markets.\n\nRegulated power markets require power to be purchased from the local utility, as opposed to directly from a power generator, which can make it challenging for companies seeking all-clean energy.\n\nThe agreement involved Google's direct input in NV Energy's power generation resource planning and developing a rate structure, which has been dubbed the Clean Transition Tariff, that Google wants to be replicated elsewhere in the country.\n\nDuke Energy, which operates in regulated states, announced a similar agreement with Google, as well as Microsoft and Amazon, late last month.\n\nTo facilitate the deal, NV Energy executed a power purchase agreement with advanced geothermal developer Fervo Energy, which is currently supplying Google with 3.5 megawatts of power after entering into a pilot program with the technology company in 2021.\n\nPower sources from solar and wind energies depend on the availability sunshine and wind, which has led to companies searching for firm clean capacity to consider existing nuclear or lesser used technologies like geothermal.\n\nGeothermal, which uses naturally occurring underground heat to produce renewable electricity, accounts for about 10% of the total electricity generation in Nevada, or the most of any U.S. state, according to the Energy Information Administration.\n\n(Reporting by Laila Kearney; Editing Liz Hampton and Rashmi Aich)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA): Underrated AI Stock Yielding Over 5%",
        "content": "AI stocks are hot, but many are richly valued, and few pay dividends. Enter Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) — an underrated AI stock that’s profitable, trades at an alluring valuation, and features an enticing forward dividend yield of 5.1%.\n\nI’m bullish on Opera based on its user and average revenue per user (ARPU) growth, the advances it is making in using AI technology to enhance its products, its attractive valuation, and its big-time dividend yield of 5.1%, which makes it a rarity among tech stocks. Additionally, analysts believe that Opera has upside potential of over 50%, making this stock an interesting bargain in the AI space.\n\nWhat Is Opera?\n\nFounded in 1995 and based in Oslo, Norway, Opera is a provider of web browsers for Windows, iOS, and Linux computers, as well as mobile browsers. Opera describes itself as “a user-centric and innovative software company focused on enabling the best possible internet browsing experience across all devices.”\n\nHow does the company make money? Opera generates 58% of its revenue money through advertising and 42% through search. You can think of Opera as a much smaller competitor to Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, but without the “Other Bets” segment the larger company comes with.\n\nGrowth Opportunities Abound\n\nOpera is much smaller than its competitors and only accounts for 2.5% of web browser market share worldwide as of May 2024. However, this can also be seen as an opportunity, as Opera has plenty of room to grow and try to take share from larger competitors.\n\nWhile it isn’t easy going up against massive, well-resourced competitors like Alphabet and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Opera can differentiate itself and compete with them by innovating and offering differentiated features that other browsers lack.\n\nFor example, Opera features free VPN, tracking protection, a built-in ad blocker, cryptomining protection, and integrated messengers, which Google’s Chrome lacks. Opera also touts the fact that it is more RAM/CPU friendly than Chrome. In a comparison between Opera and Apple’s Safari, Opera boasts features like free VPN, browser AI, a built-in ad blocker, built-in crypto wallets, integrated messengers, and other features that Safari lacks.\n\nOpera also differentiates itself by serving lucrative niche audiences, such as via its Opera GX browser, which specifically caters to gamers. Opera GX allows users to set limits for CPU, RAM, and network usage to optimize performance, integrate Discord and Twitch directly from its sidebar, and use GX Mods to fully customize the browser and create custom keyboard shortcuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Opera GX browser has 30 million users and is Opera’s most lucrative product in terms of ARPU. Opera believes it has a long runway ahead in this niche, estimating its total addressable market (TAM) to be 500 million users worldwide, an appropriately conservative estimate, given that it estimates there are 1.8 billion PC gamers globally.\n\nAdditionally, the company is growing its user base and revenues. Its user base in Western markets has grown by 64% over the past four years, from 31 million to 51 million, and its ARPU has grown by 248% over the past four years. Additionally, Opera GX has grown by 1,400% from two million users to 30 million over the same time frame.\n\nOpera may also have regulatory tailwinds at its back. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) now requires Apple and others to give users choices for default browsers on mobile devices, and Opera says this led to a spike in daily active users in the EU.\n\nCo-CEO Song Lin said, “We are starting from a modest base due to previous platform limitations, leading us to believe that the growth potential is substantial.” Lin added that Opera is “very excited about this development and will increase our iOS investments now that the playing field is more level with other key regions potentially also opening up.”\n\nAI Advances\n\nWhile Opera hasn’t received the same fanfare as many other AI stocks, it has released a spate of exciting AI-related updates in recent weeks. Aria, its new in-browser AI assistant, combines the ChatGPT model with up-to-date information.\n\nIn late May, the company announced plans to collaborate with Google to integrate Google’s Gemini AI feature into its Aria AI browser. It also unveiled plans to incorporate AI into “on-device browser capabilities to its flagship browser, Opera One, and its gaming browser, Opera GX.” While the companies compete in some areas, it appears to be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both.\n\nOPRA’s Alluring Valuation\n\nDespite these exciting AI growth prospects, Opera trades like a value stock at just 16.6 times 2024 consensus earnings estimates. Going out to next year, the stock looks downright cheap, trading at just 13.3 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nFor comparison, Alphabet trades at a reasonable but far higher 23.5 times earnings estimates, and the S&P 500 (SPX) sports an average P/E ratio of 23.4. Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 trades at a considerably higher average P/E multiple of 30.9.\n\nOpera’s Dividend Makes It a Rarity Among Tech Stocks\n\nWhile many AI stocks are years away from profitability, let alone returning capital to shareholders, Opera pays a generous dividend and currently yields an enticing 5.1%. The company paid its first special dividend in January 2023 and subsequently declared a regular semiannual dividend of $0.80 per share.\n\nOpera’s yield is more than six times higher than that of the Nasdaq 100 (0.8%), illustrating just how remarkable OPRA’s dividend yield is compared to its tech-sector peers.\n\nOpera also engages in share buybacks and has bought back 35.5 million American depository shares since 2020, representing about 30% of shares outstanding at the start of 2020.\n\nIs OPRA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, OPRA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on two Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average OPRA stock price target of $23.50 implies 53.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nA Rare Bargain in the AI Space\n\nWhile many tech and AI-related stocks trade at sky-high valuations due to their immense growth opportunities, Opera looks like a downright bargain. I’m bullish on Opera based on its inexpensive valuation, considerable growth runway, exciting potential to further leverage AI into its products, and its 5.1% dividend yield, which is difficult to beat in the tech sector.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The ‘Google bombing’ 2000s trend is back, with the help of Google’s AI overviews",
        "content": "If you Googled “miserable failure” in 2005, President George W. Bush’s official biography on the White House website would show up as the top result.\n\nThis was not a political act on the tech company’s part, but rather, a prank. Early jokesters of the internet may remember the 2000s fun of “Google bombing,” of which the Bush insult is the most famous.\n\nGoogle bombing occurred when trollers linked a webpage – like Bush’s biography – to specific text on their own sites – like, in Bush’s case, “miserable failure.” With enough instances, the search engine’s algorithm misinterpreted the terms as popularly linked. This created all kinds of entertaining results: Googling “Liar” and “poodle” produced the webpage for UK’s prime minister at the time, Tony Blair, while “Dangerous cult” returned the Church of Scientology’s website as the first result.\n\nGoogle adjusted its algorithm to prevent further Googlebombs in 2007. However, the ghost of Googlebombs has come back to haunt the tech giant, and this time, it’s through their own technological goof.\n\nAfter Google rolled out an AI-powered search overview in May, users quickly noticed the false and wacky results that these overviews sometimes provided. If you asked Google about the health benefits of running with scissors, it told you the activity was a good cardio exercise to “improve your pores and give you strength.” Another query led Google to recommend the health benefits of rocks, apparently referencing a satirical article from the Onion.\n\n“Eating the right rocks can be good for you because they contain minerals that are important for your body’s health,” Google’s AI overview replied to a reporter’s query.\n\n‘Glue in pizza’ remains strong\n\nHowever, nothing made the internet riot as much as a suggestion from the AI Overview to “mix about 1/8 cup of non-toxic glue into the sauce” to keep cheese from sliding off your pizza slice.\n\nA spokesperson from Google brushed off the false results, writing at the time that “the examples we’ve seen are generally very uncommon queries, and aren’t representative of most people’s experiences.” They added that the “vast majority” of AI Overviews provide high quality information, with links to allow the inquiring person to dig deeper into a search.\n\nHowever, even as Google publicly expressed confidence in its new AI tool,  the company quietly began reducing its visibility. Google gradually reduced the amount that AI Overviews popped up in search results from 84% to 15%, according to research from content marketing platform BrightEdge.\n\nA spokesperson from Google disputed the data, noting that the numbers were different than what the company had seen. They added that this was likely because BrightEdge looked at a narrowed query set that is not a representative sample of Google Search traffic, including those who had opted out of AI overviews.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne example where AI overviews sometimes still shows up is the same glue-in-pizza result that had the internet rolling. The Verge recently reported that if you ask Google how much glue to add to your pizza, it will give the same result, only this time citing an article from Business Insider about the fiasco.\n\nWhich means that,it seems like the more journalists write about the ridiculous AI Overviews, the more it feeds the algorithm to produce the same, wrong results. It’s a kind of self-fulfilling feedback loop that recalls the absurdity of the Googlebombing days, although the only troll in play is Google itself.\n\nWhen Fortune reporters attempted various searches for pizza, cheese, and glue, no AI overview would pop up, possibly meaning that Google may have caught wind of their continuous blunders and promptly adjusted their platform.\n\nThe Google spokesperson said the queries continue to show for a large number of searches, but the technology is undergoing edits.\n\n“We're continuing to refine when and how we show AI Overviews so they're as useful as possible, including technical updates to improve response quality,” they told Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

(GOOGL), as well as a micro-cap stock CompX International Inc. (CIX). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.8% vs. +23.7%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +13.5%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+28.4% vs. +22.2%). The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers, cloud regions and availability zones will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.\r\n\r\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on the company’s search engine. Growing momentum across Google’s mobile search is contributing further. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of CompX International have outperformed the Zacks Office Supplies industry over the past six months (+18.2% vs. +10.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $292.45 million have a strong cash and marketable securities balance of $75.6 million as of Mar 31, 2024, ensures robust liquidity for operations and growth.\r\n\r\nCompX International also consistently pays dividends, with a recent 20% increase. The Security Products segment saw a 9% year-over-year sales increase in the first quarter of 2024, indicating strong demand. Efficient cost management in the Marine Components segment and aligning inventory with market conditions reflect operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, CompX faces a challenging 2024 outlook, particularly in the Marine Components segment, due to reduced demand and OEM customers cutting production. Security Products’ sales are expected to be lower, as a significant government project from 2023 is not anticipated to recur. Also, intense competition and dependency on key customers pose additional risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CompX International here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NVIDIA Corp.

        "title": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation",
        "content": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation\n\nOn Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were below estimates. But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG’s estimate of $14.55 billion. Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle’s cloud unit is growing faster. The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion.\n\nAdjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG’s estimate of $1.65. Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share.\n\nPartnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum\n\nThe aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to extend Azure Al to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl. Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges. Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle’s cloud database growth.\n\nOutlook Shaped By The AI Hype\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, Catz expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads, adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.\n\nShifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st. Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won’t last forever.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) corner of the broad technology market has been blazing hot. The market size in the Artificial Intelligence market is projected to reach $184.0 billion in 2024 and record an annual growth rate (CAGR 2024-2030) of 28.46%, resulting in a market volume of $826.7 billion by 2030, per statista.com. In global comparison, the largest market size is dedicated to the United States ($50.16 billion in 2024).\n\nWhile pure-play AI stocks are ways to play the boom, there are several associated areas in this space that make AI investing lucrative in general. Below, we highlight a few of those.\n\nETF Areas in Focus\n\nMagnificent Seven – Roundhill Magnificent Seven ETF (MAGS)\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" refers to seven U.S. tech giants, including Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Alphabet (Google), Meta, Tesla and Nvidia. NVIDIA seems to be the most important beneficiary of AI technology as its graphics processing units are widely used in AI research. Apple, one of the laggards in the AI race, lately announced its much-awaited generative AI initiative called Apple Intelligence.\n\nThen, there are Microsoft’s OpenAI-powered Bing chatbot (Copilot) and Google’s Bard chatbot, now named Gemini. Meta has also integrated AI into its platforms through recommendation software and the Meta AI chatbot. Meta also uses AI to detect and remove harmful content on its platforms.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) provides a vast range of AI and machine learning services, while Amazon's AI-powered voice assistant is integrated into many smart home devices. Tesla’s advanced driver-assistance systems rely heavily on AI and machine learning. Plus, there is Tesla Dojo, which is a custom-built AI supercomputer designed to process vast amounts of data for self-driving applications.\n\nSemiconductor – VanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nSemiconductors play a crucial role in AI for reasons like computing power, Memory and Storage and Custom Hardware. In fact, advancements in chips enable the development of low-power devices suitable for edge AI applications. AI often relies on data from various sensors, such as cameras, microphones and accelerometers.\n\nUtilities – Utilities Select Sector SPDR ETF (XLU)\n\nThe AI industry's expansion has led to an increased need for energy sources. An IEA report said that by 2026, the AI industry is expected to consume at least 10 times the electricity demand it had in 2023, as quoted on CNBC.\n\nAn IEA report published in January highlighted that, on average, a typical Google search uses 0.3 watt-hours of electricity versus 2.9 watt-hours for a ChatGPT request. This demand is reflected in the stock market, where energy utilities have been gaining traction (read: ETFs to Make the Most of the AI-Powered Utility Sector).\n\nStory continues\n\nClean Energy – Global X Hydrogen ETF (HYDR)\n\nWhile regular fossil-fuel energy has been a source of AI’s energy requirements, demand for clean energy is also rising. In this regard, demand for Hydrogen has been surging. Hydrogen is in stark contrast to fossil fuels, which emit harmful greenhouse gases. Also, its ability to store and release energy also makes hydrogen a likely solution for grid storage, helping to balance the intermittent nature of renewable sources like wind and solar (read: Hydrogen ETFs Soared in May: Here's Why).\n\nCloud – WisdomTree Cloud Computing ETF (WCLD)\n\nCloud services have become an indispensable element in AI solutions. Firstly, cloud services provide the computational power required for AI applications. Cloud platforms like AWS, Google Cloud and Microsoft Azure offer scalable infrastructure that can handle computation tasks. Then, cloud services enable data storage and management. Moreover, cloud services ease collaboration and accessibility.\n\nCopper – United States Copper Index Fund (CPER)\n\nCopper ensures efficient power and signal transmission in AI hardware components like servers, GPUs, and data centers. Copper's high thermal conductivity makes it perfect for heat sinks and cooling solutions in AI systems. Copper is the key material in PCBs (Printed Circuit Boards) used in AI hardware. Copper is also used in the manufacturing of sensors and actuators in AI-driven robots and IoT devices.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Google CMO: There is a perception that AI is going to threaten the very nature of creativity. Here’s why I disagree",
        "content": "Lorraine Twohill is Chief Marketing Officer at Google.\n\nDuring a recent lunch conversation, a female business founder and friend turned to me and asked “Lorraine, am I being left behind?”. This sentiment captures how a lot of people are feeling about artificial intelligence right now.\n\nThere is a lot of excitement, for sure. Artificial intelligence will help solve problems, big and small, from diagnosing cancer to fighting climate change, or just by helping us be more productive.\n\nMixed with this excitement, there is also fear. Fear of not understanding the technology. Fear of making a mistake. And, like this entrepreneur, fear of missing out.\n\nIf you empathize, you’re not alone. In a recent survey, only 32% of business leaders said that their company has broadly adopted AI. We are all still figuring out how to bring the benefits of AI to our teams—and what success even looks like.\n\nIf I’ve learned anything in my 20 years at Google and 30 years in the advertising industry, it’s that we shape technology by using it. And this process isn’t linear.\n\nWith AI, we are all still testing and learning how to translate this technology into value. So now is the time when everyone can experiment and start playing around. AI tools are already available—and there’s no need for advanced training or coding knowledge to take part.\n\nBut not enough of us are doing this right now.\n\nIt starts at the top. As leaders, we’ve got to get hands-on and use AI tools at work—and in life. We need to play around with as many different use cases and solutions as possible.\n\nAI tools can now find that one email from my kids’ school with all the important dates, summarize entire work email threads, give me feedback on how our creative work will be received, or gift me with a genius line of poetry.\n\nWe also need to give our teams permission to innovate. Ideas come from everywhere and often from where you least expect it. Encourage your teams—whether they’re in operations, marketing, sales, or engineering—to try various AI tools.\n\nAt Google, we strive to cultivate a culture of curiosity, where people try, fail, and try again—regularly sharing what works and what doesn’t. Our dogfooding program is one way we encourage everyone to use early product features. In a hackathon we recently hosted, people pulled teams together from across the company and imagined entirely new ways to use AI.\n\nThere is no wrong way to experiment. Identifying a specific pain point is one way companies get started—whether it’s an e-commerce retailer using generative AI to write product descriptions at scale or a graphic design platform that makes video creation faster with AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo help inspire others, we recently published a list of how over 100 businesses use AI. We also just launched a course to help everyone from small businesses to nonprofits and governments use AI.\n\nLike many of us heading to the Cannes Lions, I have a particular interest in how AI will transform marketing. There is a perception among some that AI is going to threaten the very nature of creativity. I disagree.\n\nCreatives have long embraced major technological transformations. They use them as opportunities to try new things, often long before others, and, ultimately, ignite all our imaginations. When creativity and technology intersect, we can do extraordinary things.\n\nI'm lucky enough to work alongside some of the very best creatives in the world. Even they will tell you that a blank sheet of paper can be terrifying. So put the horror of the first terrible draft on an AI. Spare yourself. Then be brilliant.\n\nAI can also save marketers countless hours. At Google, we use AI to generate several versions of an ad in the time it would have taken to create just one in the past. And we use AI to translate ad copy and deploy campaigns across 150 countries.\n\nLike any tool, AI has limitations. That’s why humans remain essential. When we use AI to translate ad copy, a real person reviews every single piece before it goes live. AI can enhance the brilliance and judgment of our teams, not replace it. It can help us put out better work more quickly and at scale, but not without strong human judgment.\n\nSo what would I tell my business owner friend today? That this is just the starting line.\n\nThe future of AI is not set. It will be shaped by our actions today. It’s on all of us to be curious. This curiosity is what drives amazing creativity and makes all of our work great.\n\nIt’s rare that we have an opportunity to shape the future together. Today is one of these moments.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nBooz Allen Hamilton CEO: America needs a whole-of-nation approach in its great power competition with China NYC comptroller: Food delivery apps are blaming minimum pay for inflation.

        "content": "By Jody Godoy\n\n(Reuters) - Tech and competition watchdog groups have called on the U.S. Department of Justice to probe YouTube, saying the video-streaming platform could enable Google and its parent company, Alphabet, to dominate home entertainment.\n\nIn a letter to Justice Department antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter dated Tuesday, the American Economic Liberties Project, Demand Progress and nine other groups expressed concern about YouTube's growth as a competitor to cable and streaming services and its pre-installation on smartphones and TVs sold in the U.S.\n\nThe groups called on the regulator to investigate YouTube, which is among the top streaming services in the U.S. Google already dominates the internet search market and is a leader in online advertising technology.\n\n\"YouTube has a decade-long record of using its dominance across numerous markets to crowd out competitors, lock in customers, and force the purchase of bundled services,\" the groups wrote.\n\nThe growth of YouTube TV, the company's subscription streaming service, increases Google's \"prospects for living room dominance,\" the groups said.\n\n\"Anyone looking for something to watch can see this space is very competitive,\" said a YouTube spokesperson, adding that the company goes head to head with both streaming services such as Netflix and Disney+ and other video platforms like Meta's Instagram and TikTok.\n\nIn April, Alphabet reported YouTube quarterly ad revenue of more than $8 billion, up 21% from the same period last year.\n\nGoogle executive Philipp Schindler said at the time that the platform had been the most-watched U.S. streaming service for more than a year, citing data from audience analytics firm Nielsen.\n\nGoogle is already fighting two antitrust lawsuits brought by the Justice Department and several states. One claims the company monopolizes the online search market and another that it dominates the market for digital advertising technology.\n\nGoogle has fought both cases, saying its successes came by lawful means.\n\nYouTube, according to the advocacy groups, is \"the third leg of the stool that supports Google's monopoly.\"\n\nLee Hepner, a lawyer at the American Economic Liberties Project, compared the groups' concerns about YouTube to the conduct challenged in the search case, where antitrust enforcers have alleged that multibillion-dollar revenue sharing agreements with smartphone makers have allowed Google to maintain online search dominance.\n\n\"What is Google TV if not principally a distribution system for Google's own streaming service?\" Hepner said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAntitrust concerns over Big Tech have spanned administrations, with a case against Google and one against Facebook parent Meta Platforms filed under President Donald Trump's administration.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's antitrust enforcers have followed with a second case against Google and cases against Amazon.com and Apple.\n\n(Reporting by Jody Godoy in New York; Editing by Matthew Lewis)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Well, it's official: Another company has surpassed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap. Last week, Nvidia became the second-largest U.S. company, trailing only Microsoft.\n\nIt was another blow to Apple, whose revenue remains stuck in neutral. And it's facing a federal antitrust lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, given Apple's struggles and the impressive growth of some of its fellow tech megacaps, several more companies will likely surpass Apple's market value over the next decade. I expect Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will be among them.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, trailing Apple by \"only\" $900 billion.\n\nAt first blush, that gap might seem insurmountable, but for a megacap, it's entirely feasible. Nvidia, for instance, closed a recent gap of $1.8 trillion with Apple in less than six months.\n\nAnd Alphabet is up by about 26% year to date, while Apple is up just 6%. That means the former has shrunk the lead of the latter by about $275 billion so far this year. If that trend continues, Alphabet will surpass Apple in size within a couple of years.\n\nThat might turn out to be too much to expect, but over the long term, I do think Alphabet will catch up. First and foremost, Apple is a hardware company. It designs and sells computers, tablets, watches, and smartphones. Alphabet, on the other hand, is a software company. Its signature business is internet search through Google. It makes most of its money by selling digital ads. Crucially, digital advertising is cheap and easy to scale; mass production of physical electronics is not.\n\nWhat's more, Apple has put its signature product, the iPhone, into the hands of almost every human being who might want one. With an estimated 1.4 billion iPhones in use today, there's little room for it to grow its share of that key market.\n\nConversely, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% in the first quarter. The company relies on digital ad revenue (from its Google search business and YouTube), subscription revenue (YouTube, Google Fiber), and data center revenue from its Google Cloud segment. Those diversified revenue streams will help keep its growth humming along well into the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nE-commerce and cloud services leader Amazon has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, which trails Apple by about $1.2 trillion.\n\nBut like Alphabet, Amazon has narrowed the gap this year. Amazon shares have rallied by 22% year to date, with the company's market cap increasing by about $300 billion, while Apple has gained around $150 billion. If Amazon keeps closing the gap at that rate, it could catch Apple in around four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn't out of the question. Amazon's annual revenue is almost $600 billion -- roughly the same size as Sweden's entire economy in 2022. Moreover, the company is growing sales by 13% year over year, with its expansive e-commerce business and its industry-leading cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nMoreover, the pace and size of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could further accelerate that growth. AWS is a key driver for Amazon's profits, and that segment is in position to capitalize on this revolution. AI-powered apps require enormous computing power, the sort that can only be provided by high-performance data centers, many of which are run by AWS.\n\nAmazon is a tech juggernaut that is likely to continue growing -- and growing faster than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amdocs Limited DOX, a prominent provider of software and services for communications and media companies, has recently collaborated with Alphabet Inc.’s GOOGL Google Cloud to advance Embedded Subscriber Identity Module (eSIM) technology. This partnership is aimed at providing an end-to-end eSIM onboarding solution, significantly enhancing the adoption and usability of eSIMs for communication service providers (CSPs) globally.\n\nEnhances eSIM Onboarding\n\nThe core of this collaboration is the integration of Amdocs' eSIM Cloud platform with Google Cloud's Telecom Subscriber Insights. Amdocs' eSIM Cloud platform, recognized as the leading eSIM orchestration platform by Counterpoint Research, will now benefit from the advanced analytical capabilities of Alphabet’s Google Cloud. This integration promises a seamless and simplified customer experience, facilitating easier and quicker activation of eSIM-equipped devices.\n\nBy leveraging the strengths of both Amdocs and Google Cloud, CSPs can now offer eSIM services on a global scale. This comprehensive solution will be marketed and operated by Amdocs, incorporating Google Cloud's Telecom Subscriber Insights to enhance functionality. The digital-only approach streamlines the activation process, eliminating the need for physical SIM cards and visits to retail stores. This not only reduces operational costs but also minimizes customer support calls, offering a significant improvement in customer experience.\n\nThe new eSIM solution is designed to integrate effortlessly with the existing systems of CSPs. The fully automated activation process reduces the time and effort required for customers to connect their devices. Remote provisioning enables customers to activate their mobile devices without the need to visit a store, while real-time monitoring ensures the process is managed efficiently. This seamless integration is crucial for CSPs, aiming to offer quick and reliable services to their customers.\n\nAmdocs Limited Price and Consensus\n\nAmdocs Limited price-consensus-chart | Amdocs Limited Quote\n\nStrengthening Portfolio\n\nAmdocs' automation portfolio, fortified by strategic acquisitions and in-house developments, has solidified the company’s position as a trusted vendor for numerous CSPs. DOX is benefiting from its three-fold artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. The first strategy involves the integration of AI into its Customer Experience Solutions platform.\n\nSecond, it is leveraging generative AI and its telecommunication expertise to address the challenges prevailing in the industry. Lastly, it is collaborating with the industry leaders in the AI field to expand its reach. Moreover, the company believes that investment in generative AI-enabled solutions should provide it with more opportunities for margin expansion in the long run.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, Amdocs has partnered with major cloud service providers like Amazon’s AMZN Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) and Microsoft’s MSFT Microsoft Azure. These alliances are designed to enhance Amdocs' cloud offerings, streamline operations and improve service delivery for its clients.\n\nAmdocs' collaboration with Amazon’s AWS focuses on leveraging the latter’s robust cloud infrastructure to deliver scalable and secure solutions. By utilizing AWS' extensive global network, DOX can ensure high availability and performance for its clients' critical operations.\n\nThe partnership with Microsoft Azure allows Amdocs to integrate its software solutions with Azure's comprehensive cloud services. The collaboration is aimed at accelerating digital transformation, enabling CSPs to deploy innovative services quickly and efficiently while benefiting from Azure's enterprise-grade security and compliance standards.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmdocs' year-to-date (YTD) share price performance has been marked by significant volatility, reflecting broader market fluctuations and company-specific developments. The stock has lost 12.9% YTD against the Zacks Computers – IT Services industry’s growth of 4.6%.\n\nAmdocs is currently grappling with slower sales growth challenges as enterprises are postponing their large IT spending plans due to a weakening global economy amid ongoing macroeconomic and geopolitical issues.\n\nDOX had previously pointed out that current macroeconomic uncertainty has begun to weigh on customers’ spending decisions, which is presenting some headwinds to its revenue growth. The consolidation trend in the U.S. telecom industry is also hampering its financial performance.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1.26 billion for third-quarter fiscal 2024 revenues indicates a mere 1.6% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for third-quarter non-GAAP earnings has been revised downward by 3 cents to $1.61 per share over the past 30 days and suggests a 2.6% increase.\n\nConsidering the ongoing challenges faced by Amdocs, it is wise to wait to invest in the stock until we see some clarity on its growth prospects.

        "content": "Participants\n\nKen Bond; Senior Vice President, Investor Relations; Oracle Corp\n\nSafra Catz; Chief Executive Officer; Oracle Corp\n\nLawrence Ellison; Chairman of the Board and Chief Technology Officer; Oracle Corp\n\nRaimo Lenschow; Analyst; Barclays\n\nBrad Zelnick; Analyst; Deutsche Bank\n\nSiti Panigrahi; Analyst; Mizuho Securities\n\nAlex Zukin; Analyst; Wolfe Research\n\nKirk Materne; Analyst; Evercore ISI\n\nJohn DiFucci; Analyst; Guggenheim Securities LLC\n\nPresentation\n\nOperator\n\nGood day, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth-quarter 2024 earnings call. Today's call is being recorded. And now, I would like to turn the conference over to Ken Bond. Please go ahead.\n\nKen Bond\n\nThank you, Krista. Good afternoon, everyone, and welcome to Oracle's fourth-quarter and fiscal year 2024 earnings conference call. A copy of the press release and financial tables, which includes a GAAP to non-GAAP reconciliation and other supplemental financial information, can be viewed and downloaded from our Investor Relations website.\r\n Additionally, a list of many customers who purchased Oracle Cloud services or went live on Oracle Cloud recently will be available from the Investor Relations website.\r\n On the call today are Chairman and Chief Technology Officer, Larry Ellison; and Chief Executive Officer, Safra Catz. As a reminder, today's discussion will include forward-looking statements, including predictions, expectations, estimates, or other information that might be considered forward-looking.\r\n Throughout today's discussion, we will present some important factors relating to our business, which may potentially affect these forward-looking statements. These forward-looking statements are also subject to risks and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from statements being made today.\r\n As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements, and we encourage you to review our most recent reports, including our 10-K and 10-Q and any applicable amendments for a complete discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.\r\n And finally, we are not obligating ourselves to revise our results or these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events.\r\n Before taking questions, we'll begin with a few prepared remarks. And with that, I'd like to turn the call over to Safra.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nThanks, Ken, and good afternoon, everyone. Clearly, we had an absolutely incredible quarter. As you know, Oracle's Q4 is known for customers purchasing large software license contracts to power their businesses. But because the pivot to the cloud, this Q4 was power powered by the enormous demand for our cloud services. And they showed up in RPO or remaining performance obligations.\r\n In Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history, led by huge demand for training large language models as well as record levels of sales for OCI, Autonomous, Fusion, and NetSuite. RPO was $98 billion, up $18 billion from Q3 and up 44% year over year from $68 billion last year. And we are trading one-time, non-recurring license revenue in return for much bigger strategic customer commitments from multi-year cloud revenue, from which we expect to further accelerate our revenue growth rate.\r\n This is exactly really what we've been targeting. And it bolsters my confidence that our overall revenue, earnings, and cash flow performance, as well as our growth rates, will only get stronger and accelerate. In short, this Q4 marks the full emergence of our high-growth cloud businesses.\r\n Now I started talking about this tipping point four years ago, and you've seen it continue to play out in our results since then. As a reminder, we accelerated our US dollar revenue growth rate from negative 1% in fiscal year '20 to plus 8% this past year if you exclude Cerner.\r\n In addition, EPS has grown at a 10% compounded annual growth rate over that same period and both operating cash flow and free cash flow, which of course we report on a trailing 12-month basis, were each declining 10% four years ago. This year, they grew 9% and 39%, respectively.\r\n Now, customer conversations are now absolutely only focused on our cloud services as the results clearly show. So let me give you just a couple of -- a few examples. First, as you saw, OpenAI selected Oracle to run deep learning and AI workloads on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure. Like many others, OpenAI chose OCI because it is the world's fastest and most cost-effective AI infrastructure. In total, we signed over 30 AI contracts for over $12 billion this quarter and nearly $17 billion this year.\r\n Second, we continue to expand our work, helping companies use our Cloud Applications portfolio to reinvent their businesses. As an example, a very large enterprise tech company signed a contract in Q4 for over $600 million where we will be helping them transform their operations with Fusion to enable them to become more agile, faster-growing, and more profitable.\r\n May I say, in the process, we will replace out many of our competitors' product, these cross-pillar cloud deals or suite deals focused on business process reengineering that incorporate multiple-cloud applications that no one else can offer.\r\n And I would point out, by the way, that today is day 11 of our new fiscal year and we are once again announcing our results not only for the quarter, but the year, and giving guidance, making us faster than any other public company by a long shot. We are able to do this because of Fusion applications, and that is why companies are choosing Fusion and our wonderful teams are showing them the way.\r\n And third, I'm pleased to announce we signed another multi-cloud partnership this time with Google. OCI and Google Cloud Network Interconnect is available immediately in 10 regions, and we will be live with Oracle Database at Google Cloud in September where customers can get direct access to Oracle Database services running on OCI deployed in Google Cloud data centers.\r\n So what's driving this? Well, it is all about our comprehensive, highly differentiated, and secure cloud offerings. Customers have progressed from their initial curiosity about Oracle Cloud into full-blown rollouts. We have the most secure, complete, and cost effective set of enterprise applications and infrastructure cloud technologies of any vendor.\r\n Not only are our cloud technologies vertically integrated to work together, but we offer flexible deployment models like public cloud, multi-cloud, sovereign cloud, dedicated cloud, or any other way our customers ask us to deliver.\r\n And we also offer Oracle Alloy where Oracle partners become cloud providers, offering customized cloud services alongside the Oracle Cloud.\r\n Now, I'm now going to dive into the details of Q4 and finish my prepared remarks with how this strength and momentum will impact fiscal year '25 and beyond. Okay. So let's start.\r\n In Q4, the dollar strengthened from the time of my Q4 guidance. So we saw a 1% currency headwind to total revenue and a $0.01 currency headwind to EPS. As usual, I'll be discussing our financials using constant currency growth rate because this is how we manage the business.\r\n Total cloud revenue, that is SaaS plus IaaS, excluding Cerner, was $4.7 billion, up 23%; including Cerner, total cloud revenue was up 20% at $5.3 billion; and SaaS revenue of $3.3 billion, up 10%; and IaaS revenue of $2 billion, up 42% on top of last year's 77% growth.\r\n Total cloud services and license support for the quarter was $10.2 billion, up 10%, driven again by our strategic cloud applications, Autonomous database, and OCI. Applications subscription revenues, which includes product support, were $4.6 billion and up 6%.\r\n Our strategic back office SaaS applications now have annualized revenue of $7.7 billion and were up 16%. Infrastructure subscription revenues, which includes license support, were $5.6 billion, up 13%. Infrastructure cloud services revenue was up 42%.\r\n Excluding legacy hosting, OCI Gen 2 Infrastructure cloud services grew 44% with an annualized revenue of [$7.4 billion]. OCI consumption revenue was up 63%. Were it not for continuing supply constraints, consumption growth would have been even higher. Database subscriptions, which includes Database license support, were up 6%, highlighted by cloud database services, which were up 26% and now have an annualized revenue of $2 billion.\r\n Very importantly as on-premise databases migrate to the cloud, either to OCI directly or using database at Azure or database at Google Cloud, we expect these cloud database services will be that third leg of revenue growth alongside OCI and strategic step. Consistent with our strategic direction and reflecting customer preference for cloud services, software license revenues were down 14% to $1.8 billion. So all in, total revenues for the quarter were $14.3 billion. That's up 4% if you include Cerner, up 5% excluding Cerner.\r\n Shifting to margins. The gross margin for cloud services and license support was 77%. This is a result of the mix between support and cloud, in which cloud is growing much faster than support. The gross margin percentages for software support and SaaS are consistent with last year.\r\n While IaaS gross margins improved substantially, gross margins will go higher as more of our cloud regions fill up. We monitor our expenses carefully to ensure gross margin percentages expand as we scale. To that point, though, the gross profit dollars of cloud services and license support grew 8% in Q4.\r\n Non-GAAP operating income was $6.7 billion, up 9% from last year. The operating margin was 47%, up from 44% last year as we continue to drive more efficiencies in our business. Looking forward, as we continue to benefit from economies of scale in the cloud, we will not only continue to grow operating income, but we will also expand and the operating margin percentages.\r\n The non-GAAP tax rate came out over a 1% higher than my guidance at 20.1%, and non-GAAP EPS was USD1.63, and GAAP EPS was USD1.11. As a reminder, the non-GAAP tax rate last year was 9.2% and this had an adverse effect on this quarter's EPS growth.\r\n Non-GAAP pre-tax income grew 14% in constant currency. So you can figure out that had we have the same tax rate last year as this year, net income would have grown 14% and EPS would have been up 12% in CD, 11% in USD.\r\n For the full fiscal year, total company revenue was $53 billion, up 6%. Total cloud services and license support revenue, which is entirely subscription base and accounts for nearly three-quarters of total revenue was $39.4 billion, up 11%.\r\n Total Application subscription revenue grew 9% and Infrastructure subscription revenue grew 13%. Total cloud services, excluding Cerner were up 26% to $17.1 billion -- $17.2 billion. SaaS revenue, excluding Cerner, was up 13% to $10 billion -- $10.4 billion for the year.\r\n IaaS and Cloud Infrastructure revenue was up 60% to $6.8 billion for the year, with consumption revenue up 66% from last year. Non-GAAP EPS for the full year was USD5.56, up 9% in USD. And the full-year operating margin percentage was 44%, up from 42% last year.\r\n At quarter-end, we had nearly $10.7 billion in cash and marketable securities. The short-term deferred revenue balance was $9.3 billion, up 4%. Over the last four quarters, operating cash flow was $18.7 billion, up 9% and free cash flow was $11.8 billion, up 39%.\r\n Capital expenditures were $6.9 billion. As I mentioned, our remaining performance obligations or RPO is now $98 billion, up 44% in constant currency. And the portion excluding Cerner, if you're curious, was up 60%.\r\n We signed several large deals in this quarter and we have many more -- many, many more in the pipeline. Approximately 39% of total RPO is expected to be recognized as revenue over the next 12 months. And this reflects the growing trend of customers wanting larger contracts as they see firsthand how Oracle Cloud services plan are benefitting their businesses. Now, while we spent $3.5 billion on CapEx this quarter, the $2.8 billion shown in the cash flow statement is lower simply as a result of timing of payments.\r\n We are working as quickly as we can to get cloud capacity built out given the enormity of our backlog and pipeline. At this moment, we have 76 customer-facing cloud regions live with 47 public cloud regions around the world, and another 19 being built. We have 11 database at Azure sites live and more locations with Microsoft coming online soon.\r\n We will have 12 Oracle Database at Google Cloud sites live this year. We also have 13 dedicated regions live and 15 more planned. We have several national security regions and EU sovereign regions live with increasing demand for more of each.\r\n And finally, we already have two Alloy cloud regions live with 11 more planned. Of course, we also have many, many, many cloud customer installations as I mentioned earlier, the sizing and flexibility and -- the size and flexibility and deployment optionality of our cloud regions continues to be incredible -- incredibly advantageous for us in the marketplace.\r\n This quarter, we purchased 1.25 million shares for a total of $150 million. In addition, we paid out dividends of $4.4 billion over the last 12 months, and the Board of Directors today declared a dividend of $0.40 per share.\r\n Before I discuss my guidance for Q1 and fiscal 2025, I do just want you to have a couple of notes. The first is that in Q4, we decided to exit the advertising business, which had declined to about $300 million in revenue in fiscal year '24. Also, I will no longer be breaking out the Cerner business in my results. And even though it will begin to grow modestly throughout the year in both revenue and operating margin, it's not necessary to break it out anymore and -- because it is now operating in a growth mode.\r\n Now to guidance. Throughout fiscal year 2025, I expect continued strong cloud demand to push Oracle sales and RPO even higher and result in double-digit revenue growth this fiscal year. I also expect that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous quarter as OCI capacity increases to meet demand.\r\n We believe our momentum, our current momentum will continue as our pipeline is growing even faster than bookings and our win rates are going higher as well. I expect fiscal year '25 Cloud Infrastructure services to grow faster than the 50% we reported this year. CapEx In fiscal year '25 will probably be double what it is in fiscal year '24 -- what it was in fiscal year '24.\r\n Okay. Beyond this fiscal year, I remain firmly committed to our fiscal year '26 financial goals for revenue, operating margins, and EPS growth. However, given our strong bookings results, I believe some of these goals might prove to be too conservative given our momentum. We are going to provide you a more fulsome update on all of this at the Financial Analyst Meeting at Oracle Cloud World in Las Vegas in September.\r\n Okay. Let me now turn to my guidance for Q1, which I'll review on a non-GAAP basis. Now if currency exchange rates remain the same as they are now, currency should have a negative 1% effect on my revenue and either $0.01 or $0.02 negative on EPS in Q1. However, as you all know, actual currency impact may be more or less; I just can't get that now.\r\n Total revenue for Q1 are expected to grow from 6% to 8% in constant currency and using the currency situation as it is now, they're expected to grow from 5% to 7% in USD. Total cloud revenue is expected to grow from 21% to 23% in constant currency and 20% to 22% in USD. Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 11% to 15% and be between $1.33 and $1.37 in constant currency.\r\n Non-GAAP EPS is expected to grow between 10% to 14% and be between USD1.31 and USD1.35, but this time in USD. My EPS guidance for Q1 assumes a base tax rate of 20%. And as always, one-time tax events could cause the actual tax rates to vary from my guidance.\r\n Okay. I know that was long. But with that, let me turn it to Larry for his comments.\n\nStory continues\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nThank you, Safra. I'm going to start by repeating something Safra said. In Q4, Oracle's company-wide RPO increased 44% to $98 billion. In AI alone, we signed contracts with 30 different customers for $12.5 billion in new AI business. These astonishing RPO numbers 44% and $98 billion were driven by massive increases in sales of Oracle Cloud Infrastructure, OCI.\r\n So who are the companies choosing to use Oracle Cloud Services and Oracle data centers? Well, here are a few names: NVIDIA, Microsoft, Google, xAI, OpenAI, Cohere, and dozens more. In other words, the world's largest cloud companies and the world's most successful and accomplished AI companies choose to use Oracle Cloud services and data centers.\r\n So why are they working with Oracle? Because Oracle's Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure is different. OCI's (inaudible) main network moves data much faster. And when you charge by the minute, faster also means less expensive. OCI trains large language models several times faster and at a fraction of the cost of other clouds.\r\n OCI's critical cloud software, the operating system and the database are fully autonomous. At OCI, human beings do not run the operating system or the database. Autonomous software robots do. No one else has this level of autonomy in the cloud. Eliminating human labor eliminates human error. Almost all cloud security breaches begin with human error, eliminating the possibility of human error is the only way to make certain your cloud data is not stolen.\r\n That's it. The most important technology companies in the world are using OCI because it's faster, less expensive, and more secure. Easy to say, not easy to do. Back to you, Ken.\n\nKen Bond\n\nThank you, Larry. Krista, if you could please poll the audience for questions. We'll begin the Q&A portion of the call.\n\nQuestion and Answer Session\n\nOperator\n\nRaimo Lenschow, Barclays.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nPerfect. Thank you. Congrats from me. These are very impressive numbers. Safra, can you try to help us bridge the strong RPO number and how we need to think about feeding that into revenue? Is that just the capacity function? Or is there anything on the customer side that you need to deliver or the technology side you need to deliver? Just help us to bridge the gap on those. Thank you.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nIt's all about capacity. It is -- as we bring the capacity online, wherever it's going online around the world is when those workloads are coming over. A lot of the engineering work is done in advance so that those customers know how they can operate.\r\n They bring smaller workloads, but the bigger workloads, they're just waiting for us to go online and make it available to them. It is really that level. We are scheduling them on our availability. And, as I mentioned, our pipeline to take more deals is all about us just getting the capacity up and live and moving forward.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nSo it's just a mechanical problem in a way.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nYeah. Well, it's not a problem. It's just the schedule. As things come online, as the data centers go live, or as we deliver the computers, they're just getting -- it's just very straightforward. There's no magic here. These customers have done a lot of the analysis and the engineering in advance and have tested us or competed us against our competitors and have chosen us very -- already understanding how we work, and they're just waiting for us to give them more capacity.\n\nRaimo Lenschow\n\nGood. Very good. Thank you.\n\nOperator\n\nBrad Zelnick, Deutsche Bank.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nGreat. Thank you very much and congrats from me as well. Larry, it's great to see the amazing momentum in OCI, especially given it's a competitive market and the leading names in AI are coming to you, wanting to partner with Oracle. Can you talk about the innovation road map for OCI and your AI services in particular? And why we should expect Oracle to keep on winning not just today, but over the next several years to come in this market?\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nOkay. Well, I think in OCI, we've talked for a while about our ability to build very small data centers, one you could put in a shipper, a submarine, or a full cloud, a full Oracle Cloud, we will soon have in six standard half racks to go into a conventional data center.\r\n So virtually any one of our customers could choose to have the full Oracle Cloud in their data center with every service, every service in the cloud. And they could scale that up quite extraordinarily large. So we talk about the fact that we can start very small and that's a huge difference between us and our competitors. So we can actually put it again customer by customer, small countries, we can do.\r\n What we haven't talked so much about is we're also building the largest data centers in the world. We talked about -- I think we talked briefly about one last call, where we can park -- it's a 70-megawatt data center where we can park eight 747s nose to tail in the data center. It's a huge AI training data center.\r\n Well, we're also building a 200-megawatt data center. In fact, this past quarter, we sold about half of that data center for the -- for a period of time. So we're now bringing 200-megawatt data centers online. So we are literally building the smallest, most portable, most affordable cloud data centers all the way up to 200-megawatt data centers ideal for training very large language models and keeping them up to date.\r\n This AI race is going to go on for a long time. It's not a matter of getting ahead, just simply getting ahead in AI, but you also have to keep your model current. And that's going to take larger and larger data centers. And some of the data centers we have -- that we're planning are actually even bigger. There -- some are getting very close to our there, say, 1 gigawatt, which is a pretty good-sized city or one enormous AI cloud training data center.\r\n No one else can span this range. And in every case, we have unbelievably fast networks that are part of this. The data centers we're building include the power plants and the transmission of the power directly into the data center and liquid cooling. And because these modern data centers are moving from air cooled to liquid cooled, and you have to engineer them from scratch.\r\n And that's what we've been doing for some time. And that's what we'll continue to do. And currently, we are leading the pack and being able to deliver that quality and that scale of data center.\n\nBrad Zelnick\n\nAmazing. Thank you so much, Larry.\n\nOperator\n\nSiti Panigrahi, Mizuho.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nThank you. Larry and Safra, it's impressive to see how fast you ramped OCI as you're now available in 11 data centers. And then now with this Google partners, we'll have Oracle Database at Google Cloud. So I have two questions: one is, as you embark on offering this multi-cloud flexibility to customer, when can we see a similar partnership with AWS? And second is, how should we think about these partners is helping your customers migrate their on-prem Oracle workloads to cloud?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nI don't know, Larry, you wanted (multiple speakers)\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nNo. I could start. Well, we believe in giving customers choice. And customers want choice. Customers are using multiple clouds, not only infrastructure cloud, but they might have Salesforce applications or Workday applications. They use multiple cloud in their business right now.\r\n So it's very important, we think, that these -- that all the clouds become interconnected. So we're thrilled to have the connection with Microsoft and be building OCI data centers inside of it -- right inside of Azure. So the computers are next to each other to minimize network costs and network latency, which is all good things.\r\n We're doing the same thing with Google. We would love to do the same thing with AWS. We think we should be interconnected to everybody. And that's what we're attempting to do in our multi-cloud strategy. I think that's what customers want. So I'm optimistic that's the way the world will settle out.\r\n We'll get rid of these fees for moving data from cloud to cloud and all the clouds will be interconnected, and customers can pick their favorite service from their favorite cloud and mix and match whatever they want to use and do it easily and seamlessly.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nYeah.\n\nSiti Panigrahi\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nAlex Zukin, Wolfe Research.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nHey, guys. Thanks for taking the question. I wanted to dive a bit deeper on just precisely how many deployment models you guys are offering for OCI because it feels as though that is getting particularly differentiated as we start to think of sovereign cloud, GovCloud, more private cloud, given the conservative posture for AI and data privacy.\r\n So how do we think about how much of an advantage that is providing in sales cycles? And maybe in that massive $30 billion-plus in the second half RPO, but also just comment on the magnitude of that opportunity going forward.\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nI'm going to take a swing at this one. We can -- every medium-sized on-premise customer that Oracle has could have a private -- full Oracle Cloud where they have no neighbors. They are the only user of that Oracle Cloud, and we can install that in their existing data centers. Nobody else can do that. You have to move to the public cloud.\r\n Now we have public cloud, we have a lot of public cloud regions. We love the public cloud. But if you're very conservative and you want to absolutely maximize security and that's important to you, we can put in a cloud, a full Oracle Cloud, and we run it. We pay for the -- again, it's an Oracle region. We put in Oracle Cloud region and let me just make up a name.\r\n Samsung, we could build a cloud region for Samsung. In fact, two cloud regions is for Samsung. We could do two cloud regions making up names, General Motors, Ford, anybody, any company. Those are pretty big companies, but much smaller companies as well.\r\n So we're the only ones that give you an option to have the full capability of a public cloud run by Oracle, all of our services, every single one of our services. You don't pay for the hardware, you just pay for what you use, put that model directly on your premises, and you can use it, and no one else is in that cloud.\r\n We can do that. No one else can do it. We can put them on ships and on submarines, no one else can do it because we can start very, very small. All Oracle Clouds are identical, except for scale. All Oracle Clouds have all Oracle services. All Oracle Clouds are fully automated because they're identical. They're fully automated.\r\n So one of the reasons we took a little bit longer to get our cloud out was because we built something quite different than what our competitors have. And that allows us to go from very small to very large, using the same automation software. I think some of our competitors, they're large data centers, some are quite different than other data centers.\r\n They might have different -- some services might be available on some data centers and not in others. They're not -- they did a very different approach to what we did. We had the advantage of seeing what all the other guys did and we took a different road. It took us a bit longer, but we think we're better off in terms of security.\r\n We're better off in terms of scalability. By the way, that means the ability to go down in size and up in size. It allows us to get to every corner of the globe and provide a level of privacy for your data that other cloud providers cannot provide.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nYeah. And because, as Larry said, because whatever the deployment model is, you don't have to compromise. Some of our competitors may offer some level of sovereignty or some level of disconnected, but they don't actually have all the services. For us, and the reason we've been so successful is whether it's disconnected or sovereign or whatever it is, the customer always gets everything all services, not just some services.\r\n And they get to deploy it any way they want, and they get the security or the regulatory requirements. Sovereignty may be very critical. And for most governments, they don't want their data in the public cloud out and about. They want to have it sovereign to their country. And so no compromises, no compromises on the services and no compromises on security.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nIt also sounds like you guys have a better price in most cases.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nOh, much.\n\nAlex Zukin\n\nSo thanks, again, and congrats on a good quarter.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nMuch. Because we're so much faster, when you use our cloud, it is new. It's modern, but it also has technical advantages and so it runs your workload so much more quickly. And when you pay by the minute, the second, the hour, if your workload ends in 1/10 time, you pay a 1/10th the price. That's very hard to compete with.\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nOne last comment -- maybe one last comment. The other thing is our cloud was designed not for hundreds of regions, but for thousands or possibly even tens of thousands of data centers and regions. That's the -- that's why we had to put in a high degree of automation. There is no way we could run these data centers manually.\r\n There are too many of them, and we're building them to do fast. We couldn't hire people fast enough and train people fast enough. And the risk of them making a mistake, an error is the risk -- well, they start exposing our customers' data. So they are highly automated. It's a little bit like I apply to myself, and comparing it to the satellites that Elon Musk puts in the sky.\r\n StarLink has -- they're more -- he has more satellites than everyone else in the world combined because, again, it's a very different -- it's a satellite system, Starlink, that's designed for a very large number of satellites that are highly automated. And same model lots and lots of them, 100% or nearly 100% automation to run these clouds.\n\nOperator\n\nKirk Materne, Evercore ISI.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nYes. Thanks very much and I'll echo the congrats on the cloud momentum. Larry, Safra, I was wondering if you could just expand a bit on the OpenAI announcement this afternoon. Just what that entails in terms of how you'll be working with them or Microsoft? Are there certain workloads they'll be working on with you directly? Can you just give us whatever additional color you can on that deal? Obviously, very excited. Thanks.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nWell. Go ahead. No, you can. Go ahead.\n\nLawrence Ellison\n\nOkay. All right. Well, we're building a very, very large data center, very big -- about half of a huge data center. We're building for them, lots of NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA chips, the new NVIDIA interconnect, liquid cooled, and they're primarily for training. I mean node inference things. It's we're doing masses and masses of training.\r\n And I don't know, that's what we're doing and the training goes beyond languages because now these systems are -- even the call -- even though they're called large language models, they really -- part -- the proper name is probably neural networks, they're neural networks, and they're trained not just with language, but masses of images as well.\r\n For example, Oracle is very involved with taking biopsy slides and using microscopes to read biopsy slides, recording those images, and then using AI to diagnose cancer from these biopsies. It's one of the projects we're working on the medical side of our business. And these large language models, strangely enough, are also looking at biopsies.\r\n They're not just reading things, language. They're also looking at images and interpreting images. So that is actually a bigger and more complicated problem than understanding language. That's what's so exciting about -- again, second time I mentioned Elon and an Elon company. Tesla is very close to getting full service driving authorized in China.\r\n I'm not speaking at it. It's cool. I think the Chinese government is moving along the full self-driving -- full self-driving in China. In order to train a car to do full self-driving, you train it on vast amounts of images because the car has to look at these images and then decide what it's going to do next.\r\n That's what it does. It doesn't speak, it responds to what it sees. That's a very different problem than answering a question posed in any language. So everyone is going to be training their models on imaging. That's a huge amount of additional data. It's a huge amount of additional training and we're right in the middle of it.\n\nKirk Materne\n\nThank you.\n\nOperator\n\nJohn DiFucci, Guggenheim Securities.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nThank you for taking my question. My question, I think, is for Safra. Safra, the IaaS revenue growth has been really impressive, and it has been for a while here, but perhaps even more so the last couple of quarters, especially is the backlog given its scale. And this may be somewhat of an obvious question for you, but it's based on my conversation with investors.\r\n There's two high-profile topics that I want to make sure we understand what the contribution has been today versus next year. And that's Oracle database at Azure and AI in general. We've heard a lot of conversation about the former when we speak to partners and customers in the field.\r\n And you've spoken a lot about the latter today. So beyond conversation volume, can you talk a little bit more about what the contribution of these two topics has been to that impressive IaaS revenue growth in this quarter versus what we should expect that contribution to be in fiscal '25?\n\nSafra Catz\n\nOkay. I would tell you that both of them, both -- whether it's database at Azure or even the AI workloads as they come on board, they are all incremental to anything you saw so far in our revenues, okay? The database at Azure, those centers are just going live now. So even though we are selling quite a bit of ARR there, these are small and growing very, very fast.\r\n So the revenue in Q4 of, let's say, Azure was very small. Q1 will be 10 times as much. Q2 will be potentially 30 times as much. So it is extremely incremental to our current run rate. By the way, that is also true to -- we've already -- we have revenue -- AI revenue so far. Yes, we do, and we've been announcing those.\r\n These contracts that we are signing -- that we've signed at the end of Q3 and that are signed at the end of Q4 are so much larger in size that they will be incremental to everything you saw this past year, literally, incremental added by quite a bit. So it is going to be -- this is a very exciting time, obviously. And everything is incremental to what you've seen so far because it dwarfs it in many ways.\n\nJohn DiFucci\n\nThat is really clear, and it really speaks to, I think, what you started talking about a long time ago, especially a lot more publicly, geez, I don't know, the fall of '22, but thanks. That's really clear.\n\nSafra Catz\n\nThank you.\n\nKen Bond\n\nThank you, John. A telephonic replay of this conference call will be available for 24 hours on the Investor Relations website. Thank you for joining us today. And with that, I'll turn the call back to Krista for closing.\n\nOperator\n\nLadies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's conference call. Thank you for your participation and you may now disconnect.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor's European Subsidiary To Hire 2K Employees In Semiconductor Push\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) plans to hire nearly 2,000 employees from Germany and other European countries through its subsidiary, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (ESMC), according to ESMC president Christian Koitzsch, the Taipei Times reports.\n\nIn 2024, the tech sector surpassed 2023’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs. This follows nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), announced significant layoffs.\n\nThe rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.\n\nIn August 2023, TSMC announced a joint venture with Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies AG, and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) to establish ESMC, with TSMC holding a 70% stake.\n\nThe joint venture plans to begin construction of a 12-inch wafer fab in Dresden in the second half of 2024, aiming for mass production by the end of 2027. The facility will use TSMC’s 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, and 28nm processes to produce automotive electronics and specialty industrial devices.\n\nKoitzsch, who previously held roles at Bosch, will lead ESMC and oversee the training of employees in Taiwan.\n\nThe clean room will span about 45,000 square meters, and the plant will implement green technologies to reduce water and power consumption.\n\nThe key Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier outperformed its Chinese counterpart, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, forcing Chinese AI chip firms to downgrade designs to fulfill the U.S. embargo.\n\nTSMC clocked a 30% sales growth, reaching $7.1 billion in May.\n\nTSMC led with a 62% market share in the first quarter.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock gained 55% in the last 12 months.

        "content": "By Akash Sriram\n\n(Reuters) -Oracle shares jumped 9% on Wednesday as investors cheered a boom in demand for the company's relatively low-cost cloud infrastructure services from artificial intelligence applications.\n\nIf the gains hold, the company will add about $30 billion to its market valuation of $340 billion as of Tuesday market close. The shares have so far this year gained 18%.\n\nOracle has been ramping up its cloud infrastructure unit, which is expected to drive growth by renting out cloud computing and storage to companies, but will face competition from Alphabet's Google, Microsoft and Amazon.com.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOracle's cloud infrastructure, pitched as a less-expensive option to its rivals, has attracted business from venture capital-funded generative AI startups, including Elon Musk's xAI.\n\nOracle said on Tuesday it had tied-up with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI and Google Cloud to extend its own cloud infrastructure to customers.\n\n\"The announcement that OpenAI will now be using OCI (Oracle Cloud Infrastructure) only adds to Oracle's credibility as an AI platform and the new relationship with Google also broadens the company's distribution for its database,\" Evercore analyst Kirk Materne wrote in a note.\n\nThe partnership enables OpenAI to use Microsoft's Azure platform on Oracle's infrastructure for some use-cases, while its new language learning models are being trained on a supercomputer built with Microsoft, the ChatGPT-maker said.\n\nOracle's stock was trading 19.59 times to its forward earnings estimates, lower than that of Amazon.com's 36.35, Microsoft's 32.60 and Alphabet's 21.85.\n\nThe company's fourth-quarter results missed estimates on Tuesday, as its legacy database and enterprise resource planning software business faces competition from less-expensive options, as more small- and medium-sized businesses digitize their operations.\n\n\"We suspect there is ample churn off of Oracle software to competing database and ERP software firms due to the eroding switching cost argument amid massive digital transformations,\" Morningstar analyst Julie Sharma said.\n\n(Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru; Editing by Mohammed Safi Shamsi)",

(Pictorial Press, Pictorial Press Ltd)\n\nOracle (ORCL)\n\nShares in Oracle were up by over 8% in pre-market trading as the software company announced cloud deals with Google (GOOG) and OpenAi.\n\n\"In Q4 alone, Oracle signed over 30 AI sales contracts totalling more than $12.5bn (£9.8bn), including one with OpenAi to train ChatGPT in Oracle Cloud,\" CEO Safra Catz said.\n\nThe company also said that it would bring its database to Google's cloud, with availability coming in November. Organisations will be able to deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data centre regions without being subject to data-transfer charges.\n\n\"In Q3 and Q4, Oracle signed the largest sales contracts in our history, driven by enormous demand for training AI large language models in Oracle Cloud,\" Catz added.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nDespite this, fourth-quarter results in Larry Ellison's company fell short of Wall Street expectations.\n\nTotal revenue grew 3% to $14.29bn.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nGenerative AI has been massively hyped for the past year and a half since the introduction of ChatGPT.\n\nMost of us, though, aren’t really using it daily beyond AI search results or interacting with an AI chatbot when we contact customer service.\n\nIs Apple’s (AAPL) personalization pitch — \"AI for the rest of us\" — the long-awaited killer use case?\n\nInvestors who bid up the stock to a record on Tuesday (after the shares’ initial lackluster reaction to the AI product announcements on Monday) seem to think so.\n\nThere are plenty of analysts who predict the new capabilities will drive an iPhone upgrade cycle.\n\nThere are plenty more who found the introduction \"underwhelming,\" including Needham’s Laura Martin.\n\nShe wrote, \"There was nothing we heard during the WWDC keynote that makes us believe that consumers will buy iPhones faster than our current projections. GenAI was the best hope, but fizzled.\"\n\nThus far, investors have been willing to bet on a certain level of hype when it comes to AI.\n\nWe’ve seen triple-digit gains in Nvidia’s (NVDA) revenue, driven by data center demand centered around AI training. We’ve heard about new AI capabilities touted by corporations from Salesforce (CRM) to Adobe (ADBE) — heck, Taco Bell owner Yum Brands just told us how it’s using AI.\n\nAs my colleague Ethan Wolff-Mann wrote in yesterday’s Morning Brief, the case has been made that AI will transform corporate productivity. (Whether it actually will is TBD.)\n\nApple’s challenge — and Alphabet’s (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft’s (MSFT) — is proving to consumers that they need AI functionality. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks on Monday in Cupertino, Calif. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple might be behind in developing AI, but it has the best shot of integrating it into devices that are in our faces all day long.\n\nAn estimated 1.5 billion people have iPhones. Not all of them will have access to the new features, but enough non-Silicon Valley normies will be using them to perhaps understand what AI is good for.\n\nAs D.A. Davidson’s Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance, \"We're going to go from hundreds of millions of people using generative AI to billions of people.\"\n\nHe says the killer use case is here: \"When you can tell the device, 'Hey, when is my dad landing? Where can I take him for lunch?' Those are things that only Apple can do. Apple is going to build all that into our experience and allow these experiences to leverage our own information in order to execute tasks as an agent that puts them in the lead.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nIf he’s right, then using will be believing. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Apple is TSMC's biggest client, accounting for roughly a fourth of its revenue.\n\n\"We believe the semi[conductor] demand upside from Apple can get bigger with its widening AI service, from a relatively low base. TSMC is Apple’s supplier for the A- and M-series semiconductors and is well poised to benefit from multi-year growth,\" the BofA analysts said.\n\nThey reiterated their \"Buy\" rating of TSMC's stock and lifted their estimates for the firm's 2024 to 2026 earnings by 1% to 3%.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI that will see the iPhone-maker fold ChatGPT into its products. The agreement, which was revealed at Apple's annual developers conference on Monday, comes as the tech giant looks to enhance its AI offerings following an intensifying surge in enthusiasm around the nascent technology.\n\nPrior to the event investors were speculating if Apple would roll out new generative AI features, particularly as it looks to address a growing feeling that it was lagging behind its Big Tech rivals like e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Chief Executive Tim Cook lauded the new \"Apple Intelligence\" system, which aims to use AI to improve its Siri voice assistant and deliver more personalized offerings, as the company's \"next big step.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSMC poised to \"benefit\" from Apple's AI push - Bank of America\n\nJefferies dissects Apple's 7% surge higher\n\nPetMed Express shares slump premarket after Q4 loss widens\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL stock spiked +7% today to fresh 52-week highs after the renowned iPhone maker announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iconic product line and services.\n\nWith that being said, investors may certainly be wondering if it's time to buy Apple’s stock with its operating system getting an innovative makeover.\n\nApple Intelligence Overview\n\nJoining the lineup of big tech companies that are accelerating and utilizing the capabilities of artificial intelligence through generative AI chatbots, Apple joins Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT in this regard.\n\nSiri, Apple’s iconic voice-embedded virtual assistant will be upgraded with AI chatbot features as part of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI platform that will be integrated into the iOS 18 which is the next-generation operating system that will power its iconic devices including the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and smartwatch.\n\nRecent Performance & Valuation\n\nSoaring to over $200 a share on Tuesday, Apple’s stock is now in positive territory for the year and sitting on +7% gains. Although this has slightly edged the benchmark S&P 500, Apple has underperformed Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft’s stock with the tech-centric Nasdaq up +15% for the year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt current levels, Apple’s 29.3X forward earnings multiple is a slight premium to the P/E valuation of Meta Platforms and Alphabet along with the benchmark’s 21.7X but is beneath Microsoft’s 36.3X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Apple’s total sales are now expected to be virtually flat in fiscal 2024 but are projected to rise 5% in FY25 to $405.81 billion. Notably, Apple’s top line is more robust than any of its aforementioned big tech peers with the closest being Alphabet whose total sales are expected to cross $300 billion next year.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple’s annual earnings are projected to be up 7% this year and are forecasted to rise another 9% in FY25 to $7.21 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nWhile it’s far too soon to say Apple may be at another inflection point due to its artificial intelligence offerings, AAPL does land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, there could be better buying opportunities after the smoke clears from the recent rally atttribued to the announcement of Apple Intelligence and the collaboration with OpenAI.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "SAO PAULO (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google said on Tuesday that Brazil will be the first country to test an anti-theft feature for Android phones that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to identify when a phone has been stolen and lock the device's screen.\n\nThree types of lock will be available in the initial test phase. In one of them, Google will use AI that it created to help detect signals of \"common movement associated with theft\" and block the screen.\n\nThe second feature allows a user to lock the device's screen remotely by entering the phone number and completing a security challenge from another device. The last mode involves automatically locking the screen if the device is left without internet access for long periods.\n\nThe features will be available to Brazilian users of Android phones version 10 or higher starting in July, according to the company. They will be released to users from other countries gradually this year, Google said.\n\nPhone theft is a growing problem in Brazil. The number of stolen cellphones in Latin America's largest economy grew 16.6% in 2022 from the previous year to nearly 1 million, according to data from the 2023 Brazilian Public Security Yearbook.\n\nThe Brazilian government launched an app in December named Celular Seguro, which allows users to report a stolen phone and block access to it using another device belonging a trusted person.\n\nAs of last month, around 2 million people were registered with the app across the country, while 50,000 phones had been blocked, according to the Justice Ministry.\n\n(Reporting by Patricia Vilas Boas in Sao Paulo; writing by Luana Maria Benedito; editing by Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - On stage on Monday CEO Tim Cook's Apple announced a splashy deal with OpenAI to include its powerful artificial intelligence model as a part of its voice assistant, Siri.\n\nBut in the fine print of a technical document Apple published after the event, the company makes clear that Alphabet's Google has emerged as another winner in the Cupertino, California, company's quest to catch up in AI.\n\nTo build Apple's foundation AI models, the company's engineers used its own framework software with a range of hardware, specifically its own on-premise graphics processing units (GPUs) and chips available only on Google's cloud called tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoogle has been building TPUs for roughly 10 years, and has publicly discussed two flavors of its fifth-generation chips that can be used for AI training; the performance version of the fifth generation offers performance competitive with Nvidia H100 AI chips, Google said.\n\nGoogle announced at its annual developer conference that a sixth generation will launch this year.\n\nThe processors are designed specifically to run AI applications and train models, and Google has built cloud computing hardware and software platform around them.\n\nApple and Google did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nApple did not discuss the extent to which it relied on Google's chips and software compared with hardware from Nvidia or other AI vendors.\n\nBut using Google's chips typically requires a client to purchase access to them through its cloud division, much in the same way customers buy computing time from Amazon.com's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "When thinking of dividends, many investors commonly gravitate toward real estate investment trusts (REITs) and stocks within the consumer staples, utilities or finance sectors. These common targets are known for their dividend-paying natures, whereas technology companies often get overlooked.\n\nBut many technology companies reward their shareholders with dividend payouts, including Roper Technologies ROP, Micron Technology MU, and Alphabet GOOGL. In addition to quarterly payouts, all three sport bullish growth expectations, undoubtedly a strong pairing.\n\nFor those interested in a blend of growth and income, let’s take a closer look at each.\n\nRoper Technologies Shares up 6% in a Month\n\nROP shares haven’t fared well year-to-date but have jumped back into favor over the last month, gaining 6% compared to a 2% decline from the S&P 500. The company’s quarterly consistency has been remarkable, exceeding both earnings and revenue expectations in seven consecutive quarters.\n\nSales growth has been robust, with ROP posting double-digit percentage year-over-year sales growth rates in each of its last six periods. Below is a chart illustrating the company’s revenue on a quarterly basis. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares currently yield a modest 0.5% annually, undoubtedly on the lower end of the spectrum. Still, the company’s 10.2% five-year annualized dividend growth rate reflects a notable commitment to increasingly rewarding shareholders. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nKeep an eye out for the company’s next quarterly release scheduled for mid-July, as consensus expectations presently allude to a 7.8% growth in earnings on 12% higher sales. Revenue expectations have modestly increased by +0.6% since mid-March. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMicron Technology Expected to See Robust EPS Growth\n\nMicron shares have been remarkably strong in 2024, gaining nearly 60% and widely outperforming on the back of the bullish semiconductor trade fueled by the AI boom. The company recently enjoyed a strong quarter, with revenue, gross margin, and EPS results all exceeding prior guidance.\n\nMU has enjoyed favorable earnings estimate revisions following the results, landing the stock into a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Strong AI server demand has analysts optimistic. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares yield a modest 0.3% annually, beneath the respective average of the Zacks Computer and Technology sector. The company has delivered two upgrades to the quarterly payout over the last five years, reflective of a shareholder-friendly nature.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Micron is expected to return to its growth nature in its current fiscal year, with current consensus expectations alluding to 120% growth in earnings on 60% higher sales. Peeking ahead to FY25, estimates suggest an additional 780% pop in earnings on 50% higher revenues.  Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Starts Quarterly Dividend Payouts\n\nEnjoying a spot in the beloved ‘Mag 7’ group, Alphabet shares have been strong year-to-date, gaining 25% compared to a 7% move in the S&P 500. The stock continues to hold a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with analysts bullish following consistently strong quarterly results. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company positively shocked investors when it announced the initiation of a quarterly dividend back in April, just like what we saw with Meta Platforms. Alphabet’s cash-generating nature allows for future dividend growth, with the company posting $16.8 billion in free cash flow throughout its latest period.\n\nAnd to little surprise, the mega-cap giant remains firmly in growth mode, as consensus expectations suggest a 31% pop in earnings on 15% higher sales in FY24. Growth spills over to FY25, with earnings and revenue forecasted to climb 13% and 12%, respectively. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nDividend-paying stocks don’t always have to be ‘boring’ as many high-growth technology companies also reward their shareholders with quarterly payouts.\n\nAnd for those interested in a blend of income and growth, all three stocks above – Roper Technologies ROP, Micron Technology MU, and Alphabet GOOGL – fit the criteria.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Tuesday after an artificial intelligence-fueled rally put Wall Street at new highs, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve and upcoming inflation data.\n\nHype over AI remained a key point of support for markets after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to roll out AI features. This optimism also spilled over into aftermarket trade after Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced partnerships with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), OpenAI and Alphabet Inc's Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google for more cloud capacity to power AI.\n\nStill, broader gains were held back by anticipation of more cues on U.S. interest rates later on Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,386.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 19,265.75 points. Dow Jones Futures steadied at 38,788.0 points by 19:14 ET (23:14 GMT).\n\nFed meeting, CPI data due on Wednesday\n\nMarket focus was squarely on the conclusion of a two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates steady.\n\nBut markets were somewhat optimistic about the Fed flagging potential rate cuts, especially after its peers, particularly the European Central Bank, began trimming rates earlier in June.\n\nStill, general consensus is that the Fed will only begin cutting rates by September, as the U.S. labor market remains strong and inflation expectations buoyant.\n\nBefore the rate decision, consumer price index data for May is expected to offer more cues on inflation.\n\nThe reading is also due on Wednesday, and is expected to show inflation remained sticky in May, and well above the Fed’s 2% annual target range.\n\nSticky inflation diminishes the chances of rate cuts by the Fed, while the prospect of high for longer U.S. rates presents a constrained outlook for stock markets.\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq at record highs on AI hype\n\nThe S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite finished at record highs on Tuesday, driven chiefly by technology stocks amid persistent hype over AI. Apple Inc rallied over 7% to a record high after announcing its new AI features, while Microsoft and Alphabet added about 1% each.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3% to end at 5,375.32 points on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to 17,343.84 points. But the more economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to lag its peers, falling 0.3% to 38,747.42 points.\n\nGains in most tech stocks did not extend into aftermarket trade.\n\nBut Oracle surged nearly 9% after the bell on its new AI partnerships, which largely overshadowed disappointing quarterly earnings from the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after AI rally; Fed rate decision, CPI on tap\n\nTesla shareholder sues Musk to return billions in alleged unlawful profits\n\nMediaTek designs Arm-based chip for Microsoft's AI laptops, say sources\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:EBAY) in terms of attracting repeat U.S. customers, despite eBay’s nearly three decades of operation.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Omnisend revealed that 34% of consumers shop on Temu monthly, surpassing eBay’s 29%, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThis surge in customer engagement for Temu comes as the company invests heavily in marketing and promotional discounts.\n\nNotably, Temu’s advertisements, including two Super Bowl commercials, have effectively drawn customers to its platform, where they typically wait a week or more for items shipped directly from China.\n\nTemu’s aggressive advertising strategies and social media presence, encapsulated by their “Shop like a billionaire” campaign, have hugely contributed to their rapid growth in the competitive U.S. market.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Strengthens India Presence With MX Player Asset Acquisition: Report\n\nThe pandemic-induced price surge has altered consumer behaviors significantly, with only 40% of U.S. shopping journeys starting on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year, down from over half in 2022.\n\nTemu's rise reflects a broader trend of consumers increasingly starting their shopping journeys on search engines like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), seeking better deals across various platforms.\n\nWhile Temu’s pricing attracts consumers, the company faces challenges with product quality and delivery speeds, areas where competitors like Amazon excel with their vast array of fast and reliable services.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Temu’s model of direct-from-factory sales continues to gain traction among price-conscious shoppers.\n\nPrice Action: PDD shares are trading lower by 0.79% at $147.31 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Amazon Inks ‘Largest Technology Investment’ In Spain, Pours $17B Into Cloud Infrastructure\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report EBAY (EBAY): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Chinese Retailer Temu Gains Edge Over eBay In US Market originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "The Company with the Most Layoffs in 2024",
        "content": "In this article, we look at the company with the most layoffs in 2024. We recently released a list of companies laying off this year; to view the full free list, you can head over to the 15 Big Companies Laying Off in 2024.\n\nMore than 90,000 employees have been laid off across the world in 2024, according to independent job cuts tracker, Layoffs.fyi. The number suggests that the layoffs are still going strong this year following significant workforce reductions in 2023 in which nearly 240,000 people lost their jobs.\n\nCompanies were forced to layoff a large share of their employees when the coronavirus pandemic struck in 2020. However, despite the world returning to normalcy, job cuts continue to remain high, primarily due to financial reasons, pressure from investors, and the need to eliminate certain departments and roles. The first week of June has just concluded, and already over 1,400 employees have been shown the door this month, after Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), OrCam, and Oda announced fresh rounds of layoffs.\n\nOn June 3, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) announced the decision, which is likely to impact around 1,000 employees, mainly affecting the company’s Mixed Reality Department which works on HoloLens 2. The Azure for Operators and Mission Engineering departments, which were formed in 2021, are also likely to be affected. Analysts are seeing the move as part of the organizational restructuring taking place in the company. Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) laid off over 10,000 employees last year as well.\n\nJob cuts have picked up pace since the beginning of January last year, when it was reported that the company was under pressure from investors after recording its slowest revenue growth (2%) in six years during the last quarter of 2022. Between then and now, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)’s stock price has increased 79% from $236.6 per share on January 3, 2023 to its current level of $423.85. The company’s diluted earnings per share (EPS), however, only marginally increased from $9.65 in 2022 to $9.65 in 2023.\n\nOn the other hand, Google, owned by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), announced cuts in several teams that are part of its cloud unit, including engineering and sales. According to CNBC, had informed employees of the impending cuts in the cloud unit a week in advance. Around 100 employees were laid off by Google. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). The report also highlighted that the move was part of efforts aimed at prioritizing artificial intelligence.\n\nInvestors are pleased with the direction the company is headed, with its stocks gaining over 36% in the last 12 months. Lakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasized the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs (chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data center architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\n\nMoreover, Israeli companies OrCam and Pagaya, along with Norwegian supermarket delivery startup, combined laid off around 350 of their employees from various departments of the business, citing financial and strategic reasons. The three companies, however, did not make the list of the top 15 companies with the most layoffs in 2024.\n\nLet’s now head over to the companies that did. The Company with the Most Layoffs in 2024\n\nMethodology\n\nWe formulated the list of big companies laying off in 2024 using data published on Layoffs.fyi. The website has a comprehensive list of companies from various industries that have announced job cuts over the last few years. We filtered the date for layoffs announced in 2024, and have listed companies in ascending order of the number of employees laid off by them this year.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe company with the most layoffs in 2024 is Tesla!\n\n1. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)\n\nLaid off: 14,000\n\nIn April this year, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) declared to its employees that two senior executives at the company had resigned and that the electric car company would also be laying off more 14,000 employees, which represented well over 10% of Tesla’s overall workforce. According to a report in The New York Times, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA)’s decision to cut jobs was forced by a decrease in sales and growing competition in the industry. Thus far in 2024, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) has had the highest number of layoffs for big companies.\n\nThe company’s woes still continue unabated, with its stocks having lost 8.2% of their value over the last 52 weeks. Aristotle Atlantic Focus Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\nWe sold Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) due to deteriorating fundamentals, and there have been significant negative earnings revisions over the past year. Tesla has announced several price cuts to its vehicles and has underscored competition in electric vehicles (EVs) globally. China seems especially competitive. More U.S. EV offerings are expected this year. The Full-Self Driving Capability feature is controversial, has regulatory and litigation risk, and has been chronically late. Elon Musk is trying to gain additional voting shares in Tesla stock. This could present governance issues where his voting share could exceed his economic share of the company.\n\nTo learn about other companies laying off their employees, view the full report 15 Big Companies Laying Off in 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from job cuts to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 25.4% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 19.4%. The company is benefiting from a strong Google Services segment driven by search, YouTube and Android.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s division Google is making concerted efforts to bolster the segment further.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google introduced a new Notifications feature for one of its Android apps, Google Wallet. The Wallet app now has six notification categories, namely Tips, Purchases, Passes, Transit, Updates & Alerts, and Promotional Campaigns, allowing users to receive transaction notifications from Google Wallet directly instead of Google Play services.\r\n\r\nThe rollout of a new “Automatically add linked passes” feature to Google Wallet remains noteworthy. This new feature is an addition to the \"Passes\" sub-section in Google Wallet settings on Android. It allows providers to automatically add event tickets, promotions and offers to existing passes.\r\n\r\nGrowing Wallet app offerings on Android would allow Google to capitalize on growth opportunities present in the global digital wallet market, which, per The Business Research Company report, is expected to hit $47.7 billion in 2024 and reach $97.54 billion by 2033, witnessing a CAGR of 19.6% between 2024 and 2033.\r\n\r\nMoreover, it would also place Alphabet at a competitive advantage over industry peers like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are also making strong efforts to strengthen their foothold in the global digital wallet market.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s addition of a cryptocurrency wallet to its Edge Wallet remains noteworthy. This feature provides real-time updates on cryptocurrency value fluctuations and logging transactions for effective monitoring.\r\n\r\nApple, on the other hand, is enjoying the growing momentum of Apple Wallet with the addition of new features. Its Apple Pay orders can now be attached to receipts as PDF or image files, allowing customers to track payment in the Wallet app and to confirmation emails.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nStrength in Google Services Segment Aids Prospects\n\nAlphabet has been taking continuous strides to boost its search and YouTube businesses in addition to Android, in a bid to strengthen its Google Services segment.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently rolled out “Minimized Custom Tabs” for Google Chrome to improve the user experience and functionality of the Chrome browser, which, in turn, will likely boost the company's search engine.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s latest Cast menu redesign of YouTube is expected to expand YouTube’s user base. The updated Cast icon now features a floating bottom sheet with rounded corners, allowing users to control volume and voice search, and also provides remote control options for televisions.\r\n\r\nIn order to strengthen its YouTube business further, Google recently partnered with Peloton Interactive PTON.\r\n\r\nThis partnership marks a significant step for Google to expand its YouTube TV subscriber base, as it requires Peloton All-Access members to have a YouTube TV subscription in order to watch content while on their machine.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are expected to benefit the Google Services segment performance in the upcoming period.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening Google Services segment is expected to aid Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 total revenues stands at $295.53 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 15.2%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $7.60 per share, indicating a 31.03% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.4% in the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nWe believe Alphabet’s strength in the Google Services Segment, coupled with its robust cloud division, growing momentum across Google’s mobile search and strengthening generative AI capabilities, make it an attractive stock for investors at the current level.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is trading at a discount with a forward 12-month P/E of 21.74X compared with the Zacks Internet Services industry’s 22.40X.\r\n\r\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $5.28 billion, suggesting growth of 9.7% from the year-ago quarter’s reported figure.\r\n\r\nThe company expects non-GAAP earnings between $4.35 and $4.40 per share. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.39 per share, indicating a 12.3% rise from the year-ago period’s actual. The earnings estimate has been unchanged over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe upcoming results are expected to reflect the benefits of growing generative AI capabilities on the back of its family of creative generative AI models, Firefly, which has been driving growth within the Digital Media and Digital Experience segments.\r\n\r\nThe Digital Media segment, comprising Creative Cloud and Document Cloud, is expected to have gained from the strong adoption of Firefly tools in Photoshop, Generative Fill and Generative Expand.

Quote\n\nStrong Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nAdobe’s near and long-term prospects are expected to gain from its strong efforts toward leveraging generative AI to deliver groundbreaking innovation across its portfolio.\r\n\r\nThe company has been aggressively integrating Firefly into its Creative Cloud flagship applications and Adobe Express to provide enhanced user experience.\r\n\r\nADBE’s effort to integrate the power of Acrobat AI Assistant into PDF is boosting the adoption of the product in the near term.\r\n\r\nAdobe’s unveiling of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company recently launched Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom, which is a powerful Firefly-backed tool that helps remove unwanted objects from any photo in a single click in a non-destructive manner.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Adobe Express for Enterprise, which is powered by Firefly Image Model 3, is helping the company gain traction across various enterprises.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Photoshop’s web version, which is available via Firefly-powered AI tools, generative expand and generative fill, enables file collaboration through sharing links, even without subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is also witnessing the strong adoption of Generative Fill in Photoshop, which allows the creation of images in new ways and acceleration of editing workflows.

Adobe is experiencing rising free-to-paid conversions on the back of its Acrobat extensions for Microsoft Edge and Google Chrome. \r\n\r\nIn addition, Adobe’s recent partnership with Microsoft to provide marketing insights and workflows from Adobe Experience Cloud applications and Microsoft Dynamics 365 to Microsoft Copilot in order to assist marketers in creative briefs development, content creation and content approval management, is noteworthy.\n\nConclusion\n\nAdobe is well-poised to benefit from its strong generative AI-powered product offerings and cloud strategy. A strong market position in the PDF category, compelling product lines, continued innovation and a growing footprint in emerging markets should drive its business growth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, ADBE is trading at a significant discount, with a forward 12-month P/E of 24.04X compared with the industry’s 31.85X, making it a good opportunity for investors.\r\n\r\nStay on top of upcoming earnings announcements with the Zacks Earnings Calendar.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple looks to make AI more personal",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) took the leap into generative AI, debuting its Apple Intelligence platform at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. It’s a massive shift for the company, bringing a host of new features to its various operating systems and products.\n\nApple certainly isn’t the first company to debut generative AI capabilities for its software or devices. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) both debuted their own AI chatbots and services in 2023 and updated them with new capabilities during their respective developer conferences earlier this year. But Apple is unique in how it’s positioning its AI service. Samsung also has its own Galaxy AI services, which use the company's own AI models as well as Google Gemini models.\n\nRather than introducing a digital know-it-all, however, Apple, is presenting Apple Intelligence as a personalized AI platform designed to understand your data and provide it to you when you need it most. It’s a subtle distinction but one that acts as a key differentiator for Apple as it seeks to prove that its approach is the one consumers will find most useful. Apple is bringing generative AI capabilities to Siri, elevating the voice assistant to a more prominent role across its operating systems. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\n“When we think about what it means for intelligence to be really useful, it has to be centered on you,” said Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi. “We think AI's role is not to replace our users but to empower them. … It needs to be integrated into the experience you're using all the time. It needs to be intuitive, but it also needs to be informed by your personal context, really, knowledge of you.”\n\nApple is creating a personal kind of AI experience in a number of ways, including a new and improved version of Siri that is contextually aware of your data. For instance, imagine you have to pick your mother up from the airport but don't know what time she gets in.\n\nYou'll be able to ask Siri when your mom’s flight is landing, and the assistant will find the appropriate messages your mother sent you about her flight via email or text, then check real-time flight data to give you the exact time her flight lands.\n\nSiri will also be able to understand the content on your screen. Say your friend sends you an address followed by a series of unrelated texts. You can tell Siri, “Save this address to their Contact Card,” and Siri will recognize that you want to save that particular address to your friend’s Contact Card without having to say your friend’s name over again.\n\nSiri isn’t the only place you’ll find Apple Intelligence. Apple says it’s using the technology to help prioritize notifications, putting priority messages and app alerts at the top of your notifications stack and even summarizing long threads to help you catch up without having to scroll through endless messages.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Google and Samsung, Apple has also added generative AI-powered photo editing features and the ability to summarize and rewrite text in Mail and other apps.\n\nBut generative AI raises privacy concerns since data is regularly shared back and forth with the web. And it could be especially problematic for Apple to intertwine so much of your personal data with generative AI apps. To that end, Apple says it is using a number of on-device AI models that don’t share your data with cloud-based services. Apple Intelligence will stack the most important notifications above less time-sensitive messages. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nFor requests that are too complex for on-device models, Apple says it will connect to its own specialized cloud services it calls Private Cloud Compute that run on Apple’s own servers powered by its own chips, which the company says ensures requests remain secure. What’s more, the company says that when users make requests, only a small amount of necessary data goes up to the cloud.\n\nApple further points out that its servers have no storage options for user data, so it won’t save any of the information it uses in your requests. The software powering Private Cloud Compute is also publicized so that it can be audited by security researchers.\n\nBasically, the company wants users to know that while some AI prompts will use cloud-based AI models, your user data won’t end up being used to train future Apple models or live on Apple’s servers in perpetuity.\n\nApple isn’t only using its own AI models. It has also partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the company’s devices. But Apple says you’ll be asked whether you want to use the service every time you try to access it before anything is sent to the OpenAI’s servers. The company says it’s also working to integrate other AI models including Google’s Gemini.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads running its M1 chip and newer later this fall. And if the company is successful in its effort to make generative AI truly useful for the average user, it could set Apple up as one of the industry leaders in the still-nascent space.

        "title": "3 Powerful Examples of the Zacks Rank: Nvidia, Netflix, Alphabet",
        "content": "Stocks with rising earnings estimates have significantly outperformed the S&P 500 year after year, whereas stocks with falling earnings estimates have underperformed the S&P 500 year after year.\n\nThe Zacks Rank has made the process of identifying stocks with changing earnings estimates easy and very profitable. It’s a reliable tool that helps you trade with confidence regardless of your trading style and/or risk tolerance.\n\nThe Zacks Rank uses four factors related to earnings estimates to classify stocks into five groups, ranging from ‘Strong Buy’ to ‘Strong Sell.’ Importantly, it allows individual investors to take advantage of trends in earnings estimate revisions and benefit from the power of institutional investors.\n\nLet’s take a closer look at the Zacks Rank in action across several stocks, including beloved Nvidia NVDA, Netflix NFLX, and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nNvidia Shares Keep Climbing\n\nInvestor-favorite Nvidia reclaimed its Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) rating on May 30th, with shares gaining nearly 10% since. The stock has held a favorable ranking for an extended period now, reflective of analysts’ bullish outlooks regarding its Data Center sales.\n\nThe company’s favorable earnings outlook is illustrated below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nRobust quarterly results are expected to keep coming, with the company forecasted to see 130% EPS growth on 110% higher sales in its upcoming release. The company’s revenue growth has been remarkable over the years, as shown below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd the growth picture remains bright thanks to demand for H200 and Blackwell that’s currently well ahead of supply, with demand potentially exceeding supply well into next year. The H200’s larger and faster memory fuels the acceleration of generative AI and large language models (LLMs) while advancing scientific computing for HPC workloads.\n\nNetflix Shares up 11%\n\nNetflix obtained the highly-coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) back on May 3, with shares up nearly 11% since. The company’s latest set of quarterly results caused shares to face some pressure but have since erased the declines.\n\nAnalysts have raised their earnings expectations across the board, with positive revisions following the above-mentioned set of quarterly results. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe streaming giant enjoyed a solid quarter, posting $2.1 billion in free cash flow and seeing its year-to-date operating margin moving higher to 28.1% (20.6% in FY23). The company also maintained its free cash flow outlook of $6 billion for FY24 and repurchased 3.6 million shares throughout the period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company’s growth outlook remains bright, with consensus expectations for its current fiscal year suggesting 52% earnings growth on 15% higher sales. The stock sports a Style Score of ‘A’ for Growth. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAlphabet Shares Aren't Expensive\n\nAlphabet was upgraded to a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) on April 30, with shares gaining 7% since. Like those above, the company’s earnings outlook has become bright across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShares aren’t overly expensive given the company’s forecasted growth, as the current 21.7X forward 12-month earnings multiple sits right at the five-year median and well beneath five-year highs of 32.6X. Alphabet’s forecasted to enjoy 31% EPS growth on 15% higher sales in its current fiscal year, with consensus expectations for FY25 alluding to an additional 13% earnings growth on 12% higher revenue.\n\nThe multiple also compares favorably to the Zacks Computer and Technology sector average of 27.1X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs the examples above show, listening to the Zacks Rank can consistently result in market-beating gains, as positive earnings estimate revisions provide the fuel needed to move higher.\n\nAll three stocks above – Nvidia NVDA, Netflix NFLX, and Alphabet GOOGL – presently sport a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), reflecting upward trending earnings estimate revisions.\n\nVisit Zacks Rank Education to learn more about using this proven system for market-beating gains.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Wall Street had a robust first quarter before the rally came to a brief halt in April. Indexes were up again in May but volatility returned at the end of the month as lack of clarity from the Federal Reserve over the timing of the rate cut dented investors’ confidence.\n\nHowever, markets have mostly ignored those fears, and all major indexes have hit multiple all-time highs this year. On Jun 10, the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq closed at fresh all-time highs. The S&P 500 closed at 5,360.79 points, up 0.3%, while the Nasdaq rose 0.4% to close at 17,192.53 points.\n\nYear to date, the S&P 500 has gained 12.4%. Although the Federal Reserve hasn’t provided any timeline for its first rate cut, it has left interest rates unchanged in the current range of 5.25-5.5% over the past year.\n\nHigher borrowing costs have been hurting consumers but market participants are still confident about the economy as inflation finally started showing signs of cooling in April after increasing in the first quarter.\n\nThe S&P 500 rally is also being driven by tech stocks, especially because of the ongoing enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI), particularly generative AI. After a stellar ride in 2023, Al-centric stocks are powering the rally this year, too.\n\nAlso, U.S. GDP slowed in the first quarter, growing just 1.3%. However, it is projected to grow 2.1% at an annual pace in the second quarter. This led to consumer confidence rebounding in May. The consumer confidence index rose to 102 in May from an upwardly revised 95.7 in the prior month.\n\nOur Choices\n\nGiven this scenario, it would be ideal to invest in S&P 500 stocks such asNVIDIA Corporation NVDA, Alphabet Inc.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the world as we know it. While this paradigm-shifting technology may seem like science fiction to many, its impact is already profoundly reshaping global business operations, technological innovation, and human society.\n\nAs AI advances at an unprecedented pace, investors would be wise to position themselves in companies leading the charge. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhich AI stocks should be at the top of your buy list right now? Two names that stand out are Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT). Here's a closer look at why these tech giants are prime picks for gaining exposure to the potent AI theme.\n\nAlphabet's DeepMind: A wellspring of AI breakthroughs\n\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, is an undisputed force in artificial intelligence. The company has leveraged its vast resources and computing power to drive game-changing AI innovation through its pioneering subsidiary, DeepMind.\n\nAcquired by Alphabet in 2014, DeepMind has been at the forefront of AI breakthroughs in machine learning, reinforcement learning, and neural networks.\n\nAmong its most notable achievements is the development of AlphaGo, the first AI system to defeat a world champion in the ancient game of Go -- a feat once thought to be decades away.\n\nMore recently, DeepMind's AlphaFold has revolutionized the field of protein-structure prediction, unlocking new frontiers in biological research and drug discovery.\n\nAlphabet's sprawling network of data centers and robust cloud infrastructure provide it with a significant competitive edge.\n\nWith access to vast troves of data and immense computational resources, Alphabet can train and deploy increasingly sophisticated AI models that push the boundaries of what is possible.\n\nBeyond its cutting-edge AI research, Alphabet's world-class architecture puts it in a prime position to monetize its cutting-edge technology.\n\nThe company's Google Cloud platform offers a suite of AI-powered services and tools tailored for businesses and developers -- a market expected to surge as AI adoption accelerates across industries.\n\nWith its proven track record of innovation, unparalleled data, computing resources, and a budding AI-as-a-service business, Alphabet stands out as a compelling option for investors seeking exposure to this powerful trend.\n\nBest of all, the company's shares trade at a reasonable 23 times forward earnings -- one of the more attractive valuations in the ultra-high-growth AI space.\n\nMicrosoft's transformative AI bet pays off\n\nWhile Alphabet may be one of the earliest movers in the space, Microsoft has firmly established itself as a force to be reckoned with in AI. The company's strategic investments and partnerships in recent years have positioned it at the vanguard of AI's real-world applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nCentral to Microsoft's AI strategy is its partnership with OpenAI, the ambitious artificial intelligence research company behind pioneering language models like GPT-3 and DALL-E 2.\n\nIn 2019, Microsoft announced a $1 billion investment in OpenAI, granting the tech giant exclusive access to OpenAI's groundbreaking AI systems. The tech giant's investment has since ballooned to over $13 billion, underscoring its intent to be a leader in this emerging field.\n\nThe fruits of this partnership have already begun to surface. Microsoft has since infused its Bing search engine with AI and integrated OpenAI's technology into its Microsoft 365 suite through tools like Copilot, which uses AI to assist with writing, data analysis, and other tasks.\n\nWith its strategic investments, innovative product integrations, and bold vision for an AI-driven future, Microsoft is well positioned to capitalize on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence.\n\nWhat's the catch? Microsoft's stock isn't exactly cheap at 31.6 times forward earnings. However, Wall Street thinks its AI initiative will spur double-digit revenue and earnings growth in 2025.\n\nIts hefty price tag, therefore, appears justified in the context of the company's AI-fueled growth prospects.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $740,690!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "content": "Following Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s WWDC event, analysts at RBC Capital, Morgan Stanley, and Evercore ISI provided their thoughts on what the iPhone maker's announcements could mean for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s AI position.\n\nRBC sees Apple's AI product announcements as mixed or slightly negative for GOOGL. The bank did note one positive, with Apple saying it intends to add support for other AI models (besides ChatGPT) in the future and specifically mentioned Google's Gemini as a likely example.\n\nHowever, on the negative side, RBC highlighted the confirmation from Apple that OpenAI's ChatGPT will be Apple's first GenAI partner with ChatGPT integrated into Siri as well as a few of Apple's other productivity apps around content creation.\n\n\"Bears will argue that Apple is diversifying away from GOOGL with tight integration of competing tools signaling fewer hand-offs to Google in the future,\" they add.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley said the current iOS GenAI use cases don't appear to be Google Search disintermediation threats.\n\n\"In our view, the use cases presented by AAPL do not appear to present a disintermediation threat to broad-based internet Search (i.e.GOOGL Search) or commercial query search,\" said Morgan Stanley. \"For now, we see the new Siri and Apple Intelligence products as a native AAPL assistant with still limited capabilities.\"\n\nFurthermore, the bank continues to believe AAPL is more likely than not going to leverage GOOGL and Gemini, given the aforementioned dynamics, noting that AAPL said it intends to add support for other AI models (other than OpenAI) in the future. \"In our view, a confirmation of an AAPL/Gemini partnership is likely to be positive for GOOGL shareholders as it would confirm GOOGL's position in AAPL's stack of GenAI tools,\" they added.\n\nOppenheimer surveyed consumers' adoption and usage of Gen AI Search with a 1,000-respondent U.S. survey, leading up to Apple's WWDC event.\n\nThey came away from the survey more constructive on Google's competitive position in both Core Search and Gen AI Search, as it suggests \"Google's market share remains very strong even among Gen Zers.\"\n\n\"Despite the rise of Social Media searches, we see very consistent leadership for Google Search across all demographics,\" said Evercore. \"Further, our survey suggests Gen AI is driving higher overall search volume, and Google's AI products are leading to more effective searches and higher user satisfaction – which would likely translate into better ROAS for Advertisers and more Search Revenue for Google.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle stock: Analysts weigh in on Alphabet's AI position after Apple WWDC event\n\nLufthansa unlikely to offer more concessions in ITA bid, sources say\n\nAnalysis-Apple's AI push could reinvigorate iPhone sales as customers look to upgrade\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The stock market rally has been all about large caps",
        "content": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nBespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC) into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by market cap size. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year.\n\nTo Bespoke, this shows the recent trend in markets has generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\"\n\nThe move into large-cap stocks comes as investors have scaled back bets on interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports.\n\nThe larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected.\n\nThat's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" — which includes the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE) — grew 39% compared to the S&P 500's 5.9% year-over-year growth. The NVIDIA logo and the Apple logo are pictured in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province, China, June 6, 2024. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\nThis fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growth have become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon.\n\n\"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit — a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nHe added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\"\n\nThe top-heavy AI trade\n\nBigger stocks are also winning the AI trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade.\n\nThe team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date.\n\nNotably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA (NVDA), that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Factbox-India's EU-like antitrust law worrying technology firms",
        "content": "By Arpan Chaturvedi\n\nNEW DELHI (Reuters) - India's proposed EU-like antitrust law will pose a fresh regulatory challenge for tech firms including Apple, Google and Meta, laying out strict compliance obligations that could affect their business models.\n\nThe Indian government is currently examining a panel's February report that proposed a new \"Digital Competition Bill\" to complement existing antitrust laws. A key U.S. lobby group has already opposed the move, fearing its business impact.\n\nHere are key details of India's proposal:\n\nWHO WOULD THE LAW APPLY TO?\n\nThe law would affect what it says are \"systemically significant digital\" companies. Those with a domestic turnover exceeding $480 million or a global turnover of over $30 billion, along with a local user base of at least 10 million for its digital services, would be covered.\n\nApple, Google, Meta, Amazon would come under the purview of the Indian law, which has yet to be approved by parliament.\n\nWHY DOES INDIA WANT A NEW ANTITRUST LAW?\n\nThe government panel said new regulations were needed as the digital market was \"increasingly becoming concentrated\", with a few large companies wielding \"immense control over the market.\"\n\nThat, the panel said, meant smaller digital firms and startups need to depend on the larger companies, giving rise to \"an imbalance in bargaining power\".\n\nWHAT WOULD THE NEW LAW REQUIRE?\n\nCompanies would be required to operate in a fair and non-discriminatory manner, with the bill recommending a penalty of up to 10% of a company's global turnover for violations - just like EU's Digital Markets Act.\n\nThe big digital companies would be prohibited from exploiting non-public user data and from favouring their own products or services on their platforms.\n\nThe companies would also be barred from restricting the ability of users to download, install or use third-party apps in anyway. And they would have to allow users to select default settings freely.\n\nThe law proposal and feedback received will now be reviewed by the Ministry of Corporate Affairs, whose minister, Nirmala Sitharaman, remains in place following India's election.\n\nWHICH TECH FIRMS ALREADY FACE INDIA'S SCRUTINY?\n\nIn India, Amazon and Walmart's Flipkart are being examined for promoting select sellers on their e-commerce platforms, hurting rivals.\n\nGoogle has faced antitrust fines and is embroiled in legal battles over abusing its position in the Android mobile operating system market, including restricting users' ability to remove pre-installed apps.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle, as well as Apple, are also facing scrutiny for promoting their in-app purchase systems, which a non-profit group alleges hurts rivals.\n\nAll the companies deny any wrongdoing.\n\n(Reporting by Arpan Chaturvedi; Editing by Aditya Kalra and Sonali Paul)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s big AI announcements were all about AI ‘for the rest of us’ — Google, Meta, Amazon and, yes, OpenAI should take note",
        "content": "In the end, Apple’s highly-anticipated AI announcements were very, well, Apple-y. You could practically feel that bite in the tech giant’s fruit logo as the company finally announced Apple Intelligence (how deliciously on-brand to take advantage of the technology’s initials), which Apple’s Tim Cook touted will be “personal, powerful, and private” and integrated across Apple’s app and hardware ecosystem.\n\nApple, of course, has always been all about being a protective “walled garden” that provides comprehensive security measures but also plenty of restrictions for users, and Apple Intelligence will be no different. But it is that very personal context of the user within the Apple landscape, combined with the power of generative AI, that makes Apple Intelligence something perhaps only Apple could really do.\n\nApple has not been first, or anywhere near the cutting edge of generative AI, but it is betting on something else: An AI ‘for the rest of us’ — for the billions of users who don’t care about models or APIs or datasets or GPUs or devices or the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI). That is, the ‘normies’ — as those in the tech industry like to call them — who simply want AI that is easy, useful, protective of privacy and just works.\n\nThe laundry list of features Apple executives promised to roll out across iPhone, iPad and Mac OS devices was long. Siri is getting an upgrade that makes the assistant “natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal.” If Siri can’t answer a question itself, it will ask the user if it’s OK to tap into ChatGPT (thanks to a new deal between Apple and OpenAI) and it will have “on-screen awareness” that will eventually allow Siri to take more agent-like action on user content across apps.\n\nThere will be new systemwide writing tools in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, as well as new ways for AI to help prioritize everything from messages to notifications. The fun factor is well-represented as well, with on-device AI image creation and the fittingly-named Genmojis, which let users create custom emojis on-the-fly (think: smiley face with cucumbers on the eyes to indicate you're at the spa).\n\nBut unlike Google and Meta’s throw-everything-at-the-wall approach to integrating generative AI to their products, Apple is taking a different tack, putting a carefully designed layer of gen AI on top of its operating system. None of it, at least in Monday’s demo, seems bolted on as an afterthought (like Meta’s AI-is-everywhere search bar in Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, for example). And none of it, in fact, really uses the word AI as in “artificial intelligence.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe re-branding of AI as Apple Intelligence takes a technology consumers have heard and read about for more than a year (and which has often sounded frightening, futuristic and kind of freaky), and serves it up as something that's soothingly safe and secure. It’s the tech equivalent of a mild soap for sensitive skin, offering consumers a freshly-scrubbed face with no hard-to-pronounce and potentially irritating ingredients.\n\nOf course, Big Tech demos are notorious for big announcements that don’t always deliver. And there were few details about important issues like the provenance of the data powering Apple Intelligence features, the terms of Apple's deal with OpenAI for access to ChatGPT, and how Apple plans to deal with the inevitable hallucinations that will result from its AI output. After all, safe and secure does not mean “accurate.” When Apple Intelligence is released “in the wild,” things are sure to get interesting, and messier.\n\nThe tech world is in a fierce battle to see which company will be able to take AI and turn it into the industry’s next game-changer. Whether that is Apple or not remains to be seen, but the elegant simplicity of the Apple Intelligence announcements certainly puts Google, Meta, Amazon and yes, OpenAI on notice: AI may be complicated, but as Steve Jobs said, “simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.” Perhaps, AI companies will finally figure out how to keep it simple—and as Jobs said, “move mountains.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. took the wraps off long-awaited new artificial intelligence features, including a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, betting that a personalized and understated approach to the technology will win over customers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Investment Bank Moelis Probes Incident After Video of Employee Appearing to Punch Woman NYC Landlord to Sell Office Building at Roughly 67% Discount Musk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Macron Gambles on Snap French Election in Bid to Stop Le Pen\n\nA new AI platform called Apple Intelligence was the highlight of the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference presentation on Monday, which also included updates to the iPhone maker’s operating systems. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. The push also includes a revamped version of Siri, the company’s once-pioneering digital assistant.\n\nApple is making a high-stakes bid to catch up with rivals in the booming AI market. After falling behind tech peers like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., the company is counting on a streamlined interface — and loyal customer base — to regain ground.\n\n“This is a moment we’ve been working toward for a long time,” Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, who oversees software engineering, said at the event. He described Apple Intelligence as “AI for the rest of us,” alluding to an old slogan about the Mac computer.\n\nThe partnership with OpenAI, which Bloomberg reported on before the event, will let customers access ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year, but some features — including the ability for Siri to precisely control features within apps — won’t come until next year. Support for languages beyond English also won’t arrive until later.\n\nOpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was at Monday’s event and wrote on the social media site X that he was “very happy” to be teaming up with Apple. While the ChatGPT integration will be free, paid subscribers to OpenAI will get additional features over time. Apple, which has also held talks with Google about using that company’s Gemini feature, said it plans to support other services later.\n\nEnsuring that customer data is secure was a major theme of the presentation. A system called Private Cloud Compute will help keep users’ information safe when it’s being sent to data centers, Federighi said. Apple Intelligence will also support AI-created emoji called Genmoji and automated photo editing.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS — its iPhone and iPad software — will get features that improve customization, productivity and communication. Some additions will include:\n\nAn upgraded home screen will let users place icons anywhere. App icon colors can also be changed, and they can be tinted when the device is placed in dark mode. A new Control Center includes support for third-party controls, multiple pages of settings and an updated look. The iPhone 14 and more recent models will get support for text messaging via satellites. That was previously available in emergency situations. The Messages app will have the ability to schedule a text to be sent later. The Tapbacks feature, which lets users quickly respond to texts with things like a heart or question mark, will now work with an emoji or digital sticker. Customers can set up effects — such as a shaking word — for individual words and phrases, rather than entire texts. And there’s rich text support, which will make it easier for Apple customers to communicate with Android users. A Passwords app will manage secure logins, passkeys and Wi-Fi account details. A redesigned Photos app will use artificial intelligence to improve editing. There’s the ability to lock any app behind Face ID. The iPad gets the Calculator app for the first time, and it will let people solve handwritten math equations using an Apple Pencil. That app’s absence from the iPad was a longstanding issue among customers, and the new feature was announced to applause at Monday’s event.\n\nInvestors gave a tepid reaction to the event — a not-uncommon reaction when Apple debuts long-anticipated new features. The shares fell almost 2% to $193.12 in New York, leaving the stock little changed for the year.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also rolled out macOS Sequoia, which includes the same Apple Intelligence features as the iPad and iPhone.\n\nSome of its other enhancements:\n\nThe ability to receive and interact with iPhone notifications. The ability to drag and drop files between devices. Mirroring an iPhone’s display so it can be used on a Mac’s screen. The ability to organize Mac application windows as tiles that stick to different portions of the display.\n\nAnd the company unveiled visionOS 2, the latest version of its software for the Vision Pro headset. That has new features for photos and handling office work, including:\n\nThe ability to turn regular photos into 3D spatial pictures. New hand gestures for opening the Home View and Control Center. A new version of the Mac Virtual Display feature that can create a virtual wraparound screen. The ability to AirPlay content from an iPhone, iPad or Mac into the Vision Pro.\n\nApple also announced plans to launch the Vision Pro internationally, with preorders beginning in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore on June 13. The device will go on sale in those areas June 28. That will be followed by Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. Preorders will begin in those countries June 28, and sales will start July 12.\n\nNew AirPods software, meanwhile, will make it easier to hear users’ voices during a phone call by removing background noise. The Apple Watch will get additional health capabilities, such as enhanced pregnancy tracking and an app that shows at-a-glance vital statistics.\n\nBut the AI features were the biggest focus of the event. Those tools will also include the ability to transcribe phone calls and voice memos, solve advanced math equations, sort through email, and prioritize notifications.\n\nThough Apple had an early lead in AI after it launched Siri in 2011, its technology was quickly overtaken by the Google Assistant and Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa. Then AI took another giant leap forward when OpenAI’s ChatGPT arrived at the end of 2022.\n\nThat led to a flurry of other services, including ones from Google, Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. — Apple’s biggest smartphone rival — also integrated Google AI features into its devices earlier this year.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook is now under pressure to show that the iPhone maker can lead again. The company also is contending with a broader sales slump. Revenue declined in five of the past six quarters in the face of sluggish smartphone demand and a slowdown in China.\n\nOn Monday, Cook said AI would be “the next big step for Apple.” Though the company won’t make money directly on the new features, the hope is to make users more loyal and prod them to upgrade more frequently.\n\n“We think Apple Intelligence is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "title": "Nvidia stock rises after 10-for-1 stock split",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the shares' Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The stock closed up nearly 1% in its first day following the split.\n\nThe split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform, called Blackwell Ultra, is coming in 2025 as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Nvidia shares are up about 27% since the company announced its split on May 22.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s partnership with OpenAI — in the works for months — was only briefly mentioned at a much-anticipated developer event Monday, with the iPhone maker’s homegrown technology getting most of the focus.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Investment Bank Moelis Probes Incident After Video of Employee Appearing to Punch Woman NYC Landlord to Sell Office Building at Roughly 67% Discount Musk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Macron Gambles on Snap French Election in Bid to Stop Le Pen\n\nApple’s keynote presentation at its Worldwide Developers Conference lasted more than an hour and 45 minutes, but only about two minutes were devoted to OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Apple is including the chatbot as part of a broad set of AI tools that it’s calling “Apple Intelligence.”\n\nMost of the event was devoted to Apple’s own software and features — including its new AI tools, which it presented as a friendlier, safer version of the technology. “This is AI for the rest of us,” Apple software chief Craig Federighi said during the presentation.\n\nChatGPT was mentioned late in the keynote, with Federighi announcing that the chatbot would be supported through Apple’s Siri voice assistant. If you need menu ideas for a meal you’re cooking, for example, Siri can determine if ChatGPT might be able to help, he said.\n\nUsers then get a prompt from Siri asking permission — “Do you want me to use ChatGPT to do that?” — before it proceeds to ChatGPT. It’s a sign that Apple plans to keep the technology separated from its own tools.\n\nUsers can also upload a photo to ChatGPT to ask for decorating advice, Federighi said. Again, Siri will ask for permission before doing so. Writing tools will be able to tap into the chatbot as well, he said. The service will be available for free, without requiring an account. The features are coming to iPhone, iPad and Mac software later this year.\n\nFederighi also said that other AI models will be coming in the future, confirming earlier Bloomberg reports. Apple has been in talks with Alphabet Inc.’s Google about adding that company’s Gemini chatbot, according to people familiar with the discussions.\n\nApple is treading carefully with AI. Chatbots like ChatGPT and Gemini have struggled at times to supply fully accurate information, and Apple is looking to focus more on less-risky tasks — such as assembling photo collections or helping set up dinner reservations.\n\nThough OpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman attended the keynote, he didn’t appear in the presentation. After the announcement, he posted on X that he was “very happy” to be partnering with Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Think you will really like it,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "content": "We recently published a list of 9 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire George Soros. Since Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks higher in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire George Soros has been one of the most active and divisive figures in the Wall Street. Often a right-wing target, the billionaire handed over the control of his $25 billion empire to his son Alexander Soros last year. The 93 year-old Hungarian American is known as the philosopher investor in the Wall Street, mainly due to his contributions to philosophy and his deep desire to leave his mark in the world of philosophy, which many believe he fulfilled thanks to his General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets.\n\nGeorge Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Since its inception through 2010, the fund posted on average a 20% annual rate of return. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this year said that Soros Fund Management has posted a compound annual return of 13.5% over the past three years through June 30, 2023.\n\nREAD NEXT: Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones’ Top Dividend Picks and Analysts Are Upgrading These AI Stocks\n\nGeorge Soros in his book The New Paradigm of Financial Markets wrote a chapter titled “Autobiography of a Failed Philosopher” in which he talked in detail about how many, including his son and his biographer, started accepting the idea that Soros was a failed philosopher.  Soros talks in detail about his childhood, his relationship with his father who at one point, according to Soros, lost all ambition in life and did not amass any wealth. A Jew by birth, Soros decided to come to the UK after the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros’ first interactions with philosophy started when he was impressed by the works of Karl Popper. But Soros’ dreams of creating a career in philosophy could not realize for several reasons, some of which he talks about in his book:\n\n“I would have preferred to stay within the safe walls of academe—I even had a teaching assistant job prospect at the University of Michigan in Kalamazoo, but my grades were not good enough, and I was forced to go out into the real world. After several false starts, I ended up working as an arbitrage trader, first in London and then in New York.* At first I had to forget everything I had learned as a student in order to hold down my job, but eventually my college education came in very useful. In particular, I could apply my theory of reflexivity to establish a disequilibrium scenario or boom-bust pattern for financial markets. The rewarding part came when markets entered what I called far-from-equilibrium territory because that is when the generally accepted equilibrium models broke down.”\n\nStory continues\n\nFor this article we scanned Billionaire Soros’s Soros Fund Management’s Q1 portfolio and chose its top 9 stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) Billionaire George Soros's Best Stock Pick in 2024?\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nBillionaire George Soros’s Q1’2024 Stake Value: $224,976,107\n\nBillionaire George Soros increased his hold in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) by 23% in the first quarter, ending the quarter with a $225 million stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG). Analysts are deeply divided over Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), as some believe the AI revolution is a threat to Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) dominance in the search market, which is its bread and butter as it accounts for over 90% of Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) total revenue. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrate with other Google apps. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) app is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag.  Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) saw advertising revenue accelerate in Q1 2024, boosted by YouTube in particular growing by almost 21% last quarter. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the past five years on a per annum basis.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 1st in Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire George Soros's 10 Best Stock Picks in 2024.You can visit 9 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire George Soros to see other stock picks of Billionaire George Soros.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple debuts Apple Intelligence AI platform for iPhone, Mac",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) announced its long-awaited generative AI initiative called Apple Intelligence during its WWDC conference in Cupertino, Calif., on Monday. The technology, Apple's first step into generative AI, will be deeply integrated across the company's hardware and software products ranging from the iPhone and Mac to Mail, Messages, and Photos.\n\nApple is positioning Apple Intelligence as a unique offering that can understand you and your data, rather than a broad-based AI system like ChatGPT or Google's AI Overview.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer later this fall.\n\nThe biggest changes are coming to Apple's Siri. The original smartphone voice assistant, Siri has been in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint for years, and Apple Intelligence will offer just that. The company says the assistant will feature a new look, feel more natural, and be more responsive.\n\nLike other generative AI-powered assistants, you'll be able to ask follow-up questions and interrupt yourself while making requests. Siri can now respond to requests via typed text if you don't feel like making them out loud. You'll also be able to ask Siri to use ChatGPT, rather than Apple's own models to make requests.\n\nApple says its updated version of Siri is more context-aware of Apple products, allowing you to ask questions about how different features and settings work and get accurate responses. Onscreen awareness will let Siri understand and take action about things on your screen. So, if a friend sends an address in Messages, you can have Siri save it for you. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Monday, June 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple is specifically pushing Siri's ability to understand users' own data. For instance, you'll be able to ask questions like \"Show me photos of Stacy in New York wearing a pink coat,\" and the assistant will provide you with the exact photo you're looking for from your Photos app. You can then tell Siri to move the photo to another app, such as an email in Mail. These requests will also work across third-party apps.\n\nIf you need to pick up someone at the airport, you can ask Siri when the person lands, and it will find the flight information the person previously shared with you in Mail and check real-time flight tracking data to determine when you should hit the road.\n\nBeyond Siri, your devices can now prioritize your notifications to bring up the most important notes and minimize less relevant ones. Writing tools can rewrite, write, or summarize information for you, automatically available across Notes, Mail, and a host of third-party apps. You'll be able to create generative AI images of people, places, and animals across your apps in three different styles.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple says many of its generative AI models will run on-device, though some will need to access the cloud. But because Apple has traditionally eschewed forcing people to use cloud-based services when it comes to their private data, the company says it has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute.\n\nPrivate Cloud Compute servers are specially created using Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities. When you make a request, Apple Intelligence determines if it can complete it using on-device processing or if it needs to connect to the cloud. Apple, however, says it won't store any of your information used to complete Apple Intelligence requests in the cloud.\n\nWall Street has been anxiously waiting for Apple to debut its generative capabilities ever since Microsoft (MSFT) announced its OpenAI-powered Bing chatbot, now called Copilot, in 2023. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) quickly followed Microsoft's lead with its Bard chatbot, which it subsequently renamed Gemini. Social media giant Meta (META) has also incorporated AI into its platform offerings via behind-the-scenes recommendation software and its Meta AI chatbot.\n\nBut the companies have struggled with their AI rollouts as well. Google's Bard famously debuted with an advertisement showing the incorrect answer to a prompt and its Gemini image generator app showed historically inaccurate images of individuals from different time periods. More recently, its big AI Overview rollout, a major initiative meant to transform its all-important Search platform, drew jeers after it generated results telling people it was safe to eat rocks and add glue to their pizza.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, debuted its Copilot+PC standard for laptops and desktops ahead of its Build conference, as well as its new Recall app for Windows 11. The software is meant to take a screenshot of virtually everything you use on your computer to help you pull up apps and information you've previously used. But the app was blasted as a potential security nightmare, forcing Microsoft to update the software before releasing it to the public, make it opt-in rather than on by default, and enhance its security.\n\nMeta, for its part, faced heavy criticism for not allowing consumers to turn off the Meta AI chatbot in the company's apps.\n\nThose hiccups haven't exactly slowed the companies down, but Apple is a different beast altogether. The iPhone maker has built up a reputation for itself based on security and software that, largely, works out of the box. If its generative AI efforts suffer from similar flaws as Google and Microsoft's, it could have a negative impact on the brand's reputation.\n\nMoreover, a flub by Apple could hurt generative AI's image more broadly. After all, if three of the world's biggest tech companies can't roll out a new kind of software without major problems, then can users really trust generative AI?\n\nApple still has time to work on its Apple Intelligence offering before it hits users' devices sometime this September.

        "title": "If EPS Growth Is Important To You, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Presents An Opportunity",
        "content": "The excitement of investing in a company that can reverse its fortunes is a big draw for some speculators, so even companies that have no revenue, no profit, and a record of falling short, can manage to find investors. But the reality is that when a company loses money each year, for long enough, its investors will usually take their share of those losses. Loss-making companies are always racing against time to reach financial sustainability, so investors in these companies may be taking on more risk than they should.\n\nDespite being in the age of tech-stock blue-sky investing, many investors still adopt a more traditional strategy; buying shares in profitable companies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). While this doesn't necessarily speak to whether it's undervalued, the profitability of the business is enough to warrant some appreciation - especially if its growing.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Fast Is Alphabet Growing?\n\nThe market is a voting machine in the short term, but a weighing machine in the long term, so you'd expect share price to follow earnings per share (EPS) outcomes eventually. So it makes sense that experienced investors pay close attention to company EPS when undertaking investment research. Shareholders will be happy to know that Alphabet's EPS has grown 21% each year, compound, over three years. As a general rule, we'd say that if a company can keep up that sort of growth, shareholders will be beaming.\n\nCareful consideration of revenue growth and earnings before interest and taxation (EBIT) margins can help inform a view on the sustainability of the recent profit growth. The good news is that Alphabet is growing revenues, and EBIT margins improved by 5.1 percentage points to 30%, over the last year. Ticking those two boxes is a good sign of growth, in our book.\n\nIn the chart below, you can see how the company has grown earnings and revenue, over time. Click on the chart to see the exact numbers. earnings-and-revenue-history\n\nOf course the knack is to find stocks that have their best days in the future, not in the past. You could base your opinion on past performance, of course, but you may also want to check this interactive graph of professional analyst EPS forecasts for Alphabet.\n\nAre Alphabet Insiders Aligned With All Shareholders?\n\nWe would not expect to see insiders owning a large percentage of a US$2.2t company like Alphabet. But we are reassured by the fact they have invested in the company. Notably, they have an enviable stake in the company, worth US$224b. Investors will appreciate management having this amount of skin in the game as it shows their commitment to the company's future.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's good to see that insiders are invested in the company, but are remuneration levels reasonable? Well, based on the CEO pay, you'd argue that they are indeed. For companies with market capitalisations over US$8.0b, like Alphabet, the median CEO pay is around US$14m.\n\nAlphabet's CEO took home a total compensation package worth US$8.8m in the year leading up to December 2023. That is actually below the median for CEO's of similarly sized companies. CEO remuneration levels are not the most important metric for investors, but when the pay is modest, that does support enhanced alignment between the CEO and the ordinary shareholders. Generally, arguments can be made that reasonable pay levels attest to good decision-making.\n\nShould You Add Alphabet To Your Watchlist?\n\nYou can't deny that Alphabet has grown its earnings per share at a very impressive rate. That's attractive. If you still have your doubts, remember too that company insiders have a considerable investment aligning themselves with the shareholders and CEO pay is quite modest compared to similarly sized companiess. The overarching message here is that Alphabet has underlying strengths that make it worth a look at. Once you've identified a business you like, the next step is to consider what you think it's worth. And right now is your chance to view our exclusive discounted cashflow valuation of Alphabet. You might benefit from giving it a glance today.\n\nWhile opting for stocks without growing earnings and absent insider buying can yield results, for investors valuing these key metrics, here is a carefully selected list of companies in the US with promising growth potential and insider confidence.\n\nPlease note the insider transactions discussed in this article refer to reportable transactions in the relevant jurisdiction.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "content": "It seems every investor today is talking about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Over the last five years, shares have risen in value by 3,400%. Over the past 12 months alone, the stock tripled in price.\n\nThis sudden rise has everything to do with artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's chips are widely accepted as the best on the market for this technology. There's a good chance the AI future will be powered by the company's products.\n\nBut it isn't the only AI company attracting huge interest. Billionaire investors are pouring huge sums of cash into other AI businesses. The two companies below look especially promising.\n\nEven Nvidia's CEO loves this emerging AI stock\n\nJensen Huang, CEO of Nvidia, has most of his $100 billion fortune tied up in the company's stock. But he has put money to work in several other AI businesses. That's because Nvidia itself has put money into smaller AI start-ups at his direction.\n\nOne of those companies is SoundHound AI(NASDAQ: SOUN), a $1.6 billion business with huge potential.\n\nInvestors learned about Nvidia's investment in SoundHound from a 13F disclosure that Nvidia filed earlier this year. It was a relatively small investment -- only a few million dollars -- but that didn't stop shares from tripling in value from the news.\n\nSoundHound's stock price has pulled back a bit since, and there's a lot to love about the investment thesis from here. That's especially true given that another billionaire, the value investor Seth Klarman, recently revealed he owns 1.1 million shares in SoundHound.\n\nThe company is focused on the auditory side of AI. As Fool contributor Joe Tenebruso explains it: \"Conversational AI is cutting-edge technology that enables machines to understand and respond when humans speak. SoundHound offers some of the best voice AI available at a time when businesses are racing to adopt this innovative tech.\"\n\nThis is a competitive space, with Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon developing their own voice AI systems. But SoundHound doesn't tie customers to these closed ecosystems, something customers like Hyundai, Oracle, and White Castle apparently appreciate.\n\nTrading at 23 times sales, SoundHound isn't cheap from a conventional standpoint. But with analysts anticipating a 53% jump in sales this year, that premium valuation could prove a bargain years down the road.\n\nAnd the next AI stock being targeted by billionaire investors arguably has drawn even more interest. SOUN Total Return Level Chart\n\nWill Alphabet become an AI powerhouse?\n\nA recent Motley Fool analysis of 16 prominent billionaire investors found that Alphabet, the parent of Google, was one of the most popular picks, regardless of industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe long-term viability of Google's search business -- the primary contributor to revenue and profits -- could be threatened given AI's potential. Why google something and manually search for the answer when AI can get you the answer directly in far less time?\n\nRight now, there are limitations to AI's ability to replicate Google's effectiveness at sorting through the vast amount of information stored on the web. It could take many years for AI to supplant the usefulness of Google's platform.\n\nIn the meantime, the company can invest huge sums of money (more than nearly any of its competitors) in not only augmenting its current offerings with AI, but also building new tools that could ultimately become its main source of profit in the decades to come.\n\nOne of Google's biggest advantages is its access to proprietary data accumulated from its search engine and from other Alphabet properties like YouTube and Google Maps. AI models need to be trained on data to function, and there's currently a battle over how platforms like OpenAI trained their systems. TheNew York Times Company, for example, is suing OpenAI for effectively stealing its copyrighted material.\n\nWhether Google is able to transition to an AI-powered future remains to be seen. But that hasn't stopped billionaire investors from piling into the company.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia begins trading Monday after 10-for-1 stock split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock from its Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat's sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform called Blackwell Ultra is coming in 2025, as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "For the last six decades, Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) CEO Warren Buffett has been dazzling Wall Street with his investing prowess. Whereas the benchmark S&P 500 has delivered a respectable gain, including dividends, of a little over 35,000% since Buffett took over as CEO, the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" has overseen an aggregate return in his company's Class A shares (BRK.A) of almost 5,000,000%!\n\nWhen you're absolutely crushing Wall Street's widely followed stock indexes, you're bound to draw a lot of attention.

While the purpose of this transaction was for Berkshire to get its hands on General Re's reinsurance operations, it also owned a specialty investment company at the time: New England Asset Management (NEAM). When Berkshire completed the buyout of General Re, it became the new parent of NEAM.\n\nAlthough most professional and everyday investors are rightly focused on the 44-stock, $379 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees for Berkshire Hathaway, there's a 90-security, $646 million portfolio overseen by New England Asset Management, as well. The stocks NEAM holds are, ultimately, part of Berkshire Hathaway, which is what makes this Buffett's \"secret\" portfolio.\n\nWhile most of the securities contained in this $646 million secret portfolio are exchange-traded funds (ETFs) or time-tested businesses, you might be surprised to learn that there are also holdings with very clear artificial intelligence (AI) ties. AI involves the use of software and systems in place of humans, and allows for these systems to learn and evolve over time without human intervention.\n\nSay hello to the three artificial intelligence stocks Warren Buffett \"secretly\" owns in this $646 million portfolio.\n\nAlphabet\n\nThe first AI stock you'll find in the Oracle of Omaha's hidden portfolio is none other than \"Magnificent Seven\" member Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Alphabet is the parent of internet search engine Google, streaming site YouTube, autonomous driving company Waymo, and cloud infrastructure service platform Google Cloud. New England Asset Management held 10,500 Class A shares (GOOGL) of Alphabet, as of the end of March.\n\nStory continues\n\nVirtually all aspects of Alphabet's operating segments utilize AI. However, the most-profitable application is likely to be the use of generative AI solutions for Google Cloud. Subscribers can lean on these solutions to personalize their marketing efforts, as well as summarize large documents and deploy virtual chat agents.\n\nThe foundation to Alphabet's success continues to be its ad-driven operating segments. Google has tallied at least a 90% monthly share of worldwide search for the last nine years. This makes it the logical go-to for businesses looking to target consumers with their message(s).\n\nLikewise, YouTube is the second most-visited social site on the planet, with around 2.5 billion monthly active users. More eyeballs will make it progressively easier for YouTube to command stronger ad-pricing power.\n\nHowever, the future for Alphabet rests heavily on the success of Google Cloud, which is the global No. 3 cloud infrastructure service provider. Google Cloud enjoyed its first year of profitability in 2023, and should deliver rapid growth in operating cash flow as AI fuels revenue expansion.\n\nBroadcom\n\nA second artificial intelligence stock you'll find in Warren Buffett's secret portfolio is Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). As of the end of March, NEAM held 3,970 shares of this semiconductor behemoth, worth close to $5.3 million.\n\nThe reason Broadcom's stock has surged by 153% since the start of 2023 is almost entirely because of its role in the AI revolution. In April 2023, it unveiled its Jericho3-AI chip, which can connect up to 32,000 high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs). Jericho3 is designed to minimize tail latency and help facilitate the split-second processing needed for training large language models and operating generative AI solutions in high-compute data centers.\n\nBeyond AI, a significant percentage of Broadcom's sales and profits come from selling wireless chips and other accessories used in next-generation smartphones. When wireless carriers upgraded their networks to support 5G speeds, it rolled out the red carpet for consumers and businesses to upgrade their wireless devices. This ongoing replacement cycle has fueled demand for Broadcom's smartphone solutions.\n\nFurthermore, Broadcom has continued to expand its reach beyond data centers and smartphones. It offers automotive solutions, which includes advanced driver assistance systems, as well as a variety of enterprise security offerings.\n\nBroadcom's sizable backlog leads to predictable operating cash flow year after year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMicrosoft\n\nThe third artificial intelligence stock Warren Buffett secretly owns via New England Asset Management is Wall Street's largest public company (at the time of this writing), Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). NEAM closed out March with 13,210 shares of Microsoft, which was worth close to $5.6 million.\n\nAI represents an essential footprint of Microsoft's future growth plans. It's made multiple investments in OpenAI, the company behind the ultra-popular chatbot, ChatGPT. Further, Microsoft is developing its own Ai chips: the Azure Maia 100. These AI chips will be deployed in Microsoft's AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nWhat's made Microsoft such a money machine for so long has been its ability to reap the rewards of its legacy segments while reinvesting its operating cash flow for the future. For example, even though Windows and Office aren't the growth stories they once were, they still generate exceptionally high margins and boatloads of cash flow that Microsoft can reinvest in faster-growing aspects of its business.\n\nAside from specifically investing in AI, Microsoft has devoted a lot of capital to building out its cloud-based services. Azure was the global No. 2 in cloud infrastructure service spending, as of the end of 2023, per tech-analysis firm Canalys. Constant-currency sales growth for Azure has consistently hovered around 30%!\n\nLastly, Microsoft (like Alphabet) is sitting on an absolute mountain of cash. It ended March with $80 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments, and has generated a cool $110 billion in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Microsoft's balance sheet and cash flow gives it the luxury to aggressively invest in new innovations, as well as make acquisitions to further its efforts.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple to catch up on AI at WWDC ’24 (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple shares were flat in pre-market trading, with the iPhone maker failing to spark interest from investors following reports that it is expected to enter artificial intelligence race with ambitions to overtake the early leaders.\n\nHowever, the stock price might surge later as Apple's annual World Wide Developers Conference kicks off on Monday night.\n\nApple is expected to unveil a wide range of new generative artificial intelligence tools as it looks to rival Google (GOOG) and Microsoft (MSFT) in embracing the emerging technology.\n\nExperts are predicting Apple’s AI plans to come in several layers. Firstly, that broad AI-powered updates will be made across core apps to help with basic, everyday tasks, for example new AI editing tools to help with photos and videos, better predictive text for messages and emails or quick, AI-generated summaries of webpages or longer emails.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks down and euro lower after France calls snap election\n\nIn addition to this, there are reports that Apple will use the event to announce a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which will see the chatbot and virtual assistant integrated directly into Apple’s software across iPhone, iPad and Mac, to help with more detailed, complex tasks.\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia was the number one trending ticker in pre-market trading as the company will start trading later on Monday under a split.\n\nThe split will lower Nvidia's stock price, which in theory makes Nvidia stock ownership more accessible to a wider range of investors and boost demand.\n\nThe company will pay out a one cent per share dividend based on post-split holdings on June 28. Shareholders must have shares after market close on June 11 to receive the dividend.\n\nThe chip giant’s 10-for-1 stock split follows significant price growth, with shares up 212% in the past year.\n\n“A stock split is a vote of confidence from management that the stock will hold its value, as the stock [price] typically increases,” S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpotify (SPOT)\n\nShares in the audio streaming company were lower ahead of the US market opening as it hiked prices yet again.\n\nStarting in July, Spotify’s US customers will see a $1 monthly increase for its ad-free premium plan, which will now cost $11.99 per month. This marks a 20% increase over the last two years. Spotify explained that the price hike is necessary to “continue to invest in and innovate on our product features and bring users the best experience.”\n\nThere has been no announcements regarding prices hikes in the UK or Europe but the last time the streaming giant increased prices, other markets followed suit.\n\nRead more: Best UK savings accounts offering above inflation rates\n\nOther subscription tiers will also see price increases. The Duo plan, which allows two users to share a premium subscription, will rise by $2 to $16.99 per month. The family plan, which supports up to six users, will go up by $3 to $19.99 per month.\n\nHowever, Wall Street bulls continue to praise the company's outlook, with the stock up about 70% since the start of the year.\n\nAshtead (AHT.L)\n\nThe FTSE 100 equipment hire giant in the early stages of exploring a switch of its listing from London to Wall Street, according to The Sunday Telegraph.\n\nThe company has reportedly asked City advisers to review the potential merits of the move.\n\nBoard members at the FTSE 100 group are concerned that the company, which operates largely in the United States, is trading a \"significant\" valuation gap to that of its US rivals.\n\n\"Ashtead is essentially a US business operationally, with over 90% of its revenue and over 95% of its operating profits being generated in North America,\" Lucinda Riches, a non-executive director at Ashtead said.\n\nAshtead's departure would come as another blow for London after the loss of the likes of Cambridge-based chip firm Arm Holdings to the US.\n\nWatch: CEO’s top tip for young investors: Do the math</p>\\n<p>She shared these insights with Yahoo Finance’s <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/jared-blikre/\\\">Jared Blikre</a> and Sydnee Fried on \\\"<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/series/stocks-in-translation/\\\">Stocks in Translation</a>.\\\" Listen to the full episode <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://open.spotify.com/episode/22oERAB8j231MYLy53eojp\\\">here</a>, or wherever you get your podcasts.<br><br><em>This post was written by Jimi Corpuz</em>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/8_431sHCYeyo5e19sO_mNw--~B/aD0zNzg0O3c9NjcyMDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/112bd450-24cf-11ef-b45d-db7ad125aa3f\",\"duration\":\"PT1M25S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/84813d84-e8e0-32c8-8381-c9504462d023.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/ceo-top-tip-young-investors-130938013.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"84813d84-e8e0-32c8-8381-c9504462d023\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "How Nvidia Could Help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft Stocks Soar Even More",
        "content": "It's been a great time to own shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). All three stocks delivered strong gains last year and are up by double-digit percentages so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's been a spectacular time to own shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023 and has vaulted more than 140% higher year to date.\n\nYou've probably heard the adage that \"success begets success.\" I think we'll see this proved in a convincing manner, with one company's success translating to success for others. Here's how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks soar even more.\n\nCloud power\n\nTo understand how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, we first need to know something important about the three companies. Their cloud units are key growth drivers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped 28.4% year over year. This business generated nearly 20% of the company's total revenue growth despite making up less than 12% of total revenue.\n\nIt was a similar story for Amazon. Revenue for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, almost 39% of total revenue growth. AWS was an even bigger driver of Amazon's earnings growth.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Its cloud business delivered revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter (which ended March 31) of 23% -- roughly 73% of total revenue growth.\n\nHow Nvidia is driving migration to the cloud\n\nAnything that drives more customers to the cloud will directly help sales and earnings growth for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. And over the long term, that should translate to increasing stock prices for each company.\n\nThis is where Nvidia comes into the picture. Its technology is helping all three giant cloud service providers to attract more customers and more business from existing customers.\n\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress explained how the company is helping cloud service providers grow in its first-quarter earnings call. She said that organizations that use Nvidia's GPUs are able to train their large language models (LLMs) more quickly and more cost-effectively than with other chips. They can also deploy those models at the lowest cost with Nvidia's GPUs, Kress said.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft enjoy exceptional returns on investment when they use Nvidia's AI technology. Kress said that cloud providers can earn $5 in hosting revenue with Nvidia's GPUs over four years for every $1 invested in the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese big cloud service providers also have ample motivation to adopt new technology introduced by Nvidia. In his company's first-quarter call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of organizations being able to train AI models quickly.\n\nFor example, the company's forthcoming Blackwell GPU architecture enables training that is four times faster than with its wildly popular H100 GPUs. The new platform supports 30 times faster AI inference. It's not surprising that Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the early buyers of Blackwell -- even before it ships later this year.\n\nA symbiotic relationship\n\nHaven't Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft developed their own AI chips? Could Nvidia's top customers become its rivals over time? Yes and yes.\n\nHuang was asked about this by an analyst in the first-quarter call. He responded by pointing out how Nvidia's technology differs from the custom chips the big cloud service providers offer. He believes that the scope, versatility, and low total cost of ownership of Nvidia's accelerated computing architecture; its pervasiveness across all types of computers, and the company's AI factories stand out as key competitive advantages.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its big cloud customers enjoy a symbiotic relationship. Nvidia's sales grow as it launches new and improved AI technology. Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's sales grow as they use Nvidia's latest products to attract customers. It's a win-win proposition for all four companies -- and their investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "For Immediate Releases\n\nChicago, IL – June 10, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL, Alphabet Inc. GOOGL and Micron Technology, Inc. MU.\n\nBuy These 4 High-Flying Tech Stocks That Can Rally Further\n\nMaking a remarkable rally in 2023, tech stocks have shown no signs of slowing this year. Improving earnings, along with the accelerating potential of artificial intelligence, seem to have subsided investors’ worries about challenges posed by macroeconomic headwinds, including still-high interest rates, protracted inflationary conditions and ongoing wars across several parts of the world.\n\nWith a year-to-date (YTD) rise of 14.4%, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite has outperformed The Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 index’s increase of 3.2% and 12.2%, respectively. Technology stocks have more than 50% of weightage in the Nasdaq Composite index. Technology Select Sector SPDR, the most important component of the broad market index, has returned 11.8% YTD.\n\nConsidering tech stocks’ resilience amid current macroeconomic uncertainties, it is wise to invest in the sector. However, investors should be careful in selecting stocks and look for fundamentally strong technology stocks that have sustained the market jitters so far and have the potential to carry the momentum further.\n\nHere, the Zacks Stock Screener comes in handy. With the help of this Zacks tool, we have narrowed our search to four tech companies — NVIDIA Corp. , Dell Technologies Inc., Alphabet Inc. and Micron Technology, Inc.— that have outpaced the gains of broader market indexes. Year to date, NVDA, DELL, GOOGL and MU stocks have surged 143.7%, 75.2%, 26.6% and 52.7%, respectively.\n\nMoreover, these stocks have a favorable combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or #2 (Buy). The Growth Style Score condenses all the essential metrics from a company’s financial statements to get a true sense of the quality and sustainability of its growth. Additionally, per Zacks’ proprietary methodology, stocks with a combination of a Zacks Rank #1 or #2 and a Growth Score of A or B offer solid investment opportunities.\n\nOur Picks\n\nNVIDIA is the worldwide leader in visual computing technologies and the inventor of the graphic processing unit or GPU. Over the years, the company’s focus has evolved from PC graphics to AI-based solutions that now support high-performance computing (HPC), gaming and virtual reality (VR) platforms. The stock currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is gaining from the strong growth of AI, HPC and accelerated computing, which is boosting its Compute & Networking revenues. Its data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using GPUs based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures.\n\nA surge in Hyperscale demand and a solid uptake of AI-based smart cockpit infotainment solutions are acting as tailwinds for NVDA. The collaboration with several automobile companies is likely to advance NVIDIA’s presence in the autonomous vehicle and other automotive electronic space.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 11.6% in the past 30 days to $26.84 per share, which calls for an increase of 107.1% on a year-over-year basis. The long-term expected earnings growth rate for the stock is pegged at 36.7%.\n\nNVIDIA Corporation price-consensus-chart | NVIDIA Corporation Quote\n\nDell Technologies is benefiting from the strong demand for AI servers driven by ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. Its PowerEdge XE9680L AI-optimized server is very much in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding Dell Technologies.\n\nIt is witnessing demand from a diversified customer base that includes the likes of higher education institutions, financial services, health care and life services and manufacturing. An expanding partner base that includes the likes of NVIDIA, Microsoft, Meta Platforms and Imbue has been a major growth driver. Dell Technologies’ shareholder-friendly approach makes it an attractive investment.\n\nDell is a prominent PC maker and is expected to benefit from recovering demand driven by the PC-refresh cycle. It has earlier noted that 300 million PCs will turn four years old next year, most of which are notebooks. The increasing adoption of remote working is expected to benefit the PC refresh cycle. AI-enabled architectures from Intel and Advanced Micro Devices, as well as Windows on Arm, are expected to help drive demand in calendar years 2024 and 2025. This bodes well for Dell Technologies’ Client Solutions Group segment, which contributed 55% to fiscal 2024 total revenues.\n\nDELL sports a Zacks Rank #1 and has a Growth Score of A. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2025 earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $7.82 per share in the past seven days, which suggests a 9.7% year-over-year increase. The long-term earnings growth expectation for the company is 11.8%.\n\nDell Technologies Inc. price-consensus-chart | Dell Technologies Inc. Quote\n\nAlphabet’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers, cloud regions and availability zones will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space. Major search updates and the removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on the company’s search engine.\n\nGrowing momentum across Google’s mobile search is contributing further. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Deepening focus on the wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings has been revised upward by 3 cents to $7.60 per share in the past 30 days, which suggests year-over-year growth of 31%. This Zacks Rank #1 stock has a Growth Score of B and has an estimated long-term earnings growth rate of 17.5%.\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nMicron has been on a recovery path from the financial difficulties experienced in late 2022 and early 2023. This improvement is evident from the company's financial results in the last few quarters. Micron is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units. The positive impact of inventory improvement in the data center, as well as stabilization in other markets, such as automotive, industrial and others, is contributing to top-line growth.\n\nMicron anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase next year, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply. Also, 5G adoption in the Internet of Things devices and wireless infrastructure is likely to spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nCurrently, Micron carries a Zacks Rank #2 and has a Growth Score of B. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 earnings has moved 5 cents north in 30 days to 85 cents per share, which indicates a robust improvement from fiscal 2023’s loss of $4.45 per share.

        "title": "Apple WWDC Event Will Show Whether It Can Be a Force in AI Industry",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s developers conference on Monday will show whether the iPhone maker can become a major player in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, marking a critical moment for a company forced to adapt to a new era.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Macron and Scholz Get Trounced by Far Right in EU Elections Putin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine Scholz’s SPD Suffers Record Rout in Germany’s EU Vote There’s Still a Way to Snag a 3% Mortgage Rate\n\nThough Apple was an early pioneer in AI, which it has used in photo processing, health features and the Siri digital assistant, it’s now seen as a laggard — especially since ChatGPT and other cutting-edge technology hit the scene in the past two years.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Apple promises to demonstrate its AI prowess during a keynote address at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which starts at 10 a.m. California time. The company will lay out a suite of features that it calls Apple Intelligence, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nWhile Apple launched Siri in 2011, its voice technology was quickly overtaken by Alexa from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Assistant. AI took another leap with OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the end of 2022 and rival services from Google, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and others during 2023.\n\nAdding to the pressure: Samsung Electronics Co. — Apple’s biggest smartphone rival — integrated Google AI features into its devices earlier this year.\n\nThe shift to artificial intelligence promises to be a big opportunity for Apple if it can hone its technology and catch up with rivals. AI-based operating systems will change how people gather information, create and edit content, and navigate their devices.\n\nAt the event, Apple will show how it’s weaving AI features into its next software updates: iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15. The company is also planning a more powerful version of Siri.\n\nApple Intelligence will focus on providing more information to users when they need it. That involves summarizing notifications, text messages and emails; synthesizing meeting notes; transcribing voice memos; and even creating custom emojis. The software also will be able to sort through emails and classify them into categories.\n\nApple also has been working on its own large language models — the technology behind ChatGPT-style services — but it’s not far enough along in that area, people familiar with the matter have said. So it’s planning to announce a partnership with OpenAI that will supply Apple with a chatbot.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has one major advantage as it pushes deeper into AI: a massive number of loyal consumers. That could help make the company a success in AI even without breaking ground in large language models, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.\n\n“It has a very powerful consumer installed base for which it can act as a channel — just like it has for search and the App Store, the two most lucrative parts of Apple’s business today, outside of iPhone,” he said.\n\nOne concern is whether the OpenAI deal means that fewer users will be using Google search on the iPhone. Apple generates billions of dollars per year through a revenue sharing agreement with Google. The terms of Apple’s deal with OpenAI, meanwhile, aren’t clear. And Apple is still negotiating a separate agreement with Google to eventually also add its Gemini technology as a chatbot option on the iPhone, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIt’s likely that Apple will eventually want to offer its own chatbots and other generative AI, but having partners helps it navigate the artificial intelligence industry without taking on as many risks. OpenAI and Google have suffered some backlash from chatbots providing incorrect information.\n\nApple wants to avoid that, said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a former director of AI research at the iPhone maker and a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n“They’ve always watched what the space is like and have long decided they don’t have to be first, but they have to get it right,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "title": "Wall Street praises Spotify price hikes — and notes other audio streamers should follow suit",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) shares have surged as Wall Street bulls continue to praise the company's outlook on the heels of fresh price hikes for its premium US subscription plans. The stock is up about 70% since the start of the year.\n\nThe upcoming price hikes, which begin in July and are between $1 and $3, depending on the plan, follow previous hikes of certain plans implemented last summer. Analysts say the move could mean more increases for other music streamers — much to the chagrin of consumers.\n\n\"Given the size of these Spotify increases (9% to 18%) and the frequency (second time in less than a year), we believe other [streamers] should follow suit,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note published earlier this week. Still, competitors \"may not have the same pricing power as Spotify and may be more reluctant broadly.\"\n\nSpotify's family plan will rise to $19.99 per month from $16.99. Duo plans, which allow two users to share an account, will increase by $2 to $16.99. Spotify Premium subscriptions will now cost $11.99 a month, an increase of $1.\n\nSwinburne, who boasts a $370 price target and Overweight rating on shares, said the upcoming hikes \"are larger and earlier than forecasted.\" This suggests potential upside to average revenue per user and revenue growth in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We believe Spotify's strong engagement levels and industry low churn should allow it to execute these increases and still deliver on net adds expectations,\" he said.\n\nTo compare, Apple Music's (AAPL) individual plan costs $10.99 a month, while its family plan sits at $16.99. It's only raised prices once, in October 2022. Meanwhile, YouTube Music (GOOGL, GOOG) boasts the same costs for its respective plans, although it's also an included option for customers who subscribe to YouTube Premium, which carries a monthly cost of $13.99.\n\nSimilarly, Amazon Music (AMZN) is free with a $14.99 Prime membership but Prime members who want access to the Amazon Music Unlimited plan will have to pay an additional $9.99 a month. The individual plan costs $10.99 for non-Prime members, while the monthly family plan clocks in at $14.99.\n\nSpotify 'has pricing power'\n\nSpotify turned a profit in the first quarter and beat on most of its key metrics. It also guided to higher revenue and operating income for the current quarter.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to price increases in addition to multiple rounds of layoffs and other initiatives to improve profitability. The company said it would be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the company's first quarter earnings call in April, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek hinted at plans to raise prices again after last year's hikes \"had minimal impacts on growth.\" He also confirmed the platform will offer various subscription tiers to attract as many users as possible, including a music-only tier and an audiobook-only tier.\n\n\"The more value we create, the more ability we will have to then capture some of that value by price increases,\" Ek said at the time. The Spotify logo hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange with American and Swiss flags as the company lists its stock with a direct listing in New York, April 3, 2018. (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who reiterated his Overweight rating on shares and boosted his price target to $375 from $365, said he believes the price increases will result in \"favorable unit economics for Spotify.\"\n\n\"Spotify cited churn in-line with expectations & better than expected gross adds following 2023 price increases, suggesting the company has pricing power,\" Anmuth wrote on Monday. \"Spotify’s deep data & strong content curation, personalization, discovery, & ubiquity are best-in-class & hard to replicate, making it unappealing for consumers to switch platforms.\"\n\nAccording to market research firm Antenna, fewer than 1.5% of Spotify subscribers canceled their subscription plans in April. Its average churn rate has hovered around 2% since the start of the year.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect a more normalized cadence of price increases across the music streaming industry,\" Anmuth said. \"We believe that Spotify maintains longterm pricing power given the company’s reach (615M monthly active users, 239M Premium Subscribers), leading market share, & ability to improve & expand its product offering.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Believe it or not, but Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) pays dividends nowadays.\n\nOn the eve of the Google parent company's first-quarter earnings report, its board of directors also announced Alphabet's first-ever dividend payment. The new policy starts with a payout of $0.20 per share, issued on June 17 to holders of Class A (GOOGL voting shares), Class B (insiders only, 10 votes each), and Class C (GOOG shares without voting powers) shares.\n\nThe policy will continue on a quarterly schedule, and Alphabet seems likely to raise the payouts over time.\n\n\"We view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program,\" CFO Ruth Porat said on the earnings call.\n\nAlphabet's dividend by the numbers\n\nThe annual dividend yield works out to roughly 0.4% for now. With a total of 12.4 billion shares outstanding, the cash payouts work out to a substantial $9.9 billion in the first year. Moreover, Alphabet added $70 billion to its stock buybacks program. That's up from $62.2 billion of buybacks in 2023, culled from $69.5 billion of free cash flow.\n\nThe balance between dividend payouts and share buybacks will probably shift over time. Stock repurchasing tends to consume most of Alphabet's free cash flow, and the Google parent will need to make room for the dividend budget: GOOGL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nSo the company has added another financial mechanism to its tool belt, stuffing cash profits directly into shareholder wallets in a new way. It's a sign of experience and maturity. It was stunning when Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) took this step in 2003, followed by Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) return to quarterly payouts in 2012. Now, the two tech giants are commonly seen as robust income investments.\n\nAnd now it's Alphabet's turn to join this club of megacap tech titans with active dividend programs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The unceasing growth of Big Tech has been an article of faith for investors since the latest stock market rally began in October 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine There’s Still a Way to Snag a 3% Mortgage Rate Russia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Philippines Rejects ‘Absurd’ Beijing Demand Over South China Sea Saudis Said to Hand About 60% of Aramco Offer to Foreigners\n\nBut with an uninspiring earnings outlook for the rest of 2024, other corners of the market will likely be needed if share prices are to keep soaring.\n\n“To have a similar return for the market in the second half, you’d need to see broader participation,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.\n\nThat looks like it may happen. While Big Tech’s profit growth is expected to slow dramatically from here, industries like materials and health care are expected to see roughly 25% profit growth by the fourth quarter after posting contractions of 20% or more in the first quarter.\n\n“I think those sectors are starting to look pretty interesting, and I’m talking about energy, materials, consumer discretionary, industrials, financials,” said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America. “I think all those cyclical sectors are going to do better in the second half of the year.”\n\nThat rotation already appears to be underway. At BofA, clients pulled almost $2.2 billion from tech stocks during the week ended May 31, the second-most in the bank’s data going back to 2008. The biggest client inflows went to the consumer discretionary sector, which is up 1.9% this year, making it the second worst performer in the S&P 500.\n\n“Discretionary is traditionally a huge driver of S&P 500 earnings and a place that typically picks up the slack,” said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nCan’t Quit Tech\n\nNone of this is to say investors will, or should, give up on Big Tech. The S&P 500 is up 12% this year, and its five biggest stocks — Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. — are responsible for more than half of that gain with markets captivated by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIn the process, those five companies have added a combined $2.9 trillion in market value in 2024. That’s helped make information technology by far the biggest sector in the S&P 500, with a 31% weighting. The next closest groups are financials and health care at around 12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, it’s not like technology companies are done growing. It’s just that the pace of their profit expansion is slowing. After three consecutive quarters of more than 44% earnings growth, the S&P’s five biggest companies are expected to see that figure fall to 29% in the second quarter before settling into the teens in the second half of the year, according to data compiled by BI.\n\n“We still think Big Tech will likely outperform, but at a more moderate level,” Lerner said. “Investors will continue to stick with these companies, which are high quality, have strong cash flow, a lot of cash on the balance sheet.”\n\nIn many ways, the companies are suffering from their past success, as their strong 2023 results make for challenging comparisons to 2024. But the businesses are still increasing profits and generating healthy margins after aggressive cost-cutting efforts.\n\n‘Lofty Expectations’\n\n“The onus is on Big Tech to live up to lofty expectations,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. “Or else the stock market will be forced to recalibrate and sell off, particularly if profit growth from other sectors doesn’t improve from here.”\n\nPart of the challenge for tech investors is the stocks are already quite expensive. Nvidia is priced at 40 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with 21 times for the S&P 500. Microsoft is at 33 times, and Apple is at 29 times. Even Alphabet, which is relatively cheaper at 21 times, is trading above its average over the past 10 years.\n\n“As those non-tech sectors start to grow earnings, the premium that investors were paying for tech should come down on a relative basis compared to other sectors,” BofA’s Kwon said.\n\nThere’s also an emerging asymmetry in the directions of Big Tech stocks as the companies’ earnings outlooks diverge.\n\nWith investors focused on AI, Nvidia has soared ahead of the pack, climbing 144% this year and continuing as the best performer in the S&P 500. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms has added 39%, while Google-parent Alphabet has climbed 25% and Amazon has gained 21%. Microsoft, on the other hand, hasn’t really kept up, posting a relatively meager 13% rise. And then there’s struggling Apple, which spent most of the year in the red and is up just 2.3% in 2024.\n\n“The fundamental business lines of each of these companies aren’t moving in the same direction anymore like during the recovery from the pandemic, so that’s also causing a profit cool down,” BI’s Casper said. “The Magnificent Seven stocks no longer move as one ubiquitous block, and that hurts its earnings potential as a cohort because the trade has now broken up.”\n\nPicking Sectors\n\nCounting on a lift from the rest of the market carries its own risks, however. For example, health care margins are shaky despite the enthusiasm for anti-obesity drugs because the group is still grappling with charges from big drug companies. Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary sector’s earnings growth is being driven by just a handful of companies, like Amazon and home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc.\n\nThat means more sectors beyond those will need to post profit growth, particularly consumer discretionary and those closely tied to the health of the economy: industrials and financials, Casper said. However there are risks embedded in each of these groups.\n\n“Consensus earnings forecasts are pretty poor for most retailers not named Amazon,” he said. “Financials and industrials may pick up their pace, though regional banks still face a hangover from (the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank).”\n\nIn the end, the stock market’s success in 2024 still may come down to Big Tech, directly or indirectly. With AI expected to have a transformational impact on so many industries, technological development will likely spill over into other parts of the economy, lifting those shares along the way.\n\n“As long as Big Tech companies continue to deliver on their profit outlooks, that bodes well for the economy,” 50 Park’s Sarhan said. “Which will help power the stock rally further because there are other industries outside of technology that will benefit from AI.”\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Billionaire investor activity tends to gain the attention of individual investors. When it comes to the investment moves of Warren Buffett and others, many investors comb through billionaires' quarterly 13-F filings to the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), looking for investment ideas and possible insights.\n\nAdmittedly, billionaires often make such decisions for reasons that would not help or interest the average investor. However, some of their investments indeed hold growth potential, and three Motley Fool contributors believe Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), Uber Technologies(NYSE: UBER), and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ: TXN) could serve their shareholders well.\n\nBridgewater founder Ray Dalio is loading up on shares of Alphabet\n\nJake Lerch (Alphabet): It's true: Billionaires love tech stocks. And among their favorites is Alphabet. Indeed, according to Motley Fool Research, Alphabet (along with fellow digital advertising giant MetaPlatforms) tops the list as the most-owned tech stock at the end of 2023 among hedge funds run by billionaires.\n\nIn particular, Bridgewater Associates, founded by billionaire Ray Dalio, owned over $285 million of Alphabet shares at the end of 2023, making the company Bridgewater's largest holding. However, Bridgewater has added even more shares of Alphabet this year. As of the fund's latest filing in mid-May, Bridgewater now owns 5,368,853 shares, or roughly $951 million in Alphabet stock.\n\nSo, why is Bridgewater loading up on shares of Alphabet? The answer is simple: Dalio thinks Alphabet shares are cheap. In fact, he said as much in a report issued earlier this year to investors.\n\nSpecifically, Dalio highlighted that Alphabet's stock is more affordable than several other stocks in the \"Magnificent Seven\" category -- which is true. When considering a simple trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple, Alphabet emerges as the most reasonably priced stock among the Magnificent Seven. GOOG PE Ratio Chart\n\nA trailing P/E ratio is a time-tested measure that helps investors understand a stock's value. The lower the ratio, the less investors pay for their share of the company's profits. Conversely, the higher the ratio, the more investors pay for a company's profits.\n\nFor a successful portfolio manager like Dalio, who is looking to balance growth and value, Alphabet offers the best of both worlds: A relatively modest P/E ratio and a revenue growth rate of roughly 15%.\n\nSo, for those looking for an affordable growth stock loved by billionaires, it's time to consider Alphabet.\n\nStory continues\n\nUber's future earnings growth makes the stock a bargain today\n\nJustin Pope (Uber Technologies): According to research on hedge funds by The Motley Fool, Uber Technologies has become a popular pick among Wall Street's wealthiest players. The ride-hailing leader sits in the top 10 holdings for four of the 16 hedge funds analyzed. When the research was published, it was the top tech holding of late billionaire fund manager Jim Simons' Renaissance Technology.\n\nWhat makes Uber so special? It's become the de facto ride-hailing leader in the United States and has established a footprint worldwide. Uber has an estimated 76% market share in America, which helped it grow large enough to realize remarkable operating leverage in recent years. That means revenue grows faster than expenses, leading to rapid earnings growth.\n\nYou can see that Uber's free cash flow began ramping up as revenue crossed $30 billion in late 2022: UBER Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nBottom-line earnings tend to follow cash flow. Analysts believe Uber's earnings per share will grow by over 50% annually on average for the next three to five years. That seems attainable as Uber enjoys strong growth and drives new revenue streams. Uber is monetizing its platform traffic in new ways, such as advertising.\n\nShares are trading at a forward P/E of 76. That would normally seem expensive, but not if the business is growing profits as fast as analysts believe Uber will. The current PEG ratio of 1.4 signals the stock is attractive, considering Uber's anticipated growth. Wall Street's wealthiest seem to agree.\n\nActive billionaire involvement could make Texas Instruments stock a buy\n\nWill Healy(Texas Instruments): Perhaps one of the more unexpected billionaire investments is Elliott Management's $2.5 billion purchase of Texas Instruments stock. Texas Instruments specializes in analog and embedded chips. It is best known for inventing the integrated circuit in 1958 and today for its industrial and automotive chips. It has 100,000 clients.\n\nUnder the previous CEO, Rich Templeton, it also became known for a dividend that grew at a 24% compound annual growth rate between 2004 and 2023. Since then, Templeton retired and Haviv Ilan took over as CEO.\n\nIt may be Ilan's leadership that drew the attention of the fund run by billionaire Paul Singer. In 2024, its payout hike was only 5% amid an industry slump. Also, a $5 billion commitment to build additional fabs helped cause the trailing 12-month free cash flow to drop 79% in a year to $940 million, well under the $4.7 billion annual dividend expense.\n\nIn its letter to Texas Instruments' board, Elliott noted the falling free cash flows and a belief that ambitions to add capacity far exceed anticipated demand. To this end, Elliott wants the company to increase its free cash flow above $9 per share by 2026, far above the current annual payout of $5.20 per share.\n\nFor now, investors may want to await the company's response to Elliott's shareholder activism before adding shares. Texas Instruments consistently outperformed the S&P 500 until about a year ago, implying that the semiconductor stock responded well to Templeton's management philosophy. If Elliott can persuade the company to again prioritize free cash flows, the stock could again become a buy, especially for income investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaires Were Selling Nvidia Stock (Before the Stock Split) and Buying 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia completed a 10-for-1 stock split after the market closed on Friday, June 7. That split follows substantial price appreciation driven by enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia shares are up more than 200% in the past year.\n\nYet, several billionaire hedge fund managers trimmed their positions in Nvidia during the first quarter, before the stock split was announced, and reinvested the money in other AI companies.\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management sold 2.9 million shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 68%. Meanwhile, he increased his position in Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) by 155%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio. Steven Schonfeld of Schonfeld Strategic Advisors sold 96,793 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 58%. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Alphabet by 195%, making it the ninth-largest holding in his portfolio, excluding options contracts. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 103,337 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 78%. As a caveat, Jones purchased call options on Nvidia, which allow him to benefit from a price increase with a smaller capital outlay. Meanwhile, he increased his stake in Snowflake(NYSE: SNOW) by 54%, though it remains a relatively small position. Louis Bacon of Moore Capital Management sold 2,006 shares of Nvidia, reducing his stake by 19%. He also started positions in Alphabet and Snowflake, though neither rank among the top 25 holdings.\n\nThe trades made by those hedge fund managers do not mean Nvidia is a bad investment. All four fund managers still have exposure to the chipmaker, as do plenty of other wealthy investors. However, Alphabet and Snowflake warrant further consideration.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is the largest ad tech company and the third-largest cloud infrastructure and platform services provider in the world. Its leadership in advertising is predicated on its ability to engage internet users and collect data with popular web platforms, such as Google Search, YouTube, and Chrome. Similarly, its strong presence in cloud computing reflects its technological prowess and extensive data center footprint.\n\nAlphabet is slowly losing ground in digital advertising. Its market share is projected to slip to 27.4% this year, down from 28.1% last year. But Google Cloud Platform is actually gaining market share in cloud infrastructure and platform services, accounting for 11% of spending in the fourth quarter, up from 10% in the prior year.\n\nAlphabet is integrating its latest AI model, Gemini, into both ecosystems to boost growth. For instance, Gemini powers AI overviews designed to make Google Search more engaging and streamlines ad campaign creation with a conversational interface. Gemini also automates tasks in Workspace applications, like Google Docs and Google Sheets, and it can be fine-tuned by Google Cloud customers to create custom generative AI applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet is particularly well positioned to monetize AI through its cloud computing business. Forrester Research recently ranked Google Cloud Platform as the leader in AI infrastructure solutions, awarding the company the highest scores in current offering, development strategy, and market share. Forrester also ranked Google's Gemini as the leading large language model, ahead of OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nAlphabet reported encouraging financial results in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to strong momentum in cloud computing and modest growth in advertising. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income jumped 57% to $23.7 billion, helped along by cost-optimization efforts, like headcount reductions and the integration of different business teams.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street analysts estimate that Alphabet will grow earnings per share at 17.2% annually over the next three to five years. That forecast makes its current valuation of 26.7 times earnings seem reasonable. From that price, I think Alphabet can outperform the S&P 500 over the next three to five years.\n\n2. Snowflake\n\nSnowflake is best known as a cloud data warehouse, a system that stores data optimized for queries and business intelligence. In fact, Forrester recently recognized the company as a leader among cloud data warehousing platforms. But Snowflake also functions as a data lake, a system that stores raw data for analytics and AI, and its platform supports data sharing.\n\nBeyond that core functionality, Snowflake provides several adjacent solutions. Its Snowpark developer framework supports the training of AI models, its Cortex service brings generative AI and machine learning models to Snowflake data, and its Native Application Framework allows businesses to build and deploy applications on the platform. Snowflake is unique in its ability to support those features on a single platform across multiple public clouds.\n\nThe company reported mixed first-quarter financial results. Its customer count jumped 21% to 9,822, and the average existing customer spent 28% more. In turn, revenue increased 33% to $829 million on strong growth in core storage and analytics capabilities. But management also mentioned encouraging momentum with newer products. More than half of customers now use Snowpark, and over 750 customers have already used Cortex (which launched in May).\n\nThe bottom line was more troubling. Non-GAAP operating margin contracted one percentage point in the first quarter, and non-GAAP net income declined 7% to $0.14 per diluted share. Snowflake also lowered its full-year margin guidance, but management attributed that to increased costs related to AI product development. CFO Michael Scarpelli told analysts, \"We view these investments as key to unlocking additional revenue opportunities in the future.\"\n\nGoing forward, the data lake and data warehousing markets are projected to expand at 24% annually through 2030. Meanwhile, Wall Street expects Snowflake to grow sales at 23% annually over the next three years. Personally, I think that leaves room for upside if Snowflake is successful in its AI ambitions. But even if Wall Street is correct, the current valuation of 14.4 times sales is quite reasonable. Indeed, Snowflake has never traded at a cheaper valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple needs to make Siri fit into a ChatGPT world—Is it Mission Impossible?",
        "content": "Apple’s Siri was the first virtual assistant to grace our smartphones, but it only took about five years before newer competitors like Google’s Assistant—which could more freely search the web for answers—made it seem a little clunky. Now, nearly 13 years after that 2011 launch, Siri is looking positively antiquated.\n\nThe advent of generative AI is to blame. Siri was always an AI assistant of sorts—machine learning, which is a subset of AI, is what gives it the ability to understand spoken commands and requests—but the world has come to expect so much more of AI, particularly since OpenAI's seminal release of the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\n\nApple arch-rival Google, which has one of the leading large language models in the form of Gemini, is baking a host of AI capabilities into its Android operating system—most notably the Gemini chatbot itself, which is taking over from Assistant. And even on Apple's iOS, many people are now turning to apps for third-party chatbot like ChatGPT. Siri is increasingly out in the cold.\n\nThat may change on Monday, when Apple holds what’s likely to be its most consequential Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in many years. Investors are clamoring for the company to more full-throatedly declare its enthusiasm for AI and, when it unveils iOS 18 next week, Apple will have to demonstrate that it has what it takes to at least keep up in the chatbot stakes. The obvious way to do so will be to unveil a smarter Siri—one that still acts as the familiar voice interface that iPhone owners have long used to access the device's functionality, but that could also understand and do much, much more.\n\nBut there’s a problem: Apple’s most advanced under-development large language model (LLM), reportedly known internally as Ajax, isn’t yet ready for primetime.\n\nSo, to stay in the game, Tim Cook’s company has reportedly struck a deal with Sam Altman’s OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple is still talking to Google about using Gemini too—it may be that iPhone users end up with a panoply of chatbots powering the answers to their queries—but for now, it seems Cook will on Monday tout a mix of ChatGPT and Apple’s in-house AI efforts.\n\n“Apple is playing catch-up with LLM technology, and it’s probable that their AI’s conversational abilities and, more importantly, cost, don’t yet meet what they can get from OpenAI,” said Forrester senior analyst Andrew Cornwall. CUPERTINO, CA - OCTOBER 04: Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller standing in front of an image showing thought bubbles discusses the new personal assistant called Siri for the new iPhone 4s at the company's headquarters October 4, 2011 in Cupertino, California. The announcement marks the first time new CEO Tim Cook introduced a new product since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs resigned in August. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nThe limits of keeping AI 'on-device'\n\nWith the OpenAI deal now apparently a certainty, the biggest mystery about Apple’s near-term AI strategy is where it will draw the line between the capabilities offered by the cloud-based ChatGPT and those that it can offer locally on the iPhone or iPad itself. Reports suggest that an algorithm will determine which type of AI would be most appropriate, depending on the sophistication of the request.\n\nStory continues\n\nSiri’s on-device nature is part of Apple’s big privacy pitch—that, unlike Google in particular, Apple is not interested in exploiting its users’ data. Indeed, this reluctance to learn too much about the user’s interests, and to keep what is learned away from third parties, is widely seen as a key reason why Siri’s capabilities remain so limited.\n\nIt is certainly possible to find some kind of middle ground. Apple’s mobile devices have since 2017 included a neural processing unit (NPU)—a specialized component for handling AI tasks—that the company calls the Neural Engine. This has allowed Apple to offer things like improved image and sound recognition, language translation and various health features. The newest iterations of the Neural Engine, reportedly the version in last year’s iPhone 15 Pro as well as whatever is inside this year’s iPhones, will be what enables Apple’s on-device generative AI.\n\nBut a tiny NPU will not be able to match the wild horsepower contained in the data centers powering OpenAI, which allows ChatGPT to provide such an uncanny simulacrum of human intelligence. So Apple will have to walk a tightrope between the privacy that its users have come to expect and the futuristic capabilities promised by a cloud-happy AI sector.\n\n“Apple is likely to announce that much of the new Siri processing is done on-device,” said Cornwall, who suggested that the reported Apple-OpenAI deal “would be a stopgap measure to give Apple developers time to build an LLM that can run mostly on-device and inside Apple’s ecosystem.” As for requests that require OpenAI’s superior technology, Apple will probably route those through its own servers so any personal data can be anonymized, he added—a tactic that wouldn’t just conform to Apple’s privacy-first brand, but that would also “permit Apple to switch providers without disrupting its users.”\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the revamped Siri that Apple will unveil on Monday will be able to control the functions within apps on the user’s behalf, open documents, email web links, and summarize online articles. But even if some functions are using OpenAI’s technology, Apple will likely present them as improved “Apple capabilities” rather than “a front end to OpenAI,” Cornwall said.\n\nCompany pride aside, there are good reasons why Apple may want to avoid putting its OpenAI association front-and-center. Altman has become a highly controversial figure who allegedly kept OpenAI’s old board in the dark about that company’s plans, so they wouldn’t delay moves like the release of ChatGPT in the name of safety—his lack of openness with his overseers led to his brief ouster late last year. Although he won that tussle, former OpenAI employees continue to warn about an insufficient focus on safety.\n\nEven if Apple does keep OpenAI at arm’s length, it also faces risks around ChatGPT’s propensity to confidently make up nonsense when answering questions—a problem called “hallucinating” that is shared to some extent by all LLMs, as demonstrated by the dangerously wrong answers that Google’s recently AI-imbued Search has been giving. Users may not welcome Siri’s newfound willingness to provide answers if those answers are wrong.\n\nAs for whether Monday’s reveal will be enough to convince Apple’s users and Wall Street that the iPhone remains both a cutting-edge and reliable device, the proof will be in the hands-on experiences that follow when iOS 18 becomes available for public testing in July, ahead of its full release around September.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Long-term investors must think differently when evaluating stocks. Looking decades ahead is as much about preventing unnecessary risks and losses as it is about maximizing upside. Ideally, these investors strike a compromise somewhere in the middle.\n\nFinding a middle ground is going to be your best bet when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Are you looking to ride AI to big-time portfolio gains over the coming decades? Your search should focus on the best long-term AI stocks. The best choices in this sector could be a few obscure companies no one is discussing ... or they could be some obvious AI champions that have proven ability to be winners. It's all a matter of what went into creating your investing thesis.\n\nHere are three reasons why Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be the best long-term AI stocks money can buy.\n\n1. They own the cloud layer of the economy\n\nThere are huge technological challenges that go into developing and operating AI models. It takes manythousands of AI chips and it involves tremendous energy consumption. A single query on ChatGPT consumes an estimated 15 times more energy than a Google search.\n\nThat expense partly explains why ChatGPT developer OpenAI struck a partnership with Microsoft. While many companies can benefit from AI technology, only a few can afford to own and operate it. Most companies getting into this sector will ultimately pay to access AI technology instead of building it for themselves.\n\nAI overlaps perfectly with cloud computing, where a few companies own and operate most of the world's cloud resources. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet own roughly 67% of the global cloud market. Today, most of the connected world runs on this infrastructure, which makes it perfect for distributing AI technology to the masses.\n\nYou're already seeing these giant cloud companies weave AI products and services into the cloud. It just makes too much sense. Cloud dominance is a tremendous hurdle for other companies to overcome, and these three companies may continue to dominate the cloud and AI for years to come because of it.\n\n2. Deep pockets gave them a massive head start in AI\n\nIt's almost like these companies won the metaphorical lottery to become these enormous and powerful corporations, and then won again as AI emerged as a perfect fit in their existing business models. Again, the vast majority of companies cannot compete with the deep pockets Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet possess.\n\nHow much cash do these companies create? As it is, these three combined for over $184 billion in free cash flow over the past year alone. That's discretionary cash profits these businesses have to spend as they please. Note that this includes capital expenditures and business investments like, for example, buying AI chips and building out data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack out those investments by looking at operating cash flow. These companies combined for over $300 billion in just one year! MSFT Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThese companies operate hundreds of data centers worldwide and can afford to build many more to support AI demand. It's an arms race that virtually nobody has a shot at coming in and winning from the outside. These companies are realistically competing only with each other.\n\n3. Nvidia is only part of the AI equation and can eventually be replaced\n\nInvestors can't forget about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has quickly become a potential AI rival in terms of size and scale to these companies. I'm not saying that Nvidia won't be a fantastic investment and a significant player in AI over the coming decades.\n\nBut consider this food for thought: Chips are AI's building blocks, but not AI itself. The chips are only part of the equation. So far, Nvidia has done a stellar job establishing itself as the de facto go-to supplier of AI chips.\n\nStill, Nvidia depends on Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to continue building their AI infrastructure using its chips. It's unclear whether that will continue forever. Again, it's easily possible that Nvidia will remain the leading player in AI chips for the foreseeable future. But it's at least worth pondering whether these cash-flush technology giants will forever fork over billions of dollars to Nvidia.\n\nThey don't have to switch to a competitor's AI chip, like Advanced Micro Devices. Instead, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet could design custom chips for their internal use, helping diversify their chip supply away from Nvidia as the predominant source. Custom chips wouldn't be easy, but if any company can do it, it'd probably be these three.\n\nSo, do these big three cloud companies need Nvidia, or does Nvidia need them? This question has no clear answer today. However, the possibility of internal chip designs is enough to give Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet the nod as the top AI stock investors can hold decades into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Alphabet (GOOG) The Best Undervalued AI Stock Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\n\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future — productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn’t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\n\nOne doesn’t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\n\nImage by MayoFi from Pixabay\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 165\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is apparently in a no-holds-barred fight against competitors in the AI race that according to many threatened the bread and butter of Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG): its search business. However, many analysts believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is making a big turn and will continue to grow. Alex Kantrowitz, Big Technology founder, while talking to CNBC last month, said that the present for Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is looking \"real good\" amid revenue growth, leadership's harsh stance against those \"making trouble\" inside Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG), dividends and buybacks.\n\nStory continues\n\nLatest data analyzed by Bank of America shows that across all devices, Google's market search in search actually gained half a percentage point in May on a MoM basis. BofA analyst Justin Post said this shows Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) AI Overviews are \"aiding query growth and usage.\"\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is just getting started with AI product launches. Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is indeed in a strong position to develop an AI ecosystem around its products. For example, demos have shown that Gemini app will help people perform daily personal tasks like note taking, appointments, writing, etc. These features could easily be integrated with other Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) apps. Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) goal is to urge users to sign up for ‘Google One AI Premium’ plan, which has a $19.99 price tag. Analysts also believe Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in a strong position to offset any headwinds or lost market share in Google search with YouTube, which saw its ads revenue reach $8.1 billion in the first quarter, a 21% growth. Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) net income in the period came in at $23.66 billion, up 57%, or $1.89 per share.\n\nAlphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) bulls believe the market is not incorporating Alphabet Inc Class C's (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth in Cloud, Other Bets, Video and other high growth initiatives. The stock is trading 20x Alphabet's 2025 EPS estimate of $8.57. This multiple makes the stock look attractively valued since the Wall Street expects Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) earnings to grow by 13.40% in 2025 and by 19% over the next five years on a per annum basis.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts’ expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it’s not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.”\n\nOverall, Alphabet Inc Class C (NASDAQ:GOOG) ranks 4th in Insider Monkey’s list of Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks.You can visit Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks to see the other AI stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG, our conviction lies in the belief that smaller, under-the-radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference event kicks off Monday, June 10, from the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with a keynote by CEO Tim Cook. One of the most anticipated Apple events in years, WWDC 2024 is expected to serve as the launch point for the company’s big push into generative AI.\n\nWall Street is eager to find out what Apple’s been cooking up over the past few months as its rivals have begun rolling out, or in some cases rolling back, their own generative AI offerings. Apple has been largely on the sidelines of the AI conversation, save for a few fleeting mentions during earnings calls and the like.\n\nDuring the company’s Q2 call in May, Cook seemed to tee up potential AI news from WWDC while touting Apple’s capabilities in both hardware and software.\n\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,\" he said.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, Apple’s marketing chief Greg Joswiak posted on X, formerly Twitter, that WWDC will be “Absolutely Incredible!” and made sure to capitalize both words. Get it? A.I. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, Calif., on June 5, 2023. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to unveiling its broader AI strategy, Apple will also debut the latest versions of its various operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and the first major updates to the company’s visionOS, which powers the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\n\nStill, everything else is virtually guaranteed to take a back seat to Apple’s AI news.\n\nSiri gets smarter, and more\n\nAccording to Apple soothsayer Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the highlight of WWDC 2024 will be a new generative AI-powered version of Apple’s Siri smart assistant. The feature will allow Siri to control individual features within apps, making it far more versatile than the Siri on your current iPhone.\n\nSiri has been languishing for years, proving more useful for setting timers and playing songs on Spotify than acting as a true digital helper. But a generative AI version of Siri offers the promise of an actual smart assistant that could provide you with everything from proactive tips to improved responses to those random questions that pop in your head throughout the day.\n\nBloomberg’s Gurman also says Apple’s AI features, called Apple Intelligence, will touch a host of other apps including Messages, Notes, and Safari, as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nExactly how Apple will power a smarter Siri is still an open question. According to reports from Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times, Apple has held talks with OpenAI to license its GPT software and separate talks with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to license its Gemini software.\n\nA tie-up with either company could get complicated. OpenAI already works closely with Microsoft (MSFT), which is working to set its PC business apart from Apple by boasting about how some Windows 11 features are powered by GPT-4o. Google, meanwhile, uses its Gemini AI model on its Android smartphones, which compete directly with Apple’s iPhone. Google is also working with Samsung to provide AI software for that company’s Galaxy line of phones.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see if consumers or Wall Street end up more excited about Apple’s AI rollout. Investors and analysts have been waiting for Apple to debut some kind of answer to the generative AI explosion, but so far consumer use cases have been relatively limited.\n\nIf Apple does roll out some well-developed features, they’re unlikely to get consumers to drop everything and buy a new iPhone come September when the company debuts its newest phones. Instead, most consumers will probably wait until they see some kind of hardware upgrade they’ve been waiting for, or until their current phone becomes unbearably slow, before ponying up for a new device.\n\nAs for iPadOS and macOS, expect Apple to roll out the same AI features it adds to iOS across those operating systems as well. In general, I expect Apple to be rather judicious with its AI moves. The company is keenly attuned to how consumers perceive its products, and after the blowback competitors like Google and Microsoft have seen with their own AI stumbles, it’s hard to imagine Apple will announce anything it isn’t completely confident in.\n\nOutside of AI, Apple is also expected to unveil Rich Communication Services, or RCS, for the iPhone. This means that users will finally be able to text high-quality images and videos to their Android friends. RCS is also more secure than the SMS standard Apple currently uses for iPhone-to-Android texting.\n\nGurman also says that Apple will finally allow people to arrange app icons on their iPhone home screen in any way they want, rather than being stuck with the traditional grid layout.\n\nThere are bound to be plenty more announcements from the big show, and Yahoo Finance will be there live, bringing you all of the latest news as it breaks.

        "title": "Judge rather than jury will render verdict in upcoming antitrust trial",
        "content": "ALEXANDRIA, Va. (AP) — A judge rather than a jury will decide whether Google violated federal antitrust laws by building a monopoly on the technology that powers online advertising.\n\nThe decision Friday by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema was a defeat for the Justice Department, which sought a jury trial when it filed the case last year in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia.\n\nBut the government's right to a jury trial was based largely on the fact that it sought monetary damages to compensate federal agencies that purchased online ads and claimed they were overcharged as a result of Google's anticompetitive conduct. The dollar values associated with those claims, though, were relatively small — less than $750,000 — and far less significant than other remedies sought by the government, which might include forcing Google to sell off parts of its advertising technology.\n\nAs a result, Google last month took the extraordinary step of writing the government a check for more than $2 million — the $750,000 in damages claimed by the government multiplied by three because antitrust cases allow for trebled damages.\n\nMountain View, California-based Google argued that writing the check rendered moot any government claim of monetary damages and eliminated the need for a jury trial.\n\nAt a hearing Friday in Alexandria, Justice Department lawyers argued that the check Google wrote was insufficient to moot the damages claim, prompting a technical discussion over how experts would try to quantify the damages.\n\nBrinkema ruled in favor of Google. She said the amount of Google's check covered the highest possible amount the government had sought in its initial filings. She likened receipt of the money, which was paid unconditionally to the government regardless of whether the tech giant prevailed in its arguments to strike a jury trial, as equivalent to “receiving a wheelbarrow of cash.”\n\nGoogle said in a statement issued after Friday's hearing it is “glad the Court ruled that this case will be tried by a judge. As we’ve said, this case is a meritless attempt to pick winners and losers in a highly competitive industry that has contributed to overwhelming economic growth for businesses of all sizes.”\n\nIn its court papers, Google also argued that the constitutional right to a jury trial does not apply to a civil suit brought by the government. The government disagreed with that assertion but said it would not seek a ruling from the judge on that constitutional question.\n\nThe antitrust trial in Virginia is separate from a case in the District of Columbia alleging Google's search engine is an illegal monopoly. A judge there has heard closing arguments in that case but has not yet issued a verdict.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cash Flow Kings: 7 Stocks Set to Deliver Massive Value to Shareholders",
        "content": "A commonly used method to value stocks is discounted cash flow analysis. The basic idea is to estimate the present value of future cash flow from the business. While revenue growth is important, the bottom line is the cash flow potential that the business holds. Investors should look for cash-flow stocks that represent companies with robust free cash flow and the ability to increase cash flow on a sustained basis.\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip companies generally have robust cash flow. On the other hand, growth companies are focused on aggressive investments and cash flow is relatively low. However, if an investor can correctly identify a future cash-flow machine, returns from the stock can be multi-fold.\n\nI have discussed a mix of blue-chip and emerging ideas from the perspective of cash flow potential from the business. I must add that healthy cash flow would also imply robust dividends and sustained value creation through share repurchase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are seven cash-flow stocks worth your attention now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a valuation of almost $3 trillion is not a euphoria or a bubble. The valuation is a function of innovation and the cash flow potential. AAPL stock has a low dividend yield of 0.5%. However, I expect robust dividend growth in the next five years.\n\nApple reported operating cash flow of $62.5 billion for the first half of 2024, implying an annualized operating cash flow potential of $125 billion. Further, the technology company has a cash buffer of $160 billion.\n\nTherefore, there is ample flexibility for dividends, share repurchases, and investment in innovation-driven growth. For the first half of 2024, the products business witnessed some contraction. However, the services segment, which includes the App Store, offset that weakness.\n\nEven in the product segment, the wearable, home, and accessories businesses are likely to gain growth traction in global markets. Recently, the company unveiled a new AI-focused chip in its iPad Pro. With AI-powered enhancement in devices, I expect the products segment to deliver healthy growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, as the business grows, cash flows will continue to swell.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another technology stock that looks attractively valued, and the business is a cash flow machine. GOOG stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5x, which is attractive considering the impending growth backed by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet reported revenue growth of 15% on a year-on-year basis to $80.5 billion. It’s worth noting that the Google Cloud business growth was 28% to $9.6 billion. Further, the technology giant reported operating cash flow of $23.5 billion for the quarter. The annualized operating cash flow potential is almost $100 billion.\n\nThis provides Alphabet with the flexibility to invest in AI-driven growth. At the same time, I expect a robust upside in dividends in the coming years. Coming back to AI, Alphabet is just getting started on that front. Last month, the company launched a beefed-up AI search and chatbot. Alphabet believes that it’s well-positioned for the “next wave of AI innovation.” I, therefore, expect healthy growth to be sustained coupled with a cash flow upside.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin (LMT) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).3D illustration.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense expenditures surged to $2.44 trillion in 2023 and there is no doubt that spending will continue to swell. Defense stocks are likely to benefit on the back of a robust order intake. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the undervalued defense stocks to buy at a forward P/E of 17.9x. The defense stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nAs of the first quarter, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For 2024, the company guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion (mid-range). This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth and continued share repurchases.\n\nIt’s also likely that sales growth will accelerate in the coming years and will have a positive impact on cash flows. There are two reasons to expect healthy sales growth. First, Lockheed increasingly pursued deals outside the U.S. with its allies. The geographic expansion will benefit the defense major.\n\nFurther, Lockheed is focused on next-generation defense technology, including hypersonic and next-generation interceptors. Its aggressive investment in research and development is likely to be a growth catalyst.\n\nChevron (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued blue-chip stock from the oil and gas industry. In the last 12 months, CVX stock remained sideways with oil struggling to trend higher on the back of macroeconomic headwinds. I see the sideways move as a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nWith multiple interest rate cuts likely in the next 12 to 18 months, I am bullish on oil. Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet and high-quality assets with an attractive break-even point.\n\nChevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion for 2023 and $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. If oil trends higher, it’s likely that cash flow will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion for the year.\n\nCash flows will swell further with the likely completion of the acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). Therefore, even with aggressive capital investment plans, there will be ample flexibility for dividend growth and share repurchase.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best pick among retail stocks considering the company’s growth trajectory. While a forward P/E of 51x looks slightly stretched, COST stock has always commanded a valuation premium as compared to peers. I would look at corrections to accumulate this retail behemoth.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Costco reported sales growth of 9.1% on a year-on-year basis to $57.39 billion. Comparable store sales growth was also healthy at 6.6%. With rate cuts impending, I expect consumption expenditures to accelerate, and Costco will benefit.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.3 billion. Cash flows have continued to swell, and I remain bullish, considering the top-line growth and continued upside in membership revenue.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, Costco had two warehouses in China. In the last quarter, the number of warehouses increased to seven. International expansion is likely to be another catalyst for growth and cash flow upside.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have been in the limelight considering the big addressable market. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an emerging cash-flow business that deserves a place in the portfolio. CRWD stock surged by 122% in the last 12 months. There was an intermediate correction, but the reversal was swift on the back of strong Q1 results.\n\nFor the first quarter, CrowdStrike reported stellar revenue growth of 33% on a year-on-year basis to $921 million. For the same period, CrowdStrike generated operating cash flow of $383 million and ended the quarter with a cash buffer of $3.7 billion. With annual operating cash flow visibility of almost $1.6 billion, CrowdStrike is an emerging cash-flow star.\n\nThe cybersecurity company reported annual recurring revenue of $3.65 billion as of April. Over the next five to seven years, CrowdStrike is targeting an annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. This provides an indication of the headroom for upside in revenue and cash flows. It’s, therefore, not surprising that CRWD stock has remained in a sharp uptrend.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nMultiple factors globally are likely to ensure that gold remains in an uptrend. Some important reasons include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the prospects of expansionary policies. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a blue-chip gold mining company worth holding for healthy dividends and capital gains.\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported 128 million ounces of gold reserves and 155 million ounces in resources. The gold miner has a leading portfolio of 10 Tier 1 assets. A strong asset base ensures a steady production upside beyond the current decade.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $7 billion. Last year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. With gold trending higher, it’s likely that operating cash flow will be more than $3.5 billion. This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth. At the same time, capital investments will remain aggressive backed by a strong balance sheet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Mike Scarcella\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet's Google will not face a jury trial over its alleged digital advertising dominance after the company wrote a check to the United States to cover monetary damages, a federal judge ruled on Friday.\n\nThe U.S. Justice Department and a coalition of states sued the tech giant last year, claiming it was unlawfully monopolizing digital advertising and overcharging users. The jury trial would have been the first-ever in a civil antitrust case lodged by the Justice Department, Google said.\n\nFriday's ruling by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema in Alexandria, Virginia means Google will face a non-jury trial in the lawsuit, which seeks primarily to break up its digital advertising business to allow for more competition.\n\nGoogle confirmed that Brinkema, who had previously scheduled a jury trial for September, had issued the ruling during a court hearing but declined to comment further on Friday.\n\nThe company has denied wrongdoing and said it was not admitting liability by submitting a damages payment.\n\nA Justice Department spokesperson declined to comment.\n\nGoogle said last month the government, which had initially claimed more than $100 million in damages, could not show more than $1 million in damages and wrote a check to cover the amount. The final amount has not been disclosed.\n\nGoogle had accused the federal government of manufacturing its monetary damages claim in order to ensure a jury trial, since non-monetary demands are heard by judges directly in antitrust cases.\n\nThe Justice Department responded that it was open to resolving the money damages part of its case, but only if Google cut a larger check.\n\n\"Google has fought hard to keep its anticompetitive conduct shielded from public view,\" the government told Brinkema last month.\n\n(Reporting by Mike Scarcella; Editing by David Bario and Alexander Smith)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is an Incredible Growth Stock: 3 Reasons Why",
        "content": "Growth investors focus on stocks that are seeing above-average financial growth, as this feature helps these securities garner the market's attention and deliver solid returns. But finding a great growth stock is not easy at all.\n\nIn addition to volatility, these stocks carry above-average risk by their very nature. Also, one could end up losing from a stock whose growth story is actually over or nearing its end.\n\nHowever, the task of finding cutting-edge growth stocks is made easy with the help of the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects.\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this internet search leader is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 31.1% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 28.1%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nCash is the lifeblood of any business, but higher-than-average cash flow growth is more beneficial and important for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, high cash accumulation enables these companies to undertake new projects without raising expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -15.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nSuperiority of a stock in terms of the metrics outlined above can be further validated by looking at the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is of course favorable here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile the overall earnings estimate revisions have made Alphabet a Zacks Rank #1 stock, it has earned itself a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Shopify (SHOP) Down 1.6% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Shopify (SHOP). Shares have lost about 1.6% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Shopify due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at its most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important drivers.\n\nShopify Q1 Earnings Beat Estimates, Revenues Rise Y/Y\n\nShopify reported first-quarter 2024 adjusted earnings of 20 cents per share, comfortably beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 25%. The company reported earnings of 1 cent per share in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nTotal revenues jumped 23.4% year over year to $1.86 billion, which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 1.36%.\n\nQuarter in Detail\n\nSubscription Solutions revenues increased 33.8% year over year to $511 million, primarily due to more merchants joining the platform, as well as pricing changes for existing merchants on its Standard subscription plans.\r\n\r\nMerchant Solutions revenues improved 20% year over year to $1.35 billion, driven by robust Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV), which improved 23% year over year to $60.9 billion.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, $36.2 billion of GMV was processed on Shopify Payments in the first quarter, 32% higher year over year. The penetration rate of Shopify Payments, as a percentage of GMV, was 60% compared with 56% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Monthly Recurring Revenues (MRR) were $151 million, up 32% from the year-ago quarter. Shopify Plus revenues were $48 million, representing 32% of MRR compared with 33% in the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nIn the reported quarter, Shop Pay increased 56%, processing $14 billion of GMV and accounted for 39% of Shopify’s Gross Payments Volume (GPV).\r\n\r\nGPV grew to $36.2 billion, constituting 60% of GMV processed in the first quarter compared with $27.5 billion (56% of GMV) in the year-ago quarter.\n\nOperating Details\n\nNon-GAAP gross profit increased 30.4% year over year to $962 million. The gross margin expanded 280 basis points (bps) year over year to 51.7%.\r\n\r\nAdjusted sales and marketing expenses, as a percentage of revenues, gained 80 bps year over year to 18.8%. Adjusted general and administrative expenses decreased 170 bps to 5.3%.\r\n\r\nMoreover, adjusted research and development expenses, as a percentage of revenues, decreased 920 bps year over year to 14.1%.\r\n\r\nNon-GAAP operating expenses decreased 1% year over year to $761 million. Operating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, were 40.9% compared with the year-ago quarter’s 51%.\r\n\r\nShopify’s adjusted operating income was $201 million against the year-ago quarter’s loss of $31 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nBalance Sheet\n\nAs of Mar 31, 2024, Shopify had cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities balance of $5.2 billion compared with $5 billion as of Dec 31, 2023.\r\n\r\nThe free cash flow was $232 million compared with $446 million in the year-ago quarter.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, Shopify expects revenue growth in the high teens on a year-over-year basis. Adjusting for a 300-400 bps headwind related to the divestiture of the logistics business, revenues are expected to grow in the low to mid-twenties on a year-over-year basis.\r\n\r\nThe gross margin is expected to decrease 50 bps sequentially.\r\n\r\nOperating expenses, as a percentage of revenues, are expected between 45% and 46%.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nEstimates revision followed a flat path over the past two months.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Shopify has a strong Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with an F. Following the exact same course, the stock was allocated a grade of F on the value side, putting it in the bottom 20% quintile for this investment strategy.\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of C. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nShopify has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nShopify is part of the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Over the past month, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), a stock from the same industry, has gained 4%. The company reported its results for the quarter ended March 2024 more than a month ago.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +29.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of C.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Alphabet GOOGL is continuously riding on its growing generative AI capabilities. Shares of the company have rallied 26.6% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry’s growth of 21%.\r\n\r\nGoogle is making strong efforts to bolster its footprint in the global generative AI market, which, per a report by Fortune Business Insights, is expected to hit $67.2 billion in 2024 and reach $967.7 by 2032, seeing a CAGR of 39.6% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company has rolled out its AI-powered note-taking app, NotebookLM, in Australia, Brazil, Canada, India, the U.K., and 208 more countries and territories, which was available only in the United States since its launch.\r\n\r\nNotebookLM, which is powered by Google's Gemini 1.5 Pro language model, aids in document understanding and reasoning. It generates summaries and suggests follow-up questions, focusing on the content of the documents.\r\n\r\nFor this global launch, Google has upgraded the interface language support of NotebookLM to 108 languages, which include Arabic, Assamese, Bengali, Cantonese, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hindi and Hinglish. The app now also supports sources and chats in 38 languages, such as Arabic, Bengali, Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Hindi, Japanese and Spanish.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Google has added a feature with the help of which NotebookLM can now source content from Google Slides and web URLs. The company has added inline citations to the app.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGoogle to Gain Competitive Edge\n\nThe global rollout of NotebookLM, along with the new features, is expected to provide Google a competitive edge over its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Apple AAPL, which are making concerted efforts to bolster their note-taking apps with generative AI.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s integration of its in-house AI system, Copilot, into its note-taking app, Microsoft OneNote, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThis new update enhances the appearance of digital notebooks, enables content organization, adjusts formatting, generates summaries and highlights key points using your own words, offering an edge to the company’s note-taking app.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Apple offers the Journal app, which uses AI to gather evidence from daily activities and mindset.\r\n\r\nThe Journal app allows users to write entries and insert content, with local storage on iPhones and iCloud backups. It not only provides data suggestions but also prompts users to write about their love for doing something and why it brings them joy.\n\nStory continues\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nRecently, Google upgraded Android Studio's bot with Gemini Pro, which enables developers to ask coding-related questions.\r\n\r\nThe company also made Gemini 1.5 Pro available in a public preview on Vertex AI.\r\n\r\nThe latest additions to the Gemma family of open models, including Gemma 2, the next-generation model with a 27-billion parameter, and PaliGemma, the first vision language model for image captioning, labeling and Q&A use cases, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle also introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure. The new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA’s NVDA GPUs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities across various products will help Google deliver enhanced user experience, which, in turn, is expected to aid Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $295.53 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.2%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.60 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31%.

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) recommended the expanded use of AbbVie’s ABBV immunology therapy Skyrizi (risankizumab) and AstraZeneca’s AZN cancer drug Tagrisso in Europe.\n\nRecap of the Week’s Most Important Stories\n\nLilly’s CFO Departs: Lilly’s executive vice president and CFO, Anat Ashkenazi has resigned to join Alphabet, Google’s parent company, as CFO and senior vice president, effective from Jul 31, 2024. Until then, she will continue to serve in her present role at Lilly. Ashkenazi replaces present CFO Ruth Porat, who moved to a new role as president & chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, effective from September 2023, but will continue as CFO till her successor takes office. Ashkenazi will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area and will report directly to Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nAshkenazi has been Lilly’s CFO since 2021. In the last three years of her tenure as CFO, Lilly experienced tremendous growth. Lilly launched its successful tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss medicine, Zepbound, during Ashkenazi’s time as CFO. It is believed that Ashkenazi’s deep experience at Lilly will be good for Google and Alphabet, which is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence, growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market and cutting costs through layoffs.\n\nAbbVie Starts Phase III Multiple Myeloma Study on BCMA Therapy, ABBV-383: AbbVie announced that it has initiated a phase III study on ABBV-383, a B-cell maturation antigen (BCMA) bispecific antibody T-cell engager, for treating relapsed/refractory multiple myeloma (r/r MM). The study called CERVINO will evaluate the efficacy, safety, and tolerability of ABBV-383 as a single agent in r/r MM patients who have received at least two lines of prior therapy. The study, which will enroll approximately 380 total patients, will compare ABBV-383 to standard available therapies. The study’s dual primary endpoints are progression-free survival and overall response rate (ORR).\n\nAbbVie announced positive top-line data from the phase II PICCOLO study evaluating Elahere (mirvetuximab soravtansine) for heavily pre-treated patients with folate receptor-alpha (FRα) positive, platinum-sensitive ovarian cancer (PSOC). The study met its primary endpoint of ORR. In the study, the ORR was 51.9%, while the median duration of response (DOR), a key secondary endpoint, was 8.25 months. Elahere was added to AbbVie’s cancer portfolio with the acquisition of Immunogen, which closed in February 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nJ&J Seeks Approval of HIV Therapy for Kids in U.S. and EU: J&J filed regulatory applications in the United States and the EU seeking expanded use of its HIV-1 therapy, Prezcobix/Rezolsta, for younger kids aged 6 and older. Prezcobix/Rezolsta is a two-drug fixed-dose combination tablet for treating HIV-1 infection in treatment-naïve and treatment-experienced adults and adolescent patients. It combines darunavir, J&J’s HIV-1 protease inhibitor, and cobicistat, Gilead Sciences CYP3A inhibitor. Prezcobix/Rezolsta is also marketed under a collaboration between J&J and Gilead. The companies have developed a separate new combination tablet containing a weight-adjusted pediatric dose (darunavir 675 mg/cobicistat 150 mg) for younger kids.\n\nCHMP Nods: The CHMP gave a positive opinion, recommending approval of AbbVie’s Skyrizi (risankizumab) in the EU to treat adults with moderately to severely active ulcerative colitis (UC). Skyrizi is already approved in the United States and the EU for treating plaque psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn's disease. AbbVie has also submitted an application to the FDA, seeking approval for Skyrizi for the UC indication in the United States.\n\nThe CHMP also recommended the expanded use of AstraZeneca’s Tagrisso plus chemotherapy for first-line treatment of locally advanced or metastatic EGFR mutated non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The application was based on data from the FLAURA2 phase III study. Tagrisso was approved for frontline NSCLC based on FLAURA2 data in February 2024.\n\nThe NYSE ARCA Pharmaceutical Index rose 3.9% in the last five trading sessions.\n\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return Large Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return\n\nLarge Cap Pharmaceuticals Industry 5YR % Return\n\nHere’s how the eight major stocks performed in the last five trading sessions.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG).\n\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\n\nLoeb Thinks Vistra's Capital Allocation Strategy is \"Brilliant\"\n\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\n\nLoeb's Bullish on LSEG, and For Good Reason\n\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\n\nStory continues Why You Should Buy Alphabet Stock\n\nGoogle\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Third Point’s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund’s top 13F holdings.

(NASDAQ:GOOG) in Q1 2024, acquiring a stake of nearly $453 million. It's is one of his top growth stocks picks. He likes the company's dominant position across its different verticals including search and cloud, however, pointed out threats to the company's core business (Google Search) due to the rise of answer engines like Perplexity and shifting trends in how consumers interact with the internet. But Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is a tech titan and Loeb is confident about the company's ability to protect its profits from competitors by utilizing its expertise in AI, a technology the Google-parent has been working on for over a decade (long before ChatGPT). Here's are some comments from Third Point's Q1 2024 investor letter about GOOG:\n\n“During Q1, the funds made a substantial investment in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) as the market worried about the impact of LLMs, personal assistants, and answer engines such as Perplexity AI on Google Search. We have owned Alphabet in the past and have long admired its exceptional business model and its proven ability to maintain a leading position across an array of preeminent products such as Search, Gmail, Android, GCP, and YouTube. The concern that in an AI world, changes in the way consumers will eventually interact with their personal devices and with the internet can result in risks to Alphabet’s core business Search is not entirely unfounded. Alphabet, however, has both a substantial distribution and technology advantage over competitors and is positioned to use its AI capabilities to unify, enhance, and better monetize the entire suite of its products…” (Click here to read the full text)\"\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is among the few companies in the AI scene that has the potential to remain untouchable and unrivaled. Why?

Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) has a clear economic moat in AI, with its cloud platform (Google Cloud Platform), research lab (DeepMind), and large-scale data collection and processing capabilities. GOOG has the potential to remain an undisputed leader in an industry that's expected to hit $1.8 trillion by 2030 (as per estimates by Grand View Research).\n\nApart from that, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) growth trajectory is remarkable. GOOG's revenue has grown at a Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 18.6% over the past 10 years and its net income has grown even more impressively, at a CAGR of 20.3% during the same period.

        "title": "Is GOOGL Stock The Best Quality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stands against the other quality stocks.\n\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\n\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\n\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\n\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\n\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nGoogle\n\n3. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 222\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for Google. Despite its heft, the average of 45 one year analyst ratings is Strong Buy, and the average share price target is $191.83 - implying that Wall Street is still optimistic for its future. However, June 2024 is seeing Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) lay off people in its cloud computing division as it battles a tough economy. Stifel's Mark Kelley increaed Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s share price target to $196 from $174 in May 2024. The upgrade came after a detailed April 2024 note that had increased the target to $174 from $154 and shared that the price target had factored in a 26x multiple for Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s NTM EPS. The note cited confidence in the growth of the advertising industry and faster US eCommerce growth as some reasons behind the bullishness.\n\nFor their March quarter of 2024 shareholdings, 222 out of the 919 hedge funds profiled by Insider Monkey had held a stake in Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management owned the biggest stake which was worth $6.9 billion.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s forward price to earnings ratio is 22.94, which makes it nearly evenly valued compared to the S&P 500's price to forward earnings ratio of 21. Additionally, while Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s shares have gained 158% over the past four years, its revenue has grown by 68% - creating some room for a potential claw back in the share price. Baron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund praised Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s AI initiatives in its Q1 2024 investor letter as it shared:\n\nGoogle has also taken advantage of its distribution to unlock various benefits of GenAI, such as helping advertisers generate creative content in different formats or helping them optimize their budgets across Google’s various platforms. Additional opportunities that GenAI creates for Google include improving its existing offerings (e.g., GenAI offerings for YouTube creators) and helping drive demand for Google Cloud, which now offers a managed AI service called Vertex AI. We continue to monitor the risk from GenAI disrupting search, particularly given Google’s large market share today but believe the valuation is attractive and reflects too high of a probability for a bad outcome.\n\nAlphabet also has real value in assets such as Waymo, which are not factored into valuation today (and are potentially included at a negative valuation as they currently generate losses, hurting EPS). We also believe Alphabet has further room to improve its cost discipline, given its high margin core Search business and similar efficiency measures taken at other large technology companies. All together, we believe Alphabet has a reasonable path to growing EPS at a mid-teens rate for years to come. On the back of Alphabet’s strong fundamentals and a reasonable valuation (approximately 20 times P/E (On 2025 expected EPS consensus as collected by FactSet)  for a business of this dominance and quality), we decided to add Alphabet to the portfolio.\n\nOverall, GOOGL ranks 3rd among the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy now. You can visit 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy to see the other quality stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOGL, our conviction lies in the belief that there are other AI stocks that hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than GOOGL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "The biggest antitrust regulators in the US are stepping up their scrutiny of the nation’s most powerful developers of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched and divided up investigations of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI, according to reporting from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe DOJ will lead a probe of Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the market for microprocessors that power AI, according to the Times. The FTC would lead antitrust investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, left, and assistant attorney general for antitrust Jonathan Kanter participate in a discussion on antitrust reforms last October in Washington, DC. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThe new scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nIt also took to trial a case filed by the Trump administration over Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) dominance in search. A judge is currently weighing the evidence in that case, with a decision expected this year.\n\nThe efforts have not always been successful. The FTC failed in its challenge against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and fell short in a separate battle to prevent Meta (META) from being able to purchase VR company Within.\n\nThe FTC made it clear last year that it wanted to look a lot closer at the burgeoning field of AI.\n\nIt said last July that it had started a consumer protection-based investigation into OpenAI’s data collection practices, and potential harms caused by the output of its large language models (LLMs).\n\nThen in January, it began a broader inquiry into deals between Big Tech and AI developers, including Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI, and Alphabet’s relationship with rival AI developer Anthropic.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC’s probe of Microsoft will extend beyond an examination of the tech giant's conduct to include a deal it reached with AI developer Inflection AI.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the FTC wants to know why Microsoft chose to pay Inflection a $650 million licensing fee to resell Inflection's technology, rather than buy it. The regulator's interest was piqued, according to the report, because Microsoft also acquired most of Inflection’s staff as part of the accord.\n\nIn response to the report, Microsoft’s spokesperson said the agreements with Inflection gave it an opportunity to recruit Inflection AI staff and accelerate development of its AI chat interface Microsoft Copilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat structure, Microsoft said, enables Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\n\n\"We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBoth companies received subpoenas from the FTC asking for information tied to the deal, the Journal reported.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the reports.\n\nMichael Carrier, an antitrust expert and co-director of Rutgers Institute for Information Policy and Law, said antitrust regulators looking to test the Microsoft agreement against antitrust laws will look to the substance and not the structure of the deal.\n\n\"The agency will try to determine whether Microsoft restructured this deal in a way that gave it control of InflectionAI while avoiding FTC review of the transaction,\" Carrier said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The two US antitrust agencies have agreed to divide responsibility over the artificial intelligence industry, giving the Federal Trade Commission the go-ahead to open a probe into Microsoft Corp.’s relationship with OpenAI, according to people familiar with the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBillionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day A Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions Behind ‘Suicide Squad,’ the Year’s Biggest Video-Game Flop ‘Everything Is Not Going to Be OK’ in Private Equity, Apollo’s Co-President Says Nvidia Tops $3 Trillion in Market Value, Leapfrogging Apple\n\nThe Justice Department will probe whether Nvidia Corp. violated antitrust law and retain oversight over Alphabet Inc.’s Google, according to the people, who asked not to be named discussing inter-agency negotiations.\n\nThe agencies reached the deal in the last few days after more than six months of negotiations, the people said. The agreement gives each agency authority to open an antitrust probe into the company’s conduct as well as recent deals related to it.\n\nAs part of that, the FTC has opened a probe into whether Microsoft failed to properly notify the antitrust agencies about its deal with Inflection AI, according to the people. In March, the Redmond, Washington-based software giant agreed to pay the startup $650 million to license its AI software and hired much of Inflection’s staff.\n\nThe DOJ and FTC declined to comment. Representatives for Microsoft and Inflection didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment. OpenAI, Google and Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nThe Justice Department and FTC jointly enforce US antitrust laws and work together to coordinate which agency will investigate mergers and anticompetitive conduct through a process internally known as clearance. High-profile matters, such as those involving Google, have previously caused bitter clearance disputes between the agencies.\n\nThe New York Times reported the news earlier.\n\nThe European Union also looked at Microsoft’s investment in OpenAI but ultimately decided against a formal probe. The UK’s competition watchdog has also said it would examine the partnership but separately decided last month that a Microsoft deal with French AI company Mistral AI doesn’t qualify for an investigation.\n\n--With assistance from Jackie Davalos and Davey Alba.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "title": "Lyft (LYFT) Down 12.7% Since Last Earnings Report: Can It Rebound?",
        "content": "A month has gone by since the last earnings report for Lyft (LYFT). Shares have lost about 12.7% in that time frame, underperforming the S&P 500.\n\nWill the recent negative trend continue leading up to its next earnings release, or is Lyft due for a breakout? Before we dive into how investors and analysts have reacted as of late, let's take a quick look at the most recent earnings report in order to get a better handle on the important catalysts.\n\nEarnings Beat at Lyft in Q1\n\nLyft reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of 15 cents per share which beat the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 9 cents and improved year over year.\n\nRevenues of $1,277.2 million also outpaced the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $1,170.1 million and improved 27.6% year over year, reflecting growth in the rideshare market. Active riders increased 12% year over year to 21.9 million.\n\nRevenue per active rider increased year over year to $56.67.Gross bookings reported for the quarter were $3.69 billion, marking a year-over-year increase of 21%.\n\nLyft’s adjusted EBITDA in the first quarter was $59.4 million. The adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as the percentage of gross bookings) was 1.6%.\n\nLyft exited the first quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $507.91 million compared with $558.63 million at the end of prior quarter. Long-term debt, net of the current portion at the end of the reported quarter, was $942.17 million compared with $839.36 million at prior quarter-end.\n\nGuidance\n\nFor the second quarter of 2024, LYFT expects gross bookings of $4.0 - $4.1 billion, which reflects year over year growth of 16-19%.The adjusted EBITDA is estimated to be $95-100million and adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of gross bookings) is expected to be around 2.4%.\n\nFor 2024, Lyft continues to anticipate rides year-over-year growth in the mid-teens. Adjusted EBITDA margin (calculated as a percentage of gross bookings) is expected to be around 2.1%.\n\nLyft remains on track to achieve positive free cash flow for the full year. Given its improved visibility into the first half of the year, Lyft now anticipates to convert at least 70% of adjusted EBITDA to free cash flow for the full-year 2024.\n\nHow Have Estimates Been Moving Since Then?\n\nIn the past month, investors have witnessed an upward trend in estimates review.\n\nThe consensus estimate has shifted 39.71% due to these changes.\n\nVGM Scores\n\nCurrently, Lyft has a great Growth Score of A, though it is lagging a lot on the Momentum Score front with a C. Charting a somewhat similar path, the stock was allocated a grade of D on the value side, putting it in the bottom 40% for this investment strategy.\n\nStory continues\n\nOverall, the stock has an aggregate VGM Score of B. If you aren't focused on one strategy, this score is the one you should be interested in.\n\nOutlook\n\nEstimates have been broadly trending upward for the stock, and the magnitude of these revisions looks promising. Notably, Lyft has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). We expect an in-line return from the stock in the next few months.\n\nPerformance of an Industry Player\n\nLyft belongs to the Zacks Internet - Services industry. Another stock from the same industry, Alphabet Inc. (GOOG), has gained 3.5% over the past month. More than a month has passed since the company reported results for the quarter ended March 2024.\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nAlphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +29.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1%.\n\nThe overall direction and magnitude of estimate revisions translate into a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. Also, the stock has a VGM Score of C.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "content": "Eli Lilly and Company LLY announced that its executive vice president and chief financial officer (CFO) Anat Ashkenazi has resigned after serving for 23 years at the company. Ashkenazi has joined Google’s parent company Alphabet GOOGL as CFO and senior vice president, effective Jul 31, 2024. Until then, she will continue to serve in her present role at Lilly.\n\nUntil Ashkenazi joins in her new role as CFO of Google and Alphabet, Ruth Porat, the present CFO of Alphabet will continue as CFO. In July last year, Alphabet announced that Ruth Porat would move into a new role as president & chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, effective from September 2023, but remain CFO until a successor was hired. Anat will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area and will report directly to Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai.\n\nAshkenazi has been Lilly’s CFO since 2021. Before she assumed the position of CFO, Ashkenazi served as senior vice president, controller, and chief financial officer of Lilly Research Laboratories, as well as CFO for Lilly’s several global business areas. Lilly has begun its search for a new CFO, both internally and externally.\n\nLilly’s stock has risen 42.7% year to date compared with an increase of 18.5% for the industry. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIn the last three years of her tenure as CFO, Lilly experienced tremendous growth. Its stock rose 273.8% in the last three years. Lilly’s revenue growth is being driven by higher demand for drugs like Mounjaro, Verzenio, Jardiance Taltz and others. Lilly’s new tirzepatide medicines, diabetes drug Mounjaro and weight loss medicine, Zepbound, have become key top-line drivers for Lilly despite a short time on the market. Mounjaro was launched in mid-2022. Zepbound was launched in November 2023.\n\nTirzepatide is a dual GIP and GLP-1 receptor agonist (GIP/GLP-1 RA). The GLP-1 segment is an important class of drugs for multiple cardiometabolic diseases and is gaining significant popularity with the demand for weight loss drugs rising rapidly. Lilly launched Mounjaro and Zepbound during Ashkenazi's time as CFO.\n\nIt is believed that Ashkenazi’s deep experience at Lilly will be good for Google and Alphabet, which is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence, growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market and cutting costs through layoffs. However, investors are surprised about Ashkenazi’s transition from the healthcare sector to the tech industry. Nonetheless, her experience in healthcare can help a tech giant like Alphabet push into the healthcare industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nZacks Rank and Stocks to Consider\n\nLilly currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nEli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus Eli Lilly and Company Price and Consensus\n\nEli Lilly and Company price-consensus-chart | Eli Lilly and Company Quote\n\nSome better-ranked stocks in the healthcare sector are Acrivon Therapeutics ACRV and Heron Therapeutics HRTX, with a Zacks Rank of 2 (Buy) each.

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.\n\nNvidia’s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, “Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.”\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the “Magnificent Seven” companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.83% at $1,214.17 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "eBay’s EBAY shares have risen 22.8% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Internet-Commerce industry’s rally of 12%. The company is gaining from the growing momentum in its e-commerce platform. eBay is constantly making strong efforts to strengthen its marketplace on the heels of generative AI technology.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the latest rollout of an AI-powered background-enhancement tool powered by the open-source model Stable Diffusion bodes well.\r\n\r\nThe tool is capable of removing the current image backgrounds and replacing them with a backdrop of choice automatically.\r\n\r\nCurrently, the new background-enhancement tool is available in the United States, the U.K. and Germany for iOS users. It will be rolled out for Android users eventually.\r\n\r\nThe underlined tool positions eBay well to gain substantial traction among several sellers who lack the skills or tools to create professional-looking backgrounds.\n\neBay Inc. Price and Consensus eBay Inc. Price and Consensus\n\neBay Inc. price-consensus-chart | eBay Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing AI Efforts Aid E-commerce Prospects\n\nAccording to a Mordor Intelligence report, the global e-commerce market size is expected to hit $8.8 trillion in 2024 and reach $18.8 trillion by 2029, witnessing a CAGR of 15.8% between 2024 and 2029.\r\n\r\nPer Statista data, revenues in the e-commerce market are expected to hit $4.12 trillion in 2024 and reach $6.48 trillion by 2029 by seeing a CAGR of 9.5% over 2024-2029.\r\n\r\nGiven the fact that AI and generative AI technologies have become mainstream in the e-commerce industry, eBay is well-poised to capitalize on the above-mentioned growth prospects on the back of its increasing AI efforts.\r\n\r\neBay’s recent unveiling of a “shop the look” generative AI-powered feature within the iOS mobile app, offering personalized recommendations for customers, is noteworthy. This interactive feature suggests similar items and outfit inspirations based on customers’ shopping history, enabling fashionistas to shop for pre-owned and luxury items that match their style.\r\n\r\nThe company’s collaboration with Microsoft to integrate Azure cloud-computing software and open AI application programming interface into its core listing flow is a plus.\r\n\r\nEBAY’s photo-to-listing AI tool is driving its momentum across marketplace sellers. The tool can create a product listing by automatically generating a title, description and information like product release date, category, subcategory, list price and shipping cost from a single photo.\r\n\r\nThe company’s acquisition of Certilogo, an AI-powered provider of digital IDs and authentication for apparel and fashion goods, is another positive. The buyout enables eBay to provide consumers with reliable product information and activate circular services.\r\n\r\nThese efforts are expected to aid eBay in delivering enhanced e-commerce experiences to both sellers and buyers, which, in turn, will boost traffic on its marketplace platform. This will drive its financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $10.26 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 1.5%.\r\n\r\nThe same for 2024 EPS stands at $4.70, implying growth of 10.9% from 2023’s actual. The estimate has moved 0.2% north in the past seven days.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenerative AI Strength Aids Competitive Edge\n\nGrowing generative AI capabilities will help the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company in competing with its peers like Amazon AMZN and Shopify SHOP, who are also making increasing efforts to incorporate generative AI within their marketplace. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s introduction of an AI tool for sellers, which can write product listings from a series of keywords, remains noteworthy. The tool marks the first integration of large-language models into the company’s e-commerce business.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Shopify Magic, Shopify’s AI tool, comes with the feature of AI-generated product descriptions with a built-in wordsmith in the merchant’s admin.\r\n\r\nShopify’s partnership with Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Cloud to help millions of merchants meet customers’ increasing demands while delivering generative AI-backed shopping experiences is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is leaving no stone unturned to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI in the e-commerce industry.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google provides advanced tools to advertisers, which allow various brands to create product imagery with the help of generative AI.\r\n\r\nThe search giant also offers a chatbot, namely Conversational Commerce Solution, which features generative AI-powered virtual agents that can be integrated into retailers’ websites and mobile apps.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Buying Up This Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia has been one of the best-performing stocks in the market since 2023. However, after the stellar run it has been on, some lofty expectations are built in. While Nvidia will likely hit these goals, investors may be better off looking at companies that don't have as high of expectations.\n\nThat's exactly what many billionaires have been doing in their hedge funds. Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) was a popular purchase among some top hedge funds (and the billionaires that run them). In the first quarter, some that increased their Alphabet positions were Ray Dalio's Bridgewater Associates, Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management, and George Soros' Soros Fund Management.\n\nAlthough Nvidia is a strong artificial intelligence (AI) pick, Alphabet is also a fantastic investment.\n\nAlphabet has multiple ways to benefit from AI\n\nAlphabet has multiple ways to benefit from the rise of AI, but the avenue that will have the largest result is advertising. In Q1, more than three-quarters of Alphabet's revenue came from advertising. AI has already been used for some time in advertising, as it's used to pinpoint what type of ads will drive the highest return for Alphabet's customers.\n\nAlthough it's becoming more mainstream, AI has been around for a while. However, the latest iteration of the technology, generative AI, has some useful features that allow people to use the technology without needing a programming background. One way Alphabet deployed generative AI into its platform is by integrating it into its compliance software, Performance Max (PMax). This is essentially a checklist for advertisers to ensure their ads have the best possible chance of succeeding. In the past, it used to take multiple iterations to construct an ad meeting all criteria. Now, Gemini (Alphabet's generative AI product) automatically writes ads that meet the criteria.\n\nAlphabet's in-house generative AI platform, Gemini, has had its fair share of problems, but those are starting to get ironed out. Now that it is more accurate, customers can build their models on the Gemini platform. Alphabet will charge a fee to companies that do this, giving it another stream of cash.\n\nAnother avenue is Google Cloud. Running AI models takes serious computing power, and many companies either don't have it or can't justify spending millions of dollars on a system that may not be used enough to justify its cost. Cloud computing is the answer to this problem, allowing anyone to rent computing space from a cloud computing provider like Google Cloud.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhether it's data storage or processing power, Google Cloud has clients covered. With access to the latest generation of Nvidia GPUs for training models, Google Cloud is a top competitor in this space.\n\nAlphabet is set to benefit from the latest wave of AI, making it a must-own stock. It's also priced at a reasonable point.\n\nThe stock doesn't carry a massive price tag\n\nBecause many companies are experiencing massive changes and growth due to AI, it's smart to look at a company's forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Although it uses analyst projections to determine what a company's earnings may be over the next 12 months, which aren't perfect, it's still a good guide for investors.\n\nCompared to Nvidia's 41 times earnings, Alphabet's stock is much cheaper. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 23 times forward earnings, Alphabet is a reasonably priced stock. Compared to the broader market's forward P/E of 21.5 (measured by the S&P 500), Alphabet doesn't hold much of a premium.\n\nThis is why Alphabet is such a better pick than Nvidia. It's reasonably priced, so any business gains will go toward increasing its stock price rather than meeting lofty expectations and reducing the premium investors have to pay for a stock.\n\nThese billionaires think Alphabet is a great buy right now. Long-term investors who want less risky exposure to AI should consider making Alphabet one of their top picks.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Alphabet’s next CFO Anat Ashkenazi ‘fills a void’ for the company at key time during AI Revolution, says top analyst",
        "content": "Good morning. Eli Lilly and Company’s finance chief Anat Ashkenazi was tapped as the next CFO and SVP of Google and Alphabet, and Dan Ives, Wedbush Securities managing partner, believes the tech giant has made a solid hire.\n\n“This was a strong candidate that fills a void for Alphabet at a key time in its growth transformation and ‘AI Revolution,’” Ives told me. “She has a strong reputation and great CFO experience.” Eli Lilly and Company veteran Anat Ashkenazi is heading to Alphabet Inc. to become the next finance chief. Courtesy of Eli Lilly and Company\n\nAlphabet Inc., no. 8 on the 2024 Fortune 500 list, and the parent company of Google, announced on Wednesday that Ashkenazi will succeed Ruth Porat, effective July 31. A 23-year veteran of the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company Lilly, Ashkenazi began her CFO role in 2021. During her tenure, other roles included CFO of Lilly Research Laboratories, CFO for several of the company’s global business areas, and leader of corporate strategy.\n\nPorat, CFO since 2015, and Alphabet's longest-serving finance chief, was promoted to a new role as president and chief investment officer of Alphabet and Google, previously announced in July 2023. Porat continued to occupy the CFO role as the company and board searched for her successor.\n\nAn 11-month search is on the “longer side of the spectrum,” Scott W. Simmons, co-managing partner of executive search firm Crist Kolder Associates, told me. However, the new CFO has “big shoes to fill, which immediately narrows the pool of viable candidates,” he added.\n\nAshkenazi is leaving Lilly on a high note. The company ranks no. 127 on the Fortune 500, jumping up 15 spots from last year’s ranking. Lilly earned $34 billion in revenue in 2023. She has been at the helm of finance as sales and demand for weight-loss drugs has skyrocketed. In Q1, worldwide revenue for Lilly rose 26% to $8.77 billion year over year, driven by the sales of Mounjaro and Zepbound.\n\n'The CFO should anchor the organization'\n\nIn my conversation with Ashkenazi last winter about the competitive pricing of Zepbound, we also talked about her career journey at the company.\n\n“When I joined Lilly, I started on the business development side in venture investing, which is very kind of financially driven,” Ashkenazi explained. “But then I moved into strategy, and it opened my eyes to other areas, and I absolutely loved it. I love the breadth of looking at the entire business, the entire value chain from start to finish. I enjoyed being at the forefront of making really important decisions looking at very challenging and complex problems. And that’s where my career shifted a little bit and got on the CFO track.”\n\nStory continues\n\nShe added that during times of success and growth, or in challenging times, “the CFO should anchor the organization back to its core mission and values and chart the course forward.”\n\nIn Ashkenazi, Alphabet has found “a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,” Google and Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai said in a statement on Wednesday. Pichai also mentioned that he looks forward to working with Ashkenazi to invest responsibly in the company’s next wave of growth in the AI era.\n\n“Google’s growth and evolution over the last 25 years has been an incredible story, helping billions of people and millions of businesses around the world,” Ashkenazi said in a statement. The opportunity to have an impact is \"greater than ever,\" she said.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia overtakes Apple as its market capitalisation surpasses $3tn (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nUS chip designer Nvidia became the third US company to reach a market valuation of more than $3tn (£2.4tn) on Wednesday, overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world’s second most valuable company.\n\nNvidia’s shares jumped 5.2%, propelling its market capitalisation to more than $3tn to become the world’s second-largest company behind Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNvidia’s chips are powering much of the rush into AI, which has seen it become a poster child of the AI boom, with demand for its processors from the likes of Google (GOOG), Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta (META) outstripping supply.\n\nNvidia’s shares – up nearly 150% so far this year – are also being boosted by an upcoming move to split its stock by 10-to-one on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets creep higher as ECB expected to cut interest rates\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said the stock split will “bring its share price down and make it more affordable to investors who cannot afford to splash out more than a grand per share, as well as benefit employees who use some of their monthly pay packets to invest in the company.”\n\nLululemon (LULU)\n\nLululemon beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates but issued weak second-quarter guidance as it contends with a slowdown in the Americas, its largest market.\n\nThe yoga pants maker also raised its share buyback authorisation by $1bn, the second time in six months that the company has increased its returns to shareholders. Shares of Lululemon jumped 10% in pre-market trading.\n\nThe company’s revenue grew by 10% year over year to $2.2bn in the quarter ended April 28, in line with projections. Top-line growth was driven by a 35% revenue increase from international markets — including a nearly 50% increase in China — while in the Americas sales rose by a mere 3%.\n\nCEO Calvin McDonald touted the “strong momentum” the company is seeing in its international markets and hinted that it needs to do more work in the Americas.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We are pleased by the progress we are making to optimise our US product assortment,” said McDonald. “Looking ahead, we continue to have a significant runway for growth and are confident in our team’s ability to powerfully deliver.”\n\nFever-Tree (FEVR.L)\n\nPremium drink mixer brand Fever-Tree has reported growth across its markets in 2024 as it looks to capitalise on the key summer selling season when more customers spend on cocktails like mojitos and margaritas.\n\nWhile no numbers or guidance was given in a relatively short trading update to accompany the company's annual general meeting, management said it remained \"comfortable\" with full-year expectations.\n\nThe tonic maker said it has “strengthened its category-leading position” in the UK, while it “continues to be the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category” in the US.\n\nIt said the brand has continued to “deliver topline growth in the year to date.”\n\nRead more: Darktrace and Vistry promoted to FTSE 100 as Ocado and St James Place crash out\n\nLast year, the company saw profits fall 23%, despite sales growing 6%, but said it was \"on track to double EBITDA\" in 2024.\n\nGold (GC=F)\n\nThe rally in the metal market continues with gold touching $2,381 amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the US economy continues to expand in its service sector, boosting the golden metal.\n\nHowever, investors were caught by surprise over the announcement that a review has been launched by the trade body, which sets the global benchmark for gold prices, after doubts were raised about the purity of some precious metals from a supplier.\n\nThe London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) said it is reviewing allegations involving Indonesian state miner Aneka Tambang (Antam) over the purity of its gold products.\n\nAneka Tambang last week denied reports that there were 109 tons of counterfeit ANTAM gold circulating in the community in the period 2010-2021.\n\nIndonesia’s Attorney General Office has named six former general managers at Antam’s Precious Metal Processing and Refining Business Unit as suspects for alleged misuse of Antam’s stamping service.\n\nThe country is a major player in the global mining industry but has faced criticism as more than half of all tropical deforestation directly attributable to industrial mining takes place in Indonesia, according to new research conducted at Clark University.\n\nLBMA, an industry body whose rules for gold refineries require that they source gold responsibly, said that an Incident Review Process (IRP) has been invoked to review the current circumstances.\n\nWatch: Nvidia passes Apple as second-most valuable firm</p><p>Shares in the chipmaker jumped over 5% Wednesday, taking its market value to a little over $3 trillion. </p><p>That put it just ahead of the iPhone maker.</p><p>Nvidia stock has been soaring on bets it’s going to be the big winner from the AI boom. </p><p>The firm’s chips power products like ChatGPT, and are in hot demand around the world. </p><p>It has raised sales forecasts over and over again.</p><p>That has seen the stock gain 147% so far this year. </p><p>Now some analysts say it looks likely Nvidia could overtake Microsoft as well, to become the world’s most valuable company. </p><p>One said the big difference is that the chip firm is already making big money from AI, while rivals are having to spend huge amounts on the technology. </p><p>As for Apple, it’s been struggling with weak demand for its phones, and mounting competition in China. </p><p>Investors have also criticized it for lagging rivals in offering AI services. </p><p>Its stock has barely risen this year. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zVZHxvVxbxrzq5_azhD0WA--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/cef9687c21616206781155e31d2edb79\",\"duration\":\"PT1M13S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-passes-apple-second-most-050332350.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Google Alum Yu Seeks $500 Million for Fund Tied to Alphabet’s X",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Gideon Yu, the former chief financial officer of YouTube and Facebook, is leading an effort to raise about $500 million for a fund affiliated with Alphabet Inc.’s moonshot lab, X, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBillionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day A Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions Nvidia Tops $3 Trillion in Market Value, Leapfrogging Apple S&P 500 Hits 25th Record This Year as Tech Soars: Markets Wrap BlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE\n\nYu is working to launch a fund that would be independent but closely affiliated with the lab, according to multiple people familiar with the situation, who added that many key details are still being hashed out. The effort would be focused on investing in startups that spin out from X, an outcome that the lab is embracing as Alphabet ramps up financial discipline.\n\nThe group is aiming to complete the financing by the end of this year, said some of the people, all of whom asked not to be identified discussing private information. They also said that the fundraising target could change.\n\nA spokesperson for X declined to comment. Yu did not respond to requests for comment. Alphabet itself is not raising a fund, one person said.\n\nLaunched by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin in 2010, X dazzled the public with its attempts to find imaginative solutions to some of the world’s biggest problems. But in recent years, the lab has had to pursue its mission on a budget as Alphabet has sharpened its focus on search and artificial intelligence.\n\nIn January, the lab laid off dozens of employees and undertook a restructuring intended to make it easier for its projects, which have included the self-driving car effort Waymo and augmented reality headset Google Glass, to carry on their work outside the lab. Known internally as Scale Co., the new fund will support X spinouts as they enter their next phase of growth — or scale, in Silicon Valley parlance — the people said.\n\nYu and his team have been meeting with prospective investors, an effort that has included going straight to the organizations that typically back VC firms as limited partners. Yu is trying to raise cash at a difficult time for the venture industry overall. Last quarter, 100 funds raised a lackluster $9.3 billion, according to PitchBook data. That compares to more than $70 billion raised in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nIf Yu and his team are successful, their fund would be the fourth that is affiliated with Google and its parent company Alphabet, joining GV, CapitalG and Gradient Ventures.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Wednesday, Alphabet announced that Eli Lilly & Co. executive Anat Ashkenazi will serve as its new CFO, replacing Ruth Porat. Porat has moved into a new role as president and chief investment officer, in which she will oversee a division that includes X. In a statement to Bloomberg last month, she said she was “excited that X leadership is increasingly pursuing opportunities to scale and monetize many of those innovations to deliver sustainable value creation.”\n\nAmong the most prominent startups that have spun out from X is 280 Earth, which uses industrial waste heat to power machines that suck carbon out of the air. The startup, which has been cited as a model for future spinouts, attracted investment from Brin and Yu.\n\nIn an interview last month, Yu said he was drawn to X’s focus on society’s biggest problems, and the years of rigorous vetting that the projects have undergone in the lab.\n\n“I am doing everything I can to convince Astro and Ivo and Benoit to allow me to invest in more projects,” Yu said, referring to X leaders Astro Teller, Ivo Stivoric and Benoit Schillings. “I would consider that an incredible source of potential deal flow, potential investments for myself.”\n\nBut X may have to overcome some skepticism from investors who question why Alphabet is parting with the projects, or who were irked by previous interactions with the lab. For much of its history, X didn’t have much interest in meeting with venture capitalists and other key players in Silicon Valley, seeking to cultivate a spirit of isolationism that they believed was crucial for hatching bold, world-changing ideas.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Former House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is holding a substantially profitable position in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock, according to analysts tracking the trades of Congress members and their families.\n\nUnusual Whales, a financial services platform that focuses on congressional insider trading, among other things, said on Wednesday that Pelosi has nearly $4 million in gains from the Nvidia call options her husband, Paul Pelosi, purchased in November. These call options allow investors to buy shares at a predetermined price.\n\n“She is up +210% in 197 days&still not sold her calls. Pelosi has made twenty times her salary,” Unusual Whales wrote on X. “Her portfolio is near all-time highs, up 93%.”\n\nChristopher Josephs, co-founder of Autopilot—an app that tracks and mirrors politicians' trades—told FOX Business that while it's challenging to pinpoint the exact amount of Pelosi's initial investment due to the broad range of $1 million to $5 million in the filing, Unusual Whales' figures seem accurate.\n\n\"This year, the Pelosi Portfolio not only has a winner in Nvidia, but her other stocks have also performed well, including CrowdStrike Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:CRWD), which is up 45% year-to-date and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which is up 27% year-to-date,\" Josephs told FOX.\n\n\"We estimate that her year-to-date performance based on her stock filings is 28%, which outperforms the SPY by 16.5%.\"\n\nWhen asked for comment, a spokesperson for Rep. Pelosi stated, \"Speaker Pelosi does not own any stocks, and she has no prior knowledge or subsequent involvement in any transactions.\" FOX Business also contacted Paul Pelosi to seek a comment.\n\nThe statement from Pelosi's office is nearly identical to one provided by the former speaker's communications director to FOX News Digital in 2022, when one of her husband's Nvidia trades faced intense scrutiny.\n\nThat year, Paul Pelosi acquired over $1 million in Nvidia call options just weeks before a congressional vote on providing substantial subsidies to the chip manufacturing industry. He sold them after she faced criticism over the timing of the trades.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNancy Pelosi has made 20 times her salary in just one trade\n\nDelta seeks new Seattle flight as airlines jockey over DC slots\n\nChina's Nio expects Q2 EV sales to more than double\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) ticked higher in premarket trading on Thursday, pointing to an extension to a rally in the prior session that saw the artificial intelligence chip designer top $3 trillion in market capitalization and overtake iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nThe California-based firm has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI. Demand for its AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nIn an unexpected move earlier this week, Nvidia unveiled plans for its new \"Rubin\" chip only months after it announced its most recent launch. The company, which faces intensifying competition from chipmaking rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as in-house processors made by large cloud computing firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said it is targeting a \"one-year\" cadence of releases.\n\nNvidia also reported another quarter of bumper earnings in May, including a 262% year-on-year spike in revenue, and revealed a 10-for-one stock split that is set take effect on June 7.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is expected to announce more details about its plans for AI at its much-anticipated developers conference next week. Compared to many of its Big Tech peers, the group has so far said relatively little about its AI ambitions, although Chief Executive Tim Cook has remarked that the technology represents a \"key opportunity.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia shares edge higher premarket after AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3 trn\n\nFundamentals points to further stock gains - UBS\n\nAmazon buys assets of Indian video streaming service MX Player - report\n\nView comments",

The Federal Trade Commission is now seeking information about how they negotiated that partnership, the Journal reported. The unusual deal resembled an “acqui-hire” — where big companies take over startups mostly for their employees — but without an acquisition.

        "title": "Dell Stock (NYSE:DELL): Still Too Expensive Despite Recent Plunge",
        "content": "Hardware, storage, and peripherals manufacturer Dell (NYSE:DELL) has become one of the most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the market today. After the company reported its most recent earnings results at the end of May, the stock price crashed nearly 20% because of all the built-up hype and enthusiasm accumulated in Dell’s stock price. Even with the recent sell-off, I still tend to see Dell as a company trading at too expensive a valuation not to have its business entirely AI-driven, so I have a neutral stance on the company.\n\nIn this article, I’ll dive deeper into its latest quarterly results to see what’s happening at Dell.\n\nDell’s Fiscal Q1 2025 in Review\n\nThe Round Rock-based company delivered nearly everything investors wanted to hear in its most recent quarter. Sales increased annually by 6.2% to $22.2 billion for the period ending May 3, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $21.6 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was $1.27 per share, in line with the consensus.\n\nBefore delving into the details, it’s important to note that Dell operates in two distinct business segments: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which deals with servers, networking, and storage, and the personal computing Client Solutions Group (CSG). While the latter has faced challenges in recent years, the server business is thriving, primarily due to the significant investment in AI spending in this sector.\n\nThis was precisely the panorama reported in recent earnings for Fiscal Q1 2025. Dell reported Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) revenue of $9.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year, with record servers and networking revenue of $5.5 billion, up 42%, while Client Solutions Group (CSG) revenue was $12.0 billion, flat year-over-year, with commercial client revenue at $10.2 billion, up just 3%.\n\nOne of the main areas of market interest is AI, where Dell has significant growth potential. The company reported that its AI server backlog was $3.8 billion, increasing sequentially by approximately $900 million. In other words, demand for orders has been outpacing Dell’s ability to deliver, primarily due to the growth in the AI sector.\n\nHowever, the impacts of AI aren’t solely restricted to ISG. Another important point highlighted by Dell is the optimism surrounding CSG. Commercial PC demand is anticipated to experience a significant improvement as the year progresses into a new refresh cycle, driven not only by an upcoming Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows refresh cycle but also by an anticipated increase in PC demand as the industry makes major advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell’s Next Steps Toward AI\n\nDell’s management also emphasized the company’s plans to capitalize on AI in the short term. The company launched the Dell AI Factory, which should help accelerate its adoption of AI by combining workload-optimized solutions with an open ecosystem for partners such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn addition, Dell has enhanced its direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology with a GPU server that boosts power efficiency by 2.5 times. This innovation is crucial for hyperscaler companies, including leading Big Tech firms in the cloud industry like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which seek power-efficient solutions for their extensive server requirements and costly GPUs.\n\nBy offering more power-efficient solutions, it will be possible to lower costs and enhance industry performance. At the current level, Dell stands out as one of the main alternatives to provide this support and improve the efficiency and profitability of companies’ AI capabilities.\n\nThe Turning Point in Dell’s Quarter\n\nIn general, Dell’s reported results were fairly consistent, with several positive points to praise. But even when everything seemed to be going well in Round Rock, Texas, there was still a significant problem that the company was going to communicate to its shareholders: Dell’s guidance regarding its gross margin, which will be partly dragged lower by AI-optimized servers.\n\n“Given inflationary input costs, the competitive environment, and a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, we expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points,” Dell’s CFO said during the earnings call.\n\nAlthough Dell’s management team emphasized its commitment to a disciplined cost structure, expecting operating expenses to fall by low-single digits, around 3% annually by 2024, this was not enough to reassure investors. As a result, that was the inflection point for a major sell-off in Dell’s stock following the earnings call.\n\nOf course, the reasons for Wall Street’s disillusionment with Dell’s results didn’t stop there.\n\nThe adverse reaction emphasizes that Dell has been priced with very high expectations regarding its AI potential. Shares had appreciated by around 280% in the last 12 months until the earnings day. This took the company from a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 16x in May 2023 to a multiple that reached beyond 36x in late May 2024. It’s at ~28x today, reflecting its revaluation based on its AI capabilities.\n\nI still believe that Dell is an expensive company relative to its growth since it’s not an AI-only business. Dell’s AI segment accounts for less than 40% of its overall revenue. Given this fact and the little-to-no growth prospects for the rest of the business in the long term, I don’t think Dell deserves the premium valuation of about double that of its peers.\n\nIs DELL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe analyst consensus toward DELL is bullish, giving the stock a Strong Buy rating. The average Dell stock price target, based on projections from 12 Wall Street analysts over the last three months, stands at $157.15 for the next 12 months. This implies 14.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDell reported another consistent and promising quarter. However, it was overshadowed by its gross margin guidance, which fell below market expectations.\n\nWe’re still in the early days of the AI-server boom, and Dell is doing well to establish its presence in this market. However, the company’s shift from a hardware focus to an AI-centric business has led to a high valuation multiple, creating challenges in accurately assessing how much AI will contribute to Dell’s market value.\n\nConsidering that Dell seems overpriced for a hardware company—and hardware is still its main source of revenue—the current valuation carries a high risk of slippage from expectations of increased profitability growth in AI. That said, I prefer to adopt a cautious stance, remaining neutral on Dell stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Futures muted, Nvidia's market cap jumps above $3 trillion - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures were muted following a rally in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite on Wednesday. Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) market capitalization soars above $3 trillion, as the artificial intelligence chip designer becomes the world's second most valuable company. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) posts better-than-anticipated first-quarter results, sending shares in the athleisure group higher in after-hours trading.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Thursday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both posted record high closing levels in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract and Dow futures were mostly unchanged, while Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 26 points or 0.1%.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 1.18% to 5,354.03 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 1.95% to 17,186.38. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished higher, adding 0.3% to 38,807.33.\n\nSupporting the rally was the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which slid to a two-month low following weaker-than-anticipated private payrolls data. The figures -- as well as a separate report earlier this week which showed job openings dipping to their lowest level in over three years in April -- pointed to a softening in the U.S. labor market.\n\nEasing demand for workers could relieve some upward pressure on inflation, bolstering hopes that the Federal Reserve will possibly slash interest rates down from more than two-decade highs later this year.\n\n2. Nvidia surpasses Apple as world's second most valuable company\n\nNvidia's market capitalization surged past $3 trillion on Wednesday, as the artificial intelligence chip designer overtook iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nThe California-based company has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI. Demand for the firm's AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nIn an unexpected move earlier this week, Nvidia unveiled plans for its new \"Rubin\" chip only months after it announced its most recent launch. The company, which faces intensifying competition from chipmaking rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as in-house processors made by large cloud computing firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said it is targeting a \"one-year\" cadence of releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia also reported another quarter of bumper earnings in May, including a 262% spike in revenue, and revealed a 10-for-one stock split that is set take effect on June 7.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is expected to announce more details about its plans for AI at its much-anticipated developers conference next week. Compared to many of its Big Tech peers, the group has so far said relatively little about its AI ambitions, although Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a recent earnings call that the technology represents a \"key opportunity.\"\n\n3. Lululemon shares jump after-hours\n\nShares in Lululemon Athletica rose by more than 9% in extended hours trading after the premium athletic apparel retailer posted first-quarter profit and sales that topped estimates.\n\nThe Canadian company known for its pricey leggings reported quarterly per-share income of $2.54, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $2.38, while net revenue of $2.21 billion was above projections of $2.19 billion. It also lifted its guidance for annual earnings per share and reiterated its full-year net revenue outlook.\n\nStrength in mainland China, where same-store sales increased by 26% versus the year-ago period, offset flat top-line returns in the Americas. Analysts cited by Reuters noted that Lululemon has been building up its presence in China to take advantage of relatively muted domestic competition and counteract sluggish demand among inflation-squeezed U.S. shoppers.\n\nMeanwhile, Lululemon, whose share price has slumped by 39% so far this year, signed off on a $1 billion uptick to its stock buyback program.\n\n4. ECB decision looms\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely tipped to slash interest rates down from record high levels at its meeting on Thursday.\n\nBuoyed by signs that inflation in the euro zone currency area is easing toward the ECB's 2% target, policymakers have all but telegraphed the decision in the build-up to the gathering.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said in May that she believes price pressures are \"under control,\" particularly as the impact of an energy crisis and supply chain constraints fades. Philip Lane, the central bank's Chief Economist, also told the Financial Times in an interview that \"barring major surprises\" officials see enough in recent data \"to remove the top level of restriction.\"\n\nInvestors are wagering that the ECB will cut its benchmark deposit rate, which currently stands at an all-time high of 4%, by a quarter percentage point. But uncertainty remains over how policymakers will approach future potential reductions later this year, with analysts at ING suggesting in a note that they \"doubt the ECB will have much to say\" on the topic.\n\n5. Crude inches higher\n\nCrude prices edged higher Thursday, boosted by the overall positive sentiment, but are still on course for hefty weekly losses.\n\nBy 03:24 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.7% higher at $74.60 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $78.88 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts are headed for weekly declines of around 4%, weighed down by the decision from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to leave room for voluntary output cuts to be unwound gradually, beginning in October.\n\nThe crude market was also hit by the news that U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.2 million barrels in the week to May 31, compared with estimates for a draw of 2.3 million barrels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures muted, Nvidia's market cap jumps above $3 trillion - what's moving markets\n\nRussian central bank urges global integration despite sanctions\n\nNo-tariff shipments popular with Shein, Temu hit US customs speedbump\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Elon Musk’s xAI plans to develop a new facility in Memphis to house a giant supercomputer, a move by the artificial intelligence startup to boost its capacity in the race to build and offer chatbots and other AI-powered tools.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority SEC Hedge Fund Fee Disclosure Rule Struck Down by US Court ‘Mag Seven’ Drive US Stocks Toward All-Time Highs: Markets Wrap Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India?\n\nMusk and his team at xAI have been working with officials in the Tennessee city since early March to plan the new factory, which would be the “largest multibillion-dollar investment in the city of Memphis’s history,” said Ted Townsend, president of the Greater Memphis Chamber, a local nonprofit funded by the city’s private business community.\n\nMany details about the new facility have yet to be disclosed, including the total cost and the number of jobs it will create, Townsend added. The city has also discussed offering xAI tax breaks or other business incentives to lure the project to Memphis, but those specifics are still pending, he added.\n\n“We have work to do, make no mistake,” he said. “But we’re really incredibly grateful for the interest from Elon and his executives and the xAI team.” The new site’s details were first reported by the Daily Memphian. Musk didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the plans.\n\nMusk has made xAI a priority over the past year in an effort to keep up with competitors including OpenAI, Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Meta Platforms Inc. The company’s main product, an AI chatbot called Grok, is available inside Musk’s social networking app, X. It was “designed to answer questions with a bit of wit and has a rebellious streak,” according to the product’s description. Musk has described Grok as being a counterpoint to “woke” AI chatbots from other companies.\n\nTo help build this vision, xAI recently announced $6 billion in new venture capital funding that valued the company at more than $24 billion, including the new investment capital. An investor presentation from May included mention of Musk’s plan for a “gigafactory of compute” and said he hoped to have it completed by the fall of 2025, according to The Information.\n\nA spokesperson for Memphis Mayor Paul Young also declined to elaborate on the project’s cost, jobs and tax incentives, saying those details were “still in development.”\n\n“We like to say that innovation is in our DNA — from the birth of the modern-day hotel, grocery store, and overnight delivery to groundbreaking medical discoveries, the blues and rock ‘n’ roll,” Young said in a statement shared with Bloomberg. “We are a city of innovators, and it makes sense that Memphis feels like home to those seeking to change the world.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "title": "Why Apple’s generative AI push won’t launch an iPhone supercycle in 2024",
        "content": "We’re less than a week out from Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which kicks off on June 10 at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. This year the company is expected to unveil its big generative AI push with new capabilities for the iPhone.\n\nThe moves are likely to energize investors who have been anxiously awaiting Apple’s foray into generative AI. But don’t expect generative AI itself to spur a new iPhone sales supercycle this year. That’s because when it comes to smartphones, users care more about hardware than software.\n\n“I don't think it's going to become the primary reason why people buy an iPhone,” explained Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. “It's more likely going to augment experiences.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean generative AI won’t power iPhone sales in the coming years. That’s because as phones age and become unable to run generative AI experiences, users will inevitably have to upgrade.\n\nIt’s all about the hardware… at first\n\nPeople generally buy new smartphones for the hardware, not software.\n\n“The typical consumer is not going to care [about generative AI],” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “They want to know screen size, No. 1. Second is camera, third is battery.”\n\nThere’s another reason generative AI on the iPhone is unlikely to get people to line up outside of their local Apple Store: The software is still too new.\n\nMany of the consumer offerings out there are still relatively basic. Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot will soon provide helpful tips on how to fix common PC issues, and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini for Workspace makes drafting emails easier. But by and large, there’s no must-have generative AI app.\n\nEven Microsoft’s AI-centric Copilot+ PCs are more interesting for their new Qualcomm (QCOM) chips, which are supposed to rival Apple’s own M3 processors, than for the AI software they’re named after. Supercharge sales? An Apple store in Pittsburgh. AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“If you go to Joe and Jane Smith on Main Street, USA, and say to them, 'Hey, you can have Gen AI in your iPhone,' now they're going to say, 'Great. Now, what do I do with it?' And that's the … intersection that we find ourselves at right now,” explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, Apple will roll out a new, smarter version of Siri that will allow you to control apps with your voice and transcribe recordings, new photo editing tools, and enhanced notifications all powered by generative AI.\n\nSure, making Siri useful would be a huge step in the right direction, though it will be interesting to see how often people end up using the voice assistant. After all, when was the last time you asked Siri to do anything other than set a cooking timer or find out the weather for the next day?\n\nStory continues\n\nTranscription and photo editing tools would also be helpful, but Google and Samsung already offer those features in their own phones, and they don’t seem to be driving sales. And it's likely Apple will also offer its own take on transcription and photo apps too.\n\nMore importantly, we’ll have to wait to see how iPhone developers end up using generative AI technologies to improve their own third-party apps. Think about it. You likely spend most of your time on your iPhone using third-party apps like WhatsApp, TikTok, or Gmail. The same will be true with generative AI-powered apps, but it’ll take time for developers to get them up and running.\n\nSales will come\n\nWhile generative AI might not kick off a sales bonanza this year, it will get consumers to pony up for new iPhones in the coming years. That’s because generative AI features will require some of Apple’s latest chips, and users with older phones will either be unable to use those functions or they’ll run slowly. And nothing gets people to want to buy a new phone than when apps are slow.\n\n“It'll take six months, a year, two, three years, for people to start to understand that the hardware that they had pre-generative AI isn't performing as well as your phone,” Munster said. “The battery won't last, because it will be putting more weight on the CPU or the AI chip … things like that. I think that this iPhone AI upgrade cycle, it's like a two- or three-year cycle.”\n\nThat’s not to say Apple might not see a sales bump in September when it releases its next iPhone. The smartphone market, in general, is starting to turn around after a two-year slog. According to IDC, global smartphone sales should improve by 4% year over year in 2024. The majority of that, however, will come from Android sales, though iPhone shipments should improve some 0.7%. Not exactly a staggering number, but an increase, nonetheless.\n\nAs for the sales boost, that’s more likely to come further down the line as Apple fine-tunes its generative AI features and developers fire off more generative AI-powered apps that tax older iPhones. As for the supercycle, it’ll just have to wait. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "A multibillion-pound claim against Google over allegations that it has behaved anti-competitively in the advertising tech space can proceed to trial, the UK’s Competition Appeal Tribunal has ruled.\n\nThe £13.6 billion claim, brought by a group called Ad Tech Collective Action LLP, alleges that Google has abused its dominant position in the digital advertising space, causing significant losses to UK online publishers.\n\nIn its attempts to get the legal action dropped, Google called the case “incoherent”, but the Competition Appeal Tribunal has now ruled that it can go to trial.\n\nThe case centres around advertising technology, or ad tech, the system that decides which online adverts people see and how much they cost – a major source of revenue for many websites and a vital, valuable sector for Google because its search engine is the most widely used and it offers a number of services in the ad tech space.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAt the heart of the Ad Tech Collective Action argument is the claim that Google has abused its position in the market by promoting its own products and services over those of its rivals.\n\nIt argues that the activity has meant publishers have received less money from ads they host, as well as paying higher fees to Google.\n\nClaudio Pollack, a partner of Ad Tech Collective Action, said: “This is a decision of major importance to the victims of Google’s anti-competitive conduct in ad tech. Google will now have to answer for its practices in a full trial.\n\n“I look forward to working with our legal and economic advisers to deliver compensation for years during which the relevant markets did not provide a competitive outcome for the UK publishing market.”\n\nNo court date has yet been set for the trial.\n\nOliver Bethell, legal director at Google, said: “Google works constructively with publishers across the UK and Europe – our advertising tools, and those of our many ad tech competitors, help millions of websites and apps fund their content, and enable businesses of all sizes to effectively reach new customers.\n\nStory continues\n\n“These services adapt and evolve in partnership with those same publishers.\n\n“This lawsuit is speculative and opportunistic. We’ll oppose it vigorously and on the facts.”\n\nThe legal action comes as Google is under scrutiny from regulators in the UK, US and Europe around its actions in the ad tech sector.",

Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the global generative AI market size is expected to hit $67.2 billion in 2024 and reach $967.7 by 2032, seeing a CAGR of 39.6% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is well-poised to capitalize on the above-mentioned prospect, thanks to its growing generative AI efforts.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google upgraded Android Studio's bot with Gemini Pro, which will enable developers to ask coding-related questions. Users will be able to add generative AI-powered features to their apps seamlessly by accessing the Gemini API starter template through Android Studio.\r\n\r\nThe company also made Gemini 1.5 Pro available in a public preview on Vertex AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle unveiled LearnLM, a family of generative AI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects.\r\n\r\nIts introduction of the latest additions to the Gemma family of open models, including Gemma 2, the next generation with a 27-billion parameter model, and PaliGemma, the first vision language model for image captioning, labeling and Q&A use cases, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle also introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure. The new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA’s NVDA GPUs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities across various products will help Google deliver enhanced user experience, which, in turn, is expected to aid Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $295.53 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.2%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.60 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31%. The EPS estimate has moved 0.4% north over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growing generative efforts are making the battle intensified for its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, which are also flexing muscles to bolster generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft continues to make strong efforts to boost its generative AI capabilities. Its integration of GPT-4 into its search engine Bing and browser Edge to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience to users remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure offers the Azure OpenAI Service, which enables the seamless application of LLM and generative AI techniques in various use cases. It recently launched the latest copilot templates on Azure OpenAI Service that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and support store operations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on an ambitious venture to establish a cutting-edge data center project to address the imperative need for advanced infrastructure to manage generative AI-driven complex data and tasks.\r\n\r\nThen again, Amazon’s AWS is riding on Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nIts latest partnership with NVIDIA to power its portfolio with the generative AI technology is another positive. Per the terms, the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform will be available on AWS. This will help speed up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Taps Eli Lilly Executive as New CFO Replacing Porat",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Alphabet Inc. named Eli Lilly & Co. executive Anat Ashkenazi as its new chief financial officer, replacing Ruth Porat who announced last year she planned to step down.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority SEC Hedge Fund Fee Disclosure Rule Struck Down by US Court ‘Mag Seven’ Drive US Stocks Toward All-Time Highs: Markets Wrap Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India?\n\nAshkenazi, 51, has served as CFO and executive vice president at the drug maker, where she worked for more than 23 years, Alphabet said in a filing Wednesday morning. Her new position is effective July 31.\n\nPorat, 66, who took over as CFO for Google in 2015, oversaw the search giant’s transition into the current structure under Alphabet and has taken on a new role at the company as president and chief investment officer. As the company’s longest-serving CFO, she famously ushered in a period of greater fiscal discipline at Alphabet, oversaw growth of the cloud computing unit, which became profitable last year, and YouTube, now the most popular streaming service on television.\n\nFor the past year, Porat has overseen Alphabet’s investments in its Other Bets division, an eclectic collection of nascent businesses such as life sciences unit Verily and autonomous driving startup Waymo that the company is working to nudge toward profitability.\n\nAshkenazi, who served as Eli Lilly’s CFO since 2021, oversaw the finance chiefs of the commercial business as well as those for research and development and manufacturing and quality, and also led the corporate strategic planning team and business transformation office. During Ashkenazi’s time as CFO, Lilly launched Mounjaro and Zepbound, drugs for diabetes and weight-loss that have made it the most valuable pharmaceutical company in the world.\n\nHer move to Alphabet is “very tough to question despite the monster of a pharma (and consumer) play Lilly has become,” said Jared Holz, an analyst at Mizuho Group. The Alphabet CFO “gig is probably one of the best in corporate America.”\n\nAlphabet shares gained 1.3% Wednesday morning in New York.\n\nAshkenazi steps into the role at a pivotal moment for Alphabet. The company, valued at more than $2 trillion, has reoriented its teams and focus around generative artificial intelligence, which can answer questions in a conversational tone based on people’s prompts. The company has already served billions of queries with its generative AI features. But the computing power and costs associated with the technology is enormous. Ashkenazi will need to manage Alphabet’s books as the company continues to invest heavily in data centers and compete with other tech giants for talented employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe will be based in the San Francisco Bay Area, reporting to Alphabet Chief Executive Officer Sundar Pichai.\n\n“We’re very pleased to have found such a strong CFO, with a track record of strategic focus on long-term investment to fuel innovation and growth,” Pichai said in a statement. “The AI era is giving us an incredible opportunity to innovate at scale across our core products, and to create entirely new products and experiences for our users and customers. I look forward to working with Anat as we invest responsibly to support our next wave of growth.”\n\nHealth Care Advantage\n\nAshkenazi’s background in health care may also play a part in boosting Alphabet’s reputation in a sector with vast potential in generative AI, said Mandeep Singh, an analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. She “could help expand Alphabet’s addressable market and help catalyze some of its moonshots,” Singh said, “given her background and the availability of data in health care as a generative AI application.”\n\nAlphabet has been trying to revolutionize health care for years, with varied success. Recently, the company announced a slew of initiatives to deploy its AI models in the health care industry, including a tool that will help Fitbit users glean insights from their wearable devices. Last year, Google unveiled Med-PaLM, an AI model that has capably fielded medical questions. The announcements followed a broad shift in strategy for the company in 2021, in which it moved to embed health-care research and other functionality in its core products like search and YouTube, rather than starting new commercial services.\n\nBut the efforts have left some of its moonshot goals in health care, embodied by Alphabet units like Verily and the life-extension company Calico, to somewhat languish. Ashkenazi may play a vital role in re-prioritizing efforts that once made eye-catching headlines.\n\nAlphabet’s shares are up about 40% over the past year and the company reported quarterly profit that increased by more than half in the first quarter. YouTube and the cloud business are expected to end 2024 at a combined annual run rate of more than $100 billion, Alphabet has said. The company also announced its first cash dividend in April, a welcome sign to investors after months of heavy spending on AI.\n\n(Updates with Alphabet CEO comments in 10th paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still a massive theme in the market. The market has only gotten a taste of what this technology can offer, and the results have already been promising.\n\nIf investors haven't aligned some part of their portfolio to this technology, it's not too late. There are plenty of great AI stocks that can be phenomenal investments and purchased at a fair price, providing exposure to one of the most promising technological revolutions since the internet.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best ways to invest in AI, as it will be a winner regardless of whose software or AI model is the best. TSMC manufactures the chips that go into critical infrastructure, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that process the AI models. Because Taiwan Semiconductor is a foundry, it creates chips for companies that compete against each other, like Nvidia and AMD. By being neutral in the AI arms race, TSMC is in a great position.\n\nManagement is also excited about the prospects AI technology is bringing to its business. They expect the portion of its business associated with building AI-related chips will grow at a 50% compounded annual growth rate for the next five years. This growth will result in AI chips making up more than 20% of its overall revenue by then.\n\nThat's massive growth and makes Taiwan Semiconductor a strong investment. Although the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be, it's still a fair buy at 24 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nConsidering that the S&P 500 trades at 21.5 times earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor only trades at a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stumbled out of the gate when nearly every company around it was launching and integrating generative AI models. Now, Alphabet has caught its competition and has rolled out several features that integrate this technology throughout its product ecosystem.\n\nStill, AI is only a small part of Alphabet's investment thesis, as advertising accounts for more than three-quarters of its overall revenue. The AI tools Alphabet develops for advertising are far more important than any other, as these bring value to paying customers.\n\nOne example is integrating its Gemini model into its Performance Max (PMax) product. Meeting all PMax guidelines greatly increases the odds of a successful advertising campaign. It used to take some back-and-forth to check all the boxes; now, it can be done instantly, as Gemini can ensure all guidelines are met. This type of efficiency excites investors about the prospects of generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its stumbles, Alphabet also trades at a lower premium to many of its big tech peers, at 23 times forward earnings. This is an excellent price to pay for the stock, and investors should take advantage of this price while they still can.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be at the top of investors' minds when looking for AI stocks. While the company is an avid user of the technology, it may not be easy to pinpoint where Amazon would benefit.\n\nHowever, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business is slated for huge gains. Many companies trying to integrate generative AI and large language models (LLMs) into their businesses don't have the computing power necessary in-house. So, they rent some computing space from a cloud computing provider like AWS. (Alphabet also has a competing product in Google Cloud.)\n\nThis allows its users to easily scale up or down depending on workload size, and after a year of consolidation in 2023, AWS is back to growth mode in 2024. In Q1, AWS revenue rose 17% year over year to $25 billion. While that's only 18% of Amazon's total sales, the division is highly profitable. Operating income rose 84% year over year to $9.4 billion, accounting for 62% of operating profits.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's structure, and the growth it's experiencing, thanks to the AI boom, will help the company tremendously.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. The first five topics can be seen here, and these are the final five themes:\n\nCloud computing return to normal\n\nInvestors have been gaining greater confidence in the ability of certain headwinds to cloud revenue growth over the past 12-18 months normalizing, and thus attention for 2024/2025 is shifting to trying to gain a better understanding of how building momentum in artificial intelligence workloads & AI related services could contribute to growth and margins going forward.\n\n“We still see the long-term adoption of cloud computing services by enterprise customers as a secular theme due to broad-based increases of digital spending and shifts in IT budgets toward cloud adoption,” said analysts at Goldman, in a note dated May 17.\n\nWith meaningful revenue backlog, we see the broader public cloud landscape evolving from simply being a conversation around cost savings/efficiency to being an essential piece of driving growth for customers through utilization of AI-related offerings, operationally/industry specific solutions & partner integrations, all of which have a goal of improving the extraction & utilization of data to drive business outcomes while keeping that data secure.\n\nIn addition, companies have expressed optimism that AI workloads could build in momentum as a tailwind for 2024 & beyond.\n\nGoldman sees the tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the most exposed to this potential upside.\n\nNormalization of online travel demand\n\nThe multi-year period of abnormal travel growth, caused by COVID and then the associated pent-up demand, is coming to an end, and Goldman sees structural growth for the online travel industry returning to pre-COVID levels in the high-single-digit/low-double-digit percentage range.\n\nAs growth normalizes, online travel agencies are increasingly focused on a number of initiatives to drive brand loyalty, less reliance on performance advertising, including investing in loyalty programs and merchandising/discounts direct to consumers.\n\n“We believe generative AI has the potential to reshape the online travel funnel and how companies approach customer acquisition & conversion,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAdditionally, “we are witnessing a greater focus on capital returns with online travel companies increasingly buying back stock (or announcing shareholder return authorizations that have surprised to the upside).”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks most exposed to these themes include Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).\n\nEvolution of interactive entertainment\n\nThe bank sees the potential rise of a hybrid distribution model of mobile/cloud as well as the potential emergence of VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] physical equipment as the next generation of distribution and interfaces, albeit while acknowledging the inherent technological challenges limiting pace of adoption.\n\nThe other distribution mode that we will continue to monitor is whether any industry participant is able to successfully build enough scale of content to capitalize on the subscription-ification of the consumer Internet.\n\nWith consumers increasingly shifting consumption habits to short-form video and gaming, we have seen companies focus on a few themes in an effort to capitalize on evolving consumer behavior: The addition of new verticals by large scaled platforms (e.g., Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) expanding into gaming, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) expanding into audiobooks & podcasts); expanding distribution channels and touchpoints (e.g., Take-Two's (NASDAQ:TTWO) partnership with Netflix on Grand Theft Auto mobile games); the emergence of cloud gaming; and the extension of key intellectual property (e.g., Netflix TV series around Take-Two/Ubisoft franchises).\n\n“Looking longer-term, we expect large-scaled platforms to be the best positioned to capitalize on the aforementioned trends given the scale of consumers which provides greater leverage on fixed content costs, the breadth and depth of content library providing abundance of consumer choice, and rising pricing power as more value is delivered to consumers,” said Goldman Sachs.\n\nShifting industry momentum\n\nLooking to the remainder of the year, the bank sees Internet companies focused on the following themes: executing against a more normalized revenue backdrop; mixed margin outlooks; and a renewed commitment to shareholder returns, with several companies announcing new buyback authorizations and/or dividends.\n\nA key debate for investors will be how online penetration rates continue to evolve from these higher levels and how this translates back into the remaining secular growth runway of companies within these verticals.\n\nThe maturation of end markets is contributing to a step-up in competitive intensity, with companies increasingly focused on a mixture of demand/supply incentives and the launch of new products/adjacencies to help sustain revenue growth, broaden platform offerings, and deepen customer relationships.\n\nAdditionally, companies are earmarking an increasing amount of capital towards shareholder returns, with the sector returning $111 billion in 2023 (99% through buybacks) and with nearly $200 billion in remaining buyback authorization still waiting to be deployed.\n\n“We expect companies to continue to use shareholder returns in the years ahead, with this likely to support a continued broadening of their investor base,” Goldman added.\n\nRegulatory matters and business practices\n\nThe rise of government and regulators’ focus on the business practices of the industry’s scaled players has been a persistent theme in recent years, said analysts at the investment bank, seeing three potential areas of risk.\n\nThe bank cited “headline noise” if investigations, fines and new rules proliferate; rising costs to comply with an array of global initiatives; and headwinds to any in-market consolidation or strategic M&A by large players, causing the industry to lean back on internal product R&D.\n\nOver the short/medium term, the regulatory focus on antitrust issues continues to be the biggest area of uncertainty, citing the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Google; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Amazon; and the U.S. DOJ lawsuit against Google as well as the European Commission statement of objections against Google.\n\nSuch scrutiny of the largest companies is likely to persist, “and we expect that investors will remain acutely focused on ‘headline risk’ and watch for new developments.”\n\nIn addition, the increased number of antitrust-related regulatory developments in recent months/years has created an increased degree of uncertainty and volatility around potential long-term business structure and market share dynamics, particularly if it results in “structural” remedies being enforced.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2\n\nHotel executives set sights on empty office buildings as supply lags demand\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule is launched from Florida on first crewed space flight\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Buying These 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks, but Should You?",
        "content": "The transformative potential of artificial intelligence (AI) has led to billionaire investors scooping up a number of AI-focused tech stocks, most notably Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA).\n\nA Motley Fool analysis of the top tech holdings in 16 billionaire-run hedge funds found Nvidia shares in 10 of them. But Nvidia wasn't the most widely owned AI stock.\n\nThat distinction goes to shares of Google's parent, Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), which is held by nearly 70% of the firms. And Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is another top AI stock, owned by 10 of the hedge funds.\n\nDoes it make sense to emulate these billionaire investors, and buy shares in Alphabet, Microsoft, and Nvidia? Here's a look at each company to help answer that question.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is the top tech holding among these billionaire investors for many reasons. The company owns several successful services, such as its Google search engine, which generated $46.2 billion of Alphabet's $80.5 billion in first-quarter revenue through the digital advertising on its site.\n\nAlphabet's YouTube, the second-most-visited website in the world behind Google, pulled in $8.1 billion in first-quarter advertising sales. And Google Cloud is the third-largest global cloud computing provider with $9.6 billion in first-quarter revenue.\n\nNow, Alphabet is using AI to improve its services. Google's search results are enhanced by AI, videos uploaded to YouTube are scanned by AI for policy compliance, and Google Cloud is a distribution platform for customers to use Alphabet's AI technology in their own businesses.\n\nThese AI enhancements helped Alphabet's first-quarter revenue to increase 15% year over year. The company also generated $16.8 billion in free cash flow (FCF) during the quarter. Its substantial FCF enabled it to reward investors with a dividend this year.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft is not far behind Alphabet as a popular AI stock among billionaire-run hedge funds. This makes sense since Microsoft is one of the major players in AI.\n\nThe company invested billions of dollars into OpenAI, the business behind high-profile chatbot ChatGPT, which contributed to the current interest in AI.\n\nMicrosoft infused many of its offerings with AI capabilities. For example, AI is in its ubiquitous Office software, helping customers to write emails, create presentations, and perform data analysis in spreadsheets.\n\nAI is also benefiting the company's Azure cloud computing platform. OpenAI uses Azure to deliver ChatGPT to customers.\n\nMicrosoft's cloud business accounted for $35.1 billion of its $61.9 billion in revenue during the company's fiscal third quarter, which ended March 31. This represented sales growth of 23% year over year.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts cloud strength enabled Microsoft to produce $21 billion in FCF during the third quarter, an 18% year-over-year increase. The tech titan is using its impressive FCF to invest in the future of AI through the development of quantum computing.\n\n3. Nvidia\n\nNvidia saw business boom over the past year thanks to the popularity of its AI chips. For example, in its fiscal first quarter, ended April 28, revenue was $26 billion, up 262% from the prior year.\n\nGiven its outsize business performance, it's no wonder Nvidia is among the top tech holdings of these billionaire investors. And it has paid off handsomely. The stock price skyrocketed from a 52-week low of $373.56 last June to reach a high of $1,158.19 on May 30.\n\nSince the stock is not far from its high at the time of this writing, does it make sense to buy shares? Yes, for several reasons.\n\nThe company's graphics processing units (GPUs), which run AI systems, are continually getting better. This will help to maintain customer demand.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia's latest GPU for cloud computing data centers, the H200, is said to be 100 times faster than the previous generation. Speed is essential for AI systems to perform tasks in a reasonable time.\n\nAnd Nvidia recently released its Blackwell GPU to bring AI capabilities to all types of computers. According to chief financial officer Colette Kress, \"Demand for H200 and Blackwell is well ahead of supply, and we expect demand may exceed supply well into next year.\"\n\nThis demand has led to strong financials. Along with its triple-digit revenue growth, the company's fiscal first-quarter net income rose to nearly $15 million versus $2 million in 2023. Its FCF jumped to $14.9 million in the first quarter from $2.6 million last year.\n\nNvidia's financial performance over the past year led to phenomenal growth in its diluted earnings per share (EPS). The company's EPS over the trailing 12 months (TTM) now exceeds rivals, such as AMD and Intel, by a wide margin. NVDA EPS Diluted (TTM) Chart\n\nMoreover, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is a buy rating for Nvidia stock with a median price target of $1,200, indicating a belief in upside.\n\nWith a 10-for-1 stock split coming at the close of trading on June 7, reasons abound to echo billionaire investors and buy shares in Nvidia. And that goes for its fellow AI stocks Microsoft and Alphabet as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Qualcomm Stock (NASDAQ:QCOM): Energy Efficiency Is Key to Compete in AI",
        "content": "Amid the AI chip race, semiconductor specialist Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) almost seems like an afterthought. Currently, the crosshairs are on graphics processors. In contrast, Qualcomm focuses on mobile and wireless technologies. However, Qualcomm’s strategic focus on energy efficiency and its new partnership to develop more efficient AI chips position it to make a significant impact in the AI arena.\n\nTherefore, I am bullish on QCOM stock due to its potential to address the critical issue of energy consumption in AI applications.\n\nQualcomm Partners Up to Offer a Groundbreaking New Chip\n\nAccording to a Reuters report last month, Ampere Computing announced that it had integrated its chips with semiconductor products from Qualcomm in a bid to lower utility bills tied to AI-related operations. Per the report, Ampere utilizes tech forwarded by ARM Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) to manufacture central processing chips.\n\nIt’s interesting to note that these chips are used by powerhouse enterprises like Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Google under parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Enticingly, Ampere – which is a startup – aims to make chips that are more energy efficient than what industry leaders Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) produce.\n\n“Qualcomm, which dominates the market for mobile phone chips, has been working to break into the market for AI chips in data centers since 2019 with a power-efficient offering of its own,” wrote Reuters contributors Stephen Nellis and Max A. Cherney.\n\nThe initiative falls right in line with Qualcomm’s long-term directive. Per its website, it notes, “For over a decade, Qualcomm engineers have pioneered AI processing systems that center on efficiency. The systems, which harmonize our industry-leading hardware, software, algorithms, and memory hierarchy toward AI acceleration, help reduce power usage and bring groundbreaking improvements in power efficiency, performance, and latency.”\n\nOf course, outright performance will always matter. However, so does sustainability. As Qualcomm rightly states, “More efficiency means less charging of smartphones globally, making technology more sustainable — long a priority of this company.”\n\nFocusing purely on outright semiconductor performance and not paying attention to sustainability could have detrimental financial impacts. First, multiple companies have jumped on the sustainability bandwagon. Therefore, it would be incredibly hypocritical if they promoted products that put society in a worse position environmentally than before.\n\nFurther, ample evidence demonstrates that consumers care about sustainability. If word gets out about certain enterprises not holding true to their word, it could be bad news. Thus, QCOM stock stands on viable ground as the underlying enterprise moves beyond the low-hanging fruit of chasing outright semiconductor performance metrics.\n\nStory continues\n\nEfficiency May be Key for QCOM Stock\n\nEarlier this year, The Washington Post ran an alarming headline. Essentially, because of the 2,700 data centers in the country consuming more than 4% of national electricity output in 2022, America finds itself running out of power. It’s not a clickbait concept either.\n\nOther publications have noted that AI processes utilize as much energy as a small nation. Further, this circumstance will likely only worsen. The International Energy Agency estimates that based on its projections, global energy demand – driven by data centers, cryptocurrencies, and AI – could account for as much electricity consumption as currently used by Japan.\n\nAnd we’re not talking about a specific industry in Japan. Rather, we’re talking about the entire nation.\n\nPaul Hoffman wrote an excellent article on TipRanks about the broad implications of AI energy consumption. In particular, Hoffman identifies the nuclear energy industry as a key beneficiary. Under the context of AI-related consumption, “nuclear power, with its renewed appeal due to low carbon emissions and round-the-clock reliability, appears ideally positioned to meet the skyrocketing power demands driven by AI,” wrote Hoffman.\n\nAs it relates to QCOM stock, the tech industry will need to forward viable solutions to address the energy consumption problem. That’s the vulnerability that could impact the usual suspects in the AI trade. It’s wonderful that digital intelligence is expanding and may yield various efficiencies. However, if the cost of the innovation becomes too steep, this dynamic may become self-defeating.\n\nFortunately, with Qualcomm working on its efficiency-focused directive, it could forward a solution that’s the best of both worlds: incredible computing capacity while being environmentally responsible. I don’t think it’s a coincidence that QCOM stock has gained almost 43% since the start of the year.\n\nCompelling Valuation Bolsters the Bullish Case\n\nLastly, we’ve got to talk about valuation. At the moment, QCOM stock trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 27.43x and a forward multiple of 20.62x. Whether compared to the semiconductor equipment and materials category or the broad semiconductor sector, Qualcomm is undervalued. The former category features an average multiple of 31.4x, while the latter runs at 34.8x.\n\nWhere it runs a little bit hot is in the revenue department. Right now, QCOM stock trades at 6.32x trailing-year sales. That’s elevated compared to both semiconductor categories, which run at around 4.3x each. However, with Qualcomm’s efficiency directive, the premium may actually be discounted relative to the long-term upside potential.\n\nIs QCOM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, QCOM stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 19 Buys, eight Holds, and one Sell rating. The average QCOM stock price target is $198, implying 3.1% downside risk.\n\nThe Takeaway: QCOM Stock Could Make a Grand AI Entrance\n\nWhile other tech firms have embraced AI innovation, Qualcomm has been going about it in a different way, focusing on sustainable digital intelligence. While this approach isn’t as exciting, it’s arguably the most relevant. As many resources have pointed out, AI consumes too much energy, and something must be done. Qualcomm may offer a viable solution, making QCOM stock well worth consideration.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "With $30 billion in lost market value and big shoes to fill, Snowflake’s new CEO bets big on AI—and on big friends like Nvidia’s Jensen Huang",
        "content": "It's been just three months since Sridhar Ramaswamy, a former Google senior executive, took the reins as CEO of Snowflake, and one big change under the new boss is already easy to spot: The decade-old company long known as the \"Data Cloud\" now bills itself as the \"AI Data Cloud.\"\n\nThe rebrand may seem like a mere marketing exercise at a time of widespread AI hype, but Ramaswamy is ardent that AI and data are inextricable elements of Snowflake's business and its future success. AI now “pervades everything that is happening in Snowflake,” Ramaswamy told Fortune in an interview in advance of Snowflake’s annual summit taking place in San Francisco this week. And AI has become “the nervous system” that connects companies internally, he said, helping them create and manage data, but also allowing businesses to exchange information in real time across clouds with other companies.\n\nRamaswamy stepped into Snowflake's top job in February after Frank Slootman unexpectedly announced his retirement. He had big shoes to fill: Slootman, a tech industry veteran, led Snowflake through an IPO that transformed it into a public company with a $75 billion market cap. The company's headcount more than tripled under Slootman as Snowflake expanded its roster of customers and leaned into the competition with fellow data startup Databricks.\n\nCompared to Slootman, who was fond of quoting WWII General George Patton and whose leadership was described as \"brash\" and \"no-nonsense,\" Ramaswamy comes off as understated and diplomatic. But the challenges facing Ramaswamy are no less pressing. For one thing, Wall Street is still mourning the departure of Slootman; Snowflake's stock plunged on the news of the leadership change, and the company, which has yet to turn a profit, now has a market cap of $46 billion.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has faced a difficult news cycle. On Monday, Snowflake pushed back against claims by Ticketmaster parent Live Nation that hackers gained access to data it stored through Snowflake. According to Snowflake, the company has found no evidence that the hack was the result of a vulnerability, misconfiguration, or malicious activity within its product, and in a joint statement with other companies, said that a targeted campaign by hackers to exploit multifactor authentication appears to be the cause.\n\nFor Ramaswamy, the Snowflake summit in San Francisco provides a platform to win over investors and rally customers as he makes the case that this is \"the year of AI.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of Snowflake’s main announcements at this week's summit is an expanded partnership with Nvidia that allows customers and partners to build customized AI data applications in Snowflake, powered by Nvidia AI Enterprise software and Cortex AI, Snowflake’s LLM and vector search service.\n\nIn a virtual fireside chat with Ramaswamy on Monday evening, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang said that companies need to “take all the most important processes they do, capture them in a data flywheel, and turn that into the company’s AI to drive that flywheel even further.”\n\nCould Snowflake be the next Nvidia?\n\nWhile some have speculated on whether Snowflake’s AI efforts could launch the company into an Nvidia-like stratosphere of revenue and stock value, Ramaswamy sounds firmly grounded on the here and now.\n\n“I have worked for a trillion-dollar company before, at Google,” he pointed out. “It takes a lot of hard work, I think it was close to 15-18 years before Google became a trillion-dollar company. These are just very long journeys.”\n\nSnowflake is betting that Ramaswamy's experience and ability to leverage the power of data and AI will put the company on a path that leads to greater success. After leading Google’s $115 billion advertising business in the 2010s, Ramaswamy launched Neeva, an AI-powered search engine that Snowflake acquired one year ago. As part of the acquisition, Ramaswamy joined Snowflake as the SVP of AI, meant to help bring Neeva’s large language model (LLM) technology to the vast amounts of structured and unstructured data housed on Snowflake’s platform.\n\n“This is an area that I'm deeply familiar with,” he said. “My PhD was in databases. I've worked in data pretty much all my life.”\n\nNeeva’s LLM expertise turned out to be very interesting for Snowflake as a way to help customers glean structured information from unstructured data—that is, ask questions and get reliable answers from business data. “A natural language interface to all information that we either want to give or to consume is a huge unlock of AI,” he explained. “AI plus snowflake means that you can go from unstructured information to structured information—that fluid access to information offers huge potential for a company like Snowflake.”\n\nWhen it comes to AI, Ramaswamy says, Snowflake focuses on value creation. “We are not in the business of selling promises,” he said. “We are in the business of getting paid when our customers consume computers on Snowflake and pay us for it.”\n\nStill, he said he believes Snowflake is “well-positioned” to benefit from future customer obligations using AI. “Our customers are not buying GPUs, they’re not buying guaranteed contracts,” he said. “They create obligations, they use what they need from Snowflake, and they make money when they get value from it—it’s a very aligned business model. And our model is very much based on what we are able to deliver for our customers. I think that's a good thing.”\n\nA huge opportunity in the data space\n\nSnowflake has also made headlines recently for rumored potential acquisitions, including a $1 billion deal for AI model developer Reka AI that has supposedly hit the skids. Snowflake did confirm an acquisition of TruEra, which evaluates and monitors LLM apps and machine learning models in production.\n\n“We tend to be pretty strategic” about acquisitions that fill necessary niches, said Ramaswamy, who would not comment on the Reka rumors. “Neeva was brought into Snowflake because Frank and our owners realized that search was going to be pretty pivotal for AI, and we had great expertise in search and great expertise in AI.” Meanwhile, TruEra’s skills around what is known as “observability” will “be important in the world that we are heading into,” he said.\n\nRamaswamy is most interested in tackling the customer value opportunity that he says is in front of Snowflake. Cloud computing, he said, is estimated to be a more than $2 trillion prize over the next decade. “A huge part of that is going to be spent on data.”\n\nAnd AI, he added, will be a key addition to gaining customer value from that cloud equation.\n\nIf Snowflake is the nervous system that provides the connectivity between different cloud applications and massive amounts of data, perhaps AI is the brain that can make those connections for the enterprise.\n\n“There's a huge amount of value to be created for anyone that's able to crack that,” Ramaswamy said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Narendra Modi vowed to continue as India’s prime minister even after his party lost its majority in parliament, forcing him to rely on allies to form a government for the first time since he stormed to power a decade ago.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Bonds Climb as Data Put November Fed Cut in Play: Markets Wrap Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money Intel CEO Takes Aim at Nvidia in Fight for AI Chip Dominance\n\nA coalition led by Modi’s Bharatiya Janata Party secured enough seats to form a government if it sticks together, although the party remained short of the 272-seat majority on its own. The BJP-led National Democratic Alliance was on course to win 293 seats, while the opposition bloc, known as the Indian National Developmental Inclusive Alliance, was on track to win 229 seats, the results showed.\n\nModi claimed victory for his coalition in a post on X, calling it a “historical feat” and vowing to “move forward with new energy, new enthusiasm and new resolve.”\n\n“Today is auspicious,” Modi told cheering supporters at his party’s headquarters later on Tuesday night. “It is confirmed that NDA has won a mandate to form the government for a third straight term. We are very, very grateful to the people who have reposed full faith in the BJP and NDA.”\n\nIndia’s stocks had their worst day in more than four years, as it became clear the election outcome would be much closer than expected. Markets had hit a record high on Monday after exit polls released over the weekend showed Modi would coast to an easy victory in the marathon, six-week election. Before voting kicked off on April 19, the prime minister had boldly predicted that his alliance would win a whopping 400 seats.\n\n“This is not an election — it is a kind of political earthquake,” said Niranjan Sahoo, senior fellow with the New Delhi-based Observer Research Foundation who has written several books on Indian politics. “Even if Modi becomes the prime minister, his position will be diminished to a great extent. He will not be the same Modi.”\n\nIndia Election Results 2024 — Follow Live Results\n\nModi now needs to secure the support of two key members of his broader National Democratic Alliance who control some 30 seats — enough to flip the balance of power in parliament. Leaders of those two parties have a history of switching sides, and only joined up with Modi a few months ago, making it unclear whether they will stick with him or back the opposition bloc. A spokesperson of the allies, the Telugu Desam Party in the southern state of Andhra Pradesh, affirmed support for Modi’s coalition.\n\nStory continues\n\nMore than 20 opposition parties, spearheaded by Rahul Gandhi, formed a united front in a bid to stop Modi’s once-dominant electoral machine. A mixture of regional and caste-based groups, the alliance focused on appealing to voters who felt left out of India’s growth story, which has been marked by growing inequality, pervasive joblessness and rising living costs.\n\nAfter the results became clear, Gandhi said the election showed that voters don’t want Modi to run the country. The opposition alliance would meet on Wednesday to discuss next steps, he added.\n\n“We do not like the way they have run this country for the last 10 years,” Gandhi told reporters on Tuesday. “That is a huge message to Mr. Narendra Modi.”\n\nThe result is a stunning disappointment for the 73-year-old leader, who has been the main face of the BJP’s election campaign and built the party primarily around himself. Besides raising questions about Modi’s own future as prime minister, a weak coalition government will likely make it difficult for him to push through tough economic reforms or further his Hindu nationalist agenda assuming he returns to power.\n\nThe lackluster performance marks the first major setback at national polls for Modi. He had looked unbeatable heading into the election, backed by one of the world’s fastest-growing economies and the fulfillment of key promises appealing to India’s Hindu majority, including the building of a temple on the site where a 500-year-old mosque had been torn down.\n\nSigns of trouble for Modi emerged after the first of seven rounds of voting. A dip in turnout triggered a broad get-out-the-vote effort that saw Modi adopt a more strident tone, firing up his Hindu nationalist base with divisive anti-Muslim rhetoric and attacks on the opposition’s welfare policies.\n\nModi had appealed to India’s 1.4 billion people with a combination of business-friendly policies, welfare measures for the poor and Hindu nationalist policies. He had pledged more of the same in his third term, vowing measures to create jobs while also replacing India’s religion-based marriage and inheritance laws with a uniform civil code — a measure that Muslims, Christians and other minorities oppose because it would prevent them from adhering to some faith-based laws.\n\nThose more contentious proposals may now be off the table. The results also call into question whether Modi would have the political capital to implement contentious changes to land and labor laws, as well as a slew of other reform measures needed to achieve his goal of turning India into a developed nation by mid-century.\n\nEven with a reduced mandate or a change in government, India’s growth trajectory should largely remain positive. Business leaders from Elon Musk to Jamie Dimon have hailed India’s potential as an alternative to China, with some economists projecting that the nation’s $3.5 trillion economy can become the largest contributor to global growth within the next five years.\n\n“As far as economic policy is concerned, fiscal backsliding I think is a risk,” said Shumita Sharma Deveshwar, senior director of India Research at Global Data.TS Lombard. “Apart from that I actually don’t see much of a change in terms of reform policies. Even with a strong majority, Modi was unable to implement much of the so-called big bang reforms.”\n\n--With assistance from Debjit Chakraborty, Akriti Sharma, Shruti Srivastava, Menaka Doshi, Rakesh Sharma and Preeti Soni.\n\n(Updates with latest election result in second paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Startup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Tesla is projected to spend between $3 billion and $4 billion on hardware from chipmaker Nvidia this year, according to CEO Elon Musk. He revealed this in a recent post on social media platform X.\n\nMusk also disclosed that approximately half of Tesla's $10 billion capital expenditure on artificial intelligence (AI) this year would be directed towards internal spending.\n\n\"For building the AI training superclusters, NVidia (sic) hardware is about 2/3 of the cost,\" he said on X.\n\nEarlier on Tuesday, Elon Musk reportedly redirected thousands of AI chips, initially intended for Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), to his social media company, X.\n\nThe chips, manufactured by NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), were to help Tesla evolve into a leader in AI and robotics. However, the unexpected diversion could potentially delay Tesla's acquisition of processors worth $500 million.\n\nEarlier this year, Musk announced in a Tesla earnings call that the company planned to increase its procurement of Nvidia’s H100 artificial intelligence chips from 35,000 to 85,000 by year-end. He also revealed that Tesla intended to invest $10 billion in combined training and inference AI, primarily for in-car applications.\n\nHowever, recently obtained emails from Nvidia employees suggest that Musk may have overstated the AI chip purchases for Tesla. Instead, a significant number of these processors are now being shipped to X, mainly its AI subsidiary, xAI.\r\nIn response to the report, Musk posted on X that Tesla lacked the capacity to accept the Nvidia GPUs due to the incomplete state of its factory in Austin, Texas. He also estimated that Tesla would spend $3-4 billion on AI chips from Nvidia in 2024.\n\nThis move could potentially upset Tesla investors, who are banking on Musk's promise of delivering fully autonomous vehicles. The company plans to unveil its first robotaxi vehicle in August, while its Autopilot and Full Self-Driving driver-assist features continue to be scrutinized due to a string of crashes.\n\nMeanwhile, xAI, Musk's AI startup, is competing against the likes of OpenAI and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) to create practical applications for generative AI and their underlying large language models. Last month, the company announced a $6 billion funding round based on the promise of advanced products and the infrastructure to support them.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTesla set to spend $3 billion-$4 billion on Nvidia hardware this year\n\n3D Systems secures major dental contract, unveils tech innovations\n\nWall Street stocks end slightly higher as weak jobs data supports rate cut\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet’s GOOGL shares have rallied 23.5% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet-Services industry’s growth of 19.3%. The company is cashing on solid momentum in the cloud computing business, Google Cloud, which is enjoying growing customer momentum due to generative AI strength.\r\n\r\nThe latest extended partnership between Google Cloud and Workday is a testament to the same. The objective behind this deal is to accelerate the integration of generative AI technology into the Workday platform.\r\n\r\nWorkday plans to leverage Google’s Gemini models and Vertex AI in order to aid in quick AI-powered code generation, troubleshooting and information retrieval. This will expedite transaction and closing processes on the Workday platform.\r\n\r\nThis partnership will enable Workday customers to use Google's GenAI tools to carry out their search and analysis activities seamlessly. It will also aid in new purchase requisition workflow development and deliver enhanced new-hire onboarding experiences.\r\n\r\nThe Workday partnership has added strength to Google’s cloud customer base.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGenerative AI Strength: Key Catalyst\n\nGrowing generative AI capabilities position Alphabet well to capitalize on the growth prospects in the booming generative AI market, which, per a report from Fortune Business Insights, is expected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 47.5% between 2023 and 2030.\r\n\r\nGoogle is capitalizing on the increasing demand for large language models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model, Gemini.\r\n\r\nThe company’s launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool, Gemini Code Assist, is noteworthy.\r\n\r\nSolid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\r\n\r\nGoogle recently introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure. The new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units, and NVIDIA’s GPUs in the cloud.\n\nExpanding Customer Base Aids Prospects\n\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities are expected to continue driving Alphabet’s customer momentum in the cloud computing market.\r\n\r\nRecently, Cintas partnered with Google Cloud to develop a generative AI-powered knowledge center to accelerate its digital transformation. Cintas will leverage Google Cloud’s Vertex AI in order to build its own gen AI-backed search engines to empower employees.\r\n\r\nVictoria's Secret & Co. VSCO also announced a multi-year strategic partnership with Google Cloud to enhance online shopping experiences globally and improve operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nVictoria’s Secret is utilizing Google Cloud’s AI and generative AI technologies to develop a novel conversational assistant that will provide personalized product recommendations. Powered by Vertex AI, the chatbot intends to deliver individualized advice based on unique preferences and experiences.\r\n\r\nAn expanding customer base, backed by strength in generative AI, is expected to aid the performance of Google Cloud in the near term as well as bolster Alphabet’s footprint in the booming cloud computing market.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, the segment reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Google Cloud segment will, in turn, contribute well to the overall performance of Alphabet.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $295.53 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.2%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.60 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31%. The EPS estimate has moved north by 0.4% over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nWith the growing generative AI capabilities in the cloud, the largest cloud provider will be able to narrow down its gap from its strong peers like Amazon AMZN and Microsoft MSFT, the cloud giant and the second largest cloud player, respectively.\r\n\r\nBoth Amazon and Microsoft are making concerted efforts to bolster their generative AI solutions in order to expand their cloud footprint.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon Web Services accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market, per the latest Canalys data. Meanwhile, Microsoft accounted for 25% of the market with its robust Azure cloud services. Google Cloud, on the other hand, acquired 10% of the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nWe believe that Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong market position in generative AI, search engine and cloud.\r\n\r\nAlphabet currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology.

        "content": "(Reuters) - A group of current and former employees at artificial intelligence (AI) companies, including Microsoft-backed OpenAI and Alphabet's Google DeepMind on Tuesday raised concerns about risks posed by the emerging technology.\n\nAn open letter by a group of 11 current and former employees of OpenAI and one current and another former employee with Google DeepMind said the financial motives of AI companies hinder effective oversight.\n\n\"We do not believe bespoke structures of corporate governance are sufficient to change this,\" the letter added.\n\nIt further warns of risks from unregulated AI, ranging from the spread of misinformation to the loss of independent AI systems and the deepening of existing inequalities, which could result in \"human extinction.\"\n\nResearchers have found examples of image generators from companies including OpenAI and Microsoft producing photos with voting-related disinformation, despite policies against such content.\n\nAI companies have \"weak obligations\" to share information with the governments about the capabilities and limitations of their systems, the letter said, adding that these firms cannot be relied upon to share that information voluntarily.\n\nThe open letter is the latest to raise safety concerns around generative AI technology, which can quickly and cheaply produce human-like text, imagery and audio.\n\nThe group has urged AI firms to facilitate a process for current and former employees to raise risk-related concerns and not enforce confidentiality agreements that prohibit criticism.\n\nSeparately, the Sam Altman-led firm said on Thursday it disrupted five covert influence operations that sought to use its artificial intelligence models for \"deceptive activity\" across the internet.\n\n(Reporting by Jaspreet Singh in Bengaluru; Editing by Tasim Zahid)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Microsoft: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Shares in Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) have climbed 25% over the last year as investors have grown bullish over the company's potent position in tech and its expanding artificial intelligence (AI) business. The growth saw Microsoft surpass Apple as the world's most valuable company, achieving a market cap above $3 trillion.\n\nAs the home of Windows, Office, Xbox, Azure, and LinkedIn, Microsoft has garnered a significant user base and has a powerful grip on tech. However, recent stock growth has made it a slightly expensive option compared to other stocks. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis charts above show that Microsoft has a higher forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-sales ratio (P/S) than Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), two tech companies with solid outlooks. The figures suggest Microsoft's stock offers the least value out of the three companies.\n\nMeanwhile, recent developments indicate Intel and Alphabet could have the same, if not more, growth potential in the coming years than the Windows company. So, consider buying these two tech stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel hasn't instilled much confidence in investors recently, with its stock tumbling 47% since 2021. The tech giant has faced multiple headwinds, including a global chip shortage, a market downturn that curbed consumer spending, increased competition that has threatened its market share in central processing units (CPUs), and the end of a lucrative partnership with Apple.\n\nHowever, recent developments indicate Intel is beginning to turn things around, and it could be worth investing in the company at the start of its restructuring.\n\nIn 2023, the chipmaker announced a complete overhaul of its business model, transitioning to a foundry-first company. The move will see Intel go up against organizations like Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and become one of the world's top chip manufacturers. Intel has plans to build at least four chip plants in the U.S. for now, with recent reports showing construction is progressing on schedule for two locations that broke ground in 2022.\n\nFocusing on manufacturing strengthens Intel's long-term outlook as increased interest in AI has led to skyrocketing demand for chips. While rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices specialize in chip design, Intel has the unique opportunity to cash in on the boom in AI by becoming the go-to manufacturer for companies across AI.\n\nIt'll take time to complete construction on its facilities and see a return on its hefty investment, but Intel could enjoy significant boosts in earnings thanks to its shift to a foundry model.\n\nStory continues INTC EPS Estimates for 2 Fiscal Years Ahead Chart\n\nThis chart shows Intel's earnings are expected to hit nearly $3 per share over the next two fiscal years. Multiplying that figure by the company's forward P/E of 27 yields a stock price of just over $70, projecting stock growth of 133% by fiscal 2026.\n\nOf course, it's crucial to remember that these estimates are based entirely on analyst projections, which could prove wrong. However, it would still be a worthy investment even if Intel achieves half of that growth.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nShares in Alphabet have climbed 206% over the past five years, significantly outperforming the S&P 500's 87% rise in the same period. Potent brands like Android, YouTube, Chrome, and Google have seen the company flourish in tech, garnering a loyal user base and a lucrative digital ad business.\n\nAlphabet's various products attract billions of users, granting almost endless advertising opportunities. In the first quarter of 2024, ad sales continued to be the gift that kept on giving, with Google Services revenue rising 14% year over year and operating income soaring 28%.\n\nHowever, while ads are currently Alphabet's bread and butter, its future appears to be AI and its platform, Google Cloud. The cloud service posted revenue growth of 28% year over year in the first quarter of 2024, while operating income increased by 371%. Despite having less cloud market share than Microsoft's Azure, Google Cloud outperformed its rival in revenue growth by about 7% during the quarter.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet is gradually expanding Google Cloud's AI capabilities in an effort to keep up with its competitors. Earlier this year, the company unveiled its most advanced AI model yet, dubbed Gemini. Meanwhile, news broke on May 30 that the tech giant plans to invest $2 billion in Malaysia, developing a new data center and a Google Cloud hub.\n\nAlphabet is on a promising growth trajectory as it continues expanding its digital ad business and AI capabilities. Its better-valued stock makes it a no-brainer compared to Microsoft and a screaming buy for anyone looking to invest in tech.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Lakehouse Capital, a Sydney-based investment manager, released its “Lakehouse Global Growth Fund” April 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. April was a busy month as many of the companies in the portfolio reported earnings. The Fund returned -4.3% net of fees and expenses for the month compared to -2.8% for its benchmark. Since its inception in December 2017, the Fund has returned 152.8% compared to 96.0% for its benchmark, the MSCI All Country World Index, Net Total Returns (AUD). As of the end of April, the Fund's largest sector allocations were to consumer discretionary (19.3%), information technology (22.6%), and communication services (27.0%). In addition, please check the fund’s top five holdings to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund highlighted stocks like Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter. Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), the parent company of Google, offers various platforms and services operating through Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets segments. The one-month return of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) was 0.83%, and its shares gained 36.36% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On June 3, 2024, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) stock closed at $174.42 per share with a market capitalization of $2.147 trillion.\n\nLakehouse Global Growth Fund stated the following regarding Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) in its April 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) delivered a strong quarterly result that came in well ahead of analysts' expectations. Revenue grew 15.4% (16.0% constant currency) to $80.5 billion and operating income grew 46.0% to $25.5 billion. Revenue growth accelerated across Search, YouTube Ads, and Google Cloud, all whilst the company delivered its highest operating margin since 2021 – showing meaningful progress in the company’s efforts to durably re-work their cost structure. On the Generative AI front, management emphasised the company’s infrastructure advantages including 5th generation TPUs(chips developed by Google specifically for AI training and inference), high performance data centre architecture, and AI models that are 100x more efficient versus 18 months ago. Overall, we believe that Alphabet is well placed for the AI opportunity ahead and still has significant latent earnings power. When combined with a relatively undemanding valuation of 21x forward net profit and over $100 billion of cash on the balance sheet, it's not hard to see why we remain positive on the range of outcomes in the years ahead.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto by Firmbee.com on Unsplash\n\nAlphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) is in 7th position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 165 hedge fund portfolios held Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) at the end of the first quarter which was 166 in the previous quarter. Alphabet Inc.’s (NASDAQ:GOOG) trailing 12-month revenue is $318.15 billion and its year over year quarterly growth rate is 15.40%. While we acknowledge the potential of GOOG as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Advanced Micro Devices, NVIDIA, Microsoft and Alphabet",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 4, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Advanced Micro Devices AMD, NVIDIA NVDA, Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet GOOGL.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nAMD-NVIDIA A.I. Rivalry Escalates with New Product Launches\n\nThe fight for AI supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices and NVIDIA is escalating, with both launching new chips at Computex 2024.\n\nAMD is playing catch-up to NVIDIA's dominance in the AI space, which has been riding on strong spending as the digital transformation (DX) of enterprises continues. Per IDC estimates, worldwide spending on DX is forecast to reach roughly $4 trillion in 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2022 and 2027.\n\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\n\nThis massive splurge by enterprises presents significant growth opportunities for both chipmakers.\n\nAMD & NVIDIA Focus on Frequent Launch of Chips\n\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA are now focusing on the faster launch of AI-enabled chips to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap that includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in fourth-quarter 2024. Instinct MI325X accelerator features 288GB of ultra-fast HBM3E memory that extends AMD's GenAI performance footprint.\n\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA \"Next\" architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\n\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\n\nAt Computex, Microsoft, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\n\nStory continues\n\nNVIDIA recently expanded its portfolio with the announcement of the next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, which will leverage HBM4. This follows the March announcement of Blackwell, which is currently in production and is expected to ship to customers later this year.\n\nThe most valuable chip company now plans to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline. NVIDIA also announced a plethora of new tools and software models at Computex 2024.\n\nNVIDIA's yearly launch decision reflects the ongoing competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and its urgency to maintain its dominant position, which is not only threatened by AMD and Intel but also by initiatives taken by Microsoft, Alphabet and Meta Platforms.\n\nTech Giants Spicing Up AI Race\n\nMicrosoft's Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes. The Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\n\nAlphabet's Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\n\nMeta followed Google to introduce the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta's AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nNVIDIA has returned a whopping 121.4% year to date, outperforming AMD, Microsoft and Alphabet's growth of 13.2%, 10.4% and 23.5%, respectively.\n\nNVDA is enjoying dominance in the AI-space thanks to its next-generation chips with high computing power that have been the top choice for enterprises. However, AMD, with its latest products, seems well-equipped to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\n\nNVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes NVDA an attractive pick for investors. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. Moreover, AMD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 40.11X compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry's 32.92X and NVIDIA's 38.12X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "Investors Heavily Search Alphabet Inc. (GOOG): Here is What You Need to Know",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOG) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this company have returned +2.7% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. The Zacks Internet - Services industry, to which Alphabet belongs, has gained 2.2% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.87 per share, indicating a change of +29.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.69 points to a change of +32.6% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.71 indicates a change of +13.2% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOG _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate of $70.55 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +13.7%. The $291.26 billion and $325.08 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +13.6% and +11.6%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG.L) Has A Rock Solid Balance Sheet",
        "content": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it seems the smart money knows that debt - which is usually involved in bankruptcies - is a very important factor, when you assess how risky a company is. We note that Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG.L) does have debt on its balance sheet. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. In the worst case scenario, a company can go bankrupt if it cannot pay its creditors. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, the upside of debt is that it often represents cheap capital, especially when it replaces dilution in a company with the ability to reinvest at high rates of return. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Alphabet\n\nHow Much Debt Does Alphabet Carry?\n\nAs you can see below, Alphabet had US$11.9b of debt, at March 2024, which is about the same as the year before. You can click the chart for greater detail. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$108.1b in cash, so it actually has US$96.2b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Alphabet's Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Alphabet had liabilities of US$77.0b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$37.5b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$108.1b as well as receivables valued at US$44.6b due within 12 months. So it actually has US$38.1b more liquid assets than total liabilities.\n\nHaving regard to Alphabet's size, it seems that its liquid assets are well balanced with its total liabilities. So it's very unlikely that the US$2.14t company is short on cash, but still worth keeping an eye on the balance sheet. Simply put, the fact that Alphabet has more cash than debt is arguably a good indication that it can manage its debt safely.\n\nOn top of that, Alphabet grew its EBIT by 34% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. When analysing debt levels, the balance sheet is the obvious place to start. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Alphabet's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you want to see what the professionals think, you might find this free report on analyst profit forecasts to be interesting.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, while the tax-man may adore accounting profits, lenders only accept cold hard cash. Alphabet may have net cash on the balance sheet, but it is still interesting to look at how well the business converts its earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, because that will influence both its need for, and its capacity to manage debt. Over the most recent three years, Alphabet recorded free cash flow worth 80% of its EBIT, which is around normal, given free cash flow excludes interest and tax. This free cash flow puts the company in a good position to pay down debt, when appropriate.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to investigate a company's debt, in this case Alphabet has US$96.2b in net cash and a decent-looking balance sheet. And we liked the look of last year's 34% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't think Alphabet's use of debt is risky. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Alphabet's earnings per share history for free.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. Here are the first five topics:\n\nThe rise of generative AI\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, specifically Generative AI, and its potential to alter the consumer and enterprise computing landscape has been a key debate for investors for the past 12 months or so, analysts at the influential investment bank said, in a note dated May 17.\n\n“In many ways, we see AI (its continued development and deployment across all aspects of the digital economy) as perhaps the most influential theme in decades and reminiscent of other prior major internet shifts (e.g. the shift from desktop [Web 1.0] to mobile [Web 2.0]),” said Goldman.\n\nStocks of publicly listed technology companies have tended to react promptly to perceived changes in strategic positioning resulting from the rise in Generative AI, Goldman added.\n\nSo far the debate around Generative AI has tended to center largely on the infrastructure layer - fulfillment of the Cloud Computing needs associated with this technology, involving largely Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - and the AI model/platform layer, where we view that only a select few (mainly Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)) have the scale of capital and technical resources to compete effectively.\n\nHowever, the bank increasingly sees an opportunity for AI implementation to begin to drive meaningful impacts, both positively and negatively, across various aspects of consumer internet in 2024 - the application layer.\n\nInvestor debates are likely to center around about how Generative AI might alter go to market strategies; input costs; and the competitive landscape for any specific end market that disrupts more traditional desktop/mobile behaviors.\n\n“Broadly, we expect Generative AI to produce a mix of product innovation and changed consumer behavior across many subsectors in our coverage,” Goldman added.\n\nBlurring lines between advertising and e-commerce models\n\n“We continue to see blurring lines between traditional advertising and e-commerce business models,” analysts at Goldman said, “with retail media capturing more budgets as traditional e-commerce platforms continue to build out their advertising offerings and digital advertising platforms continue to innovate around social commerce.”\n\nThat said, over the past few months, the bank has also observed a pivot in strategies by both e-commerce and digital advertising companies as it relates to this theme by embracing a partnership-type model versus trying to directly compete for traffic and transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank continues to see that social commerce remains a key long-term secular theme within digital advertising, but expects digital ad platforms to further pivot their strategies and prioritize building better user experiences around shopping/commerce over the medium-term.\n\nGoldman sees Google; Meta Platforms (in partnership with Amazon); and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) (also in partnership with Amazon) as well positioned against this theme.\n\nTurning to retail media, Goldman sees a long runway for Amazon to continue to grow its advertising business.\n\nElsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) disclosed that advertising revenues hit a $900 million annualized run-rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 and remains on track to exceed its prior target of $1bn+ by 2024, while Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is also focused on scaling its advertising business.\n\nRising competition in e-commerce landscape\n\nThe e-commerce landscape continues to reset towards a new normal of slowing demand, more moderate increases in online penetration rates, an ongoing shift of spending from goods to services, and a more discerning consumer.\n\nConsumers appear to be consolidating their online spending around fewer platforms and refocus on price/selection/convenience - supporting gains from two main types of players: large aggregators with scale, leading delivery speeds, and competitive pricing, and platforms focused on low-cost items, including new Asia-based cross-border competitors.\n\nThe bank continues “to see Amazon as best positioned to produce a mixture of strong revenue growth and margin expansion with lower risk to estimates relative to smaller peers against an increasingly volatile consumer backdrop.”\n\nImpact of AI on digital advertising\n\nArtificial intelligence and automation in the context of digital advertising (across various aspects of the value chain) has been a key theme in recent months, potentially allowing smaller advertisers to adopt more sophisticated digital ad strategies and driving better targeting/returns on customer acquisition spend, as well as helping individual creators.\n\nIn some ways, this democratizing effect and the broader integration of AI into digital advertising could be an positive for smaller platforms as AI implementation improves underlying ad tech, drives deeper user engagement and/or enables improved performance for other digital channels.\n\nThis could offer upside over the long-term for mid-cap digital ad platforms, including the likes of Pinterest, Snap, DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP).\n\nThat said, a potentially more likely outcome, is that the large-scaled, incumbent platforms (who are furthest along in terms of AI development&adoption - e.g. Google&Meta Platforms) disproportionately benefit from this theme, as these platforms have the scale of capital, engineering talent/resources and first-party data to remain AI leaders and that smaller platforms may have difficulty matching.\n\nShift of local commerce activity online\n\nLocal commerce continues to build in scale as consumers increasingly prioritize faster delivery speeds and as the industry invests to meet these expectations.\n\nTraditional e-commerce companies and on-demand delivery platforms are increasingly competing head-on, as on-demand platforms expand into more traditional retail categories, and as both sets of players are focusing more resources to digitize large categories that were historically underpenetrated by online.\n\nThese new verticals are accretive to the growth of restaurant delivery businesses, with the likes of Uber and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) seeing strong momentum.\n\n“Both UBER and DASH have commented on these new verticals being important investment areas that while a drag to margins today (not yet adjusted EBITDA profitable) are displaying improving unit economics and strong growth and support mgmt’s confidence that these businesses have attractive long-term return profiles,” said Goldman.\n\nWithin more traditional eCommerce platforms, Amazon continues to expand its online grocery business and is increasingly consolidating its various brands/platforms in a more integrated offering for consumers.\n\nAmazon sees room to drive further efficiencies from its logistics network which Goldman expects to remain an important tailwind to multi-year retail margins.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq dip in choppy trading after economic data\n\nRussia's two largest banks to open in annexed regions of Ukraine by July\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant and Piling Into This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred three weeks ago. During the heart of earnings season, and following the eagerly awaited April inflation report, institutions with $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn simple terms, a 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter. In this instance, it covered trading activity during the March-ended quarter. Even though these snapshots are backward looking, they can offer valuable insight into what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\n\nOne theme that's definitely stood out for more than a year has been Wall Street's love for almost anything involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Using software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to evolve over time without human intervention, provides AI with multitrillion-dollar utility in virtually all sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut what's interesting about this affinity for AI stocks is that the face of the AI revolution has been sent to the chopping block for two consecutive quarters by billionaire investors. At the same time, we've seen billionaires repeatedly pile into another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock with abundant long-term potential.\n\nOver a half-dozen billionaires are dumping Nvidia stock\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence might be the hottest innovation since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, it didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers from casting aside shares of the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement during the March-ended quarter. Eight billionaire investors -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- sent shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) packing, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia has taken advantage of its AI-driven opportunity. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred choice in high-compute data centers, and it's enjoying otherworldly pricing power on these chips as a result. Nvidia's gross margin came in at a scorching-hot 78.4% during its fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, there are four very clear reasons for billionaire investors to be skeptical of Nvidia moving forward.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is that history has been unkind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Without fail, investors have overestimated the uptake/adoption of every new innovation, and AI is unlikely to break this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, the company that most-directly benefited from its rise (Nvidia) would be the likeliest to deflate.\n\nThe second issue is that Nvidia's pricing power on its GPUs is likely to wane in the quarters to come. Competitors are rolling out GPUs designed to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 GPUs retain a compute edge over its competitors, the increased availability of new GPUs will lessen the scarcity that sent Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere. When this pricing power fades, so will Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nTight domestic regulation on AI solutions is another concern. In each of the last two years, U.S. regulators have restricted what AI chips Nvidia can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Nvidia even developed toned-down AI-GPUs (the A800 and H800) specifically for China following the first round of export restrictions in 2022, only to have these chips also banned for export to China last year. Sans China, Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly revenue.\n\nThe fourth and final puzzle piece that may have encouraged billionaires to ring the register is an increasing amount of internal competition. Nvidia's top four customers account for roughly 40% of its net sales. The problem is that they're all developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed chips are to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs or to replace them entirely, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from these industry-leading businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis Magnificent Seven stock has been the apple of billionaires' eyes\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have been widely credited with sending Wall Street's major stocks indexes to record-closing highs. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest (by market cap) and most-influential businesses in the country and are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven companies are industry leaders with well-defined long-term catalysts and clear competitive edges. In fact, the four top customers of Nvidia I alluded to earlier are Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nBut these are also stocks that billionaires have been avid sellers of in recent quarters... with one exception: e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the first quarter, nine billionaires piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia stock (Laffont, Griffin, and Englander) were buyers of Amazon shares.\n\nThough Amazon's online marketplace is considered the \"face\" of the company, it's not why billionaires have taken the plunge. Amazon's exceptional growth in cash flow has everything to do with its trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's cash flow or bottom line than the ongoing growth and success of cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on an analysis from Canalys, AWS accounted for a hearty 31% of global cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. As of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. With enterprise cloud spending still rapidly accelerating, the juicy margins associated with cloud services should allow Amazon to rapidly grow its operating cash flow.\n\nSubscription services (e.g., Prime) is another segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth potential. In exchange for Prime member perks like free two-day shipping on most online marketplace orders and access to Amazon's growing content library, Amazon enjoys strong subscription pricing power with Prime. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and has almost certainly added to this total.\n\nThe third higher-margin ancillary segment that does some heavy lifting for Amazon is advertising. When you're driving in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion monthly visitors to your site each month, as well as growing the number of Prime subscribers, it's easy to command higher prices from advertisers who want motivated shoppers to see their message(s).\n\nPut these three ancillary segments together and you get a company slated to more than double its cash-flow-per-share between 2023 and 2027. Relative to its future cash flow, Amazon remains historically cheap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) is moving to dismiss at least 100 employees from Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s fast-growing cloud division, CNBC reported on Tuesday.\n\nCiting internal correspondence and people familiar with the matter, the business news channel said that the tech giant informed employees last week about the layoffs. Roles being impacted include consulting, sales, operations, engineering, and \"go to market\" strategy, CNBC added.\n\nA spokesperson for Google told CNBC the cuts will be incremental across teams in order to help the business evolve to meet \"significant opportunities ahead.\"\n\nThe decision comes after Google announced at least 200 layoffs from its \"Core\" unit in April. The segment oversees the technical foundation behind Google's flagship products, according to a blog on the company's website.\n\nIt also laid off hundreds of workers in January as part of a string of job reductions across the tech industry that stemmed in part from lingering economic uncertainties.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle to slash at least 100 jobs across cloud division - CNBC\n\nStocks bullish positioning declined globally: Citi\n\nIndia shares dive as polls show Modi's mandate slipping\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Ivy League Inspiration: 3 Stocks That Harvard’s Endowment Managers Believe In",
        "content": "Today, we focus on the Harvard Management Company (“HMC”) and discuss three Harvard endowment stocks. HMC manages Harvard University’s substantial endowment fund, valued at well over $50 billion for fiscal year 2023. As a result, many on Wall Street pay attention to the investment decisions made by the fund.\n\nHMC’s latest SEC filings reveal a concentrated portfolio of twelve securities. The company’s leading holdings include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), Light & Wonder (NASDAQ:LNW), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, the top three stocks account for a significant 78% of its invested assets. With that information, here are three Harvard endowment stocks that deserve your attention in June.\n\nTop Harvard Endowment Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of Harvard endowment stocks is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud. During the first quarter of 2024, Harvard Management Company increased its ownership of Alphabet, specifically the Class A shares (GOOGL) by 27.6% through two purchases, a decision likely supported by Alphabet’s strong financial performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giant exceeded analyst expectations in the first quarter, reporting a 15% surge in revenues to $80.5 billion. This growth was propelled in part by a 13% rise in Google’s ad revenue, totaling $61.7 billion. In addition, a 28% surge in cloud computing revenue, which hit $9.6 billion thanks to advancements in AI technology, was helpful. Alphabet announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share and a $70 billion buyback program. Both moves were well-received by stakeholders.\n\nStrategic ventures, like a partnership with augmented reality startup Magic Leap and over 1,000 new cloud product offerings, underscore Alphabet’s innovation commitment. Meanwhile, Alphabet is heavily investing in generative AI, particularly through its Google Cloud and Search segments. The company has introduced generative AI features into Google Search, which allows it to serve more complex queries and improve user experience. Google has rolled out “AI overviews” in Search in the U.S. and U.K., focusing on complex queries where generative AI can add value.\n\nSo far this year, GOOGL stock has gained nearly 24%, and currently trades at around 23 times forward earnings and 7 times trailing sales. Analysts foresee further upside, setting a 12-month price target of $195, a 13% potential increase from current levels. In addition to growth prospects, the stock also comes with a modest 0.47% dividend yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight & Wonder (LNW) video game stocks: a person playing a video game with a handheld controller\n\nSource: korobskyph / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe continue our discussion on Harvard endowment stocks with games developer Light & Wonder (NASDAQ:LNW). The company designs, manufactures, and distributes physical gaming machines like slot machines and electronic table games for casinos and lotteries. LNW also owns a digital gaming segment, SciPlay, which publishes mobile and web games.\n\nOn 8 May, Light & Wonder reported solid first quarter 2024 earnings. Consolidated revenue increased by 13% YOY to $756 million. Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) came in at 88 cents compared with 23 cents for the year-ago quarter.  Management also expressed confidence in its ability to deliver sustainable growth and achieve its target of $1.4 billion in revenue by 2025. Investors noted that the key growth drivers include the launch of new games, expansion into adjacent markets, and continued momentum in its digital businesses.\n\nWhile Light & Wonder presents a compelling investment opportunity with its consistent revenue growth, diverse revenue streams, and strong financial health, potential investors should also consider the industry volatility and dependence on consumer spending. Understandably, balancing these pros and cons can help long-term investors make an informed decision about including Light & Wonder in their investment portfolio.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), LNW stock is up more than 16% while the shares are trading at 24.83 times forward earnings and 2.88 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for LNW stands at $113.0 suggesting an upside potential of over 18% from current levels.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final company among our Harvard endowment stocks is Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). This pioneering space company specializes in launch services and space systems solutions for commercial, aerospace, and government clients. With a robust product lineup including the electron and photon platforms, and ambitious plans for the neutron rocket, RKLB stock offers investors exposure to the rapidly growing aerospace and defense (A&D) industry.\n\nRocket Lab reported total revenues of $92.77 million for the first quarter of 2024, representing a significant growth of 68.99% compared to the same quarter in the previous year. We should note that despite the strong revenue growth, Rocket Lab USA is currently operating at a loss.\n\nThe A&D industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, significant capital requirements, and long development cycles. Wall Street highlights that the industry is experiencing a renaissance, driven by advancements in technology, increased demand for satellite launches, and growing interest in space exploration. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab has secured a robust backlog of over $1 billion, providing significant visibility into future growth. The company has also formed strategic partnerships and secured government contracts, which not only provide stable revenue but also enhance its credibility and competitive position in the industry. Recently, the company announced that it has selected subcontractors to support the development of a satellite constellation for the Space Development Agency (“SDA”).\n\nSince January, RKLB stock has advanced almost 22%. Yet, we should note that the shares are changing hands at a relatively high valuation of 7.51times sales. Finally, the 12-month median price forecast is $8.0, suggesting an upside potential of 83% based on current prices.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil held both long and short positions in NVDA. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Is Alphabet (GOOG) a Solid Growth Stock? 3 Reasons to Think \"Yes\"",
        "content": "Investors seek growth stocks to capitalize on above-average growth in financials that help these securities grab the market's attention and produce exceptional returns. However, it isn't easy to find a great growth stock.\n\nBy their very nature, these stocks carry above-average risk and volatility. Moreover, if a company's growth story is over or nearing its end, betting on it could lead to significant loss.\n\nHowever, the Zacks Growth Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which looks beyond the traditional growth attributes to analyze a company's real growth prospects, makes it pretty easy to find cutting-edge growth stocks.\n\nAlphabet Inc. (GOOG) is on the list of such stocks currently recommended by our proprietary system. In addition to a favorable Growth Score, it carries a top Zacks Rank.\n\nStudies have shown that stocks with the best growth features consistently outperform the market. And for stocks that have a combination of a Growth Score of A or B and a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy), returns are even better.\n\nWhile there are numerous reasons why the stock of this company is a great growth pick right now, we have highlighted three of the most important factors below:\n\nEarnings Growth\n\nEarnings growth is arguably the most important factor, as stocks exhibiting exceptionally surging profit levels tend to attract the attention of most investors. And for growth investors, double-digit earnings growth is definitely preferable, and often an indication of strong prospects (and stock price gains) for the company under consideration.\n\nWhile the historical EPS growth rate for Alphabet is 23.4%, investors should actually focus on the projected growth. The company's EPS is expected to grow 32.6% this year, crushing the industry average, which calls for EPS growth of 26.7%.\n\nCash Flow Growth\n\nWhile cash is the lifeblood of any business, higher-than-average cash flow growth is more important and beneficial for growth-oriented companies than for mature companies. That's because, growth in cash flow enables these companies to expand their businesses without depending on expensive outside funds.\n\nRight now, year-over-year cash flow growth for Alphabet is 16.7%, which is higher than many of its peers. In fact, the rate compares to the industry average of -15.4%.\n\nWhile investors should actually consider the current cash flow growth, it's worth taking a look at the historical rate too for putting the current reading into proper perspective. The company's annualized cash flow growth rate has been 15.1% over the past 3-5 years versus the industry average of 12.5%.\n\nStory continues\n\nPromising Earnings Estimate Revisions\n\nBeyond the metrics outlined above, investors should consider the trend in earnings estimate revisions. A positive trend is a plus here. Empirical research shows that there is a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nThere have been upward revisions in current-year earnings estimates for Alphabet. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has surged 0.4% over the past month.\n\nBottom Line\n\nAlphabet has not only earned a Growth Score of B based on a number of factors, including the ones discussed above, but it also carries a Zacks Rank #1 because of the positive earnings estimate revisions.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nThis combination indicates that Alphabet is a potential outperformer and a solid choice for growth investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Datadog DDOG continues to benefit from strength in customer demand for modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management offerings. The solid adoption of its cloud-based monitoring and analytics platform, owing to accelerated digital transformation and cloud migration across organizations, remains a positive.\r\n\r\nThe company has consistently expanded its portfolio with new features and capabilities, such as serverless monitoring, real user monitoring and security monitoring. This commitment to innovation helps Datadog stay relevant and address evolving customer needs.\r\n\r\nDatadog has a rapidly growing customer base, including many large enterprises and high-growth companies. Its customer-centric approach and focus on providing value have contributed to its success and market recognition.\r\n\r\nIn the first quarter, Datadog had 3,340 customers with an annual run rate (ARR) of $100,000 or more, which increased 14.8% year over year. These customers generated about 87% of the total ARR. As of Mar 31, 2024, 82% of customers used two or more products, up from 81% in the year-ago quarter. Additionally, 47% of customers utilized four or more products, up from 43% in the year-ago quarter.\n\nDatadog, Inc. Price and Consensus Datadog, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nDatadog, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Datadog, Inc. Quote\n\nDatadog’s Prospects Ride on Strong Partner Base\n\nAlthough shares of Datadog have declined 9.2% year to date against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's rise of 15.2%, we believe its strong portfolio and an expanding partner base will help it to outperform the industry in the long haul.\r\n\r\nAs businesses increasingly embrace multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies, the need for a unified monitoring and observability platform has become paramount. This bodes well for Datadog.\r\n\r\nThe company has been steadily expanding its integrations and support for major cloud platforms, including Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL and Microsoft MSFT. This positions Datadog as a powerful ally for organizations navigating complex cloud environments.\r\n\r\nAt the forefront of Datadog's multi-cloud strategy is its deep integration with Amazon Web Services (AWS). As an AWS Partner Network (APN) Advanced Technology Partner and holder of the AWS Cloud Monitoring Competency certification, Datadog collaborates closely with AWS to ensure seamless monitoring and analysis capabilities for AWS infrastructure, applications, and services. Datadog’s availability on the AWS Marketplace further streamlines the procurement and deployment process for AWS customers.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, Datadog has cultivated a strong partnership with Alphabet’s Google Cloud, deeply integrating its platform with a wide range of Google Cloud services, including Google Compute Engine, Google Kubernetes Engine and Google Cloud SQL.\r\n\r\nDatadog has formed a strategic partnership with Microsoft, aimed at enhancing observability and security capabilities for customers running applications on Microsoft Azure cloud services. This collaboration allows Datadog's monitoring and analytics platform to deeply integrate with Azure services, enabling customers to gain comprehensive visibility across their hybrid and multi-cloud environments.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, Datadog’s security capabilities are extended to Azure, providing customers with a unified view of their cloud infrastructure's security posture. This partnership streamlines the management and optimization of cloud-native applications on Azure, ultimately improving operational efficiency and delivering better digital experiences for Microsoft's cloud customers.\r\n\r\nDatadog's multi-cloud and multi-vendor approach allows customers to monitor their entire cloud infrastructure from a single platform, regardless of the cloud providers they use. This unified view empowers organizations to optimize performance, troubleshoot issues, and maintain a robust security posture across their diverse cloud environments.\r\n\r\nAs organizations continue to adopt multi-cloud and hybrid cloud strategies, Datadog's ability to provide comprehensive observability across different cloud environments could become increasingly valuable. By partnering with industry giants like Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, Datadog positions itself as a trusted ally for businesses seeking to navigate the complexities of modern cloud architectures.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nWe believe Datadog’s strong portfolio of offerings in modern observability, cloud security, software delivery and cloud service management and an expanding partner base make it an attractive stock for investors at the current level.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, DDOG expects revenues between $2.59 billion and $2.61 billion. Non-GAAP earnings are projected between $1.51 and $1.57 per share. Non-GAAP operating income is expected in the range of $585-$605 million.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues and earnings is pegged at $2.6 billion and $1.54 per share, respectively. This indicates year-over-year an improvement of 22.1% in the top line and 16.7% in the bottom line. The earnings estimate has also moved 8.5% north over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nThe stock sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and has a Growth Score of A, a combination that indicates a good investment opportunity. A Momentum Score of A makes DDOG an attractive pick for investors.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "The fight for AI supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA NVDA is escalating, with both launching new chips at Computex 2024.\r\n\r\nAMD is playing catch-up to NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI space, which has been riding on strong spending as the digital transformation (DX) of enterprises continues. Per IDC estimates, worldwide spending on DX is forecast to reach roughly $4 trillion in 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2022 and 2027.\r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nThis massive splurge by enterprises presents significant growth opportunities for both chipmakers.\n\nAMD & NVIDIA Focus on Frequent Launch of Chips\n\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA are now focusing on the faster launch of AI-enabled chips to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\n\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap that includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in fourth-quarter 2024. Instinct MI325X accelerator features 288GB of ultra-fast HBM3E memory that extends AMD’s GenAI performance footprint.\r\n\r\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA “Next” architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\r\n\r\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\r\n\r\nAt Computex, Microsoft MSFT, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA recently expanded its portfolio with the announcement of the next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, which will leverage HBM4. This follows the March announcement of Blackwell, which is currently in production and is expected to ship to customers later this year.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable chip company now plans to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline. NVIDIA also announced a plethora of new tools and software models at Computex 2024.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s yearly launch decision reflects the ongoing competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and its urgency to maintain its dominant position, which is not only threatened by AMD and Intel but also by initiatives taken by Microsoft, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Giants Spicing Up AI Race\n\nMicrosoft’s Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes. The Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nMeta followed Google to introduce the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nNVIDIA has returned a whopping 121.4% year to date, outperforming AMD, Microsoft and Alphabet’s growth of 13.2%, 10.4% and 23.5%, respectively.\r\n\r\nNVDA is enjoying dominance in the AI-space thanks to its next-generation chips with high computing power that have been the top choice for enterprises. However, AMD, with its latest products, seems well-equipped to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes NVDA an attractive pick for investors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. Moreover, AMD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 40.11X compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s 32.92X and NVIDIA’s 38.12X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Alphabet (GOOGL): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet (GOOGL).\n\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.6% and 6.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOGL Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOGL\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nWhile the ABR calls for buying Alphabet, it may not be wise to make an investment decision solely based on this information. Several studies have shown limited to no success of brokerage recommendations in guiding investors to pick stocks with the best price increase potential.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt has been and continues to be the case that analysts employed by brokerage firms are overly optimistic with their recommendations. Because of their employers' vested interests, these analysts issue more favorable ratings than their research would support, misguiding investors far more often than helping them.\n\nOn the other hand, earnings estimate revisions are at the core of the Zacks Rank. And empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nShould You Invest in GOOGL?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $7.60.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Brokers Suggest Investing in Alphabet (GOOG): Read This Before Placing a Bet",
        "content": "Investors often turn to recommendations made by Wall Street analysts before making a Buy, Sell, or Hold decision about a stock. While media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm employed (or sell-side) analysts often affect a stock's price, do they really matter?\n\nBefore we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage, let's see what these Wall Street heavyweights think about Alphabet Inc. (GOOG).\n\nAlphabet currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.34, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 44 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.34 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 44 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 79.6% and 6.8% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for GOOG Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for GOOG\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Alphabet here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Alphabet, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nThis means that the interests of these institutions are not always aligned with those of retail investors, giving little insight into the direction of a stock's future price movement. It would therefore be best to use this information to validate your own analysis or a tool that has proven to be highly effective at predicting stock price movements.\n\nZacks Rank, our proprietary stock rating tool with an impressive externally audited track record, categorizes stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), and is an effective indicator of a stock's price performance in the near future. Therefore, using the ABR to validate the Zacks Rank could be an efficient way of making a profitable investment decision.\n\nABR Should Not Be Confused With Zacks Rank\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ABR is calculated solely based on brokerage recommendations and is typically displayed with decimals (example: 1.28). In contrast, the Zacks Rank is a quantitative model allowing investors to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nIn addition, the different Zacks Rank grades are applied proportionately to all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide current-year earnings estimates. In other words, this tool always maintains a balance among its five ranks.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs GOOG a Good Investment?\n\nLooking at the earnings estimate revisions for Alphabet, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has increased 0.4% over the past month to $7.69.\n\nAnalysts' growing optimism over the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by strong agreement among them in revising EPS estimates higher, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to soar in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) for Alphabet. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nTherefore, the Buy-equivalent ABR for Alphabet may serve as a useful guide for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Alphabet (GOOGL) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this internet search leader have returned +3.2%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +5.1% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Services industry, which Alphabet falls in, has gained 4.7%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Alphabet is expected to post earnings of $1.85 per share, indicating a change of +28.5% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $7.60 points to a change of +31% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $8.61 indicates a change of +13.3% from what Alphabet is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.2%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Alphabet is rated Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for GOOGL _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Alphabet, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $70.55 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +13.7%. For the current and next fiscal years, $295.53 billion and $329.71 billion estimates indicate +15.2% and +11.6% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAlphabet reported revenues of $67.59 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +16.4%. EPS of $1.89 for the same period compares with $1.17 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $66.04 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +2.35%. The EPS surprise was +26.85%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAlphabet is graded D on this front, indicating that it is trading at a premium to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Alphabet. However, its Zacks Rank #1 does suggest that it may outperform the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Maximus and Diodes have been highlighted as Zacks Bull and Bear of the Day",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 3, 2024 – Zacks Equity Research shares Maximus MMS as the Bull of the Day and Diodes (DIOD) asthe Bear of the Day. In addition, Zacks Equity Research provides analysis on Alphabet GOOGL, NVIDIA NVDA and Nutanix NTNX.\n\nHere is a synopsis of all five stocks:\n\nBull of the Day:\n\nGovernment health and human services program operator Maximus made its way onto the Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) list last week with its stock starting to check the boxes in terms of value, growth, and momentum.\n\nLanding the Bull of the Day, Maximus belongs to the top-rated Zacks Government Services Industry which is currently in the upper 1 percentile of over 250 Zacks industries. Strong demand and elevated volumes in federal services programs including those tied to Medicaid redetermination have made Maximus stock very compelling with U.S. government agencies already accounting for more than 80% of the company's revenue heading into fiscal 2024.\n\nForeign government agencies accounted for roughly 14% of Maximus' revenue with a breadth that extends to Australia, Canada, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, and the United Kingdom.\n\nAttractive Valuation\n\nConsidering its strong business environment, Maximus' valuation makes the company stand out with MMS trading at the optimum level of less than 2X sales with a P/S ratio of 1X compared to its industry average of 1.3X.\n\nEven better, MMS trades at a 14.5X forward earnings multiple which is a pleasant discount to its peer's average of 22.1X and the S&P 500's 21.9X. Checking an \"A\" Zacks Styles Scores Grade for Value, Maximus is also attractive in terms of valuation metrics such as Price to Book Value (P/B) and Price to Cash Flow (P/CF).\n\nSteady Growth\n\nWith an \"A\" Zacks Style Scores grade for Growth as well, Maximus is now expected to see its bottom line expand by 51% in FY24 to $5.79 per share versus $3.83 a share last year. Plus, FY25 EPS is projected to increase another 4%. On the top line, total sales are projected to be up 7% this year and are expected to rise another 3% in FY25 to $5.39 billion.\n\nMost compelling and indicative of more short-term upside for Maximus stock is that FY24 and FY25 EPS estimates have continued to trend higher in the last 30 days and are nicely up in the last week.\n\nThis comes as Maximus impressively exceeded top and bottom line expectations for its fiscal second quarter in early May and raised its EPS guidance for the second time this year.\n\nMMS is Gaining Momentum\n\nCorrelating with a strengthened outlook and the positive trend of earnings estimate revisions, Maximus lands an \"A\" Style Scores grade for Momentum with MMS rising +6% over the last month to roughly match the Nasdaq while topping the S&P 500's +4% and the Zacks Government Services Market's +3%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nBenefiting from a strong business industry, it's hard to overlook the very favorable trading indicators for Maximus stock with MMS commanding an overall \"A\" VGM Zacks Style Scores Grade for the combination of Value, Growth, and Momentum.\n\nBear of the Day:\n\nWith a slew of promising semiconductor stocks to choose from, investors may want to avoid Diodes at the moment which lands a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell) and the Bear of the Day.\n\nThis comes as the supplier of high-quality discrete and analog semiconductor products says it's grappling with a slower-than-expected recovery in the consumer, communications, and computing markets.\n\nGrowth Concerns\n\nReporting its first quarter results in early May, Diodes' Q1 sales of $301.97 million missed estimates by -1% and dropped -35% from $467.24 million a year ago. Furthermore, Q1 earnings of $0.28 per share fell -82% from EPS of $1.59 in the comparative quarter despite slightly edging expectations.\n\nDeclining Earnings Estimates\n\nFollowing mixed Q1 results, the earnings outlook for Diodes has begun to slip over the last 30 days with FY24 EPS estimates falling -20% from $2.55 per share to $1.80 a share. More concerning is that FY25 EPS projections have dipped -13% despite a rebound forecasted in Diodes bottom line next year to $4.06 a share although this is down from estimates of $4.67 per share a month ago.\n\nIn contrast, many chipmakers have seen a positive trend of earnings estimate revisions.\n\nThe CEO Just Sold Shares\n\nWhat may also concern investors and dampen the optimism for a rebound in Diodes' bottom line is that CEO and Director Keh Shew Lu sold 13,216 of his DIOD shares for a total of $965,462 on May, 14. Notably, Lu controls over 900,000 shares of the company with 369,992 shares held directly and 599,143 shares held indirectly according to the Form-4 filing with the SEC.\n\nBottom Line\n\nGiven there are so many promising semiconductor companies to invest in, Diodes' stock may not be worth the risk at the moment considering the downward trend of earnings estimate revisons and insider selling.\n\nAdditional content:\n\nHere's Why Alphabet (GOOGL) Is a Must-Buy Stock Right Now\n\nInvestors looking for maximum returns should consider Alphabet adding to their portfolios due to its solid fundamental strength.\n\nShares of the search giant have risen 23.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's growth of 18.1% and the S&P 500 index's return of 11.5% during the same time frame.\n\nThis outperformance reflects the company's back-to-back quarters of impressive financial performance. Alphabet's earnings per share surpassed the Zacks Consensus Estimate in the trailing four quarters, the average surprise being 11.3%. In its last reported quarter, the top and bottom lines beat the consensus mark and witnessed strong year-over-year growth.\n\nWe believe that GOOGL shares have further room for expansion, given the company's growing efforts to bolster its generative AI capabilities. Its leading position in the search engine space, strengthening cloud footprint, solid momentum in YouTube and Android, and growing traction in the autonomous driving space should aid Alphabet's prospects further.\n\nThe upswing in the company's estimates testifies to the aforesaid fact. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues and earnings is pegged at $295.53 billion and $7.61 per share, respectively. This indicates year-over-year improvements of 15.2% in the top line and 31.2% in the bottom line. The EPS estimate has also moved 0.5% north over the past 30 days.\n\nLet us delve deeper into the fundamental strength of Alphabet.\n\nGrowing Generative AI Capabilities: Key Catalyst\n\nGoogle is well-poised to capitalize on the growing proliferation of generative AI-backed chatbots on the back of Bard, which enables users to collaborate with experimental AI with new features that include image capabilities, coding support and app integration.\n\nThe company is cashing in on the increasing demand for Large Language Models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model called Gemini. Growing momentum in Google's Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\n\nGoogle recently introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure.\n\nThe new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA's GPUs in the cloud.\n\nThe company's launch of an enterprise-focused AI code completion and assistance tool called Gemini Code Assist is noteworthy.\n\nGrowing generative AI capabilities position Alphabet well to capitalize on the growth prospects in the booming generative AI market, which, per a report from Fortune Business Insights, is expected to reach $667.96 billion by 2030, seeing a CAGR of 47.5% between 2023 and 2030.\n\nSearch Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nThe strong efforts of Google toward innovation in AI techniques for the advancement of its search business are noteworthy.\n\nGrowing momentum in Search Generative Experience, which leverages the generative AI technology to make search results more natural and intuitive, should benefit Google's search business in the near term.\n\nGoogle's initiative to improve search results by combining LLMs' capabilities with multi-search and visual exploration features is another positive. The growing momentum of Bard bodes well for search revenues.\n\nThe company's strength in the mobile search category on the back of mobile-friendly algorithms, robust product listings and flight search capabilities is a plus. These factors will continue to boost the search traffic on the Chrome browser.\n\nCloud Strength Drives Growth\n\nAlphabet has been growing rapidly in the booming cloud-computing market. Google Cloud has turned out to be the key growth driver of Alphabet, owing to strengthening cloud service offerings. The solid adoption of the Google Cloud Platform and Google Workspace has been driving growth in the Google Cloud segment.\n\nGoogle's growing investments in infrastructure, security, data management, analytics and AI are major positives. Its strategic partnerships and acquisitions, and growing number of data centers are helping Google to expand its cloud footprint worldwide. The increasing number of cloud regions and availability zones globally is a major positive.\n\nThe solid adoption of generative AI-powered Workspace tools is a plus. Strength in Google's Kubernetes offerings is contributing well to driving customer momentum.\n\nGOOGL's efforts in integrating data lakes, data warehouses, data governance and advanced machine learning into a single platform are bolstering its prospects in the data cloud market.\n\nTo Conclude\n\nWe believe that Alphabet presents a compelling investment opportunity due to its strong market position in generative AI, search engine and cloud. Strong financial health, combined with its commitment to innovation and strategic growth, positions it well for sustained success.\n\nAlphabet currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of B, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nSome other top-ranked stocks in the broader technology sector are NVIDIA and Nutanix , each flaunting Zacks Rank #1 at present.\n\nNVIDIA has surged 131.9% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NVIDIA's fiscal 2025 revenues is pegged at $116.4 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 91%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $25.10 per share, which implies a 93.7% increase from that reported in fiscal 2024.\n\nNutanix has gained 18.1% year to date. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for NTNX's fiscal 2024 revenues is pegged at $2.14 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 14.7%. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $1.08 per share, which implies an 80% increase from the fiscal 2023 reported number.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "Ford CEO on the future of EVs, Detroit, and his relationship with Tesla's Elon Musk",
        "content": "Inside an 111-year old former Detroit train station, Ford (F) CEO Jim Farley is charting a path for the auto giant's next 100 years.\n\nJust don't expect it to include electric trains.\n\n\"The building's really been revitalized physically, but what's important is that it will have software people here, the future of our pro and our EV business will be down here,\" Farley told me in a new episode of Yahoo Finance's \"Opening Bid\" podcast (video above).\n\nWe are sitting smack in the middle of Michigan Central Station in Detroit's Corktown neighborhood. Constructed in 1913, the station ran trains for about 75 years before officially closing in 1988 due to waning ridership — a byproduct of Detroit's manufacturing decline.\n\nThe 472,000 square foot building, decked out in early 1900s architecture, stood abandoned until 2018. Led by executive chairman Bill Ford, Ford purchased the building and several surrounding locations for $90 million, with a vision to re-establish Detroit as an epicenter for high tech jobs.\n\nClose to $1 billion of renovation work later, the rehabbed Michigan Central Station is now the center of a new mobility innovation district.\n\nThe central building will house Ford employees working on autonomous vehicle projects. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) also signed on in 2022 as a founding member of the district.\n\nGoogle will share its cloud technology for the site's various mobility projects. The company will also offer workplace development training to local high school students and job seekers.\n\nOver time, Ford envisions the mixed-use site to include hotel and retail options to lure in vital tech talent to the rebuilding city.\n\nFarley says the development should help the company attract the best and brightest to develop autonomous and electric vehicles. Built in 1913, Michigan Central Station in Detroit reopens after 36 years after close to $1 billion in investments from Ford. (Brian Sozzi)\n\nThe reopening arrives at a critical time for Ford and the race-car driving Farley, who will reach his four-year mark as CEO in October.\n\nFord's stock has downshifted in the past two years, as the company dealt with issues like quality control, a slowdown in the EV market, and losses in the EV business. Under Farley's watch, Ford debuted the Mustang Mach-e SUV and Lightning F-150 pickup to compete in an EV market led by Tesla (TSLA).\n\nHe also struck up a partnership with Tesla to allow Ford EVs to charge at its Superchargers using adapters. That partnership has created a relationship with Musk, who Farley says he just texted the other day to ask for more charging adapters.\n\n\"I think there is a mutual respect,\" Farley says of his relationship with Musk.\n\nStory continues\n\nFord's shares are down 14% in the past two years according to Yahoo Finance data, lagging the 28% gain for the S&P 500. Its rival GM's stock has gained 12% in that span, supported by stock buybacks and aggressive cost cuts.\n\nFarley has pivoted as market conditions evolved.\n\nThe company said in April it would push back the release of its three-row electric vehicles from 2025 to 2027. It's also delaying EV production at the massive BlueOval City EV campus in Tennessee from 2025 to 2026.\n\nIn October 2023, Ford postponed $12 billion in planned EV spending, including the construction of a new battery factory in Kentucky. But the company committed to making more hybrids to bridge the gap during the EV transition.\n\nA more cost-minded Ford is beginning to show up on the company's balance sheet.\n\nIn April, Ford guided to the high-end of $10 billion to $12 billion for full year operating profits. Adjusted free cash flow guidance was lifted to $6.5 billion to $7.5 billion — previously the range stood at $6 billion to $7 billion.\n\n\"If Ford can continue executing in the coming quarters, the stock should benefit from positive EPS revisions and an increasingly compelling case for multiple expansion post last year’s re-segmentation — all anchored by a strong B/S & improved FCF conversion,\" Citi analyst Itay Michaeli wrote in a recent client note.\n\nEven still, the EV division will likely be the one driving the stock's narrative — though the narrative hasn't been a bullish one.\n\nThe Model e division (Ford's electric segment) lost $1.32 billion in the first quarter on $100 million in sales (down 84% compared to last year). The number of vehicles sold for the division fell 20% year over year, as consumers navigated away from EVs despite price cuts.\n\nThe Model e division is on track for $5 billion in operating losses this year.\n\nFarley says he has a date in mind for EV profitability, but declined to share.\n\n\"We wouldn't allocate capital if I didn’t think it was profitable,\" he said.\n\nWatch what Ford's longtime competitor General Motors is up to in a recent episode of Yahoo Finance's \"Lead This Way.\" CEO Mary Barra says she isn't backing down on EVs.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Tech companies bet on carbon removal startups as AI tests climate goals",
        "content": "Carbon removal technologies are becoming increasingly important for companies, particularly for tech giants locked in a fierce battle to become the leader in artificial intelligence.\n\nOnce considered a diversion for the critical work of cutting emissions, carbon removal projects that extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere — such as direct air capture facilities or reforestation efforts — are now seen as a necessary step to hit key climate change targets.\n\n“There are some portions of company emissions that you will just never abate,” Karan Mistry, managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, told Yahoo Finance. “[Companies are] recognizing that they have a net-zero target and they want to actually get to zero and honor their very public commitments, they have to invest in some sort of removal technology.”\n\nFrontier Fund, a consortium of investors that includes Alphabet (GOOG), JPMorgan (JPM), and Meta (META), has purchased contracts to remove more than 510,203 tons of carbon to date.\n\nThe fund made one of its biggest commitments last year when it committed to paying $57.1 million to enhanced rock weathering startup Lithos Carbon to remove 154,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n\"All of these frontrunners in the carbon market, they’re not just interested in what they can buy today,\" Henry Liu, head of engineering at Lithos Carbon, told Yahoo Finance. \"They’re investing in the future of the carbon dioxide removal market. [With] the scale of the market, they recognize that investment is needed. So they’re looking to support pathways.” A bank of fans draws air through specialized filters at Climeworks' Mammoth carbon removal plant on May 24, 2024, in Reykjavik, Iceland. (John Moore/Getty Images) (John Moore via Getty Images)\n\nTech buys into carbon removal\n\nAlthough the number of companies making net-zero commitments has continued to grow, so have overall global emissions. And emerging technologies are making achieving those commitments more difficult.\n\nThe scale and speed of data processing needed for AI technology require so much energy that the International Energy Agency recently warned that consumption from data centers, AI, and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026.\n\nThat realization has led to a surge in investments in carbon removal startups. Direct air capture firms and those utilizing nature-based carbon removal methods raised more than $1 billion combined in 2023, according to PitchBook data. The number of carbon removal credits sold jumped more than 650% from the previous year, according to CDR.fyi.\n\nThe energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors are leading those investments, but some of the biggest tech companies in the world are also investing in carbon removal to tackle emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), a key player in the AI race, is one of the largest buyers, with more than 7.6 million purchases of carbon credits since 2020.\n\nThe company has already seen its carbon emissions jump 30% from 2020, according to its sustainability report. Four years ago, the company set out to become carbon-negative by the end of the decade, calling it the company’s moonshot. Microsoft CEO Brad Smith speaks at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) on Feb. 26, 2024, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. (Kike Rincon/Europa Press via Getty Images) (Europa Press News via Getty Images)\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft president Brad Smith admitted the goal would be harder to reach with the company’s AI ambitions.\n\n“In many ways, the moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020, if you think of our own forecast for the expansion of AI and its electrical needs,” he said.\n\nChallenges in the fledgling market\n\nWhile carbon credits have largely been limited to voluntary markets, companies are planning for the increasing possibility of regulation mandating purchases to reach net-zero goals. The problem is that demand is expected to outstrip supply, even with hundreds of startups working to remove carbon on behalf of emitting companies.\n\nBCG analysis estimates an annual demand for durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to reach 40 million to 200 million tons of CO2 by the end of this decade. Supply is projected to be 15 million-32 million tons.\n\nCompanies are looking to get ahead of that crunch by investing in nascent technologies with clear processes for monitoring, reporting, and verifying the quality of carbon removed.\n\nHowever, impact is still hard to quantify, depending on the removal process. Companies that offer what is considered some of the highest-integrity offsets remain among the most expensive, largely because the technology has not scaled.\n\n“If you want someone to buy a CDR offset or a carbon offset, you want them to feel good that they actually bought what they said they did,” Mistry said. Saplings grown at the nursery of the nonprofit environmental group Rioterra, await planting to restore areas of a nearby rainforest in Itapua do Oeste, Brazil, Feb. 18, 2020. (REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nDirect air capture (DAC) has the simplest measuring system, according to Mistry, whose firm has invested in a handful of DAC companies, including Climeworks. But it requires building large factories that can suck carbon dioxide out of the air, and it costs $600 to $1000 to capture a ton of carbon.\n\nMethods that rely on agricultural waste are considered cheaper, but they require a lot of land. Planting trees may be among the most economical, but Mistry argues that carbon storage isn’t as permanent.\n\n“You can estimate how much carbon is in the tree, but there are questions like, what happens if it gets cut down? What happens if there’s a forest fire?” Mistry said.\n\nThese questions over credibility have hampered the market recently, with studies showing that many carbon offsets haven't led to the kind of carbon removal they promised.\n\nHowever, the carbon market did receive a vote of support from the Biden administration last Tuesday when it unveiled a framework for using voluntary carbon offsets, an admission that the country will not achieve its net-zero goal by 2050 through emissions reductions alone.\n\n“​​We need to use all the tools at our disposal — creatively, thoughtfully, and at scale,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, praising the role of carbon removal technology in helping companies achieve their climate goals. Still, she stressed, “Corporate buyers should prioritize reducing their own emissions, particularly through transition planning.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Ray Dalio Just Bought These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Tracking what billionaire hedge fund managers are doing is a great way to get ideas for your portfolio. Most of the time, they have a proven track record, but you need to make sure they're buying stocks for reasons similar to yours. Otherwise, you may get stuck holding a stock with strong short-term movements but a poor long-term outlook.\n\nBridgewater Associates, run by Ray Dalio, is a massive hedge fund with nearly $175 billion in assets under management. In Q1, it bought many stocks, but among its biggest buys were companies related to artificial intelligence (AI). With AI being such a broad field, looking at what billionaires are buying is a great way to double-check yourself, and you might even find a new idea.\n\nMaking a massive bet on AI proliferation\n\nIn Q1, Bridgewater Associates increased its positions in the following stocks:\n\nCompany Current Percentage of Portfolio Previous Percentage of Portfolio Alphabet 4.1% 1.6% Nvidia 3.2% 0.7% Meta Platforms 2.4% 1.3% Microsoft 1.2% 0.4% Amazon 1% 0%\n\nData source: WhaleWisdom.\n\nThat's a sizable increase in many of the biggest AI players, pointing to Ray Dalio's belief that AI will be a massive growth catalyst for these stocks. So far, he's been right, as these stocks have had a phenomenal performance in 2024.\n\nHowever, information about which stocks these billionaires have been buying isn't available to the public until 45 days after Q1 ended, so we're dealing with two-month-old information right now. So, are these five still worth buying at today's prices?\n\nThese AI stocks are great picks for all investors\n\nStarting with the biggest of these positions, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Bridgewater has made it the third-largest investment overall in his portfolio. This is a turnaround in sentiment, as many believed Alphabet was losing the AI arms race until a few months ago. While it stumbled out of the gate, its latest AI releases have been positively received, and its generative AI model, Gemini, is emerging as a top pick in the space.\n\nThis has ignited a run-up in the stock, with Alphabet rising nearly 20% since Q1 ended. Despite its rise, Alphabet remains attractively priced at 23 times forward earnings, making it a strong buy now.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the king of AI hardware, is a much harder stock to assess. It recently reported earnings for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended April 28) and saw revenue rise a jaw-dropping 262%. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis rise was fueled by the massive demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) used in data centers to train AI models. Nvidia has been one of the index's best performers for two years straight, but this massive growth makes the stock hard to assess.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, Nvidia trades at 42 times forward earnings, making it quite expensive. However, this premium may be worth it if the AI demand persists for many years. Nvidia is a very tough stock to assess, and I wouldn't fault investors for passing it over right now.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is similar to Alphabet because most of its revenue comes from advertising. With dominant properties like Facebook and Instagram under its roof, it generates a lot of money from advertising. However, Meta has also been making substantial AI investments in developing its own generative AI models that are suitable for its uses.\n\nIt has integrated its AI model into these platforms and can help create content or understand something about a post. While these technologies have monetizable uses, their primary use right now is to solidify Meta's place as a company with top-tier social media platforms. At 24 times forward earnings, it's a great stock to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-powered products into its primary offerings. Its Copilot is already integrated into the Microsoft Office suite of products (if you pay the subscription fee) and provides impressive productivity increases. Microsoft also has a strong cloud computing business in Azure, and this division is seeing incredible growth as companies scramble to increase their computing power to create their own in-house AI models. While Microsoft is seeing great success as a business, it's a very expensive stock. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 36 times forward earnings, it's not far off from Nvidia's valuation despite much slower growth levels. Due to Microsoft's price, I'll take a pass on the stock for now.\n\nLastly, there is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a company that many may not see as an AI investment. While most of Amazon's revenue comes from its commerce-related business, 62% of its operating income comes from its cloud computing division, which is benefiting from the same trends as Microsoft Azure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the largest chunk of the cloud computing market share and is growing revenue at a healthy 17% year-over-year pace.\n\nOverall, Amazon is thriving right now, with sales climbing 13% and earnings per share dramatically rising from $0.31 last year to $0.98. Amazon is another tricky company to value, as it's still working on maximizing its profitability. Although it trades around 40 times forward earnings, I think it's a fair price to pay because Amazon is still enacting many margin-boosting measures.\n\nOverall, Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates' investments in Q1 are great picks. Although investors shouldn't blindly follow them into these buys, I think these stocks are a great starting point when searching for top-notch investment ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TW:2330) is set to be bolstered by the latest wave of artificial intelligence-optimized chips announced by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), according to analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nIn an unexpected move over the weekend, California-based Nvidia revealed its latest chip architecture, calling it \"Rubin.\" Slated to begin shipping in 2026, Rubin's unveiling comes before the company's next generation of data center processors -- dubbed \"Blackwell\" -- has even started to be rolled out.\n\nBlackwell itself is being produced only a little over a year after Nvidia's current \"Hopper\" chips were announced.\n\nNvidia, which has added around $350 billion in market value since it reported yet another quarter of bumper revenue last month, is racing to combat competition from rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), as well as in-house chips made by tech giants like Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe Goldman Sachs analysts argued in a note that semiconductor contract manufacturer TSMC's powerful 3-nanometer nodes will likely be \"leveraged\" by Nvidia in the Rubin platform \"given the ongoing pursuit of more advanced chip performance.\" The product after Rubin, they added, could utilize TSMC's cutting-edge 2-nanometer chips as well.\n\n\"We sense that the overall sentiment among investors towards AI is still positive, with more future new applications to emerge beyond just AI chatbot[s] [like] [OpenAI's] ChatGPT,\" the Goldman analysts said. \"From our point of view, we see TSMC as the key beneficiary under the AI trend, given its solid leadership stance in leading-edge processing for chip manufacturing in meeting the increasingly higher power/computing demand of chip performance for AI applications.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia's latest AI chips likely to \"leverage\" TSMC technology - Goldman Sachs\n\nMexico's Sheinbaum secures landslide presidential election win\n\nEuropean shares rally, eyeing ECB rates move\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Futures higher, Nvidia's next-generation AI chip - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures tick higher to begin a fresh trading week, with investors looking ahead to a key employment report later in the week that could influence on how Federal Reserve policymakers approach possible interest rate cuts this year. Meanwhile, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) unveils the latest generation of its crucial artificial intelligence chip as it attempts to address rising competition.\n\n1. Futures higher\n\nU.S. stock futures pointed higher on Monday, suggesting a positive start to a new month for equities after all three of the major indices on Wall Street clocked strong gains in May.\n\nBy 03:33 ET (07:34 GMT), the Dow futures contract had added 44 points or 0.1%, S&P 500 futures had inched up by 7 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 43 points or 0.2%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average and benchmark S&P 500 both ended the final session of the previous month in the green, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite closed marginally lower. The Dow climbed by 2.4%, the S&P 500 moved up by 4.8%, and the Nasdaq advanced by 6.9% in May.\n\nOn Friday, traders were assessing mixed signals from data that suggested some stickiness in inflationary pressures but weakening consumer spending activity. Investors are now placing roughly even odds on a potential Fed interest rate cut in September. Wagers of a second possible reduction in December were also bolstered.\n\n2. U.S. jobs report ahead this week\n\nFriday's closely-watched nonfarm payrolls report is expected to show that the U.S. labor market remained resilient in the face of elevated interest rates in May.\n\nEconomists are expecting the economy to have added 185,000 jobs during the month, a modest uptick from April.\n\nMarkets have been worried that an overly strong economy might prevent the Fed from lowering rates this year at all, or even require a rise in borrowing costs. But those concerns were somewhat alleviated last month, albeit temporarily, by data showing slowing in inflation and a cooling in job demand.\n\nPolicymakers have continued to call for patience on rate cuts, saying they would like to see more proof that inflation is sustainably heading back down to their 2% target. On Monday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari echoed this sentiment, telling the Financial Times that rates may have to stay on hold for an \"extended\" period of time.\n\nHowever, a soft employment report could hint at an easing in the broader economy -- a trend that may relieve some upward pressure on prices.\n\n3. Nvidia unveils latest chip model\n\nNvidia has announced its newest line of artificial intelligence-optimized chips, as the semiconductor giant at the center of a boom in enthusiasm around AI looks to maintain a \"one-year\" cadence of fresh releases to combat intensifying competition.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn an unexpected move over the weekend, California-based Nvidia revealed its latest chip architecture, calling it \"Rubin.\" Slated to begin shipping in 2026, Rubin's unveiling comes before the company's next generation of data center processors -- dubbed \"Blackwell\" -- has even started to be rolled out.\n\nBlackwell itself is being produced only a little over a year after Nvidia's current \"Hopper\" chips were announced.\n\nNvidia, which has added around $350 billion in market value since it reported yet another quarter of bumper revenue last month, is racing to address competition from rivals Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), as well as in-house chips made by tech giants like Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nElsewhere on Sunday, AMD also unveiled an update for its own AI flagship AI chip, the MI325X accelerator, along with an upcoming series of its MI350 processor that will be available in 2025.\n\n4. China manufacturing activity grows more than expected in May - Caixin PMI\n\nChina’s manufacturing sector grew more than expected in May, private purchasing managers' index data showed on Monday, indicating momentum in some sectors of the world’s second-biggest economy.\n\nThe Caixin manufacturing PMI read 51.7 for May, more than expectations of 51.6 and higher than the 51.4 in the prior month.\n\nThe figure largely contrasted with an official PMI reading from Friday, which showed that China’s manufacturing unexpectedly shrank in May.\n\nBut the Caixin PMI differs from the official data. The Caixin survey covers smaller, private businesses in southern China, while the official survey focuses more on larger, state-run businesses in the north.\n\nThe Caixin PMI also covers a smaller pool of Chinese businesses than the official reading. Investors usually use both surveys to get a broader picture of the Chinese economy.\n\n5. Oil inches higher after OPEC+ extends production cuts\n\nOil prices ticked slightly higher in European trade on Monday after OPEC+ extended its current run of production cuts into next year, a decision that was widely expected by markets.\n\nBrent oil futures expiring in August rose 0.1% to $81.21 a barrel, while West Texas Intermediate crude futures edged up 0.1% to $76.82 per barrel by 03:36 ET. Both contracts fell between 0.6% and 1% last week, weighed down in part by concerns that higher-for-longer interest rates could dent demand in the U.S., the world's top oil consumer.\n\nThe Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies including Russia, known as OPEC+, decided to extend its ongoing output cuts of roughly 5.86 million barrels per day well into 2025.\n\nSpecifically, it will maintain 3.6 million bpd of reductions until end-2025. Meanwhile, 2.2 million bpd of cuts will be prolonged by three months until the end of September this year and will then be gradually phased out from October until September 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures higher, Nvidia's next-generation AI chip - what's moving markets\n\nTake Five: Cool jobs at last\n\nWhat S&P's ratings downgrade means for France\n\nView comments",

If you want to learn about more cities, head straight to 20 Most Congested Cities in North America.\n\nGlobal Traffic Management Market: Growth, Challenges, and Regional Insights\n\nThe global traffic management market is projected to grow from USD 42.3 billion in 2023 to USD 72.5 billion by 2028, at a CAGR of 11.4%. The traffic management industry is a big one in the US, where major companies like Cisco, IBM, Siemens, and others are involved. By 2033, the US is anticipated to hold a significant 25% market share in the worldwide traffic management industry. To lessen traffic and improve road safety, the nation makes significant investments in traffic control technologies. With a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.03%, the global integrated traffic systems market is expected to reach $66.14 billion by 2032 from $28.05 billion in 2022.\n\nAccording to a recent CDC analysis, road accidents claim 1.35 million lives worldwide each year or about 3,700 deaths per day. These accidents include automobile, bus, motorbike, and bicycle fatalities. Estimated to be the seventh leading cause of death worldwide by 2030, with an astounding financial burden of $1.8 trillion. Interestingly, the death rate from crashes is three times greater in low-income nations. Over $300 billion is spent on traffic congestion in the US each year; in 2017, Los Angeles alone incurred $19 billion in expenditures.\n\nDue to reduced commute times per 10 km, Dublin almost missed out on the title of most crowded city in 2023, although topping the global congestion records. There are serious traffic problems in other places, such as Mexico City, Lima, Bengaluru, and Bangkok. In the meantime, traffic in New York City was heavy and took almost twenty-four minutes for a six-mile trip; in contrast, Detroit was found to be among the easiest cities to travel through, taking less than nine minutes. Beyond the amount of traffic, other factors that affect travel speeds include the quality of the road and topographical elements like hills and rivers.\n\nTech Giants Combat Traffic Congestion with Innovative Solutions and Robust Financial Performance\n\nTraffic congestion is being addressed by tech companies such as Conduent Incorporated (NASDAQ:CNDT) and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) with their Google and advanced analytics services, respectively. Drivers can report incidents for real-time updates on Waze, operated by Google. With tools like UberX Share, Uber (NYSE:UBER) encourages ridesharing and lessens the number of single-occupant vehicles on the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nThrough the provision of real-time updates to users, Alphabet Inc.'s (NASDAQ:GOOG) crowdsourced data-powered Google Maps efficiently reduces travel congestion. It forecasts traffic patterns with the use of sophisticated machine learning, which helps academics and policymakers. Precise traffic data is guaranteed worldwide by Google's dedication to improving its AI algorithms and collaborations with research centers such as DeepMind. Notwithstanding difficulties in the internet advertising space, Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) revealed robust earnings in Q1 2024, with $69.79 billion in revenue and an approved $70 billion share repurchase. With sales of $7.45 billion, Google Cloud proved profitable.\n\nConduent Incorporated (NASDAQ:CNDT) is also tackling urban traffic congestion, with cutting-edge transportation management techniques including tolling, congestion pricing, and transit connections. To improve mobility and lessen traffic, they employ human-centered design and cutting-edge imaging technology, placing a focus on data-driven and environmentally friendly tactics that advance social justice. Conduent Incorporated (NASDAQ: CNDT) is well-positioned to serve public sector transportation agencies, enhance passenger experiences, and lower emissions and congestion thanks to its excellent financial performance, which includes $953 million in revenue in Q4 2023 and $3,722 million in revenue for the whole year.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we have ranked the most congested cities in North America based on hours lost per driver in 2022. For the accuracy of data, we relied on Inrix’s 2022 Global Traffic Scorecard.\n\nThe Most Congested City in North America\n\n1. Chicago, Illinois\n\nHours Lost per Driver: 155\n\nChicago tops the list for being one of the most congested cities in North America. According to the survey, Chicago drivers increased their gasoline expenses by $288 between 2022 and 2021 when commuting to work. During weekday rush hours, the average speed in Chicago was only 19 mph, compared to an optimal travel time of 27 mph.\n\nIf you are curious to know which other cities in North America are congested, head straight to our full exclusive list on the 20 Most Congested City in North America.\n\nYou can also check out our study on The Cheapest AI Stock if you're searching for an AI stock that trades at less than five times its earnings and is just as promising as Microsoft.\n\nREAD NEXT: 25 Cities with the Least Amount of Time Lost to Traffic & 17 Countries with the Highest Number of Road Traffic Deaths.\n\nDisclosure.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the 17,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.\n\nI'm not exactly one to get excited about record highs on major exchanges or on certain stocks, but I found this \"milestone\" to be really cool.\n\nWhen I began my career in the summer of 2004, the Nasdaq Composite was at 1,800 or so and not too far removed from the dot-com bust. That's a ninefold-plus increase in 20 years — at the same time my hairline DECREASED by ninefold!\n\nToday, we are witnessing another tech boom, with the daily advancement of generative AI fueling the rise of companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), Anthropic, and OpenAI. While some of this tech is scary as hell, there is no denying the impact it's having on value perception in markets.\n\nAnd throughout the week, I got the latest dose of insight into how the spread of AI is powering financial statements and outlooks.\n\nHP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores told me (video above) a factor in the company's above-consensus second quarter EPS guidance is the release of higher-priced AI PCs in mid-June. These will be HP's first crop of AI PCs with beefier processors to support various AI-related tasks.\n\nChewy (CHWY) CEO Sumit Singh didn't explicitly mention AI in our chat, but you could see how it's beginning to drive better sales and margins. It's my understanding the company is able to react quicker to consumer needs because of its investments in automated technology.\n\nA similar vibe was felt when I talked to Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz, who is using new technology to keep inventory low, then \"chase\" demand signals it's getting in real time. The end result: impressive margin expansion.\n\nExciting stuff!\n\nAnd all of it helps to understand the enthusiasm around a lot of big-cap tech stocks.\n\nBut then there were those rough Salesforce (CRM) numbers and guidance.\n\nOof.\n\nI wrote about them at the crack of dawn in our live markets blog, as I couldn't get over how disappointing the quarter was — truly came out of left field given the company's new suite of AI offerings.\n\nNevertheless, guidance was lackluster and Salesforce could be sitting out of the hot AI trade until the macroeconomic backdrop improves.\n\nBut the shocking Salesforce quarter sent me off to dig into the tech-heavy Nasdaq, specifically the Nasdaq 100 — the 100 largest nonfinancial companies traded on the Nasdaq — to see if there are warning signs creeping into the picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, I'm not liking what I've found, for you believers in stock prices being the truth — or a predictor of future fundamentals.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq 100 is hovering around fresh highs amid strength in names like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), drastically fewer stocks are holding above their 50-day moving averages, per new research from Sundial Capital Research. As of last week, fewer than 60% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 were holding above their 50-day moving averages. That's not great.\n\nFewer and fewer stocks are holding above their 200-day moving average as well, Sundial notes.\n\n\"It looks ominous on a chart, but historically, most of the weakness in forward returns was confined to the next 1-3 months,\" said Sundial's research team.\n\nSome of the laggards in the Nasdaq 100 include consumer names Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Lululemon (LULU). But AI plays in Workday (WDAY) and Autodesk (ADSK) have also been relatively underperforming.\n\n\"It’s a have-and-have-not market for tech stocks. Investors want to bet on the pure-play AI revolution plays with Big Tech dominating and leaving other tech stocks in the dust abandoned,\" Wedbush's omnipresent tech analyst Dan Ives tells me.\n\nTruist co-chief investment officer Keith Lerner tells me weakness in non-tech names could continue amid a convergence in factors.\n\n\"What seems to be hurting the other sectors outside of tech is the bounce back in the 10-year Treasury yield; after hitting support just above 4.3%, it's now back above 4.6% as the market has been dialing back the number of Fed rate cuts. And as we move further into June, the election will come further into view. This is likely adding to some of the recent selling pressure,\" Lerner says.\n\nI am not here saying the Nasdaq is headed for a summer bear market. What I am saying is that not everything is as healthy in tech land as it appears, and there could be a pullback in the top tech stocks this summer as investors reassess valuations from the beach.\n\nAre there values to be had among Nasdaq stocks not participating in the current rally?

Thanks to the company's enormous share of the fast-growing digital advertising market, Meta has quickly become a cash-printing machine.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), Meta generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow. This river of cash enabled the company to return value to shareholders through share buybacks (totaling $14.6 billion in the quarter) and, for the first time ever, a quarterly dividend payment of $0.50/share. Granted, the payouts (share buybacks and dividends) exceeded the company's free cash flow, but the company's massive cash reserves of $58 billion easily covered the deficit.\n\nIn any event, Meta reduced its overall shares outstanding by 11% over the last five years. That's great news for investors, because as the number of outstanding shares decreases, the value of each remaining share increases. And that's the beauty of stock buybacks: They can provide a boost to share prices.\n\nMeta has one of Wall Street's biggest share buyback programs, and its 11% reduction in outstanding shares is impressive, but it's not the largest reduction on this list. That honor goes to a travel website operator.\n\nBooking Holdings\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but when it comes to stock buybacks, BookingHoldings(NASDAQ: BKNG) is a giant.\n\nGranted, the overall amount of its buybacks is less than that of much larger companies like Apple, Meta Platforms, or ExxonMobil. However, on a percentage basis, the company tops the list. BKNG Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nOver the last five years, Booking Holdings reduced its overall shares outstanding by almost 21%. The company repurchased about $26 billion worth of its shares, which is astonishing for a company with a market cap of only $128 billion.\n\nThe result has been fantastic for investors. Shares are up 120% over the last five years, even after accounting for the lackluster pandemic-influenced years between 2020 and 2022.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFinally, there's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Similar to fellow digital advertising giant Meta Platforms, Alphabet generates a ton of cash thanks to its lucrative suite of Google advertising businesses (Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network).\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, in its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), the company's Google advertising segment generated $61.7 billion in revenue. Overall, the company's quarterly revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $80.5 billion. Net income increased to $23.7 billion.\n\nIn turn, the company announced its first-ever dividend payment of $0.20 per share; it also enlarged its share repurchase program to $70 billion.\n\nAll in all, Alphabet has reduced its total shares outstanding by more than 1.5 billion shares, or 11%, over the last five years. GOOG Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nInvestors should remember that companies that prioritize a long-term strategy of stock buybacks are often smart investments, as the reduction in outstanding shares drives higher prices as the overall supply of shares shrinks. In turn, that can help investors buy low and sell high, which is the ultimate goal on Wall Street.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Best Country to Teach English Abroad in 2024",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Best Countries to Teach English Abroad in 2024.\n\nIn 2024, The global demand for TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) teachers continues to grows, with over 3,000 job vacancies accessible through TEFL Academy's online jobs board. In Asia and the Middle East, TEFL-certified teachers are especially sought after, with salaries ranging from €1,165 ($1260) to €4,668 ($5050) per month. For instance, in South Korea, teachers can earn between €1,750 (1893) and €2,450 ($2650)monthly, while in the Gulf Arab States, salaries can increase up to €4,668 ($5050), making these regions some of the best places for English teachers. To read about countries with the highest demand for ESL teachers, see 25 Countries with High Demand for English Teachers.\n\nThe qualifications required for TEFL positions vary but typically include a Level 3 certificate or a Level 5 Diploma, which entail 120 to 168 hours of study, respectively. These credentials open doors to teaching opportunities in countries like China, Japan, Taiwan, and Vietnam, where English education is integral to their educational systems. In Taiwan, for example, teachers may earn between €1,868 and €3,500 per month. While TEFL is a great option to pursue, there are places like India which happen to be one of the countries where you can teach English without a degree or even TEFL certification.\n\nAs far as teaching English abroad with all expenses paid opportunies are concerned, these programs often cover airfare, housing and a high-paying salary. Countries like South Korea, Japan, and the UAE are highly popular in this domain owing to their high demand for English teachers and attractive benefits packages. For instance, South Korea's EPIK program offers teachers free housing and a salary ranging from $1,600 to $2,500 per month, along with a settlement allowance and medical insurance.\n\nOwing to the importance of English as a language for organizational success, many US companies are focusing on English instruction for their employees. It is also interesting to note that non-English speakers in the US earn 40% less than their English-proficient counterparts.\n\nSpeaking of language training, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) has recently enhanced its AI-assisted language learning tools with a focus on English conversation practice. Initially launched in October 2023, the speaking practice feature now allows users to engage in ongoing dialogues with an AI bot. This tool is currently available to Search Labs users in Argentina, Colombia, India, Mexico, Venezuela, and Indonesia and provides feedback on spoken sentences while helping learners choose the best words and conjugations in context.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite lacking a structured curriculum like Duolingo Inc (NASDAQ:DUOL), Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG)’s approach aims to facilitate practical language use. The company has not yet disclosed plans for broader rollout or additional language options. Speaking of AI, Duolingo Inc. (NASDAQ:DUOL)'s CEO recently opined that AI will likely replace humans in most jobs, but teachers will probably be safe due to the human factor they bring in their profession.\n\nIs Switzerland the Best Country to Teach English Abroad in 2024?\n\nIn order to find out the best country to teach English abroad, we divided our methodology into two parts to identify the best countries to teach English Abroad in 2024. Firstly, we identified the 30 highest paying countries for ESL teachers in the world based on average salaries. Secondly, we looked at the countries with the highest Human Development Index. We obtained average salaries from our salary database and for the HDI, we relied on data from UNDP. Our methodology revealed that Switzerland is the best country to teach English abroad in 2024.\n\nSwitzerland offers a perfect blend of professional opportunities andan unparalleled quality of life for English language teachers. With over 200,000 TEFL teachers globally, Switzerland is particularly famous for its high salaries, averaging around ₣50 ($60) per 45-50 minutes of teaching. This financial stability is complemented by Switzerland's stunning natural landscapes and its central location in Europe which also allows for travel to neighboring countries like France, Italy, Austria, and Germany. While demand for English teachers may not be as high compared to other countries, opportunities exist in different sectors such as the hotel industry and private tutoring. Cities like Zurich, known for its luxurious lifestyle, and Bern, with its abundance of international schools, offer attractive prospects for TEFL teachers.\n\nTo teach English in Switzerland, it is mandatory to atleast have a Bachelor's degree and a minimum 120-hour TEFL certification. The average salary of ESL teachers in the country is $132,206, making it the best country to teach English abroad in 2024.\n\nTo check out the extensive list of the best countries to teach English, please visit 20 Best Countries to Teach English Abroad in 2024.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and A New Dawn Is Coming to US Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None. 20 Best Countries to Teach English Abroad in 2024 is originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Prediction: These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth a Combined $25 Trillion by 2030",
        "content": "Is the hype warranted? That's a question investors must always ask about anything that receives a huge amount of attention.\n\nIn some cases, the hype fizzles away -- 3D printing comes to mind. However, in other cases, early hype is more than justified. For example, the massive market built around the internet has shown that many early proponents were right.\n\nI think artificial intelligence (AI) belongs in the latter category. In my view, the enormous success of multiple AI leaders is just the beginning. It's impossible to know what the future holds. However, I predict that by 2030, five AI stocks will be worth a combined $25 trillion -- perhaps even more.\n\nAI's fantastic five\n\nBased on market cap, the five biggest companies on the planet have one major thing in common: They're all investing heavily in AI. Not only that, their respective AI strategies have played a key role in their big gains over the last couple of years. Below are AI's \"fantastic five\":\n\nAI Stock Current Market Cap* Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $3.08 trillion Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $2.93 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $2.73 trillion Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $2.13 trillion Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.86 trillion\n\nData source: Google Finance. *Market caps as of May 30, 2024.\n\nMicrosoft surged past Apple earlier this year to take the No. 1 spot based on market cap. The company's partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unquestionably been the primary factor behind Microsoft's remarkable rise. The tech giant has integrated GPT-4 throughout its product lineup. Microsoft is especially benefiting from its relationship with OpenAI in its cloud business.\n\nApple delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2023. Since then, though, it's lagged well behind the other biggest AI stocks. Some investors have worried that Apple was getting left behind in the generative AI race. The company's growth has also slowed significantly due in large part to saturation in the smartphone market. Still, Apple remains in a close contest with Microsoft for the biggest market cap.\n\nNvidia is, without question, the brightest star in the AI universe right now. The demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to skyrocket. Every other company in the top five (plus many more) are Nvidia customers. Most of them would love to buy as many GPUs as they could get. Thanks to this tremendous demand, Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed.\n\nAlphabet seemed to have been caught by surprise by the successful launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It didn't take long, though, for the company to roll out its own generative AI products. Despite some public relations stumbles, Alphabet remains in the thick of the AI race with its Gemini AI models and Google Cloud AI offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon quickly introduced multiple generative AI products after ChatGPT took the world by storm. Amazon's AI initiatives have helped drive its stock much higher. The company's focus on profitability has also been a critical factor, with earnings more than tripling year over year in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe path to $25 trillion\n\nThe combined market cap of these five AI stocks stands at a little over $12.7 trillion right now. How can they together nearly double that amount to reach $25 trillion by the end of 2030? I think there are three major prerequisites.\n\n1. Organizations migrate rapidly to the cloud to benefit from AI's tremendous return on investment\n\nImportantly, AI must deliver tremendous returns on investment (ROIs) for companies. I expect this will be the case. If so, organizations across the world will almost certainly rapidly migrate their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy estimates that at least 85% of global IT spending remains on-premises, with the remainder in the cloud. AI could go a long way toward flipping those numbers by the end of the decade.\n\nThis migration would directly benefit Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud since they're the biggest cloud service providers. It should also help Nvidia as the leading source of chips for AI servers.\n\n2. AI computing technology continues to improve at a frantic pace\n\nIt's critical for Nvidia that AI computing technology, especially chips, continues to improve at a frantic pace -- and that the company leads the way. Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU platform, which will launch later this year, should help make this a reality. CEO Jensen Huang said in the company's Q1 call that \"other Blackwells are coming.\"\n\n3. Edge AI becomes a huge new market\n\nThe first two prerequisites should ensure continued success for Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon. But what about Apple? The tech giant needs edge AI to become a huge new market. Edge AI enables AI to be run on mobile devices. Since Apple has over 2 billion active devices worldwide, it should be in the driver's seat to lead the edge AI market.\n\nPotential problems and pleasant surprises\n\nWhat could go wrong to derail these five AI stocks from reaching a combined market cap of $25 trillion by 2030? A lot. On the one hand, an economic recession could cause tech spending to tank. AI might not deliver the ROI companies hope to achieve. The \"hallucinations\" and other issues with generative AI could remain problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be some pleasant surprises over the next few years. One possibility is a major breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AI). Perhaps AI computing power could increase even faster than anyone expects.\n\nWhatever happens, I think the hype about AI is warranted. And I won't be shocked if my prediction turns out to be too pessimistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 1 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Instead",
        "content": "There might be no company that represents the artificial intelligence (AI) boom quite like Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). The thriving chipmaker is firing on all cylinders right now. And it has rewarded its shareholders in remarkable fashion.\n\nI'm sure you're looking at ways to gain exposure to the ongoing AI trend. However, perhaps it's best to forget about Nvidia. Instead, consider buying this other \"Magnificent Seven\" stock instead.\n\nHigh expectations for Nvidia\n\nNvidia impressed investors once again with a fantastic financial report. During the three-month period that ended April 28 (Q1 2025), the business revealed that revenue skyrocketed 262% year over year to $26 billion. Operating income was even more impressive, up 690%.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's chips is as robust as ever, particularly in the data center segment. Looking ahead, executives believe sales will be $28 billion in the current fiscal quarter. While that would mark a quarter-over-quarter and year-over-year slowdown, it still would mean huge growth for the business.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the hype for Nvidia continues to soar as well, as the market remains enamored with AI-focused businesses. Shares trade at a nosebleed price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 35.9, indicating just how lofty investors' expectations are. Nvidia looks to be priced for perfection right now.\n\nInvestors who want to buy Nvidia shares today are probably not too happy that they missed the stock's monumental rise. This might be a bold statement, but at this point, I think it's a perfect example of people trying to chase returns, which isn't a smart investment strategy.\n\nDominant internet firm\n\nIt's hard to tell investors to ignore one of the hottest stocks in the market. But there's a business that is posting strong results that is already a leader in AI. I'm talking about Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). The $2.2 trillion company has been a big winner for shareholders, and it's poised to continue this trend.\n\nDespite generating a sizable $307 billion in sales last year, Wall Street consensus analyst estimates call for revenue to increase at a compound annual rate of 11.5% between 2023 and 2026. That growth is going to come from greater usage of Alphabet's numerous products and services, which will help drive more digital ad revenue. Here's where AI will help.\n\nSundar Pichai, Alphabet's CEO, proclaimed back in 2016 that the world was going to transition from mobile to an AI-first focus. This kind of thinking early on has put the business at the forefront of this emerging technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet has such a massive user base, with six products being used by at least 2 billion people, that it's effortless to ship new AI features with almost instant mass adoption. Some of the most well-known services, like Photos, Maps, Gmail, and YouTube, have long utilized AI in some form.\n\nAnd when it comes to Google Cloud, there is more of an opportunity to have a bigger impact. As the industry's third-largest player with first-quarter revenue of $9.6 billion, this segment is becoming a mission-critical tech infrastructure partner for its client base. Customers can use a wide range of tools, like generative AI, machine learning, and speech and text features, to build their own applications.\n\nIt's understandable that investors gravitate toward the hot new business or stock in order to ride the momentum to quick profits. But with AI, this dominant internet firm looks to be in a favorable position to benefit. Alphabet has almost unlimited financial resources, as exemplified by $108 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, to invest aggressively in servers and network infrastructure to strengthen its position in the AI race.\n\nShares trade at a P/S ratio of 7.2, which is significantly more reasonable than Nvidia's valuation. Consequently, I believe Alphabet is the one AI stock investors should look to buy instead of the high-flying GPU stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

Several ETFs cater to the market's hottest sector: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere is a lot of hype around AI, and the enthusiasm is warranted. Companies are spending billions of dollars researching real-world solutions and bringing them to market, and organizations in many industries are already integrating generative AI and large language models (LLMs) into workflows. The efficiencies these tools provide and our ultra-competitive business world will encourage more companies to adopt them.\n\nOne estimate forecasts that the global market size will approach $2 trillion by the end of this decade, as shown below. Image source: Statista.\n\nWhat are the best artificial intelligence ETFs?\n\nNot all ETFs are created equal. Factors like diversification, assets under management, historical performance, and the expense ratio are important. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF(NASDAQ: BOTZ) is a popular AI fund. It has $2.8 billion in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.68%, which is competitive. Its portfolio currently holds 43 companies, focusing on those that will \"benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence.\"\n\nBOTZ is heavily weighted toward its top holdings. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) makes up more than 10% of the fund, and its top four holdings account for more than 35%. The fund has underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: SPY) over the past year, despite Nvidia gaining 248%.\n\nBesides the reliance on a few top holdings, another potential drawback is its lack of big tech holdings. BOTZ investors miss out on Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and even one of my personal favorites, Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM).\n\nBOTZ is most appropriate for investors seeking a well-managed portfolio featuring a few stocks with a focus outside big tech.\n\nGlobal X also manages the Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF(NASDAQ: AIQ). AIQ holds positions in 84 companies, has a 0.68% expense ratio, and has crushed the S&P 500 over the past year, as you can see below. SPY Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has positions in all of the stocks above except for Arm Holdings. Its top stock is also Nvidia, but it accounts for only 5% of the total. AIQ is best for those who seek a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on big tech. AIQ is an excellent choice with a tremendous recent track record.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's my favorite\n\nHowever, my favorite AI ETF is the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund(NYSEMKT: WTAI). WTAI is the worst-performing fund in the chart above, but this doesn't mean it won't outperform moving forward. Nvidia and Microsoft account for almost 13% of the S&P 500 and 8% of AIQ but under 5% of WTAI, which explains the underperformance. These stocks exploded last year, but they could soon hit fair value and level off.\n\nThe WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund is the most diversified of the three funds I've chosen, with no company making up more than 3% of assets. It currently holds 75 stocks, including big tech names. It also has the lowest expense ratio at 0.45%. Its most significant investments are in semiconductors (33%) and AI software (24%), thriving industries with serious room for growth as AI ramps up. Its recent underperformance could change quickly, since the semiconductor industry is cyclical and appears headed for another up cycle after a difficult 2022 and 2023.\n\nWTAI is a terrific pick for those who want significant diversification, a low expense ratio, and exposure to the industry's biggest names.\n\nYou don't have to be a brilliant stock picker to capitalize on a rising industry like AI. Sometimes, it's best to let those with more time to dedicated to following stocks choose. ETFs offer broad exposure with less risk and volatility. There are tons of options; perhaps one mentioned above is right for you.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now and in this article we will give you an AI penny stock that can be worthy of exploring in case you missed buying NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it was trading under $500 per share at the beginning of the year.\n\nIt's no secret that semiconductors are among the best pick-and-shovel plays for those looking to invest in the booming Artificial Intelligence sector. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw its stock surge by more than 150% over the past year. This growth can almost solely be attributed to increased demand for its Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which are perfect for processing large amounts of data required in various AI and machine learning applications.\n\nAmid this strong performance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was included in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\", a group of the largest publicly-traded companies. However, as the AI boom continues, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to continue to deliver solid returns to investors. The stock currently saw its price target upped by Goldman Sachs. Analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target to $1100 from $1000 and reiterated the 'Buy' rating. In the research note, the analyst mentioned that the sustainable nature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s growth suggests that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation.\n\nThe strong fundamentals suggest that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good pick for risk-averse investors looking for solid long-term returns. Therefore, it's not surprising that the stock is one of the most popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. According to the latest round of 13F filings, 186 out of 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on NVIDIA at the end of March. We are following this metric because our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEnter Navitas Semiconductor\n\nHowever, for risk-tolerant investors, we can suggest looking at Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Similarly to NVIDIA, Navitas is a semiconductor stock, but it is currently trading at less than $4 per share, which makes it one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now. It may not reach the size of NVIDIA Corporation, but it's worth remembering that in 2014, NVIDIA was trading at less than $5 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nNavitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a small-cap company that is focused on power semiconductors, such as gallium nitride power integrated circuits and silicon carbide power devices. Basically, it is developing semiconductors that are used in power supply for various devices. In this way, Navitas' products have a wide range of applications, including mobile phones, laptops, and consumer electronics. Moreover, Navitas supplies semiconductors to some high-growth industries, such as Data Centers, electric vehicles, and solar inverters. Among the company's clients are Dell, Lenovo, Xiaomi, Amazon, OPPO, and Motorola. Most of the company's products that are currently being shipped are used in mobile device chargers. Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock\n\nA technician in a pristine lab, focused on designing a new semiconductor chip.\n\nOn a financial side, things look good for Navitas. The company has seen strong revenue growth over the past several quarters. In the first quarter of 2023, Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) saw its revenue grow by 73% to $23.2 million. The company has been seeing robust top-line growth over the past several quarters. However, the costs are also quite high and Navitas has yet to report a profitable quarter. For the first quarter, Navitas posted a net loss of $0.02 per share, significantly lower than the $0.39 loss posted a year earlier. Both first-quarter revenue and net loss were above analysts' expectations of $22.92 million and a loss of $0.15 per share, respectively.\n\nNavitas As a Pick-and-Shovels AI Play\n\nDespite the revenue growth and the further revenue growth potential, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) has seen its stock lose 48% since the beginning of the year. In an environment where most semiconductor stocks recorded gains, this doesn't look good. One of the reasons for the decline, was explained by the company's CEO Gene Sheridan on CNBC.\n\n\"We're not shipping to AI today, so our stock price reflects that,\" Sheridan said.\n\nHowever, the CEO added that Navitas plans to change that soon. The company plans to develop and market power chip technology that could be used to power AI-focused data centers. The company is developing power platforms that could provide higher power output to meet the demand required by AI processors, such as NVIDIA's Grace Hopper H100 and recently announced Blackwell chips. These chips demand between 700W to 1,000W and more power, which is significantly higher than 300W demanded by traditional CPUs. Navitas said it has around 30 customer projects in development and expects its power chips to be used in data centers at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nCheck out our report about the cheapest AI stock and find out which company is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than five times its earnings.\n\nWhat Smart Money and Sell-Side Think About Navitas\n\nAs stated earlier, we believe that Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now based on the hedge fund sentiment. At the end of March, there were 11 funds in our database bullish on the stock, down from 18 a quarter earlier. At the end of March, these funds held $80 million worth of shares.\n\nAnalysts also generally see potential upside in Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). In May, following the earnings release, four analysts reiterated their buy ratings on the stock, although they did lower their price targets. Among these, the highest price target is currently assigned by Rosenblatt Securities, which has a $10 target. Other three analysts, at Robert W. Baird, Needham & Company LLC, and Deutsche Bank have a $7.00 price target. On the other hand, analysts at Jefferies, downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy and slashed the price target down to $4.00.\n\nIn conclusion, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a penny stock worth exploring. The company is advancing its developments to get more exposure to the AI sector, albeit it is late to the party. On the other hand, it has a broad pipeline of applications across various sectors and can unlock more growth in other areas. For example, in automotive, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) plans to start production of chips for EV chargers and has several big names among its customers, including Volvo, Smart, and Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd (NYSE:ZK).\n\nIf you want to explore other AI stocks under $5 that smart money is bullish on, check out our free report on the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Micron but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Growth stocks can be volatile. Sometimes, they're beloved market darlings, with stock prices soaring on the wings of speculation and exciting business prospects. Just a few months later (or earlier), the same companies may be found in the proverbial bargain bin as investors seek stability and proven profits in times of crisis. This corner of the stock market isn't for the faint of heart.\n\nBut the same volatility that might make me reach for the antacids can only set the stage for incredible long-term gains. When the stock of a great high-growth company is on fire sale, it's time to buy.\n\nOn that note, let's check out a duo of formerly high-flying stock market sweethearts that have been swooning recently. One stock is almost back to its former highs, while the other stands a hair-raising 88% lower in three years. I'm talking about Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) and Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), the service and platform masters of the media-streaming universe.\n\nHere's why you should add Roku and Netflix to your portfolio and hold them forever, for all intents and purposes. Spoiler alert: Both companies have a lot of growing left to do.\n\nA booming media market\n\nLet's start with Netflix's \"long term view.\" This document, found on the company's investor-relations website, outlines Netflix's long-term business plan in great detail. It also offers an overview of the streaming market as a whole.\n\nIt's a simple vision, really. Linear TV systems such as cable, satellite, and broadcast services have had their day, and streaming-video alternatives are taking over on a global level. The streaming experience is \"on-demand, personalized, and available on any screen,\" freeing consumers from the tyranny of broadcast schedules or programming digital-video recorders. The streaming market itself is growing as more and more people gain access to broadband-level internet connections and suitable viewing devices. In the end, the old-school linear TV experience should become a seldom-used novelty act, putting the trillion-dollar media market squarely in the hands of streaming media services.\n\nNetflix's unshakable leadership\n\nNetflix is the reigning champ in the streaming world. With a subscriber base of 270 million accounts -- rivalling the population of Indonesia, the fourth-largest nation in the world -- Netflix has carved out a dominant position in the market. About a year ago, Netflix shifted gears to focus more on profitability, much to the delight of analysts and investors.\n\nI mean, the initial reaction was a panic, as the company abandoned its long-held focus on optimized subscriber growth in search of more profitable options. But the upsides of the new strategy became clear over the next few quarters, and Netflix shares are sniffing at all-time highs again.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku's emerging strength\n\nRoku is still in the earlier stages of its growth story, like a scrappy underdog with tons of potential.\n\nIt hasn't made the switch to a profit-first strategy yet, remaining laser-focused on global growth and capturing more users. Netflix is an important partner in this quest, alongside every streaming service that hopes to make a dent in the streaming market.\n\nNetflix has been a global operation since 2016, but Roku is almost exclusively an American growth story so far. The company doesn't even report its international business results, with one interesting exception. About 79% of its long-lived assets are located in the United States, 17% are found in the U.K., and the remaining 4% in \"other countries.\" It's a big world out there, and Roku is only getting started with its global-expansion plans. Current focus areas include Canada, Mexico, and Germany. Other first-world markets will follow, and the final ambition is to go worldwide.\n\nRoku's success is not guaranteed, of course. Rivals include local heroes in each target market as well as deep-pocketed tech giants led by Fire TV manager Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Chromecast/Google TV mastermind Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). But if the trendsetting American market is any indication, Roku seems poised to enter about half of the global media market's 1.8 billion households. That's a long way away from Roku's current market footprint of 81.6 million accounts.\n\nDigital-advertising market recovery\n\nBoth Netflix and Roku are well positioned to benefit from the anticipated recovery in the digital-advertising market. Roku's stock price has been adversely affected by the downturn in digital-ad spending, but as the market recovers, the company should experience substantial gains in ad-based revenues. Additionally, Netflix's recent introduction of ad-supported streaming tiers opens new revenue streams, further enhancing its growth prospects.\n\nAd sales make the business world go 'round, and these companies are ready to help it spin.\n\nThe mature market leader and the undervalued turnaround story\n\nNetflix is like the wise elder in the streaming world. It knows the game, has proven its staying power, and offers stability and steady growth. With its shift to a profit-oriented model, Netflix is a solid choice for investors looking for robust and reliable profit growth. You would have laughed me off the stage for a statement like that in 2019, but things have changed.\n\nIn the opposite corner, Roku is the young and hungry upstart. Its number of active accounts and trailing revenues are similar to Netflix's figures in 2015 just before the service leader launched into a global presence. This high-octane growth stock looks tremendously undervalued these days.\n\nI can't promise that Roku will follow the Netflix playbook to perfection, but its trajectory should be quite similar. And it's a promising path, too: Netflix has quintupled its sales and delivered a 480% return to shareholders since the end of 2015. By comparison, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index is only up by 160% over the same time span.\n\nWhether you prefer the stability of Netflix or the potential mega-upside of Roku, these are two stocks to buy and hold forever. The streaming-media market is going places, with Roku and Netflix in the vanguard. You can follow my example and own both of them for the long haul, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Now",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently notched a new all-time high, which may give investors some hesitancy to enter the market. This is understandable, as nobody wants to buy at a high. However, investors also must realize that the only way the market gets to new heights is to continuously set new closing records. While I understand wanting to buy cheaper, missing out on massive bull runs waiting for a pullback can harm returns.\n\nPart of the reason for new all-time highs is investor excitement in artificial intelligence (AI). The big tech firms all have many irons in the AI fire and are a big reason for the index's new record high. Despite the S&P 500 being at a high, these three AI stocks I've pinpointed have the potential to increase even more.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and many other brands. While the company's primary business is advertising, it also offers other businesses like cloud computing and a growing AI toolkit.\n\nAlthough it stumbled out of the gate when companies like OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in late 2022, it's doing much better now. Recently, Alphabet rolled out a generative AI feature to its Google search engine that summarizes the topics you search for. While this isn't necessarily a new moneymaker for Alphabet, it solidifies itself as a top option against other search engines that have integrated generative AI.\n\nAlphabet is also succeeding as a business, with revenue growing 156% year over year in the first quarter and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.17 to $1.89. Alphabet also initiated a small dividend to pay investors with its excess cash flow while adding an additional $70 billion in stock repurchase authorization.\n\nAlphabet remains a top buy in the S&P 500 due to its strong growth and shareholder-friendly capital return programs. With the stock only trading at 23.4 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 21.5, it only trades at a slight premium to the broader index, which indicates the stock isn't overpriced at its current levels.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet are similar businesses that rely mostly on advertising revenue to keep the lights on. They're also similarly priced compared to the market, with Meta trading at 24 times forward earnings.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue comes from its social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger, and WhatsApp. These sites have been cash cows for Meta, and their strength shined in Q1. In Q1, Meta's revenue rose 27% year over year, with EPS more than doubling to $4.71. Those strong results solidify Meta's social media platforms as a place the consumer wants to be. As a result, advertisers also go there due to the large number of people who use them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough its Reality Labs division, the segment that makes virtual reality headsets and other exploratory technologies, doesn't make any profits, it does have exciting products like the smart glasses it collaborated with Ray-Ban to make. This is one of the first products to put generative AI in the hands of consumers in a practical way outside of an internet browser and could be a product that leads to something far more mainstream.\n\nMeta is succeeding in its primary business, but with other AI products in the works, it has a ton of upside.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nLast is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), a company that makes all things AI possible. Taiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer that makes the semiconductors that go into hardware used to make AI models.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's customer base ranges from Nvidia to Qualcomm to Apple, and it has earned that business by consistently having best-in-class technology. Right now, that's 3nm (nanometer) chips, but management stated on its Q1 conference call that its 2nm design (available in 2025) is already seeing far more demand from its customer base.\n\nManagement also believes its AI chips will be a significant source of growth in the coming years. It expects its AI-related business to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate for five years, reaching 20% of its total revenue by 2028. This performance will help fuel management's broader 15% to 20% overall compound annual revenue growth projection -- a strong projection from a sizable company.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the most expensive stock of the trio at 25 times earnings, but its importance in the rollout of high technology cannot be understated, which is why it has performed so well this year. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWithout Taiwan Semiconductor, none of the AI technologies we experience today would be possible. As a result, it's a fantastic stock to buy and hold on to for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "New AI battle adopts old price war strategy as Chinese tech giants keep start-ups at bay behind the Great Firewall",
        "content": "In the 18 months since Microsoft-backed OpenAI launched ChatGPT, Chinese tech firms large and small have rallied around a singular goal - besting the San Francisco-based start-up with their own Chinese-language chatbots.\n\nThe results have been mixed, with some tech giants claiming to have better results than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, with Chinese queries. But with a deluge of more than 200 Chinese large language models (LLMs) - the tech powering these chatbots - from a slew of companies all jostling for market share, China's AI firms can claim at least one other clear, albeit less boastworthy, advantage over their US counterparts: price.\n\nIn recent weeks, TikTok owner ByteDance, internet search giant Baidu, e-commerce conglomerate Alibaba Group Holding and social media behemoth Tencent Holdings have all drastically slashed prices on their LLM services, with some offering a variety of services for free. One premium offering from ByteDance's Doubao Pro costs as low as 0.0008 yuan (0.011 US cents) per 1,000-token prompt, 99.8 per cent less than what OpenAI charges for GPT-4 access.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"It's like the bad money is driving out good money,\" said You Yang, a computer science professor at the National University of Singapore (NUS).\n\nThe price war indicates a lack of competitiveness based on the merits of the models themselves, according to You, making them incapable of attracting customers at previous market prices.\n\nIn the US, tech giants like Google owner Alphabet, Facebook owner Meta Platforms, Amazon.com and Microsoft have also been competing in AI by following the \"blitzscaling\" playbook that has become commonplace in Silicon Valley: acquiring users as quickly as possible, at the expense of revenue, to corner a market.\n\nYet even while enjoying the \"walled garden\" behind the Great Firewall that censors foreign internet services, Chinese firms face limits from Washington's export restrictions on advanced chips from Nvidia, whose graphics processing units have become central to AI model development. They also have less corporate spending power than their peers in the liquidity-rich US market.\n\n\"The price reduction [for Chinese AI services] mainly aims to attract more clients and is more like a branding practice,\" Xu Li, CEO and co-founder of Hong Kong-listed AI company SenseTime, told the South China Morning Post in an interview this week.\n\nStory continues\n\nByteDance launched the opening salvo of the price war in mid-May when it unveiled the pricing of its Doubao AI enterprise services that aggressively undercut its domestic rivals.\n\nUnder this pricing, 1 yuan could buy 1.25 million input tokens. By comparison, it would cost around US$37.50, or 272 yuan, to buy 1.25 million GPT-4 tokens.\n\nIn AI, a token is a fundamental unit of data that is processed by algorithms. For Chinese LLMs, a token typically equates to between 1 and 1.8 Chinese characters.\n\nOther Chinese tech heavyweights were quick to respond.\n\nAlibaba, owner of the Post, was the first to react, dropping the price of its Tongyi Qianwen (Qwen) service by as much as 97 per cent, from 0.02 yuan per 1,000-token prompt to 0.0005 yuan, or 0.0003 yuan cheaper than ByteDance.\n\nSeveral companies including Baidu, Tencent and iFlytek, an AI specialist known for its audio recognition technology, followed with even more drastic price cuts, some offering access to their less powerful LLMs for free.\n\nWang Sheng, an investor with Beijing-based InnoAngel Fund, said this kind of \"vicious\" price competition is hurting local AI start-ups.\n\n\"When it comes to developing LLMs, Big Tech companies are not necessarily better than start-ups,\" Wang said. \"But their practice of subsidisation to grab a bigger market share is detrimental to these firms.\"\n\nAlain Le Couedic, senior partner at AI investment house Artificial Intelligence Quartermaster (AIQ), suggested that the price competition will pay off for some over time.\n\n\"The race for dominance in the market is a sign that many players see attractive opportunities down the road, even if this requires some pain in the short- to mid-term,\" he said.\n\nLLMs are energy intensive, making them expensive to run, so the marginal cost of adding a new user is likely higher than for other online services. This makes blitzscaling more complicated for AI services. A race to make LLMs more efficient could eventually change this math, though.\n\n\"People are pursuing these improvements in efficiency ... because it pays to do so,\" Bill MacCartney, chief technology officer at the venture capital firm SignalFire and a computer science professor at Stanford University, told the Post at the UBS Asian Investment Conference this week. \"It costs a growing amount of money to operate these models, and people have a powerful economic incentive to find ways to make it cheaper.\"\n\nMacCartney noted that resources are pouring into finding efficiency gains across multiple levels: \"There's improvements at the silicon level, there's improvements in model architecture, there's improvements in that kind of software that we layer above the models.\"\n\n\"It's not far-fetched to imagine that we'll see over a three-year horizon ... maybe a 10x improvement in inference efficiency broadly across AI,\" he said.\n\nBill MacCartney (right), chief technology officer at the venture capital firm SignalFire and computer science professor at Stanford University, discusses generative artificial intelligence at the UBS Asian Investment Conference in Hong Kong on May 29, 2024.

Photo: Handout>\n\nSome companies have said improved efficiencies in training and running models are the main reason for their price reductions. OpenAI credited new efficiencies for the reason behind the much lower pricing on its GPT-4o model launched in May.\n\nRobin Li Yanhong, founder and CEO of Baidu, said in April that the efficiency of training its flagship Ernie LLM improved 5.1 times within a year. The model's inferencing performance increased 105 times, reducing inferencing costs by 99 per cent.\n\nByteDance also said it cut prices because it is confident in being able to reduce its costs through technical improvements.\n\nWherever profits stand, tech companies have been quick to attribute rising revenues to the AI boom.\n\nAlibaba Cloud said its 3 per cent growth in the March quarter was buttressed in part by AI-related income that accelerated growth. Baidu Cloud reported 12 per cent revenue growth in the same quarter, with generative AI and foundation model services accounting for 6.9 per cent of total AI cloud revenue.\n\nUS tech giants Google and Microsoft have likewise reported robust demand for their cloud-based LLM services. In its third-quarter results, revenue at Microsoft's intelligent cloud unit grew 21 per cent from a year earlier. Google, meanwhile, saw first-quarter revenue expand 28 per cent year on year.\n\n\"We have witnessed Microsoft's market capitalisation soar, and everyone is eager to capitalise on this opportunity,\" said Ivan Lam, an analyst at market consultancy Counterpoint Research. \"The Chinese market is particularly keen to establish quick links between [AI] applications and business [uses] in order to foster further advancements in its LLMs.\"\n\nAlibaba declined to provide data on the growth in usage of its LLMs after its recent price cut, but the company said that the number of calls to its Qwen application programming interface (API) from a top Chinese recruiting firm spiked 100-fold within a week.\n\nAt least for users of these LLMs like that recruiting firm, the current economics of AI services appear to be paying off.\n\nZhao Chong, founder and CEO of AI-powered graphic design service iSheji, was upbeat about cheaper LLMs in an interview with the Chinese news portal Sohu.com published on May 24.\n\n\"For start-ups like us building applications, [the price war] is a good thing,\" Zhao told Sohu. \"LLM costs used to account for between 5 and 10 per cent of our total costs, now it could be 1 per cent, boosting our profit margins.\"\n\nThese consumer-facing service providers have in turn been reducing the prices of their own offerings, with many available for free.\n\nMeanwhile, start-ups that are in a position to do so are trying to sit out the price war. Beijing-based Baichuan and 01.AI - a company established by Lee Kai-fu, a Taiwanese computer scientist who previously headed Google China - have dismissed the idea of cutting prices.\n\nYou, the NUS computer scientist, noted the benefits of low prices for app developers, but he cautioned that these applications might not perform well if built on subpar foundation models.\n\nDespite this, the price war has emerged because companies have limited options. Competing on price is always easier than endless improvement to model capabilities, according to Yan Lijie, founder and CEO of Shanghai-based MiniMax, one of China's four \"AI Tigers\".\n\n\"[Reaching] the upper limit of a technology is less certain and requires more exploration,\" Yan said in a fireside chat published by Chinese technology news site Geekpark on May 23. \"Whereas there is always a way to cut price.\"\n\nCounterpoint's Lam said that price competition may be inevitable for companies looking to maintain dominance in AI services as the market becomes increasingly crowded.\n\nSome of China's tech giants would appear to have an edge when it comes to compute resources and money to burn. AIQ's Le Couedic said it is too early to predict a potential winner of an AI price war, as the industry is still not mature. Business models and technical edge will both be key factors in determining the dominant players, he added.\n\n\"At the end of the day ... companies with the best services and best technologies will win,\" Le Couedic said.\n\nAdditional reporting by Matt Haldane.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2028",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have soared 650% since January 2023. Consequently, its market capitalization has jumped from $360 billion to $2.7 trillion in less than two years. Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) systems was the driving force behind that price appreciation.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are currently worth $1.8 trillion and $2.2 trillion, respectively. However, both companies could eclipse Nvidia's current valuation within four years, meaning they could be worth at least $2.8 trillion by mid-2028.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported stellar financial results in the first quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 13% to $143 billion as advertising and cloud computing sales accelerated. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income tripled to reach $0.98 per diluted share. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue.\n\nThe investment thesis for Amazon centers on its strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, markets projected to expand at annual rates of 11%, 15%, and 21%, respectively, through 2030. Amazon runs the most visited online marketplace in the world, and its clout in retail has evolved into a robust digital advertising business. Specifically, Amazon is the largest retail advertiser in the U.S. and the third largest adtech company worldwide.\n\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to increase revenue and boost efficiency across its e-commerce and advertising businesses. For instance, machine learning models optimize warehouse inventory and last-mile delivery routes, and a new generative AI tool helps brands create marketing content in a cost effective manner. Amazon has also shifted to multiple regional fulfillment networks (rather than one centralized network) and introduced ads on Prime Video. Those changes are not strictly related to AI, but they should boost profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. The company lost a percentage point of market share over the last year, but it remains well positioned to benefit from AI. Public clouds are the most cost-efficient way for businesses to get the computing power needed to build and run AI applications, so AWS has a significant advantage in its market leadership. However, the company has also expanded its portfolio with new products like Amazon Bedrock.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 10.9% annually over the next five years, a reasonable estimate given how quickly its major markets are projected to grow. Assuming Wall Street is correct, the stock could achieve a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion within four years if shares trade at 3.1 times sales in mid-2028. That seems reasonable, given that shares currently trade at 3.2 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would that mean for investors? If Amazon is worth $2.8 trillion in mid-2028, shareholders will see annual returns of approximately 11.6% (from its current market capitalization of $1.8 trillion). Those gains would probably beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), given that the index has compounded at 10% annually (more or less) over long periods.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet looked strong in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to especially strong sales growth in Google Cloud and modest sales growth in Google Advertising. Meanwhile, net income jumped 61% to $1.89 per diluted share as the company continued to focus on expense management.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet centers on its strong presence in digital advertising and cloud computing, with markets forecast to grow at annual rates of 15% and 21%, respectively. Alphabet is the largest adtech company in the world, due in large part to its dominance in internet search. Alphabet is experimenting with generative AI to fortify that dominance. For instance, CEO Sundar Pichai says recently launched AI Overviews are boosting Google Search usage and user satisfaction.\n\nSimilarly, Google Cloud is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services, but the company gained a percentage point of market share over the past year and its recent launch of Gemini could sustain that momentum. Gemini is a multimodal AI model -- meaning it can be prompted with text, images, video, and other media -- that Google Cloud customers can use to build generative AI applications.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow sales at 10.5% annually over the next five years, a reasonable estimate (perhaps a little low) given how quickly its major markets are projected to expand. Assuming Wall Street is correct, the company could achieve a $2.8 trillion market capitalization within four years if shares trade at 5.9 times sales in mid-2028. That seems easily done since shares currently trade at 7.1 times sales.\n\nWhat would that mean for investors? If Alphabet is worth $2.8 trillion in mid-2028, shareholders will see annual returns just north of 6% (from its current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion). Those gains would probably underperform the S&P 500. That said, I believe Alphabet will be worth more than $2.8 trillion in four years, and I expect the stock to beat the market between now and then.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Prepping for Its Next Decade of Growth with AWS",
        "content": "E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised for the next decade of growth after delivering a return of around 1,000% over the last decade. Thanks to its recent earnings beat, the stock price recently hit a new all-time high. Despite these gains, Amazon’s reaccelerated AWS growth, bolstered by AI, strong retail momentum, and margin and cash-flow expansion from optimization initiatives, make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll buy the stock at current levels.\n\nAmazon Posts Yet Another Quarterly Beat Driven by AWS\n\nOn April 30, Amazon reported impressive Q1 results for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all segments, including cloud, advertising, and e-commerce. Adjusted earnings of $0.98 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $0.84 per share. Also, earnings more than trebled (+216%) year-over-year compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, net sales soared 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, and sales for Amazon’s cloud business segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion, beating expectations. Segment growth was aided by renewed demand and investments in generative AI, which boosted AWS’s performance, alongside a near cessation of the cost optimizations that customers had resorted to last year.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is that AWS’s operating income jumped 84.3% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Further, there was a significant operating margin expansion in the segment from 24% in the prior-year quarter to 37.6% currently.\n\nRegion-wise, North America sales grew 12% year-over-year, with International segment revenue growth at 11% (in constant currency). Moreover, operating income for all the company’s segments combined jumped by 219% year-over-year to $15.3 billion.\n\nBased on its robust Q1 performance, Amazon provided an optimistic Q2 outlook, above expectations. Q2 net sales are projected to grow between 7-11% to be in the range of $144-149 billion. Notably, operating income guidance of $10-14 billion ($12 billion at the midpoint) is also much higher compared to the $7.7 billion generated in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAWS Sees Record Growth and Margins in Q1 Due to AI Impact\n\nAWS, Amazon’s cloud business, has long been the market leader and the profit engine for the company for years. However, after years of impressive growth, the segment saw a slowdown, with growth decelerating to 13% in 2023 compared to 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021.\n\nThat downtrend is now history. In Q1, AWS’s sales grew 17%, helping AWS reach the much-anticipated $100 billion run rate milestone in revenues. Additionally, operating income for the segment saw a remarkable growth of 84%.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the catalyst behind this stupendous growth witnessed at AWS during the quarter. As a matter of fact, the tech titans of the world like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been investing heavily in AI technology.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft’s Azure has gained market share in the cloud space, now holding a 25% share versus 19% in 2021. The addition of AI tools has been a contributing factor toward Azure’s rapid growth over the years. Like its peers, Amazon is making meaningful investments in AI and developing its own large language models as well as investing billions in AI products like Anthropic (which competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT).\n\nAmazon’s investments in AI are now reaping benefits and showing up in the financial figures. The company stated that the majority of its FY2024 CapEx (capital expenditures) will be toward bolstering AWS infrastructure and AI efforts. As the cloud leader, AWS can significantly monetize the growing demand for AI with its wide variety of cloud offerings.\n\nIt’s not just the margin expansion that impressed investors in Q1. It was a huge jump in cash flows despite substantial capital investments in AI and cloud infrastructure. This reassured investors that Amazon’s fundamentals remain intact. Q1 free cash flows grew to $50.1 billion (Q4: $36.8 billion) compared to cash outflows of $3.3 billion a year ago. Margin expansion, coupled with robust free cash flows, implies strong returns for investors in the years to come.\n\nEarlier this week, there was news that AWS is looking to invest billions in Italy to strengthen its cloud infrastructure and data center operations in the country. Similarly, AWS will invest billions in Spain (€15.7 billion) and Germany (€7.8 billion) with the aim of expanding its cloud business across European countries.\n\nAmazon has been undertaking key initiatives to streamline the company’s operations as well as bring down costs. These steps include transforming the U.S. fulfillment model from a nationwide one to a regional one and synchronizing inventory with the regional consumers, among others.\n\nOn a separate note, Amazon recently announced the departure of its AWS head, Adam Selipsky. He will be replaced by Matt Garman, an AWS veteran, to become the CEO of AWS. This leadership change may further enhance Amazon’s AI growth initiatives.\n\nAmazon’s Valuation Isn’t Expensive\n\nAs Amazon houses multiple businesses under its radar, I believe the EV/EBITDA ratio is the best metric to evaluate the stock’s valuation. Being an industry leader, the company has historically traded at high multiples. At present, however, Amazon stock is trading at around 14.3x EV/EBITDA (on a forward basis) compared to its own five-year historical average of 20.6x. This implies a huge 31% discount.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, let’s also look at its P/S ratio. Amazon is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.0x. In contrast, cloud computing and tech giant Microsoft trades at a P/S of 13.1x, while social networking company Meta Platforms  (NASDAQ:META) trades at a P/S of 7.7x.\n\nTherefore, I believe the stock is trading at an attractive valuation and presents a great buying opportunity, given the strong growth potential across various business verticals.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Amazon stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the impressive earnings beat. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 unanimous Buys. Amazon stock’s average price target of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider AMZN Stock for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nAmazon may have been a little late to the AI growth story, but it’s important to remember that AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure. Its substantial investments and recent leadership changes should yield significant benefits. The foundation has been laid, and I believe there’s no turning back for Amazon.\n\nWith multiple growth drivers, including AWS’s growth trajectory fueled by generative AI initiatives, a well-diversified business portfolio, strong retail performance, and impressive margin and cash-flow expansion, Amazon appears well-positioned for its next phase of growth. Therefore, I am confident in buying the stock at its current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "June jobs report ushers in new quarter during holiday-shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "content": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.

BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks for the Second Half of 2024",
        "content": "The tech bull market sparked by innovations in generative AI in 2023 continued in the first half of 2024. Even when focusing on tech broadly rather than the industry's strongest performers, the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index yielded a total return of nearly 19%.\n\nKnowing that, investors may wonder which stocks could lead the way in the second half of the year. While the market offers no guarantees, the last two quarters of the year could be the time when some stocks begin to rise in earnest. In this article, three Motley Fool contributors deliver insights on stocks they believe investors should watch for the remainder of the year.\n\nAlphabet is positioned to leverage its search-market dominance into AI riches\n\nJake Lerch (Alphabet): My choice is Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL) (NASDAQ: GOOG), the parent company of Google. What I really like about Alphabet is that the company combines two of the most critical features of any outstanding stock: potential, best represented by its artificial intelligence (AI) tools, and results, as seen in its consistent financial performance.\n\nLet's examine its potential first. Regarding AI, the sky is the limit for Alphabet. The company's latest AI-powered personal assistant, Google Assistant, offers many features to help people accomplish more. Through voice commands alone, users can:\n\nSet timers, create lists, and save locations and passwords. Call, text, and read emails aloud. Gather local information, such as weather, traffic, and directions. Answer general questions, such as \"how many grams in an ounce\" or \"what is 18% of $57.\" Find and play music, movies, or podcasts.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet can capitalize on its massive user base. As the most-visited website in the world, Google processes over 8.5 billion searches per day -- about one for every person on the planet. As such, Alphabet has a significant opportunity to make Google Assistant the preferred AI assistant. This could lead to substantial benefits for Alphabet in the future as it explores ways to monetize Google Assistant through a subscription model where users pay a monthly fee for premium features or an advertising model where companies pay to have their products or services recommended by the assistant.\n\nIn the meantime, Alphabet can rely on its already established businesses, such as Google Cloud, YouTube, and Android, to keep \"bringing home the bacon.\" These businesses show consistent growth and profitability, adding to Alphabet's overall stability and investment potential.\n\nTo sum up, Alphabet could be the AI stock to watch in the back half of 2024 -- and beyond. Investors seeking a stock with an unbeatable combination of potential and results would be wise to consider it.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta stock isn't done riding the AI wave\n\nJustin Pope (Meta Platforms): Social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has been on a rocket-like trajectory. Shares have risen 45% since January and are up an astonishing 326% since January 2023 when artificial intelligence began picking up steam. In just 18 months, Meta stock created the magnitude of wealth the broader market generally takes decades to achieve. I understand if people feel skeptical that Meta has more in the tank.\n\nYet, the fundamentals indicate that Meta could ride its current momentum through the latter half of this year. That's driven primarily by strong operating performance and a stock valuation that's still borderline cheap. Meta's core business is advertising to its billions of social media users. Meta impressively still gains users even though so many people already use its apps. Meta's family of apps, which include Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, grew to 3.24 billion daily active users in the first quarter, a 7% year-over-year jump.\n\nDigital advertising continues to take market share away from older media formats like television and print, so Meta is also enjoying tailwinds there. Meta's ad volume was up 20% year over year in Q1. Lastly, Meta has started using AI to help companies advertise more efficiently, which helped increase Meta's price per ad by 6% in Q1. In other words, Meta benefits from multiple variables boosting its primary business.\n\nInvestors will need to see how Meta continues to perform in future quarters. Analysts are very optimistic; 2024 earnings-per-share estimates of $20.16 would represent 35.5% growth over 2023. Meanwhile, analysts believe Meta will grow earnings by an average of over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Given that healthy growth outlook, Meta stock remains arguably cheap at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 25.\n\nMeta is a world-class business that experienced severe adversity in 2022. The comeback has created eye-popping returns. While Meta's meteoric rise means there's probably far less upside than before, investors shouldn't jump ship too soon. There is still plenty of wind in its sails.\n\nIn the AI chip space, a rising tide could lift AMD\n\nWill Healy(Advanced Micro Devices): Given Nvidia's dominance in the AI chip space, potential competitors are easy to dismiss at first glance.\n\nHowever, according to Allied Market Research, the AI chip industry is expected to grow at a 38% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) through 2032. With Nvidia apparently struggling to meet current demand, it leaves an opening for competitors such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ: AMD).\n\nEven though Nvidia leads in the innovation battle, AMD has a history of catching up to and sometimes surpassing its competitors. Moreover, while a Nvidia AI chip costs around $30,000 to $40,000, AMD's $10,000 to $15,000 semiconductors will likely appeal to customers who are anxious to snap up any AI chips they can find.\n\nMore recently, investors largely overlooked AMD as its revenue of $5.5 billion in Q1 2024 grew by only 2% yearly. However, data-center revenue of $2.3 billion rose 80% over the same period. Moreover, it made up 42% of the company's overall revenue, a level comparable to Nvidia's percentage of data-center revenue at the end of fiscal 2022 (ended Jan. 30, 2022) of 39%.\n\nFast forward to fiscal 2025 Q1 (ended April 28), and 87% of Nvidia's revenue came from its data center segment. With AMD's aforementioned 80% data-center growth, Nvidia's recent history shows how AMD could follow in its footsteps as AI chips become its dominant source of revenue.\n\nAlso, thanks mostly to AI chips, Nvidia's revenue grew 262% yearly in that quarter. Although AMD may or may not match that number over time, Nvidia's recent history describes what could happen to AMD's revenue growth as its AI chip sales accelerate.\n\nAdditionally, AMD holds a significant valuation advantage if looking beyond its misleading P/E ratio of 232. The company currently trades at a price-to-book value ratio of around 4.5. In comparison, Nvidia sells at 63 times its book value. This differential makes AMD stock a relative bargain, giving the stock room to run as the sale of AI chips becomes a more critical revenue stream.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Inc (META): Best Tech Stock to Buy According to Brad Gerstner?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other tech stocks.\n\nGerstner is Bullish on Tech in 2024\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\n\nGerstner Thinks Now is the Right Time to  Invest in Tech\n\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\n\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\n\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund’s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we’ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $1,144,706,778\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nSecond on our list and Brad Gerstner's portfolio is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META). In the first quarter of 2024, the company launched Generative AI image expansion tools on Facebook and Instagram reels. The update has witnessed widespread adoption by small businesses. The company has been making significant progress on AI and Metaverse and plans to increase spending from $35 billion to $40 billion. The decision is driven by significant investments in AI, data centers, chip designs, and R&D. In April, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) introduced its next generation of custom chips to manage the company’s AI workloads. The chips are designed to balance compute, memory bandwidth, and memory capacity for ranking and recommendation models. Last year, the company launched its Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), its first-gen AI inference accelerator. The accelerator is focused on developing efficient architecture for the company’s workloads.\n\nAt the close of Q1 2024, 246 investors disclosed positions in the stock with total stakes amounting to $46.92 billion, up by $44.17 billion from the previous quarter. Considering analysts expect Meta's earnings to grow by 27% this year and 46% by 2025, it is a great pick by Brad Gerstner.\n\nIn 2022, Gerstner sent an open letter to the CEO of META, Mark Zuckerburg, asking for cost-cutting and improving efficiencies. Exactly a year later, on October 26, 2023, Brad Gerstner appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he stated that he regained confidence in the stock after META decided to pursue efficiency throughout the year. He stated that the company has increased its free cash flow from $18 billion to $35 billion in a year, and reduced its headcount by 24% to become a more efficient company. Here are some comments from the interview:\n\n\"A couple months after we wrote the letter, that mark first declared it the year of efficiency, discipline, and rigor. And has he delivered imagine a year ago thinking that they could reaccelerate the top line of the business, while doubling free cash flow from $18 billion to $35 billion, and let's talk about efficiency. He and Elon Musk stand atop the heap of efficiency and reduced head count 24% year over year. From 85,000 to 65,000 employees. Find me another large company in Silicon Valley other than those two that can demonstrate accelerating top lines while reducing head count and get more fit.\"\n\nOn February 2, Gerstner later appeared in interviews on CNBC and talked about how Meta reacted to his letter. He pointed out that the stock gained nearly 270% since his letter, and the company grew its free cash flow by 28% and revenue by 25% in the last quarter of 2023. Moreover, Meta's earnings per person grew by 3x over the past 15 months. Gerstner is bullish on Meta's investments in AI and tech particularly the $20 billion investment in its AR/VR business, which the hedge fund manager believes will add to its enterprise value.\n\nOverall META ranks 2nd on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. You can visit 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner to see the other tech stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment and in this article, we will talk about TheTop MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment.\n\nDeclining College Enrollments\n\nThe National Center for Education Statistics (NCES) reports that college enrollment decreased by nearly 14.6% in the US between 2010 and 2021. Particularly, enrollments at 4-year private for-profit colleges decreased by about 54%. Declining enrollments in colleges is an indication that many high school graduates are either struggling to cope with the financial difficulties that come with a conventional career path or simply failing to see the value of investing in a college degree. According to a survey published by HCM Strategists, 64% of survey respondents who did not wish to attend college did so because of financial reasons. 38% were not willing to attend college due to fears about the cost of college and amassing debt. The remaining 26% believed it was more important to work and earn money in the short term.\n\nIn times past, it was quite common for American students to utilize educational loans in order to secure their future. However, BankRate reveals that 24% of Americans believe that borrowing too much for their education is their biggest financial regret. Consequently, even those capable of obtaining student loans are skeptical about whether or not a college degree is worth the debt. Moreover, increasing interest rates on federal student loans are likely to shake confidence in student loans even further. Recently, the Education Department announced that as of July 1st, the interest rate on new federal student loans would be rising to 6.53%, in comparison to 5.5% currently. In addition, rates on graduate and professional loans will be rising to 8.08%.\n\nDue to the increasing impracticality of college education, many individuals are choosing to supplement their CVs with comparatively affordable and flexible alternatives. One such alternative that has become quite popular is digital education platforms such as Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY) and Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR). While such courses are unable to unlock doors in the same manner as a college degree, they can be used to learn useful skills. Moreover, several renowned companies, such as Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ: META), and International Business Machines Corporation (NYSE: IBM) now offer professional certifications online through Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), allowing users to showcase their skills proficiency.\n\nStory continues\n\nMBA Enrollment Trends\n\nDeclining enrollments in colleges isn’t exclusively an American phenomenon. Whilst some countries around the world are currently experiencing an increase in college enrollments, research from GMAC reveals that business school applications are experiencing a decline worldwide. In a survey of nearly 250 business schools, it was revealed that applications to all business school programs fell by almost 5 % in 2023, following a 3.4 % decline in 2022.\n\nThe statistics are even worse for MBA program applications, which fell by 6.5% and 4.9% during 2022 and 2023 respectively. MBA is arguably the most prestigious graduate accreditation offered by business schools. Apart from allowing individuals of non-business backgrounds to pivot their careers towards a management path, an MBA can be a catalyst for career growth. In fact, in 2022, GMAC estimated that MBA graduates working at US companies earn a median annual salary of $115,000. In comparison, those with a bachelor's degree earned a median salary of $75,000.\n\nConsidering this, it might be surprising why fewer and fewer people are inclined to enroll in an MBA, even in comparison to other business school degrees. However, much like college education in general, the financial requisites of an MBA, as well as the risks associated with student debt, have resulted in a decline in MBA enrollment. While the cost of an MBA depends greatly on the institution of study, Education Data Initiative estimates that an average MBA in the US costs $56,850. For top-tier B-schools, this figure is well over $200,000. In addition, most MBA students also have to deal with the financial impact of having to relocate and/or give up work for the course of their degree.\n\nThus, despite the many benefits of an MBA, it has become an unfeasible career path for many working-class Americans. However, much like alternatives that are offered by Coursera, Inc. (NYSE: COUR) and Udemy, Inc. (NASDAQ: UDMY), many high-ranked universities now offer online MBA degrees that are both affordable and flexible to the needs of working-class Americans. In addition, most of these degrees can be completed without forgoing your existing job.\n\nOnline MBA: An Alternative to Conventional MBA\n\nAn online MBA degree from the Jack Welch Management Institute at Strayer University has an estimated cost of $35,000, just 62% of an average MBA. It is worth noting that this particular degree was featured in the list of Top 10 Online MBA Programs by both The Princeton Review and Poets & Quants. Strayer University is a subsidiary of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA), Inc., a company dedicated to providing innovative educational services.\n\nIn late April, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) announced its Q1 2024 financial results. During the period, the company achieved a YoY increase in revenue of 13.1% to $290.3 million. The majority of revenue was generated through the company’s U.S. Higher Education (USHE) Segment, which comprises of Strayer University and Capella University. The segment yields a revenue of $219.2 million, which was an 11.3% increase from the same period in 2023.\n\nImproved margins in the USHE segment yielded an overall adjusted net income of $26.8 million and adjusted diluted EPS of $1.11. In Q1 2023, the company posted an adjusted diluted LPS of $0.09, primarily caused by significant losses in its Australia/New Zealand segment, which has since turned profitable. Currently, Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock has a forward P/E ratio of 23.15 and is priced at approximately $109.\n\nWhile we at Insider Monkey recognize the potential of Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) stock and its potential to generate returns, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns and doing so within a shorter time frame. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Strategic Education, Inc. (NASDAQ: STRA) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAlthough online MBA is an affordable alternative to in-person MBA programs, the quality of in-person learning is difficult to emulate in an online environment. Thus, individuals looking to enroll in the best MBA programs might find that the highest-paying MBA programs are ones that offer in-person, full-time instruction. One method of figuring out what are the most profitable MBA degrees is to calculate whichMBA school has the best ROI. With that in mind, join us as we look at the top MBA programs with the highest return on investment. The Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nThe Top MBA Program with the Highest Return on Investment\n\nMethodology\n\nTo develop our list of top MBA programs with the highest return on investment, we initially picked out the most highly rated MBA programs in the US. We used rankings from sources such as QS and Fortune to develop a shortlist of 50 universities. To ensure the schools were comparable, we focused only on full-time, two-year MBA programs, which is the most common structure for MBA degrees. Further research was narrowed down to these only.\n\nAmong these highly rated MBA programs in the US, we calculated the average expense using the cost of attendance data provided by each school. To calculate each program’s return we used the median base salary based on the latest available employment reports. Using an expected increase in salary of 3% per year, we calculated each program’s return on investment during the first 5 years of employment. The top 15 institutes were chosen as the top MBA programs with the highest return on investment.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter's strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nHere is the top MBA program with the highest return on investment:\n\n1. The University of Texas at Austin - McCombs School of Business\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 10\n\nTotal Cost of Attendance: $177,610\n\nMedian Base Salary: $175,000\n\nROI: 423%\n\nThe University of Texas at Austin is the flagship institution of the University of Texas System. In 2023, the school’s MBA graduates achieved the highest average base salary in its history of $157,735 and a median salary of $175,000. The estimated 2-year cost of attendance of the program is $177,610, the second lowest on our list.\n\nAccording to the institution’s website, McCombs facilitated 80% of job opportunities through internships, recruiting through Texas McCombs corporate partner ecosystem, alumni and staff networking, or other UT Austin resources. Approximately 69% of MBA graduates secured employment in Southwest US, while 43% of all graduates ended up in the consulting industry.\n\nTo learn about other top MBA programs with the highest return on investment, you can check out our detailed report on the 15 Top MBA Programs with the Highest Return on Investment.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best online ESL courses to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META): One of the Best Growth Stocks According to Ray Dalio?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other growth stocks.\n\nRay Dalio is one of the most successful investors in Wall Street's history. He has invested through his firm Bridgewater Associates, and according to Insider Monkey's research, Bridgewater had a 13F portfolio worth $19.7 billion as of Q1 2024 end. What's more, is that we also looked at the top hedge funds on Wall Street as part of our coverage of 23 Best Hedge Funds of All Time and discovered that Bridgewater Associates ranked in the top five due to its $30 billion in gains since inception.\n\nLooking at these, it's clear that Dalio and his firm must be doing at least something right. Ray Dalio is a macro player who not only loves to look at the broader trends that affect the economy, but he also loves diversification and selling stocks at the right time. This approach differs from several other hedge funds which choose to focus on specific companies or are proponents of buying and holding stocks for the long term. Dalio's strategy allows his fund to manage a changing economic and investment climate, as part of what is dubbed an All Weather Strategy.\n\nHowever, despite his success, 2024 has been a mixed year for Bridgewater Associates. The firm, currently headed by CEO Nir Bar Dea, is currently shaking things up as its Pure Alpha fund has lost 4% for the last four years. This fund also had one of its worst years in history in 2023, but the changes do appear to be making their mark. This is because in Q1, the fund posted 16% in returns which were higher than the 4.59% in gains made by global hedge funds.\n\nAs for Dalio, even though he has moved forward from directly overseeing Bridgewater's affairs, the investment guru regularly shares his wisdom with the world. He started 2024 by listing five key forces that will play a dominant theme in the investment environment this year. In a LinkedIn post, the billionaire shared that these forces are those that determine how the economy, the American and global political systems, forces of nature, and humanity's innovation work.\n\nWhile these forces are important for 2024, Dalio's life's work has focused on studying them over the course of the years and analyzing how they match similar trends in history. This makes his investment approach one of the most unique ones in the industry, and it appears to be yielding results as between 1991 and 2022, Bridgewater's Pure Alpha fund has delivered 11.4% in average annual returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nDalio is also one of the few investors in the world who takes a serious approach to studying history and understanding the implications on the broader investing environment. Ever eager to share his insights, the famed investor gave a talk at Columbia Business School in April. Commenting on the investment approach at Bridgewater, the billionaire shared his values, philosophy, and guiding beacons for the process. He started out by sharing that he began his career by trading commodities because they had low margin requirements which would let him make more money. The stock market crash of 1982, which forced Dalio to borrow $4,000 from his father to pay bills was also critical in formulating his investment approach. As we've mentioned above, diversification is a key theme of Dalio's All Weather Strategy, and the market crash influenced this approach:\n\nAnd the way I looked at the risk, is I said, it's like I, I, had a visual image that there's this jungle there. And if I can cross the jungle without getting killed to the other side I would be okay. But I have to go through that, and then, or I could stay on the safe life side. And not take those risks. And how would I do that? And that was a problem that I had to figure out. And I realized two things I needed to do. I needed to diversify because it's like my 15 uncorrelated returns stream mantra. I've realized that if I can have debts, 15 good uncorrelated return streams that I could reduce my risk by 80% with keeping the same expected returns.\n\nSo that was a big thing. And the other thing is I realized that I needed to do it with people who were on the mission who could see what I couldn't see. I wanted people that we would stress test each other and challenge each other. We all see differently. Each one of you, have what you see is different from the way other people see. And, and when you start to have an appreciation of  how people see things differently and you can get through that, that's a great power. And so, I, it was like  going into the jungle with others who were on the same mission with me. And we'd protect each other and so on.\n\nFinally, before we get to Ray Dalio's top growth stock picks, it's also important to understand why such stocks are important particularly in today's investment environment. US economic growth slowed down to 1.6% in Q1 from 2.4% in Q4 2023. At the same time, while the stock market has flourished on the AI front, other sectors have shown that persistently high inflation and tight credit conditions are making their mark. Since the economy is the sum product goods and services produced, firms whose revenue growth outpaces the consumer price index (CPI) inflation of 3.3% for May and the GDP growth are adding more customers to their top line instead of simply matching economic trends. Combining such stocks with the investment principles of the legendary Ray Dalio can help gain a better understanding of some of the market's top sectors.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at the top growth stocks that Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates have invested in.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of Ray Dalio's top growth stocks, we analyzed Bridgewater Associate's 13F filings for Q1 2024 and picked out ten stocks with strong fiscal year annual revenue growth among the top 80 stocks.\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nLatest Fiscal Year Annual Growth Rate: 15.69%\n\nBridgewater Associates' Q1 2024 Investment: $482 million\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) needs no introduction due to the near ubiquity of its social media products. Its size and heft, aided by a large user base, means that the firm has to continuously think of unique ways to increase user engagement on Facebook and Instagram. The more time users spend on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s platforms, the more money the firm can earn through advertisers, which are often eager to work with it due to the sizeable user base. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has also kept itself abreast with the latest technology trends by not only competing at the high end of the artificial intelligence industry through its Llama AI model but by also integrating AI features into its platform to drive consumer engagement. This makes Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) an early mover in integrating AI into social media, and the only headwinds that it can face are a slowdown in ad spending due to economic weakness or regulatory action against its heft.\n\nBaron Funds mentioned Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the fund said:\n\nShares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, rose 37.3% in the quarter due to robust fourth quarter top-line growth of 25% year-over-year with operating margins more than doubling year-over-year to 41%, benefiting from the year of efficiency12 as Meta’s headcount was down 22% year-over-year (note that the profitability of the core business is even stronger as Reality Labs’ losses of over $4.5 billion in the quarter are included in the overall operating income metric). Meta also guided for first- quarter revenue growth of approximately 29% year-over-year, which was better than expected. Advertiser satisfaction and adoption of Meta remains strong, core app engagement is healthy with video daily watch time up 25% year-over-year and the total number of monthly active users up 6% year-on-year to 3.98 billion in the fourth quarter, and Instagram Reels and click-to-message ads monetization continues to improve. Meta also continues to rapidly innovate in GenAI, with its leading research lab releasing widely adopted open-source models (e.g., Llama 2), and internal algorithms and core apps becoming augmented with AI (e.g., Meta’s recommendation engine). We remain shareholders and believe Meta can sustain its leading market share in digital advertising thanks to strong network effects enabled by its massive user and advertiser base. Additionally, we believe the company’s innovative culture, large installed base, and leading GenAI research should enable it to embed AI and GenAI into its offerings with further monetization opportunities ahead. For example, AI agents could help scale business messaging, handling a large volume of customer requests on behalf of business customers, making business messaging at scale more viable.\n\nOverall META ranks 8th on our list of the best growth stocks to buy according to billionaire Ray Dalio. You can visit 10 Best Growth Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Ray Dalio to see the other growth stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Trillion-Dollar Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Larger companies are sometimes perceived as having less upside potential than smaller ones. That's one reason some people might hesitate to invest in stocks with market caps above $1 trillion.\n\nBut tech giants Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) have a new secret weapon that could allow them to deliver solid returns in the medium term: artificial intelligence (AI). Even beyond that, Microsoft and Meta Platforms have numerous qualities of \"forever stocks.\"\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft was partly responsible for kick-starting Wall Street's recent obsession with AI, which began when ChatGPT burst onto the scene. Microsoft has been an investor in OpenAI, the company behind ChatGPT.\n\nSince the initial craze that made the AI chatbot famous, the two companies have amended their collaboration, with Microsoft doubling down and boosting its stake in the privately held AI specialist to 49%. The partners also offer services that allow other companies to build their own generative AI platforms, which Microsoft offers through its cloud computing arm, Azure.\n\nAccording to Microsoft's management, more than 65% of the Fortune 500 now use Azure OpenAI services. Those services look particularly promising for the company, not least because cloud computing was already its most important growth driver. Management says that Azure continues to gain market share partly thanks to AI.\n\nThat is helping Microsoft deliver solid results. In its fiscal 2024 third quarter, which ended March 31, revenue increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, and net income rose 20% to $21.9 billion.\n\nIts recent results have been strong, but what makes Microsoft a forever stock? At least three things: First, it is an incredibly innovative company, an important factor for it to stay relevant and successful over the long run.\n\nSecond, the company has solid competitive advantages stemming from several sources. Its computer operating system benefits from high switching costs, and it has one of the most valuable brand names in the world.\n\nAnd third, it has attractive opportunities and a long runway for growth in several industries, especially in AI and cloud computing. Income seekers should also find what they want with this stock: Microsoft is arguably the most attractive dividend stock among the \"Magnificent Seven.\"\n\nThe company has increased its payouts by almost 168% in the past decade, and reinvested dividends can substantially boost investors' long-term returns. That's another excellent reason to hold on to the stock for good.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nLast year, Facebook parent Meta Platforms released Llama, a large language model that has become popular in its own right. It has since introduced several newer versions of Llama in an open-source capacity.\n\nLlama is the backbone of Meta AI, a virtual assistant the company recently debuted. Meta Platforms has also implemented various other related initiatives to boost its business. AI algorithms on Facebook and Instagram that help encourage users to watch Reels for extended stretches of time are helping bolster the company's advertising revenue.\n\nThat being said, AI doesn't contribute much to Meta's revenue and earnings yet, but that could change, considering the company is setting itself up to be a leader in the field.\n\nIn the meantime, it still has one of the largest digital ecosystems -- perhaps the largest -- of any company worldwide. It ended the first quarter with 3.24 billion daily active users. When ad spending dropped a couple of years ago, it navigated that storm, and has now rebounded, partly thanks to its vast user base. In the first quarter, revenue increased by 27% year over year to $36.5 billion. Its net income more than doubled to $12.4 billion.\n\nAnd the company benefits from the network effect. A website like Instagram becomes more valuable as more people use it -- the more people who are on it, the more useful it will be to them, and the more that people on the outside looking in will tend to want to join it. The same applies to Facebook. Meta Platforms has also proved to be an innovative company beyond AI. It is one of the leaders in virtual reality.\n\nInnovation, an economic moat in the form of the network effect, and growth potential in fields such as AI and online advertising make Meta Platforms an excellent forever stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Instead of DJT as Trump Media Keeps Falling",
        "content": "On the heels of the Trump/Biden presidential debate, shares in Trump Media & Technology (NASDAQ:DJT) surged in after-hours trading. However, it promptly nosedived after the markets opened.\n\nBut does Trump’s debate win mean the stock is worth buying, or are there stocks to buy instead of Trump Media that capture both political will and emergent social media opportunities?\n\nFrom a purely operational success standpoint, and not accounting for its meme stock status, Trump Media is cooked. Though the initial premise of Truth Social as a free speech platform once held promise, after X realigned its moderation policies there’s little benefit to yet another social media platform. Moreover, the most important demographics — younger users who are happy to use social media as a shopping platform — stick to more familiar names.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTrading at 1,200x sales today and facing dwindling download rates alongside reduced user engagement, these stocks to buy instead of Trump Media offer what the platform once promised with improved operational outlooks to boot.\n\nRumble (RUM) In this photo illustration the Rumble logo seen displayed on a smartphone. RUM stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nViewers flocked to Rumble (NASDAQ:RUM) this week to catch the Presidential Debate as the platform attracted a broad range of watchers just as interested in their favorite pundit’s opinion as the debate itself. This wide-ranging user base and improved content moderation perspectives, compared to alternatives like YouTube, are what set Rumble apart. They also make it a core component of the stocks to buy instead of Trump Media.\n\nRumble has a long way to go before it’s a major competitor to platforms like YouTube, but its current trajectory is promising. Despite first-quarter monthly active users (MAU) dipping below 2023 highs, the global MAUs remain reliably above 50 million.\n\nIn its latest quarterly report, Rumble posted a loss of 14 cents per share, outperforming analyst expectations, which had predicted a 22-cent loss per share. Alongside these financial results, Rumble made a bold strategic move by filing an antitrust lawsuit against Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google. The lawsuit alleges that Google engages in online advertising practices that unfairly favor its own platform, YouTube, over competitors like Rumble. While the lawsuit’s outcome is uncertain, it still creates a “David and Goliath” underdog story that could propel Rumble to new heights.\n\nBuzzFeed (BZFD) Buzzfeed (BZFD) logo displayed on screen resting on top of a black keyboard with colorful lighting behind keys\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Ralf Liebhold\n\nLike Rumble, BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) counts itself among the ranks of undervalued media stocks to buy instead of Trump Media, which could soon gain more attention due to increasing activist shareholder activity. Over the years, BuzzFeed has faced multiple scandals, including allegations of plagiarism, excessive advertiser influence and controversial political stances that have turned off many readers.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese issues, combined with declining sales and limited profitability, likely attracted the interest of former presidential candidate and activist investor Vivek Ramaswamy. Ramaswamy recently acquired a significant stake in BuzzFeed, indicating his intention to implement major changes within the company.\n\nRamaswamy is currently engaging with BuzzFeed’s board and recently met with CEO Jonah Peretti to discuss various operational and strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value. This includes potential staff reductions and the company’s editorial and business strategies shift.\n\nHis investment reflects a broader strategy to address the lack of high-quality, independent media outlets while promoting greater transparency, objectivity and quality in media content.\n\nDespite some pushback from BuzzFeed’s current management, Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management is establishing itself as a powerful player in activist investing and Buzzfeed itself has the potential to stand out from other stocks to buy instead of Trump Media.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the icon TikTok and Facebook app seen displayed on a smartphone. Meta stock to buy if TikTok banned.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is strategically repositioning itself in a way that, despite its comparative market saturation, still seems viable among stocks to buy instead of Trump Media. By observing X’s post-Musk growth, Meta may be aligning its values with evolving consumer preferences for freer speech and a broader diversity of opinions. Often perceived as a platform for older generations, Meta is maintaining its dominance among Gen Z users — which could prove profitable if the TikTok ban goes into effect.\n\nDespite delays in Mark Zuckerberg’s ambitious metaverse vision, the shift toward virtual reality as a key element in future digital interactions seems inevitable. While interest in metaverse-related activities like virtual fashion shows and real estate has waned due to technological and accessibility hurdles, the sector’s moderate demand remains steady. This positions Meta’s metaverse initiative to eventually lead the evolving social media landscape, even if initial efforts were a bit premature.\n\nFurthermore, Meta’s forward-thinking approach is supported by its strong foundation of over 10 million active advertisers, who pay premium rates for prominent visibility in user feeds. This combination of innovative outlook and robust advertising revenue solidifies Meta as a blue-chip leader among stocks to buy instead of Trump Media.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world’s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades “well into” overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.  QQQ tracks  the Nasdaq-100 Index and it’s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\n\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is an important constituent of the QQQ which is overbought now according to investment firm BTIG. While Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) RSI value of 55 is not outlandishly high, it’s still worse than 70% of the 600 companies in the interactive media industry, according to data from GuruFocus.\n\nMeta is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had “made…META substantially larger” during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency,” a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META’s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\n\nAlthough these multiples are now back to “normal” levels, they are hardly expensive for a company whose top line growth re-accelerated into the double digits, with operating leverage and despite ongoing heavy investments in the Reality Labs segment. These are the reasons why we continue to hold a large position in META. As for why we did some selling, we want to emphasize a few key points:…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) is Attracting Investor Attention: Here is What You Should Know",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) is one of the stocks most watched by Zacks.com visitors lately. So, it might be a good idea to review some of the factors that might affect the near-term performance of the stock.\n\nShares of this social media company have returned +11.2% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.5% change. The Zacks Internet - Software industry, to which Meta Platforms belongs, has gained 4% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Meta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share, indicating a change of +44.3% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.6%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.04 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates indicate +17.8% and +13.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "SYDNEY (Reuters) - Facebook owner Meta is considering blocking news content from the platform in Australia if the government makes it pay licensing fees, a company representative told a parliamentary hearing on Friday.\n\nMeta's regional policy director Mia Garlick told lawmakers \"all options are on the table\" when asked if the company would block Australians from sharing news content to avoid paying fees.\n\n\"There's a large number of channels that people can get news content from,\" Garlick told the inquiry.\n\nShe said Meta was waiting for Canberra to decide if it would apply an untested 2021 law which gives the government the right to set the fees U.S. tech giants pay media outlets for links.\n\nThe comments are the strongest indication so far that Meta would take the same hardline approach in Australia it took in Canada in 2023 when that country introduced similar laws.\n\nMeta struck deals with Australian media firms including News Corp and the Australian Broadcasting Corp when the law was brought in Australia, but has since said it will not renew those arrangements beyond 2024.\n\nIt now falls on Australia's assistant treasurer to decide whether to step in and force Facebook to pay for news content. The assistant treasurer has said he is still collecting advice but that Meta seems to respect the law only when it suits.\n\nAsked if blocking news from Facebook in Australia would amount to sidestepping the law, Garlick said taking that action would be complying with it.\n\n\"Every other law - tax laws, safety laws, privacy laws - we work to comply with,\" she said. \"It's just compliance would look slightly different in relation to this law if it's fully enacted.\"\n\nGarlick defended Meta's processes for Australians to complain if they believed the company was spreading harmful misinformation or scams, although she said its content moderation centres were all in other countries.\n\nAsked about Australian mining billionaire Andrew Forrest, who is suing Meta for showing cryptocurrency scam advertisements featuring his face, Garlick said the company had processes in place to detect and stop scams, but \"there are a lot of challenges\".\n\nHow could Meta call itself an advertising business when \"some ads sell lies\", asked Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young.\n\n\"We have policies and systems and tools to do everything we can to prevent those ads,\" Garlick replied.\n\n(Reporting by Byron Kaye; Editing by Stephen Coates)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Stock Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to enjoy a solid run as the improving macro environment, coupled with the AI optimism and recent stock upgrades, provides solid support for risk assets.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600, up from the previous target of 5,200.\n\nThis revision by one of the most important financial institutions is attributed to robust earnings growth from five major U.S. technology companies and a higher projected fair value price-to-earnings ratio multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have seen a combined surge of 45%, now representing 25% of the S&P 500’s equity capitalization.\n\nGoldman points to upward adjustments in the 2024 earnings estimates for these tech companies and valuation increases driven by growing investor excitement around artificial intelligence. The broker anticipates that stable real yields by the end of the year and strong earnings performance will justify a 15x P/E ratio for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index.\n\nHowever, the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November poses a significant risk to the S&P 500’s levels, as historically, index volatility has increased leading up to the election. Post-election, the trend typically reverses, with the index recovering to higher levels.\n\nThe news that Goldman lifted its target came as Evercore ISI also revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 on Sunday, setting it to Street-high 6,000, up from 4,750. The firm expects an 8% earnings growth in 2023, bolstered by the potential of the AI “revolution.”\n\nAs valuation models are refreshed to account for higher multiples, we look at 3 hottest stock upgrades from last week.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Known for its innovative products and strong brand, Nike consistently delivers strong financial performance and growth potential, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) upgraded its rating for Nike, shifting from a neutral “Perform” stance to a more bullish “Outperform.” Alongside the stock upgrades, the firm also increased its price target for the sportswear giant’s shares from $110.00 to $120.00.\n\nThe stock upgrades come after a period when Nike faced a series of challenges that impacted its sales growth and profit margins. According to Oppenheimer, these difficulties included a mix of external and internal factors that have now been largely accounted for in the company’s current stock price and financial projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm’s analysis suggests that the current market valuation of Nike’s shares and the short-term financial expectations have become “derisked.” This term indicates that the risks previously associated with Nike’s performance are now reflected in its stock price, setting a stage for potential recovery.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is a leading retailer of electronics, appliances and tech services. With a broad product range and strong market presence, it attracts investors seeking exposure to consumer electronics and retail sectors.\n\nRecently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded shares of Best Buy, moving the rating from “Neutral” to “Buy.” Accompanying the stock upgrades, the firm also increased the price target for the retailer’s stock to $106 from the previous $85. The stock upgrades come with a positive outlook from UBS on Best Buy’s potential performance over the next 18 months.\n\nUBS identified several factors that could drive the company’s sales upward. These include an anticipated improvement in housing trends, which typically correlate with appliance sales, and a pending electronics replacement cycle that occurs every four to seven years.\n\nMoreover, the firm expects product innovation, particularly involving artificial intelligence, to boost sales by an average of approximately 200 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, UBS highlighted Best Buy’s expansion into new product categories, such as e-bikes and furniture, as a potential growth avenue. The firm predicts that these elements combined could lead to a robust recovery in Best Buy’s sales in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a major producer of aluminum, known for its mining, refining and smelting operations. Its position in the industrial metals sector and focus on sustainability make it an appealing investment for those interested in materials and infrastructure growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) revisited its recommendations on mining companies, lifting ratings on Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Analysts upgraded Alcoa from “Equal Weight” to “Overweight,” setting a new price target of $50.00, up from the previous $36.50.\n\nThe stock upgrades come against the backdrop of disruptions in the global alumina supply, which are expected to keep prices elevated. The broker pointed out that approximately 5.9 million tonnes of alumina capacity disruptions have occurred, accounting for about 10% of the global supply outside of China.\n\nThese disruptions, coupled with China’s increased need to import alumina, are anticipated to tighten the global supply and sustain higher alumina prices than historical averages, potentially reaching $500 in the second half of 2024 and $385 in 2025.\n\nThe situation is also expected to constrain China’s aluminum production, despite the country’s plans to restart some operations. Morgan Stanley’s projections suggest aluminum prices could be supported at $1.22 in the latter half of 2024 and $1.12 in 2025. This outlook appears to be a driving factor behind the positive sentiment on Alcoa’s stock.\n\nAdditionally, Freeport-McMoRan received an upgrade from “Equal Weight” to “Overweight,” with the price target being lifted to $62.00 from the former $49.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

        "content": "You don’t need much money to invest in the stock market. Fractional investing makes it possible to invest in any company, even if you do not have enough cash to buy an entire share.\n\nWhile stock investors can get wealthy by picking the right stocks, it ultimately comes down to regularly contributing to your portfolio. Did you find a stock that’s going to double this year? That will only turn your $1,000 portfolio into a $2,000 one. Once you get up to a $100,000 portfolio, a doubling and any incremental gain start to mean much more.\n\nRegularly investing in your portfolio is a common path to achieving long-term financial goals. If you only have $500 to invest, you may benefit from putting that cash to work in one of these compelling growth stocks to buy, or you could use the power of fractional shares to get at least a portion of each. These picks feature rising revenue and plenty of long-term catalysts that can support further acceleration.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s been hard to bet against Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) since CEO Mark Zuckerberg strongly focused on efficiency. Revenue growth remains elevated while net income continues to soar. Facebook’s parent company reported strong results in the first quarter. Revenue increased by 27% from a year ago, while net income surged by 117%.\n\nRising profit margins will continue to strengthen the firm’s price-to-earnings ratio, which currently stands at 28.5x. Given the company’s tremendous growth and dominance in the online advertising, it’s a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has some of the most popular social networks under its corporate umbrella, and they have delivered astonishing gains for its investors.\n\nMeta Platforms stock gained 43% year-to-date and has rallied by 159% over the past five years. Analysts have been rushing to raise their price targets as the “strong buy” pick continues to rise. The average price target suggests a 6% upside from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the most well-diversified corporations on the stock market. It exposes investors to many growing industries, and Microsoft is gaining market share in many of them. Artificial intelligence continues to capture headlines, and the company has taken advantage of the opportunity. Microsoft Cloud and Copilot are two of the company’s catalysts for AI.\n\nMicrosoft Cloud, in particular, has been a big winner for the company. Cloud revenue increased by 23% from a year ago to reach $35.1 billion in in the company’s fiscal third quarter of 2024. That’s more than half of the company’s revenue in the quarter. Microsoft reported $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year ago. Net income increased by 20% to reach $21.9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nWall Street is bullish on Microsoft, and analysts have given it a “strong buy” rating. The average price suggests an 11% upside from current levels. Microsoft has been consistently outperforming the market for many years. It logged a 21% year-to-date gain and has jumped by 228% over the past five years.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware.\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is on a historic tear, soaring by more than 3,200% over the past five years. The chipmaker is at the forefront of the AI boom and has a comfortable lead over its competitors.\n\nWhile investors know that Nvidia can’t maintain triple-digit revenue growth rates forever, the firm is still maintaining that growth rate. Revenue surged by 262% year-over-year in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, while net income was up by 628%. Both growth rates comfortably exceed the stock’s 194% gain over the past year.\n\nNvidia is one of the few high-growth corporations that are keeping up with its growth. Recent gains are backed by impressive revenue and earnings growth rates. Nvidia briefly became the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation and will likely reclaim that crown. The stock has a $3.1 trillion market cap and trades at a P/E of 74x.\n\nDuolingo (DUOL) The word \"hello\" is written in a variety of languages in a handwritten style.\n\nSource: Anna Kutukova / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou don’t have to narrow your search to multi-trillion-dollar tech companies to find compelling opportunities in the stock market. Some corporations are much smaller and have market caps below $10 billion. Duolingo (NASDAQ:DUOL) certainly fits this description.\n\nThe stock is barely down year-to-date and has logged a 45% gain over the past year. The company has strong financials and rising profit margins. The only weakness is the educational tech firm’s P/E of 214x, but that should improve soon. The language learning app reported 45% year-over-year revenue growth and $27 million in profits in the first quarter. In the same quarter last year, Duolingo lost $2.6 million.\n\nA rapidly growing user base forms the foundation for future growth. Daily active users were up by 54% from a year ago while monthly active users increased by 35%. With 97.6 million monthly active users at the end of the first quarter, it’s likely for Duolingo to exceed 100 million monthly active users in its next quarterly report. The app also has 31.4 million daily active users.\n\nRobinhood (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) is innovating the brokerage industry. The firm started moving toward commission-free stock trades and has a few resources to help it stand out.\n\nRobinhood seems to be swinging for the fences with Robinhood Gold. The number of benefits in this plan suggests that other brokerage firms and traditional banks will have to offer better products and services to catch up.\n\nRobinhood Gold offers many products that the average consumer will find difficult to resist. You can receive 1% back on all qualifying deposits, a credit card that offers unlimited 3% cashback on all purchases, zero interest on the first $1,000 of margin, lower margin rates than most of the competition, 3% IRA matching on every dollar each year, and more.\n\nIt’s no wonder the stock has doubled over the past year. Recent financials were also great. Revenue increased by 40% year-over-year in the first quarter while net income more than doubled.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) The Brazilian flag with the sun in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is another fintech firm worth monitoring. The Brazilian digital bank gained 51% in 2024 and is rated as a “strong buy” among Wall Street analysts. The average price target suggests a 12% upside, while the highest price target indicates that a 22% gain is possible.\n\nWhat’s up with the gains and strong investor sentiment? The company’s first-quarter earnings offer a glimpse into the excitement. Revenue increased by 69% from a year ago, while net income soared by 167%. The firm reported a 43.2% gross profit margin.\n\nA booming customer base has supported the bank’s expansion as it taps into loans, credit cards, bank accounts, brokerage accounts, and other financial services. The company closed out the first quarter with 99.3 million customers, a 26% year-over-year improvement. That’s also up sequentially from 93.9 million customers in Q4 2023. More than 80% of Nu Holdings’ customers are active.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nEveryone needs sneakers, and there’s plenty of competition in the industry. However, newer companies like Deckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) are gaining market share from their larger rivals. You may not know the company by its corporate name, but you may have heard of Hoka and Ugg. Deckers Outdoor is the parent company of those brands.\n\nThe athletic apparel company is currently rated as a “moderate buy” and has a projected 8% upside from current levels. Shares are up 45% year-to-date and have soared 459% over the past five years. The company’s recent inclusion in the S&P 500 brought more attention to the stock.\n\nDeckers Outdoor shined in its first quarterly report as a corporation listed in the S&P 500. The firm reported 21.2% year-over-year net sales growth in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Domestic and international sales had double-digit growth rates with Hoka leading the way. The company’s profits increased by 39% year-over-year, resulting in a 13.3% net profit margin.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in MSFT, NVDA, and DECK.

        "title": "Here Is My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Right Now (Hint: It's Not Nvidia)",
        "content": "Semiconductor giant Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been on a roll, with shares soaring a mind-boggling 200% last year. Hyperscalers, enterprises, start-ups, and even governments have increasingly focused on adopting accelerated computing solutions to develop advanced artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities.\n\nNot surprisingly, demand for Nvidia's cutting-edge AI chips, networking solutions, and software has soared at an unprecedented pace. Nvidia is a key beneficiary and an enabler of the AI boom. Its full-stack AI platform (hardware, software, and networking solutions) enables clients to rapidly build \"AI factories\" (essential infrastructure for generating AI-based outputs), which in turn helps expand the AI market.\n\nWhile all this paints a rosy picture for Nvidia, the company also faces headwinds such as increasing competition, geopolitical tensions, and the risk of self-cannibalization (due to an accelerated pace of rollouts) . On top of all that, the stock trades at over 33 times trailing-12-month sales.\n\nInvestors who find Nvidia expensive can consider opting for social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) as another exceptional way to ride the AI wave, albeit at a relatively lower cost. Here's why Meta Platforms can be a smart pick for astute investors.\n\nAI leadership\n\nMeta's prowess in building cutting-edge consumer-facing products is unbeatable, and the recently released Meta AI assistant is no exception. Launched in the first quarter, Meta AI is seeing rapid adoption with \"tens of millions\" of people trying the assistant within a few weeks of launch, according to the company. Meta AI, powered by the Llama 3 language model, is capable of language understanding, image and video generation, creating animations from still images, and overall multi-modal reasoning. Meta expects to make this assistant the most widely used one worldwide.\n\nMeta claims that the Llama 3 model has emerged as \"industry-leading\" based on several public benchmarks and its ability to understand and generate natural language compared to other state-of-the-art language models. The company has also developed three versions of the Llama 3 model (capable of handling different parameter sizes) for multiple deployment environments and use cases.\n\nThe company has already released 8 billion and 70 billion parameter models, (parameters are the variables used for training large AI models) while the 400-plus billion parameter model is still in training. Meta also plans to open-source these models, making them even more robust in the coming years.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta has also been aggressively integrating AI in all aspects of its business, whether it's content recommendations to drive user engagement on its social media platforms or a suite of AI tools called Advantage+ to help advertisers optimize and automate advertising campaigns.\n\nExceptional scale and reach\n\nMeta Platforms' family of apps (Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, WhatsApp) was used daily by nearly 3.2 billion people -- or almost 40% of the global population -- in March 2024. The company's unmatched geographic reach is pivotal in establishing its dominance in the digital advertising landscape. Meta is expected to continue being the second-largest player in the U.S. digital advertising market, accounting for an 18.9% share of U.S. digital ad dollars in 2024.\n\nAI-powered recommendations are helping Meta improve content relevance and user engagement on its social media platforms. In the first quarter, 30% of the posts on the Facebook Feed and more than 50% of the content seen on Instagram was AI-recommended. Reels, a short-form video content format, has also helped boost user engagement, accounting for almost half of the time spent on Instagram in the first quarter. WhatsApp also picked up momentum in the number of daily actives and messages sent, especially in the U.S. market.\n\nThe increase in user engagement has translated into improved advertiser performance on Meta's platforms. The total number of ad impressions grew by 20% year over year, while the average price per advertisement was up 6% year over year in the first quarter. Meta's Asia Pacific and \"Rest of World\" segments have emerged as the fastest-growing ad markets, followed by Europe and North America. Meta has also seen conversions (desired actions such as sales or app installations) grow faster than ad impressions in the first quarter.\n\nAdoption of Advantage+ tools has also risen, considering that the revenue from the \"Advantage+ Shopping\" and \"Advantage+ App Campaigns\" products more than doubled year over year in the first quarter.\n\nAll these initiatives have played a key role in driving up Meta's revenue and earnings performance. In the first quarter, the company's revenue was up 27% year over year to $36 billion, while operating income soared 91% year over year to $13.8 billion.\n\nReturning value to shareholders\n\nMeta remains committed to returning a major chunk of its earnings to its shareholders. In the first quarter, the company repurchased $14.6 billion worth of shares and paid shareholders $1.3 billion in dividends.\n\nMeta ended the first quarter with $58.1 billion in cash and marketable securities, implying that the company has sufficient resources to continue aggressive investments in AI initiatives while returning capital to shareholders.\n\nDespite these positives, Meta is trading at just under 9 times sales. Although higher than its three-year average price-to-sales multiple of 6.97, it is still quite reasonable for a company expected to grow its revenue by 17.7% in fiscal 2024 and 12.7% in 2025.\n\nHence, Meta's robust AI strategy, broad scale, commitment to returning capital to shareholders, and reasonable valuation make it a compelling stock to buy now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Undervalued Social Media Stocks to Snap Up Now",
        "content": "When we think of social media influencers, we think of silly teenagers dancing on ByteDance’s TikTok. However, the industry is becoming significant, and social media is leading to a $1.2 trillion market of e-commerce that leverages attention and influence. To take advantage of this trend, it’s easy to attempt to invest in the most popular tech stocks like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) or Snap (NYSE:SNAP). However, they often have high valuations. If the thesis to invest in them doesn’t work out as expected, investors could be trapped into buying a bubble. But what about undervalued social media stocks?\n\nTo find opportunities, we must go for stocks often overlooked while having strong financials to have what Warren Buffett called a “margin of safety.” If we buy inherently cheap stocks, the stock price won’t have much room to go down even if it fails to grow as expected. Below are three social media stocks that are potentially undervalued and a way to get into the burgeoning social media market with more upside.\n\nJOYY (YY) hands holding smartphone with social media icons floating above it. brick wall background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJOYY (NASDAQ:YY) is a video-based social media platform based in Singapore. It has a significant presence in Asia and is prominent globally. Though many in the West have not heard about it, BIGO Live, its flagship product, ranks as the world’s second-largest social app based on consumer spending.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst quarter 2024 revenue declined 3.3% year-over-year (YOY) to $554.6 million, while net profits grew 34.8% to $45.3 million. Its revenue has declined due to the tough ad spend environment and competitive pressures. However, management has shown good discipline in cost-cutting. In addition, the sale of some investments combined with increased interest income contributed to management rewarding shareholders with more earnings.\n\nIts stock is down over 11% this year, while its trailing price-to-earnings ratio is down to just 5.81x as of writing, trading at a historic low.  For reference, another social media platform like Snapchat trades over a forward P/E ratio of 84.03x. With valuations so low, now is an excellent time to take a second look at this social media giant.\n\nTencent (TCEHY) Guiyang, China skyline at Jiaxiu Pavilion on the Nanming River. China Stocks\n\nSource: Sean Pavone / Shutterstock\n\nTencent Holdings (OTCMKTS:TCEHY) is a Chinese tech company that started as a social media company but expanded to everything from gaming to cloud computing to fintech. It owns WeChat, the de facto social media app in China, which acts as a super app for everything from paying bills to ordering food. WeChat has 1.2 billion active monthly users and comprises almost the entire population of China.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 2024, total revenue was roughly $22.5 billion, up 6% YOY. Meanwhile, net income was $6 billion, up 62% YOY.\n\nBecause China adopted short-form content early, social media penetration has been much stronger there than in other nations. 15% of all retail products in China are already sold exclusively through social channels, triple that of the United States. With such dominant control over social media in China, Tencent is primed to capitalize on the increased use and purchasing of social media.\n\nIts forward P/E ratio is just 15.92x, on the low side for one of the biggest social media companies in the world, but expected due to the negative sentiment surrounding China. Still, Tencent is a healthy social media business that many are overlooking.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on wall of corporate building.\n\nSource: r.classen / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE)  is a multimedia software company that helps people produce images and videos. It was founded in 1982 and currently has over 60% market share.\n\nAdobe is like the shovel to the creator economy. Creators must use its products to create content posted on social media.\n\nIn Q2 2024, Adobe’s revenue was $5.31 billion, up 10% YOY. Its net income was $1.57 billion, up over 20% YOY. Despite its good financial performance, the stock is down almost 10% year-to-date. This is due to worse-than-expected guidance from management and the lack of growth in its AI services that people expected.\n\nIt trades at a forward P/E ratio of 28.9x, which is justified due to the company’s strong growth, though still pricey. Adobe has been underperforming compared to its other tech peers, rising only 77% in the past five years. Adobe’s strong market position and financials make it a good bet on social media stocks, and the pullback in its stock price presents a better opportunity to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 A-Rated Stocks for Your June Buy List",
        "content": "There’s no bad time to buy A-rated stocks. But if you want to be richer than you are now, one of the best things you can do for yourself this June is to invest in A-rated stocks and watch the returns come in.\n\nWhen I’m talking about A-rated stocks, of course, I’m referring to the rankings assigned to all stocks by the Portfolio Grader. Stocks get “A” ratings based on their earnings performance, growth history, analyst sentiment and momentum.\n\nYou have a much better chance to make money with A-rated stocks than with those that have a poor rating, so I always use the Portfolio Grader as a tool when I’m looking at new stocks, or when its time to rebalance my portfolios.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nJune is the perfect time for this exercise. We are approaching the end of the second quarter, which is an ideal time to check on your portfolio to see how it’s performing compared to the general market.\n\nJune is also a time where many companies announce quarterly earnings and issue or reaffirm guidance for the rest of the year. That’s important information for any investor, especially for those of us looking at A-rated stocks.\n\nThe stock market continues to be strong this year, carried primarily by tech stocks.\n\nYou don’t want to lose out on the opportunities that the markets offer this June, so I encourage you to review your holdings versus the Portfolio Grader and look to optimize your holdings. If you’re looking to make a change, these seven stocks are ideal selections.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Closeup of mobile phone screen with logo lettering of nvidia corporation on computer keyboard. NVDA stock. Nvidia stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nI can’t tell you how many times over the course of the last year I led off a series of recommendations with the semiconductor maker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). But if you’re a skittish investor, you may be nervous about the recent dip this company saw.\n\nDon’t be.\n\nFollowing another great earnings report and the company’s successful 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia extended its mammoth run to a market capitalization of $3.3 trillion and was briefly the No. 1 company in the world in terms of market capitalization.\n\nBut then we saw a dip — roughly 13% over three trading sessions, and some people started saying that the NVDA bubble was finally popping.\n\nThey were wrong — NVDA is already climbing its way back up. And Nvidia hardly represents a bubble. This is a company that makes that powerful semiconductors that handle the most complex computer operations, including machine learning, generative artificial intelligence and the Internet of Things.\n\nNvidia has a massive market share in making these chips, with even better products in the workflow to be released over the next few quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat’s why analysts from Bank of America and Jefferies are still touting NVDA stock, and why you’re going to see Nvidia continue to gain new highs in 2024.\n\nNVDA stock is up 154% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome company has to make the server infrastructure that allows companies who are buying up NVDA chips to package them together and so they can run generative AI.\n\nThat’s where Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI), or Supermicro, comes in.\n\nSMCI took a hit recently as its stock price fell from nearly $1,200 to less than $800. But the stock is already rebounding, helped in no small part by Nvidia’s strength and the bullish sentiment that surrounds it.\n\nThe company is also making some key moves, such as collaborating on building a large AI data center in Japan, and it’s work into building “Direct Liquid Cooling” servers that would offer energy cost and environmental advantages over those that utilize traditional fan-based cooling systems.\n\nIf you’re kicking yourself for not buying SMCI when it was under $800, don’t fret. This company has a long path ahead of it and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it go back over $1,000 and re-challenge its previous highs.\n\nSMCI stock is up 196% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nI love a good stock split, because they instantly increase the liquidity of a stock by making shares more affordable.\n\nThe share price decreases as the total number of shares increase, so while an individual investor still has the same position in the company, the number of shares they have increase.\n\nFor example, when Nvidia had a share price of $1,200 and did its 10-for-1 split, an investor with a single share of NVDA stock suddenly had 10 shares valued at $120 each.\n\nThat brings us to Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG), which more than topped Nvidia’s trick. Chipotle just completed an amazing 50-for-1 split, bringing the share price from $3,283 to roughly $65.\n\nBut if you had a single CMG share, you now have 50 of those beauties, and you know the price is going to be climbing again.\n\nChipotle is one of the best restaurant stocks on the planet, with more than 3,400 locations dishing out its freshly made Tex-Mex fare.\n\nSecond-quarter results won’t be out until late July, but the company had a solid first quarter with revenue of $2.7 billion rising by 14.1% from a year ago. Chipotle also reported that comparable restaurant sales were up an impressive 7% and operating margins rose from 15.5% to 16.3%.\n\nCMG stock is up 45% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the owner of some of the most popular social media and advertising platforms on the planet, including Instagram, Facebook, Threads and WhatsApp.\n\nWhile many call Meta purely a social media company, it will always be an advertising powerhouse in my book — especially considering that it saw roughly 98% of its revenue come from advertising in the first quarter.\n\nMeta’s advertising is so popular because they do it right. Meta has amassed an amazing amount of data about its users, including hobbies and interests, locations and their social networks. They use that information to allow advertisers to precisely target offerings to the people who are most likely to buy a product.\n\nMeta is also making an effort in the AI world with Meta AI, a large language model that would be capable of answering queries, solving problems and performing other functions on Meta’s platforms.\n\nMeta will continue to be a workhorse for your portfolio. The stock is up 44% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) A Dell (DELL) office in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThat brings us to Dell Technologies (NYSE:DELL), which is truly a legacy technology company. The company made its name as a manufacturer of computers laptops and mobile devices, but its future is in AI as well.\n\nNvidia has a key partnership with Dell, and Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang touts that Dell’s large server business makes it easier for companies to get into AI.\n\nDell and Nvidia are working hand-in-hand to create an AI factory that would help xAI, the artificial intelligence venture fronted by Elon Musk, create an AI supercomputer to power the Grok chatbot, among other things.\n\nMusk says that Dell will assemble half the racks that are going to be used for the xAI supercomputer. Supermicro is also involved in the effort.\n\nAll this will be important for Dell stock moving forward. DELL is up 83% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust a few years ago, I think it would have been fair to have legitimate concerns about Netflix.\n\nThe company seemed to have hit a wall — subscription growth was weak, other streaming services were taking off, stripping Netflix of some of its most popular content (such as the Star Wars franchise, the Marvel franchise and hit sitcoms like Friends and The Office).\n\nBut wow, did Netflix turn things around, or what?\n\nThe biggest move that it made was ending the password-sharing practice that Netflix had long turned a blind eye to. It recognized that its platform was still desirable, and that people were willing to pay for it.\n\nSo it instituted an $8 surcharge for people who were sharing their accounts with someone outside of their platform — kids in college, former roommates and ex-romantic partners, for instance.\n\nThat left customers with the choice of paying the surcharge or allowing those external household members to get their own accounts. Both decisions are a win for Netflix.\n\nEarnings in the first quarter showed revenue of $9.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. Global streaming paid memberships hit 269.6 million, up 16% from a year ago, and net income was $2.06 million, up from $1.3 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nNetflix is still special and still growing, and it’s the premiere streaming service on the market. The stock is up 38% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nEli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) isn’t a tech stock, but its made what may be one of the most popular breakthroughs of the decade. The biotech company created a drug that’s approved by the Food and Drug Administration to help people lose weight.\n\nZepbound is an injectable drug that won FDA approval in November 2023 and is geared to the 42% of the U.S. population that are classified as obese. The drug in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is also used in another highly successful Lilly product called Mounjaro, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nWhile Lilly is now pouring billions of dollars into expanding its manufacturing facilities to produce Zepbound and Mounjaro, the company has another amazing drug around the corner.\n\nAn FDA panel voted unanimously in favor of the company’s donanemab drug, which would be used to treat Alzheimer’s. The full FDA still needs to give final approval, but that’s fully expected to happen soon.\n\nThese catalysts make LLY stock a must-own for 2024. Eli Lilly stock is up 55% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in NVDA, SCMI and LLY.

        "title": "The 3 Smartest Social Media Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "Some investors look at the latest innovations to outperform the stock market. That’s why many investors are rushing toward artificial intelligence stocks. It’s also the reason why many electric vehicle stocks boomed in 2020 and 2021 before coming back to earth in 2022.\n\nHowever, you don’t have to invest in the latest trends. Buying and holding companies that operate in growing industries can still result in plenty of returns. While social media was innovative upon its introduction, it’s easy to take it for granted. Social networks still have plenty of growth opportunities left as more users flock to their platforms.\n\nHowever, investors can also benefit from social media tools. Some software tools will generate more traction as social networks become more popular. Many companies use these social media tools to create and implement their strategies. This article will cover social media stocks to buy with the tools many business owners use to gain traction on various platforms.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a social media leader for decades. Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp have billions of users and generate significant ad revenue. Meta Platforms has put its 2022 struggles behind it as high revenue growth and soaring profit margins defined the company’s 2023.\n\nLast year’s success rubbed off on the company. Revenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter, while net income soared by 117% YOY. Meta Platforms closed out the quarter with a 33.9% net profit margin as its year of efficiency continues.\n\nAd impressions increased by 20% YOY across the company’s 3.24 daily active users. The average price per ad was up by 6% year-over-year. The company’s first quarter explains why the stock has done so well in the long run. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and have gained 161% over the past five years. The stock is rated as a Strong Buy and has a projected 3% upside from current levels.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMany businesses use social media to attract potential customers to their websites. Most companies want website visitors to become email subscribers. Then, they send messages to their audiences to build relationships and increase the likelihood of landing sales.\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) helps with the entire process. Companies use the customer relationships management tool to craft and execute their content strategies. The stock has more than tripled over the past five years and is rated as a Strong Buy. The average price target suggests a 16% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe customer relationship management firm recently reported Q1 2024 results. Revenue increased by 23% YOY, while GAAP net income came in at $5.9 million compared to a $36.6 million net loss in the same quarter last year. HubSpot generates most of its revenue from recurring subscriptions. Once customers use HubSpot, it is very difficult to leave since their email sequences, automations and other essentials are within the HubSpot dashboard. That means steady revenue for HubSpot and plenty of gains for its investors.\n\nSemrush (SEMR)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSemrush (NYSE:SEMR) is a search engine marketing tool that helps companies plan out their keyword research and create campaigns. Business owners use this tool to gather insights for their social media marketing strategies. Users can schedule social media posts, track the performance of each post and analyze competitors.\n\nThe stock is flat year-to-date but has gained 54% over the past year. A shift to profitability explains the recent stock gains. Semrush reported 21% YOY revenue growth in the first quarter. While revenue came to $85.8 million, GAAP net income was $2.1 million. Semrush anticipates 20% YOY revenue growth in the second quarter, and guidance also suggests that Semrush will maintain that growth rate for all of 2024.\n\nSemrush has approximately 112,000 paying customers and $354.2 million in annual recurring revenue. The firm is signing up customers with higher annual contract values.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Meta and Buying This Stock Instead",
        "content": "Billionaire stock transactions can be valuable data for investors. You shouldn't expect to uncover any enormous secrets that reveal infallible strategies shared universally among the ultra-wealthy. However, you can gain important insights about the factors that are influencing sophisticated investors based on the stocks that are being purchased or sold most heavily by hedge funds and billionaires.\n\nBillionaires are taking their gains on Meta\n\nThere's been a flurry of recent hedge-fund selling activity for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Numerous billionaires and high-profile funds, including Steven Cohen, Andreas Halvorsen, Lee Ainslie, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Soros, and David Tepper, have all unloaded a large volume of shares in recent months.\n\nMeta's recent first-quarter earnings report was strong but mostly in line with analyst expectations. The company achieved 27% revenue growth and more than doubled its quarterly profits over the prior year.\n\nMeta reported higher user volume, more advertisement interactions, and more revenue per advertisement. That's a comprehensive set of improvements across its various revenue-driving components. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta shares dropped steeply following the earnings report, despite the strong headline figures. The company's second-quarter outlook fell roughly 1.5% below consensus analyst expectations, and it also revised its full-year operating expense forecasts higher. Meta's sales guidance implies 18% annual growth next quarter, which marks a significant slowdown from the most recent results.\n\nIt's odd to see such a big sell-off following quarterly earnings that were overall positive or neutral. Meta did phenomenal work to stimulate growth while slashing costs in recent years. Those sorts of improvements are impossible to replicate year after year, but building incrementally on last year's improvements wasn't good enough for many investors.\n\nThis is evidence of unsustainably aggressive expectations and a \"what have you done for me lately?\" attitude from many shareholders. Meta's strong operational results and big returns have attracted a crowd of traders and short-term investors who piled in on the momentum. That's a recipe for volatility, as we saw after the last earnings report.\n\nIt's important to note that many of Meta's sellers still maintain large positions and that multiple billionaires and hedge funds have increased their Meta positions lately. Just recognize that the activity is skewed toward selling and reduced positions.\n\nThat's likely motivating many long-term investors to reassess their situations. Meta has returned 322% since the start of 2023, crushing the Nasdaq Composite's impressive 73% return over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's led to rapid inflation in the stock's important valuation ratios. Meta's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash flow ratio have roughly doubled year to date, climbing above 25. Neither is particularly expensive relative to the company's growth outlook, but the stock is no longer the glaring value buy it was last year. META PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nVolatility is up, analyst expectations are more difficult to meet, growth is slowing, the stock is more expensive, and there's less low-hanging fruit to drive operational improvements. It's not hard to see why some billionaires took this opportunity to lock in their significant gains over the past year and redeploy capital elsewhere.\n\nApple is getting more attention\n\nIt seems that billionaires and hedge funds haven't tired of the \"Magnificent Seven\" quite yet, with one of Meta's peers attracting attention. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a landing spot for some high-profile investors. Stanley Druckenmiller and Andreas Halvorsen opened large new positions, while Yan Huo, Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio, Steven Schonfield, David Shaw, and Ken Griffin added significantly to their existing stakes.\n\nApple reported a 4% decline in revenue in its most recent quarterly financial report, with noteworthy weakness in the Chinese market and a discouraging outlook for iPhone sales. However, it posted its highest all-time earnings per share (EPS) and beat Wall Street's forecasts for sales and profits.\n\nLike many of its tech peers, Apple has cut operating expenses without hampering sales performance. It's also achieving record service revenues, which are recurring and have higher profit margins than device sales. That's important for predictable cash-flow generation.\n\nUntil May, Apple's recent performance in the stock market was less impressive. Shares fell roughly 10% from the start of 2023 through April 2024. Its forward P/E ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio bottomed at approximately 25 earlier this year. AAPL P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nApple's most recent financial data wasn't particularly encouraging, compared to Meta's, but there's a clear trend in the assessments by billionaire investors. Meta's rising valuation ratios met Apple's falling ratios, then the two stocks promptly switched courses. The timing of that reversal coincides with noteworthy hedge fund transaction activity. META PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nBillionaire investors don't always get it right. However, hedge fund managers and ultra-high-net-worth people have access to resources and information that are often unavailable to the general public.\n\nTransaction data suggests that sophisticated investors were assessing valuation and outlook, leading many to sell Meta and buy Apple. Don't just follow these moves blindly -- make sure that you consider the logic behind the trends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks With the Best Earnings Per Share in 2024",
        "content": "According to Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh, earnings growth drives stock prices over the long term. This assertion is evident as growth stocks with the best earnings per share (EPS) have led the market since it bottomed out in October 2022.\n\nTypically, you find best-in-class EPS growth in innovative companies riding the coattails of a secular trend. That’s true for the growth stock picks on this list. These companies have invested heavily in their growth initiatives. Now, those efforts are bearing fruit and driving remarkable earnings growth.\n\nGiven the artificial intelligence (AI) buzz and growing capital expenditures by the hyperscalers, one major growth area has been data center AI chips. Another growth industry continues to be e-commerce. The shift from physical brick-and-mortar stores continues, driving e-commerce penetration worldwide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stocks with best EPS are profiting from the aforementioned trends. According to Finviz, they will grow their EPS by over 70% this year. Furthermore, analysts forecast over 25% earnings growth next year. These stocks aren’t done yet, so expect more upside.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has capitalized on a once-in-a-generation innovation: the emergence of artificial intelligence. Over the years, the semiconductor chip company invested in designing powerful chips that could support accelerated computing. Now, it’s reaping the rewards.\n\nNotably, the company has emerged as the undisputed leader in AI chips. Its AI chips are critical in training large language models as well as inference. Due to its technological advantage and lower total cost of ownership, its chips are in high demand. It counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as key customers.\n\nCapitalizing on demand, Nvidia revenues have soared over the past year. For instance, revenues for the fiscal year ending January 2024 grew 125%. As a result, GAAP diluted earnings per share surged an astounding 586%.\n\nAnalysts expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2025 after Q1 earnings highlighted the continued strength in demand. GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter rose 629% year-over-year (YOY), driven by Nvidia’s pricing power and operating leverage.\n\nAs long as Nvidia continues to beat expectations, it will remain one of the growth stocks with best EPS. Wall Street consensus estimates call for over 109% growth in EPS for fiscal year 2025. Demand isn’t slowing and Nvidia will continue marching higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) has been a real disruptor in the e-commerce market, taking share from incumbents. In China, it has been grabbing market share from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) by offering steep discounts and targeting lower-income consumers.\n\nSimilarly, it’s following the same playbook in developed markets. One good example is its approach in the U.S. It launched its shopping app Temu, which offers heavily discounted items. Then, it followed up with an aggressive marketing campaign with ads at the Super Bowl and across various social media sites.\n\nSince launching Temu, PDD has been in growth mode, blowing past analyst estimates. After growing revenues by 123% YOY in Q4 2023, growth accelerated to 131% YOY in Q1 2024. Even better, net income soared by 246%. These results reinforce why PDD stock is among the growth stocks with best EPS to buy today.\n\nWall Street analysts are also bullish and Goldman upgraded the stock to “buy,” raising the price target from $145 to $184. Analysts Ronald Keung and David Ma increased their 2024 to 2026 profit estimates by 25% to 43% as they see sustained revenue momentum. Even looking at valuations, PDD is one of the top growth stocks with best EPS to buy today. Finviz estimates 77% EPS growth this year, yet PDD stock trades at 12 times forward EPS.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America is another stock riding the e-commerce wave to tremendous growth. Over the past five years, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has grown revenues at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57%. More growth lies ahead given the potential for increased penetration of e-commerce in Latin American markets.\n\nMELI is among the growth stocks with best EPS based on its growth profile. Over the past three years, EBIT has grown at a 109% CAGR. The forward outlook is even more attractive. According to Finviz, the e-commerce giant has grown trailing twelve-month EPS by 82% YOY. What’s more, analysts expect EPS to increase by 77% this year and 35% in 2025.\n\nFundamentally, MercadoLibre is firing on all cylinders and can surpass these estimates. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter as total revenues increased from $3.18 billion to $4.33 billion, a 36% YOY growth rate. Key markets experienced strong growth, with Brazil and Mexico reporting 44% and 55%, respectively, after excluding reporting updates.\n\nLooking ahead, management sees secular opportunities for its e-commerce and fintech business. As more buyers shift online and customers seek simpler financial services, Latin America’s e-commerce leader will soar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple\n\nOn Monday, EU regulators found that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) violated the Digital Markets Act due to its lucrative App Store by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store. Regulators also revealed that they opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU. Apple responded that it is confident that the changes it made in the EU comply with the DMA.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Apple is defending itself against antitrust charges made by the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. In March, they sued Apple for using illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe new law designed to rein in tech giants and limit their power is already starting to give Big Tech legal headaches.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act that went into effect in March aims to limit the monopoly power that Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), ByteDance, and Meta (NASDAQ: META) enjoy by imposing more restrictive rules around competitive practices. Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly raised the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators. As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for abusing its market dominance in the distribution of music streaming apps, and is appealing the court’s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple’s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its pay or consent” model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers and will question if Meta is obtaining consent from users when intending to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:META) Recent Stock Performance Tethered To Its Strong Fundamentals?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has had a great run on the share market with its stock up by a significant 6.8% over the last month. Since the market usually pay for a company’s long-term fundamentals, we decided to study the company’s key performance indicators to see if they could be influencing the market. In this article, we decided to focus on Meta Platforms'  ROE.\n\nROE or return on equity is a useful tool to assess how effectively a company can generate returns on the investment it received from its shareholders. Simply put, it is used to assess the profitability of a company in relation to its equity capital.\n\nView our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Do You Calculate Return On Equity?\n\nReturn on equity can be calculated by using the formula:\n\nReturn on Equity = Net Profit (from continuing operations) ÷ Shareholders' Equity\n\nSo, based on the above formula, the ROE for Meta Platforms is:\n\n31% = US$46b ÷ US$150b (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThe 'return' is the amount earned after tax over the last twelve months. That means that for every $1 worth of shareholders' equity, the company generated $0.31 in profit.\n\nWhy Is ROE Important For Earnings Growth?\n\nThus far, we have learned that ROE measures how efficiently a company is generating its profits. We now need to evaluate how much profit the company reinvests or \"retains\" for future growth which then gives us an idea about the growth potential of the company. Generally speaking, other things being equal, firms with a high return on equity and profit retention, have a higher growth rate than firms that don’t share these attributes.\n\nMeta Platforms' Earnings Growth And 31% ROE\n\nFirst thing first, we like that Meta Platforms has an impressive ROE. Additionally, the company's ROE is higher compared to the industry average of 7.4% which is quite remarkable. This probably laid the groundwork for Meta Platforms' moderate 11% net income growth seen over the past five years.\n\nWe then compared Meta Platforms' net income growth with the industry and we're pleased to see that the company's growth figure is higher when compared with the industry which has a growth rate of 6.0% in the same 5-year period. past-earnings-growth\n\nEarnings growth is a huge factor in stock valuation. It’s important for an investor to know whether the market has priced in the company's expected earnings growth (or decline). Doing so will help them establish if the stock's future looks promising or ominous. What is META worth today? The  intrinsic value infographic in our free research report  helps visualize whether META is currently mispriced by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Meta Platforms Efficiently Re-investing Its Profits?\n\nMeta Platforms has a low three-year median payout ratio of 2.8%, meaning that the company retains the remaining 97% of its profits. This suggests that the management is reinvesting most of the profits to grow the business.\n\nUpon studying the latest analysts' consensus data, we found that the company's future payout ratio is expected to rise to 9.2% over the next three years. Therefore, the expected rise in the payout ratio explains why the company's ROE is expected to decline to 23% over the same period.\n\nConclusion\n\nOverall, we are quite pleased with Meta Platforms' performance. Particularly, we like that the company is reinvesting heavily into its business, and at a high rate of return. Unsurprisingly, this has led to an impressive earnings growth. We also studied the latest analyst forecasts and found that the company's earnings growth is expected be similar to its current growth rate.

        "title": "You’ve Been Warned! 3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "The top metaverse stocks to buy are a hot topic these days and with good reason. Once considered a pipe dream, a fully immersive, virtual three-dimensional world could soon become our new reality. As a result, companies involved in the development, creation and deployment of this technology are experiencing exponential growth.\n\nDespite being in its early stages, the potential of the metaverse has many touting it as the next dot-com stock. A virtual world will power social and commercial technologies, thereby redefining how we live and work. Businesses can leverage the metaverse to provide their customers with a 360-degree virtual experience while individuals will interact with one another in a three-dimensional world.\n\nGiven the promising prospects of the metaverse, companies leading the charge have attracted significant interest from investors. Early buyers in the space stand to earn massive gains as the technology scales in the coming years. Experts predict the metaverse market will be worth $5 trillion by 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nCompanies across industries are dabbling in the metaverse but the gaming sector is playing a key role in the development of these virtual platforms. The company leading this charge is Roblox (NASDAQ:RBLX), a platform for games, social hangouts and experiences designed by its users. Roblox is perhaps our first glimpse into what a fully virtual world will look like and the response has been overwhelmingly positive.\n\nSince its inception, the company has built out its metaverse by incorporating more real world tools on its platform. Last year Roblox launched a video chat capability– combining the features of Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM) and FaceTime with its gaming environment. More recently, it signed a deal with Walmart (NYSE:WMT) to sell ‘real-world’ items on the platform. In essence, every Walmart purchase comes with a virtual twin that buyers can use on their avatar.\n\nThe company’s financials reflect the success of its investments. Revenue was up 22% year-over-year (YOY) and bookings were up 19% YOY. As Roblox continues to expand its platform, this is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy for plenty of upside potential.\n\nMeta (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta’s (NASDAQ:META) new name (formerly Facebook) is a sign as clear as any other on its shifting priorities. In the last few years the company has made large investments in Reality Labs, the division that houses its metaverse initiatives. In addition to its augmented and virtual reality (AR/VR) headsets, Meta has placed a heightened focus on the role of generative AI in the metaverse. The company recently launched an open source language model- the Llama 3 and is testing an AI image generator on Whatsapp.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta’s metaverse investments show plenty of promise in the long-haul but continue to hinder short-term finances. In the last quarter, Reality Labs has generated $440 million in revenue and an operating loss of $3.85 billion. These losses are expected to grow as Meta continues to invest in these initiatives.\n\nBut looking at things through a long-term lens, the company’s metaverse investments will pay off. For one, Meta’s large user base of 3.2 billion active users across its platforms enables the company to leverage its network when testing on launching new features to improve the user experience. Moreover, advertising revenue remains strong, increasing by 27% YOY in Q1.\n\nAs Meta’s metaverse continues to expand, this is one of the top metaverse stocks to buy for long-term gains.\n\nUnity Software (U) In this photo illustration Unity Software Inc. (U stock) logo is seen on a mobile phone and a computer screen.\n\nSource: viewimage / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother company that’s making waves in the metaverse gaming sector is Unity Software (NYSE:U). The company holds a critical market position because it provides the tools required to create games. This includes sound effects, computer graphics and multiplayer features in the game. Unity provides these services through a freemium model that allows smaller developers to build games on its platform.\n\nThe dawn of metaverse has served as a boon for Unity Software offerings. The company’s tools can be used to create 2-D and 3-D content for mobile, PC and AR/VR devices. Developers can also leverage the Unity IAP and Unity Ads products to improve the revenue potential of their content. More recently, Unity announced a partnership with Walmart to integrate its Commerce API into their games. This allows creators to sell physical items in the 3D world.\n\nLooking at the financials, Unity reported earnings per share at -75 cents which was below the estimated -62 cents. However, revenue came in 6.68% above analyst expectations at $460.38 million. While the results are a mixed bag, Unity Software is ultimately worth betting on for its long-term prospects. The company projects a 2% to 4% increase in growth this year.\n\nDespite short-term headwinds, Unity’s key role in the gaming industry makes this one of the best metaverse stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "title": "Futures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures point mostly into the green on Wednesday after a rebound in tech stocks helped the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite end multi-day losing streaks in the previous session. FedEx (NYSE:FDX) shares spike in extended hours trading as the delivery group and global economic bellwether unveils an upbeat full-year financial forecast. Shares in Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) also surged, boosted by plans from Germany's Volkswagen (ETR:VOWG_p) to invest up to $5 billion in the electric truck maker.\n\n1. Futures broadly higher\n\nU.S. stock futures edged broadly higher on Wednesday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite snapped three-day losing streaks in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:27 ET (07:27 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly flat, S&P 500 futures had gained 5 points or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures had inched up by 32 points or 0.2%.\n\nStrength in artificial intelligence semiconductor group Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other big-name tech firms pulled both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite into the green on Tuesday. Shares in Nvidia climbed by 6.8%, recovering from a three-session sell-off, while the sector-wide Philadelphia Semiconductor index added 1.8%.\n\nChipmakers also gave lift to the S&P 500 Technology index, while Google-parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also rose, pushing up the communications services index.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average was the laggard, ending the trading day in the red after touching a one-month high on Monday.\n\n2. FedEx advances on upbeat outlook\n\nShares in FedEx surged by more than 13% in extended hours trading after the shipping giant revealed an upbeat outlook and unveiled plans for a $2.5 billion share buyback in its current financial year.\n\nThe Memphis-based company, whose results are considered to be a possible marker of the state of the global economy, said it now expects to deliver full-year revenue growth in the low- to mid-single digit. Analysts had called for an increase of 3%.\n\nEarnings in its 2025 fiscal period are also seen at between $20 to $22 per share, topping Wall Street's predictions of $20.92 at the midpoint.\n\nFedEx also reported a 7.2% uptick in income excluding items to $1.34 billion in its fiscal fourth quarter on revenue of $22.1 billion. CEO Raj Subramaniam called the returns \"unprecedented in this current environment,\" adding that the momentum is expected to \"continue in fiscal 2025.\"\n\nLogistics player DHL's (ETR:DHLn) stock price ticked higher in early European trading following FedEx's announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Pool shares sink\n\nPool (NASDAQ:POOL) stock fell 7% on Tuesday after the swimming pool products distributor cut its earnings and revenues expectations, citing the impact of a downturn in consumer spending on big-ticket items like home improvement projects.\n\nOne of the sector's leading names, Lousiana-based Pool flagged that construction activity may slip by 15% to 20% this year. Sales year-to-date have also decreased by around 6.5% versus the comparable period in 2023, the company noted.\n\nThe firm warned that recent data suggests \"persistently weak demand for new pool construction\" following the end of the typical swimming pool high-season from late May to early June.\n\nPool's decline on Tuesday pulled down peers like pool supplies firms Hayward Holdings (NYSE:HAYW) and Leslie's (NASDAQ:LESL), as well as pool manufacturer Latham Group (NASDAQ:SWIM).\n\n4. Rivian shares soar as VW plans $5 billion investment\n\nShares in Rivian leapt in extended hours trading after Germany's Volkswagen announced a major investment plan in the American high-end electric truck group.\n\nThe partnership, which could see VW provide Rivian with as much as $5 billion in capital, aims to form a 50/50 joint venture for sharing knowledge on electric vehicle architecture and software. If the tie-up is completed, Volkswagen will gain \"immediate access\" to Rivian's current EV technology.\n\nA final decision on the establishment of the joint venture is still pending.\n\nThe move comes as VW looks to bolster its EV offerings during a time of intensifying competition from rivals in China and U.S. giant Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\n5. Crude inches up\n\nCrude prices rose Wednesday, despite a surprise jump in U.S. stockpiles, as traders weighed geopolitical risks and confidence surrounding the summer driving season.\n\nBy 03:26 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.6% higher at $81.28 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.5% to $84.62 a barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories grew by around 0.9 million barrels in the week to June 21.\n\nThis was something of a surprise given expectations for a draw of 3 million barrels, but is largely being overlooked as investors anticipate inventory drawdowns during the peak third quarter demand season. The official numbers from the Energy Information Administration are due later in the session.\n\nBoth contracts are still sitting on strong gains over the past two weeks, as persistent geopolitical tensions – Israeli strikes on Gaza and Ukrainian attacks on Russian refineries -- resulted in traders pricing a risk premium into oil prices.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures mostly higher, FedEx's rosy outlook, Rivian surges - what's moving markets\n\nVolkswagen's $5 billion investment in Rivian boosts EV maker's shares\n\nBarclays: FOMO fever leaves positioning full, vulnerable to Tech faltering\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy That Are Up 100% Over the Past 52 Weeks",
        "content": "Morningstar.com recently discussed how GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) stock has skyrocketed over the past 12 months, gaining 86%, with more than half the gains in 2024. Apparently momentum plays like GE have become the stocks to buy entering the second half of the year.\n\nIt’s hard to believe that GE’s become a momentum stock after lying dormant for so many years. Kudos to CEO Larry Culp for the job he’s done delivering value for long-suffering shareholders.\n\nGE isn’t the only stock that skyrocketed over the past year. According to Finviz.com, there are 67 U.S.-listed stocks (market cap of $2 billion or higher) that have achieved a 100% retunrn or more over the past 52 weeks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe stock with the largest market capitalization that doubled its money over the past year is NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), the AI superstar. The stock with the smallest market cap to do so is Amneal Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:AMRX), a producer of more than 280 generic and specialty pharmaceuticals.\n\nHere are three more to add to your list of stocks to buy.\n\nModine Manufacturing (MOD) The front of a Modine Manufacturing (MOD) facility with the company name and logo present.\n\nSource: Tony Savino / Shutterstock.com\n\nModine Manufacturing (NYSE:MOD) has a $4.92 billion market cap as I write this with a 201% gain over the past 52 weeks.\n\nMost investors would never think it’s possible for a company that’s over a hundred years old to be able to triple its market cap in a single year, but that’s precisely what Modine has done since last June.\n\nFounded in 1916 by Arthur B. Modine, the company started by manufacturing thermal solutions for the emerging automobile industry. Since then it’s taken its business global, providing thermal solutions in many different markets including HVAC, data centers, and automotive.\n\nIn May, it reported its Q4 2024 and full-year results. In 2024, its sales increased 5% to $2.4 billion, while its adjusted EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization) jumped 48% to $314 million, a healthy EBITDA margin of 13.1%.\n\nIt has two operating segments: Climate Solutions (43% of sales) and Performance Technologies (57%).\n\nIn 2025, it expects sales to grow by 7.5% at the midpoint of its guidance with an adjusted EBITDA of $375 million, nearly 20% higher than in 2024.\n\nIn November 2023, I recommended investors consider buying MOD stock because it was growing its free cash flow by focusing on higher-margin markets. So far, it’s working like a charm.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Image of Arista Networks (ANET) logo on the side of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) has a $105.72 billion market cap with a 124% gain over the past 52 weeks. Since it went public in June 2014 at $43, its stock has appreciated by 3,038%, which includes a four-for-one stock split in November 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cloud networking stock has done well in 2024 due to the emergence of AI. Its networking products help AI leaders such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) — the two companies account for approximately 39% of its overall revenue — carry out AI workloads requiring efficient data-throughput for its GPU networks.\n\nIts Q1 2024 revenue increased 16.3% year-over-year to $1.57 billion. Sequentially, its sales grew 2.0% from Q4 2023. Meanwhile, its non-GAAP net income jumped 40.9% to $637.7 million. Its earnings per share rose at a slightly slower rate of 39.2% due to more shares outstanding.\n\nOf the 27 analysts covering ANET stock, 18 rate it a Buy, with a $327.50 target price, below where it’s currently trading.\n\nThe company’s steady-as-she-goes performance should continue to deliver solid long-term returns for its shareholders. If you are looking for the top stocks to buy, start here.\n\nSterling Infrastructure (STRL) Picture of a highway system with business statistics on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.\n\nSource: ekapol sirachainan / Shutterstock\n\nSterling Infrastructure (NYSE:STRL) has a $3.59 billion market cap with a 123% gain over the past 52 weeks.\n\nIn the same November 2023 article recommendeding Modine, I also recommended Sterling Infrastructure. My rationale was simple: It continues to benefit from rebuilding America’s infrastructure.\n\nIt finished the first quarter with a $2.35 billion backlog. Due to the strong start to 2024, it now expects revenues to grow by 12% year over year, net income to increase by 23%, and a 16% increase in EBITDA.\n\nMost importantly, its cash flow has grown considerably, from $25 million in 2017, to $479 million in 2023, a compound annual growth rate of 64%. Based on 2023 free cash flow of $428 million and an enterprise value of $3.50 billion, it has a free cash flow yield of 12.2%. Anything above 8% is value territory.\n\nInvestors can expect its free cash flow to continue to grow given its focus on strategic acquisitions.\n\n“We continue to believe that the best use of our cash is strategic acquisitions that expand our suite of services, enhance our competitive position, or expand our geographic reach,” stated its 2023 annual report.\n\n“We remain very active in the pursuit of potential targets, with particular focus in E-Infrastructure Solutions and Building Solutions.”\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nEuropean regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge Tuesday, one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple (AAPL) with violating European Union competition law.\n\nThe European Commission (EC), the EU’s antitrust authority, said it informed Microsoft of its view that the tech giant had been illegally bundling — or \"tying\" — its Teams software to other proprietary business software, including Office 365 and Microsoft 365. Microsoft offices in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, France. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nTying the software applications together, according to the EC, violates the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits abuse of dominant market positions.\n\nFines for violations can run up to 10% of a company’s worldwide annual revenue. For Microsoft, global revenue in 2023 totaled $212 billion.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said the company has already untethered Teams from some of its other software products.\n\n\"We appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the commission‘s remaining concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe EC on Monday took a similar step against Apple, informing the iPhone maker that the rules for its lucrative App Store violated a different antitrust law — the EU’s recently enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA) — by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the store.\n\nApple defended its practices, saying, \"We are confident our plan complies with the law.\"\n\nThe actions this week are the latest examples of how the EU is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data and social media content, as well as the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers, and it readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US. European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. (REUTERS/Johanna Geron) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, even though that industrial union had received approval in the US.\n\nIn 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions.\n\nIn more recent years, the EU’s attempt to rein in tech giants has become a core focus. The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations on companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft, and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\nThe charges announced this week against Microsoft and Apple are detailed in separate legal filings, or statements of objection, that detail the EC’s investigative evidence and justifications for its claims. An Apple store in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn its statement outlining the charges against Microsoft, the EC said the tech giant’s practices may have granted Teams a distribution advantage because customers had no choice about whether to acquire access to Teams when subscribing to the company’s software productivity applications.\n\nThe commission went on to say that Microsoft imposed interoperability limitations on competing software with Teams, and that those limitations may have prevented competition, stifled innovation, and disadvantaged consumers.\n\nComplaints over Microsoft’s software bundles originated back in 2020 when Salesforce-owned Slack, a business software competitor, claimed the company was abusing its market power.\n\nThe EC’s investigations into the matter led Microsoft in October 2023 to untether Teams from some of its other software products. In April, it applied the change globally.\n\nMicrosoft will now have an opportunity to present its own evidence in response to the objections before the EC issues a final decision on whether or not the bloc’s antitrust laws were breached.\n\nThe EC’s final determinations are handled through administrative proceedings without a trial. However, appeals from the Commission’s final determination can be made to the European Court of Justice.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Meta Platforms META, Hugging Face, and Scaleway recently announced the launch of an AI Accelerator Program targeted at European startups. This initiative aims to bolster economic and technological advancements through the integration of cutting-edge AI models into startup ecosystems across the European Union.\r\n\r\nBased at STATION F in Paris, the AI Startup Program, which will run from September 2024 to February 2025, is designed to support five promising startups from the MVP or product stage.  This initiative follows the success of the first edition of the accelerator announced in November 2023, which supported innovative projects like Pollen Robotics, Fringuant and Qevlar AI.\r\n\r\nThe program offers extensive resources and mentoring from Meta’s Fundamental Artificial Intelligence Research (FAIR) team, Hugging Face’s platform and Scaleway’s AI infrastructure. The selection process will involve a panel of experts from Meta, Hugging Face and Scaleway, who will evaluate projects based on their use of open foundation models and integration plans.\r\n\r\nSelected startups will gain access to invaluable resources, including technical mentoring, computational power, and tools essential for developing services based on open-source AI technology.\n\nMeta’s New AI Research Models\n\nAlongside the accelerator announcement, Meta’s FAIR team has unveiled a series of new AI research models aimed at advancing the field through open collaboration. These models include innovations in image-to-text and text-to-music generation, multi-token prediction for faster word processing in large language models (LLMs) and tools for detecting AI-generated speech.\r\n\r\nThe latest releases include Chameleon Models, Multi-Token Prediction, JASCO and AudioSeal.\r\n\r\nChameleon Models are capable of processing and generating both text and images simultaneously. These models offer new possibilities in creative content generation.\r\n\r\nThe Multi-Token Prediction approach enhances the efficiency of LLMs by predicting multiple future words at once, reducing the text needed for training.\r\n\r\nJASCO is a text-to-music generation model that accepts various inputs like chords or beats, providing more control over the generated music outputs.\r\n\r\nAudioSeal is an audio watermarking technique for detecting AI-generated speech segments within audio snippets, designed for large-scale and real-time applications.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms also released tools to evaluate and enhance geographical and cultural diversity in AI-generated images, aiming to ensure more inclusive and representative outputs.\n\nStory continues\n\nHarnessing AI Capabilities to Aid META’s Prospects\n\nMETA shares have returned 41.2% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s gain of 24.4%. It has been benefiting from an innovative portfolio, which includes Threads, Reels, Llama 2, Ray-Ban Meta smart glass, and mixed reality device Quest 3.\n\nMETA Year-to-Date Performance Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nMeta is heavily investing in AI to enhance user experience. It has upgraded its Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. AI-recommended content now comprises more than 50% of the content people see on Instagram.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, this advanced recommendation technology will be extended across Facebook’s video ecosystem, aiming to offer the world’s best recommendation technology by 2026.\r\n\r\nMeta is advancing its generative AI capabilities with Meta Llama, providing users with more interactive and personalized experiences.\r\n\r\nIt now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern for its top-line growth.\r\n\r\nMETA expects total revenues between $36.5 billion and $39 billion for the second quarter of 2024, assuming an unfavorable forex impact of 1% to year-over-year revenue growth.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $38.15 billion, indicating 19.22% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $4.66 per share, suggesting 44.27% year-over-year growth.\n\nZacks Rank & Stocks to Consider\n\nMeta currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\r\n\r\nNVIDIA NVDA, Dropbox DBX and Datadog DDOG are some better-ranked stocks in the broader Zacks Computer & Technology, each sporting a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have gained 138.5% year to date, while shares of Dropbox and Datadog have lost 26.1% and 2.4%, respectively.\r\n\r\nThe long-term earnings growth rate for NVIDIA, Dropbox and Datadog are currently pegged at 37.57%, 11.44% and 9.56%, respectively.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally — why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme — not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) the Best Technology Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs mega-cap technology stocks continue to soar to new highs, the number of Wall Street analysts highlighting the “concentration of gains” problem are increasing. It’s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that “Big Tech” has  “largely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.” Krishna said that Q1 results showed the “ongoing dominance” of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\n“This makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,” Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen’s New AI Fund\n\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet “on and against” companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez. The fund’s expected launch date is later this year or early 2025.\n\nBillionaire Cohen is already ramping up his bets on AI. To see his AI investments this year, click 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nSince Krishna of Barclays talked about the rise of big tech funds and their concentration into AI, in this article we will take a look at the major AI stocks that form the portfolios of these funds and discuss their growth catalysts and long-term outlook. For that we first listed down all holdings of major tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and iShares Global Tech ETF and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds.

(NASDAQ:META) AI Stock?\n\n1000 Words / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top mega-cap tech stocks Big Tech funds are concentrating into.\n\nWhy is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Alphabet, Meta, and Nvidia: 3 Tech Stocks Beloved by Billionaires",
        "content": "It's hard to get broad agreement on much these days, as I'm sure we all see heading into election season. But one area of agreement, at least among billionaire hedge fund managers, is that investing in big tech stocks like Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is wise. It's been lucrative lately, with Nvidia leading the way, as shown below. META Chart\n\nOf the 16 hedge funds analyzed by The Motley Fool, at least 10 have the three stocks named above among their top 10 tech holdings (as of the fourth quarter of 2023). Top Tech Tech stocks owned by billionaires\n\nHere are some reasons, so you can determine if they should also be in your portfolio.\n\nAlphabet\n\nBy diving into its financial results, it's easy to see why Alphabet is a favorite of hedge funds. In 2023, the company produced $307 billion in revenue and $84 billion in operating income. It followed this up with $81 billion in revenue and $25 billion in operating income in the first quarter, year-over-year gains of 15% and 46%, respectively. The 32% operating margin in the first quarter is particularly impressive. But perhaps the best quality is its ability to generate cash flow.\n\nAlphabet produced $102 billion in cash from operations (CFO) in 2023 and $29 billion in the first quarter of 2024, putting it on pace to smash the 2023 figure. Cash from operations is an important metric because it shows how a company's primary business performs and how much of the profit converts to cash. Since CFO is even higher than operating income, it confirms that Alphabet's earnings are high quality.\n\nIt's been decades since there was any true challenge to Google Search's dominance. However, the release of ChatGPT and Microsoft's investment in bringing it to Bing were wake-up calls. Since then, Alphabet has answered with artificial intelligence (AI) tools of its own. The company has developed them for years, but they are finally coming to the market.\n\nGemini is its most advanced generative-AI chatbot yet, able to answer complex queries, assist with coding, and much more. For instance, if you want to update your resume, you can list your experience and qualifications and Gemini will produce a sample resume almost instantly.\n\nAlphabet's current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is 27, close to its five-year average. With its tremendous cash flow and continued growth, the stock is an excellent long-term investment.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta, formerly Facebook, is making a big push to lead the AI arms race. Meta AI is a large language model (LLM) virtual assistant capable of answering complicated queries, solving complex problems, and other functions. It is Meta's answer to ChatGPT and is available on platforms like Facebook, Messenger, Instagram, and WhatsApp.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt its heart, Meta is an advertising company; 98% of first-quarter revenue was from advertising. The more users and more time spent on its apps, the more revenue it will make. Meta AI could keep users from leaving the app for rivals, like ChatGPT or Google when looking for chatbot-type services.\n\nMeta's total revenue hit $36.5 billion in the first quarter with impressive 27% year-over-year growth. Operating income leaped from $7.2 billion to $13.8 billion.\n\nTiger Global Management appears to be Meta's biggest fan, as 19% of its tech portfolio is dedicated to its stock. Meta's current P/E ratio is slightly higher than its five-year average; however, the average is skewed to the downside by the stock's huge decline in 2022, as shown below. META PE Ratio Chart\n\nThis means the stock is likely close to its fair value. Meta also introduced its first-ever dividend this year. The yield is small now, at less than 1%, but given the company's profitability, it could rise significantly over time. Meta's recent results are terrific, making it easy to see why it is a billionaire favorite.\n\nNvidia\n\nNvidia's rise to become the most valuable company on the planet is incredible, and it was built on our endless appetite for data. Nvidia's graphic processing units (GPUs) and software are crucial components for data centers and are even more in demand due to the rise of AI.\n\nCloud software, data processing and storage, streaming services, and banking all rely on data centers to function. So-called hyperscaler data centers (many over 100,000 square feet) are expected to increase by over 100 annually for the next decade, according to one source, providing Nvidia with a long runway still.\n\nNvidia didn't disappoint in the first quarter, posting a 262% year-over-year increase in total revenue to $26 billion. Its data center sales exploded again to $23 billion, a 427% year-over-year increase. The 10-for-1 stock split also excited investors, although stock splits have no direct effect on the company's or shareholders' value.\n\nOf the 16 billionaire portfolios studied, Nvidia is in the top-10 tech holdings of 10, with several having it in the top three. However, new investors in Nvidia should consider the valuation before jumping in with both feet.\n\nIts current P/E is more than 70. This drops to 47 on a forward basis but still dwarfs Microsoft's (NASDAQ: MSFT) own lofty valuation.\n\nNvidia will have a long, prosperous future, but consider dollar-cost averaging or waiting for a dip to accumulate shares now.\n\nMost billionaires didn't get wealthy by accident. These hedge funds study data, hire industry experts, and make shrewd stock buys. While investors should not blindly follow their lead, examining their top picks is a terrific place to get ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Stocks to Profit From the Trillion-Dollar Creator Economy",
        "content": "The creator economy is an ecosystem surrounding content creators on platforms like YouTube and TikTok, who monetize their content through sponsorships, affiliate marketing, subscription models, merchandise sales and more. It’s a burgeoning new industry caused by the rapid rise in digital media consumption and the various monetization methods made possible in recent years. In fact, over 50% of the Generation Z surveyed said they want to be content creators; it’s a job that has been ridiculed in the past but is now worth $250 billion dollars and is estimated to be worth half a trillion dollars in just five years.\n\nThat is due to a few industry trends. First, AI (artificial intelligence) makes content creation more accessible than ever, eliminating the technical barrier many face. Second, the rapid rise of short-form content, such as TikTok, has increased the amount of time people spend on digital media and led to more opportunities for sponsorships.\n\nWith the creator economy such a large and fast-growing industry, below are three creator economy stocks to take advantage of its growth and other trends.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock is currently over $180 a share and has seen a 29% increase year-to-date due to the recovery of advertising revenue and the introduction of dividends.\n\nGoogle has owned YouTube since 2006, one of its most valuable brands. In terms of profits, it will grow even faster as the larger creator economy propels it.\n\nFor one, it’s capitalizing on the growth of short-form content. YouTube Shorts, YouTube’s equivalent of ByteDance’s popular TikTok, has grown over 135% year-over-year. YouTube is also implementing AI to help creators create videos more easily since it has historically been a barrier to entry. Finally, YouTube has continuously developed its AI algorithm such that 70% of all views are now driven by recommendations, giving the platform more control over its viewership and making it more predictable.\n\nWith TikTok potentially banned from the U.S. and the difficulty of acquiring the company, YouTube’s burgeoning Shorts could fill in and drive millions more to its platform.\n\nWith rapid growth in short-form content and its leveraging of AI, Alphabet is a good bet on the creator economy.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is an iconic social media company owning Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger. Its stock has risen over 40% this year due to successful cost-cutting, recovery in advertising revenue, the introduction of dividends for the first time and hype over AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the United States, it has a whopping 73% market share through Facebook and Instagram and has continued to maintain market share, making it a vital benefactor of the creator economy.\n\nWe’ve all heard the hype about the “metaverse” and its virtual reality headsets, but arguably, what’s even more critical to the company is how much AI can benefit its most significant business segment, which makes up 97% of its revenue — on the surface, better AI recommendations and driving increased engagement. For advertisers, AI is helping to optimize their marketing campaigns and make better ads that will see more engagement.\n\nNot to mention, Instagram reels, the equivalent of ByteDance’s TikTok, are increasing and helping creators drive more engagement. Despite launching in 2022, Instagram has over 30% of the market share. With TikTok’s potential demise, Meta can quickly snatch market share in short-form content.\n\nWith such a grab on existing social media platforms and AI making its business more profitable, Meta is a sure pick to invest in the creator economy.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) is a computer software company specializing in multimedia creation. It is a long-established company with over 60% of the market share. Despite beating earnings and revenue estimates, its stock price is down over 9% this year. However, it provided weaker-than-expected guidance.\n\nThat was mainly due to competition in AI for creating multimedia designs. Even though Adobe has its own AI creator, Firefly, competitors in this market are fierce. It’s also worth noting that in the future of AI, creators no longer need to spend tedious hours on Adobe software creating graphic designs or editing videos since AI can do all of those tasks for a human. Therefore, Adobe must be able to make the switch.\n\nHowever, many forget Adobe has superior data for training its AI models. Adobe has incorporated AI in its software and has user data, gaining knowledge on how designers can best use AI. In addition, the AI is trained on thousands of Adobe Stock images, avoiding the copyright infringements that other AI image generators have.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Growth stocks to buy on the dip have the potential to significantly outperform the stock market. Some of these assets can accumulate generational returns and get passed down to your heirs. However, these same stocks often experience declines on the way to new highs. Stock dips are common, and it’s important not to panic.\n\nAccording to the Fear & Greed Index, panic may be setting in. The latest reading of 41 suggests that fear is partially driving the stock market, but not to a strong degree. When you invest in any asset, including stocks, you sign up for dips. These dips offer buying opportunities since they let you buy your favorite companies at discounts.\n\nKnowing which growth stocks to buy on the dip will leave you better prepared. Investor should narrow their search to companies that exhibit high revenue growth and rising profit margins. These are some of the growth stocks to buy on the dip to consider for long-term growth investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) has been a juggernaut in the cybersecurity industry. The firm continues to grow while its competitors cite headwinds as reasons for slower revenue growth. Crowdstrike reported 33% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25 and closed out the quarter with $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue.\n\nCybersecurity will remain an essential service for many years. Businesses put a lot of their information online, and they also store customers’ information in their databases. Hackers try to get into these databases and access a company’s private files. Furthermore, the cyber criminals are using artificial intelligence to scale their attacks. This use of AI demonstrates how innovative technology can become dangerous if it falls into the wrong hands. Luckily, Crowdstrike is also upping its defenses with the help of artificial intelligence.\n\nCybersecurity is becoming a battle of AI vs. AI, and it’s been beneficial for long-term investors. Crowdstrike stock has gained 54% year-to-date and is up by 427% over the past five years.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been crushing the stock market for many years as businesses rush to run advertisements and rank higher on the company’s search engines. The stock has gained 29% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. A 28 P/E ratio and a strengthened focus on profit margins makes the stock attractive at current levels.\n\nWall Street analysts seem to agree with that assertion. Alphabet is rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 10% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $225 per share suggests that Alphabet can gain an additional 25%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost of the company’s revenue comes from advertisements, but more than 10% of its revenue comes from cloud computing. Alphabet can continue to diversify its revenue with artificial intelligence and other initiatives. Overall revenue increased by 15% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income surged by 57% year-over-year. Alphabet wrapped up the first quarter with a 29.4% net profit margin.\n\nChipotle (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipotle (NYSE:CMG) has been on a tear. Shares are up by 43% year-to-date amid a stock split and have gained 342% over the past five years. Higher prices haven’t stopped Chipotle’s customers from regularly buying food at its venues. Revenue increased by 14.1% year-over-year in Q1 2024 while net income was up by 23.2% year-over-year.\n\nChipotle should continue to grow its revenue and net income based on its recent expansion. The restaurant chain opened up 47 new restaurants with 43 of them including a mobile pickup drive-thru window. The company remains on pace to open 285-315 restaurants this year. Comparable sales growth of 7% year-over-year indicates that many of its restaurants continue to generate traction, so growth isn’t entirely reliant on the company opening up new locations.\n\nThe stock is currently rated as a “Moderate Buy” among 27 analysts with a projected 3% upside. The highest pre-split price target of $3,888 suggests a potential 21% gain from current levels.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) also has a lot of analysts behind it. The stock is rated as a “Strong Buy” and has a projected 6% upside. The highest price target of $593 per share suggests that Facebook’s parent company can gain an additional 20%. The stock is up by 43% year-to-date and has gained 159% over the past five years. Meta Platforms trades at a 28.5 P/E ratio and is valued at $1.26 trillion.\n\nThe social media firm recently offered a dividend. Investors currently get a 0.40% yield, but shareholders should expect the company to maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years. Profit margins are north of 30% as the company continues to refine its business model with a focus on efficiency.\n\nNet income more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 2024 while revenue still marched forward to the tune of a 27% year-to-date gain. Meta Platforms also has a healthy balance sheet which features $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.\n\nHubSpot (HUBS) Hubspot (HUBS) logo displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nHubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) has been generating more buzz amid acquisition rumors. Alphabet has been rumored to be making an offer for several months, but now there’s competition. An unnamed company appears to be in the mix for acquiring the $30 billion customer relationship management software firm.\n\nAlthough this speculation is helping the stock price, HubSpot hasn’t needed the rumor mill to generate returns for investors. The stock is up by 6% year-to-date and has more than tripled over the past five years. Many businesses use HubSpot to communicate with their customers more effectively and increase their conversions. HubSpot has many monthly and annual subscriptions available which results in steady recurring revenue.\n\nHubSpot continues to report strong financials amid its recurring revenue model. Total revenue increased by 23% year-over-year in the first quarter to reach $617.4 million. GAAP net income came in at $5.9 million compared to a net loss of $36.6 million in the same quarter last year. Rising revenue and profit margins create a good opportunity even if an acquisition doesn’t pan out. However, an acquisition can result in a surging stock price and one last hurrah for investors before a big tech firm adds the company to its product mix.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) has more than one million customers in various industries. The firm provides business supplies, safety equipment and other resources for businesses. Cintas generates steady revenue from its customers since many businesses need supplies and safety equipment in order to function properly. A lack of safety equipment can bring production to a halt and make them non-compliant.\n\nCintas has been outperforming the stock market for several years. Shares are up by 20% year-to-date and have more than tripled over the past five years. The $72 billion firm trades at a 49 P/E ratio and offers a 0.76% yield. Cintas has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years and has raised its dividend for more than 40 consecutive years.\n\nA high dividend isn’t the only positive attribute for this stock. Cintas reported solid financials, including 9.9% year-over-year revenue growth in Q3 FY24. Net income jumped by 22.0% year-over-year to reach $397.6 million.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is on of the stocks to buy on the dip that have been outperforming the stock market. Shares are up by 21% year-to-date and have soared by 370% over the past five years. The corporation has a $93 billion market cap and trades at a 66 P/E ratio.\n\nSynopsys has been in business for more than 35 years and generates over $5 billion in annual revenue. The company’s chips are used in self-driving cars, machine learning devices, 5G technology, and other devices. Synopsys also generates revenue from its software which results in healthy profit margins.\n\nThe firm reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth in Q2 FY24 which was at the high-end of guidance. Net income increased by 7% year-over-year.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. rejected overtures by Meta Platforms Inc. to integrate the social networking company’s AI chatbot into the iPhone months ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Jain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show ‘Hot Ones’ Nvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can’t Keep Up Tech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\n\nThe two companies aren’t in discussions about using Meta’s Llama chatbot in an AI partnership and only held brief talks in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The dialogue about a partnership didn’t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\n\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\n\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn’t see that company’s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta’s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\n\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple’s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\n\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology — called Apple Intelligence — includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\n\nBut Apple’s chatbot technology isn’t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing for searches.\n\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company’s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn’t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\n\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) legal headaches mounted Monday with the news that European Union regulators found it violated a new law designed to rein in tech giants.\n\nThe EU’s European Commission said it informed Apple that the rules of Apple's lucrative App Store violated the Digital Markets Act by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\n\nThe regulator also announced it had opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny overseas comes as Apple defends itself in the US against antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold onto a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit; it has yet to comment on the new EU actions.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple’s stock up more than 1%.\n\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" — Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) — and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\n\nThe law’s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\n\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\n\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\n\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAnd that’s what regulators said Apple did. The logo of Apple is illuminated at a store in Munich, Germany, in 2020. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\n\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company’s global annual revenue. In Apple’s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\n\nApple doesn’t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category that includes the store’s revenue reached $85 billion that same year.\n\nThe EC’s announcement significantly broadened financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple’s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 Euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify, targeted Apple’s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\n\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst.Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said in a fresh note that major tech giants are now running in a “race” to capture the $4 trillion AI market, calling GPUs the new “oil” or “gold” in the technology sector. Ives said that the AI “party” is just getting started and the clock is showing “9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.” Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the “only game in town.” Ives thinks the “first wave” of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth “derivatives” beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\n\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\n“The tech bull market is just starting,” Ives reportedly said.\n\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).

UBS recently named the accelerator as Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) strength in the AI Enabling layer, while Llama and advertising are social media giant’s moat points in the Intelligence and Application layers in the AI value chain.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“We believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had “made…META substantially larger” during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency,” a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META’s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\n\nAlthough these multiples are now back to “normal” levels, they are hardly expensive for a company whose top line growth re-accelerated into the double digits, with operating leverage and despite ongoing heavy investments in the Reality Labs segment. These are the reasons why we continue to hold a large position in META. As for why we did some selling, we want to emphasize a few key points:…” (Click here to read the full text)\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst.

        "title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\n\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\n\nAlphabet's future position in AI\n\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\n\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\n\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\n\nFundamental and competitive analysis\n\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\n\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\n\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\n\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\n\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\n\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\n\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\n\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\n\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\n\nConclusion\n\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Undervalued Stocks on the Cusp of a Triple-Digit Recovery",
        "content": "The market rally so far has been what anyone would have expected just a year back. I wouldn’t be surprised if it drags on and, the S&P 500 crosses 6,000 points, and the Nasdaq goes above 20,000 by the end of the year. However, as everyone knows, most of these gains have been due to a select few companies at the top that are reaching euphoric levels while overshadowing commonly undervalued stocks.\n\nFor example, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the world’s largest company by market cap for a moment. It has come down again, but I think it could regain the crown again if the rally continues.\n\nOn the other hand, many undervalued stocks have been given the bad end of the stick by Wall Street. They’ve been languishing at bargain-basement levels, and investors have ditched them to put their money where the action is. I think that makes it the best time to go bargain hunting. Many of these companies are household names with solid profitability and should bounce back once the market cycle takes a turn again. Their downside risk is also pretty low. You’d definitely want a pie of at least some of these undervalued stocks if you wish to hold for the next couple of years:\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) is a leading digital payment platform that enables online money transfers and purchases. The fintech sector has been battered in recent years, but I believe PayPal is poised for a major breakout. In Q1 2024, the company delivered solid 10% currency-neutral revenue growth on $404 billion in total payment volume, with transaction margin dollars growing 4% better than expected. Non-GAAP EPS surged an impressive 27% year-over-year.\n\nDespite maintaining 8%+ annual revenue growth and low double-digit EPS growth set to accelerate to around 20% in coming years, PayPal trades at a ridiculously cheap 51% discount to its February 2020 peak. The stock is trading at a fraction of its historical earnings and sales premium. Undervalued stocks: PYPL revenue EPS chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nWhile user growth remains a Wall Street concern, it has turned positive on a quarterly basis. Meanwhile, PayPal has evolved into a cash cow, executing $5 billion in buybacks last year with plans for another $5 billion in 2024. It is one of the most undervalued stocks right now, and I think most analysts would agree with me.\n\nSnapchat (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) operates the Snapchat social media platform. The company’s Q1 results show promising signs that this beaten-down stock could be on the cusp of a major recovery. I was pounding the table on social media stocks like Meta (NASDAQ:META) back when it was trading below $100 less than two years ago. It now trades at $500-plus as of writing. I believe Snap could follow a similar trajectory, especially if a TikTok ban occurs in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnap’s revenue growth accelerated to an impressive 21% YOY, a significant improvement from the prior quarter’s 5% growth rate. The company also reached 422 million daily active users, up 10% from a year ago, as it continues to deepen engagement. Importantly, Snap has a huge advantage with the coveted Gen-Z demographic, reaching over 75% of 13 to 34-year-olds in more than 25 countries. EBIT is also expected to rise significantly from these tailwinds. Snapchat EBIT chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nIf TikTok does shut down, I expect Snapchat to be a prime beneficiary as young users flock to familiar alternatives. While Snap’s ARPU has been lackluster, I anticipate this key metric will inflect higher going forward as ad demand improves and the company refines its advertising platform. With strong operating leverage, even modest ARPU gains could drive explosive profit growth.\n\nThe pieces are in place for Snap to potentially deliver a triple-digit return for investors willing to ride out the near-term volatility.\n\nSix Flags Entertainment (SIX) Customers riding a rollercoaster at a Six Flags park in Maryland.\n\nSource: Cvandyke / Shutterstock\n\nSix Flags Entertainment (NYSE:SIX) operates regional theme parks across North America. I believe this stock is significantly undervalued and poised for a major recovery in the coming years. Like many travel and leisure companies, Six Flags was forced to take on substantial debt to survive the pandemic, which has weighed heavily on its earnings due to the high 6.57% annualized interest rate.\n\nHowever, several key indicators give me confidence that Six Flags is on the cusp of a resurgence. Pass sales remain strong, with both units and average pass prices showing solid double-digit increases over last year. Group sales are also outperforming expectations, surpassing last year’s numbers by over 20% and approaching pre-pandemic levels. Additionally, in-park spending continues to grow, with a 5% increase in spending per capita.\n\nAs interest rates eventually come down, I expect Six Flags’ earnings potential to be unleashed. The company’s focus on premiumization and reinventing the customer journey through digital transformation should drive profitable growth. With the stock remaining depressed, I believe now is an opportune time to invest before the market recognizes Six Flags’ cash cow potential. I wouldn’t be surprised to see EPS comfortably double within the next three to four years.\n\nDollar General (DG) Dollar General (DG) store front with yellow store sign, midday\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDollar General (NYSE:DG) operates a chain of discount retail stores across the United States. Despite delivering solid Q1 results that beat expectations on both the top and bottom lines, DG stock has been unable to stage a sustained recovery amid the broader retail sector’s ongoing struggles. I believe the biggest culprit holding back DG shares is the persistently high interest rate environment, which continues to weigh on consumer spending and sentiment.\n\nHowever, when I look at Dollar General’s long-term positioning, I see a company that is poised to benefit from some of the most powerful megatrends reshaping the retail landscape. Dollar General is uniquely positioned to capitalize on the growing demand for affordable shopping, especially in rural areas.\n\nFurthermore, as consumers increasingly prioritize value in economic uncertainty, I believe Dollar General’s business model will prove more resilient than many of its peers. I think now is an excellent time for patient investors to scoop up DG shares before the inevitable recovery takes hold. Profitable, well-established household names like Dollar General rarely disappoint in the long run.

Carnival Cruise Line is an international cruise line.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nCarnival (NYSE:CCL) operates the world’s largest cruise line. I believe Carnival stock will have a major recovery in the coming years. The company reported record revenues, bookings, and customer deposits in Q1 2024, with yields increasing over 17% YOY. Carnival is seeing strong demand and pricing across all core markets and quarters.\n\nManagement highlighted that they are capturing more new guests than ever, in addition to their growing base of repeat cruisers. This broad-based demand should drive sustainable revenue growth. At the same time, Carnival has prepaid significant debt, which will reduce its interest expense burden going forward. Rate cuts should help significantly since interest expenses ate away 90% of operating income last year. Carnival corporation financials chart\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI see powerful demographic tailwinds at Carnival’s back. The growing population of retirees in Florida and other coastal states represents a huge addressable market for cruising. As these headwinds converge with Carnival’s strengthening fundamentals, I believe the stock offers a rare opportunity for triple-digit gains in the years ahead. For long-term investors, Carnival looks like a once-in-a-generation buying opportunity at these still-depressed levels.\n\nUnited Airlines (UAL) The side of a United Airlines (UAL) plane with \"united\" written above passenger windows. Represents airline stocks.\n\nSource: travelview / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnited Airlines (NASDAQ:UAL) is a major U.S. airline providing air transportation services. The company could soar as the travel industry recovers, buoyed by strong pent-up demand and the easing of pandemic restrictions. United’s Q1 results show the resilience of its United Next strategy, with the airline delivering meaningful YOY margin improvement despite facing significant aircraft delivery delays from Boeing (NYSE:BA). United ended up asking some pilots to take unpaid leave, often for months!\n\nManagement stated they would have been profitable for the quarter if not for the Boeing MAX 9 groundings. Plus, United is seeing positive booking momentum across all customer segments. While the Boeing delays are driving temporarily higher costs this year, United’s adept cost management is helping offset most of those headwinds.\n\nIt is targeting a full-year EPS target of $9 to $11. Thus, I believe the stock trades undervalued at these levels. As United pays down debt and capitalizes on the travel resurgence, I expect the stock to make a strong comeback in the coming years.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) provides mobile payment solutions and financial services for businesses and consumers. The company has faced challenges along with the broader fintech sector, but I believe it now stands poised for a resurgence that could propel its stock to triple-digit gains beyond other undervalued stocks.\n\nIn Q1 2024, Block delivered impressive results with EPS of 84 cents, beating estimates by 12 cents, and revenue growing 19.38% year-over-year to $5.96 billion, surpassing expectations by $138 million.\n\nWhile Block was previously unprofitable like many high-growth fintechs, it has pivoted profitability. The company is now expanding margins, with analysts projecting EPS to double over the next four years, complemented by robust 12% annual revenue growth. Block EPS Revenue estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nI believe it remains among significantly undervalued stocks relative to its long-term earnings power.

        "content": "What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday?\n\nTrump Media & Technology Group Corp (NASDAQ:DJT), the operator of the Truth Social platform, is trading higher on Monday. Last week the company announced it expects to receive over $69.4 million from the cash exercise of warrants on June 20 and 21, 2024.\n\nThe cash exercise option became available after the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) declared the company’s registration statement effective on June 18, 2024,\n\nTMTG revealed that if all warrants covered by the registration statement are exercised for cash, the company could receive up to approximately $247 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company will have $40 million of restricted cash become unrestricted due to the effectiveness of the registration statement. These funds add to the over $200 million in unrestricted cash already held by TMTG as of June 18, 2024.\n\nThe infusion of funds will likely support further development and expansion of its platforms, including Truth Social.\n\nTMTG has experienced a significant decline in market value. The conservative social media company’s stock has dropped nearly 50% since May 30, following the conviction of former President Donald Trump on 34 felony counts in a hush money trial, CNN reports.\n\nDespite the falling share price, experts warn that TMTG remains overvalued. Truth Social is a minor player in social media compared to platforms like Elon Musk's X, Reddit Inc (NYSE:RDDT), and Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) Instagram Threads.\n\nSome experts compare TMTG to meme stocks like GameStop Corp (NYSE:GME) and AMC Entertainment Holdings, Inc (NYSE:AMC), which trade on momentum rather than fundamentals.\n\nTrump, the dominant shareholder with 114.75 million shares, has seen his stake’s value drop from $6 billion to about $3.1 billion since late May. The company plans to use the funds raised to enhance its ad platform and explore potential mergers and acquisitions.\n\nTMTG stock gained 118% in the last 12 months.\n\nPrice Action: DJT shares are trading higher by 7.12% to $29.63 premarket at last check on Monday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article What's Going On With Trump Media & Technology Stock On Monday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "How to invest in AI as the rally continues",
        "content": "Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the AI rally. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to significantly influence equity market gains, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) contributing to 64% of the global equity market’s growth in total return terms in the past 18 months.\n\nNotably, chipmaker Nvidia became the largest listed company globally in June. Additionally, 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies mentioned “AI” in their first-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet data. Here’s how investors can seize the AI opportunity, according to UBS.\n\nNvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the split increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation, it does not change the company’s overall value. “Splitting the stock shouldn’t create economic value in theory, but it will make the company more accessible to smaller investors,” Morningstar technology equity strategist Brian Colello, explained.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said: “AI looks set to remain a key driver of equity market returns. We see opportunities in the enabling layer of the AI value chain and in vertically integrated megacaps.”\n\nSignificant investments are being directed towards AI, particularly at semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend approximately $200bn (£158bn) in the sector, a 35% increase over 2023, according to FactSet consensus. For this level of capital expenditure to be justified, AI use cases need to scale up significantly, UBS said.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nPotential applications span advertising, customer service, personal and coding assistants, R&D, cybersecurity, and more. However, AI-linked revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill AI justify the hype?\n\nUBS expects robust capital investment in AI to continue, driving strong earnings growth for companies within the enabling layer of the value chain. For instance, the Swiss bank expects earnings in the global semiconductor industry to rise by 50% this year and 25% in 2025. As the AI ecosystem expands, annual capital expenditure for the enabling layer could reach $331bn by 2027.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Apple, Bitcoin, Target and PepsiCo\n\nHowever, potential risks include the possibility of overcapacity in components like graphics processing units, custom chips, or memory if there’s a lack of significant model advancements or consumer/business uptake.\n\nThe AI value chain: three critical layers\n\nTo understand AI’s potential, UBS breaks down its value chain, comprising of three layers:\n\nEnabling Layer: Includes semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Intelligence Layer: Consists of large language models. Application Layer: Encompasses companies providing AI services for specific use cases, such as copilots and coding assistants.\n\nThe tech capex surge has primarily benefited the enabling layer. While fears of overcapacity could introduce volatility, this segment currently enjoys strong investment rates, offering a mix of attractive earnings growth profiles, competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway. UBS suggests focusing on semiconductor companies leading the AI infrastructure investments at data centres.\n\nMoreover, the AI investment landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major players.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\n“Over time, we expect the AI market to be dominated by an oligopoly of vertically integrated “foundries” and monolithic players along the value chain. So, alongside semiconductors, we also think investors should position in the oligopolies that are present across the entire technology stack, covering chips, cloud computing, and generative AI models and applications. We think these companies will be well positioned to navigate potential shifts in the competitive landscape in different parts of the value chain,” UBS wrote in its CIO 2H outlook.\n\nAI rally: China or US?\n\nWhile the US has seen the greatest benefits from the AI rally, UBS notes that China's tech giants remain undervalued, trading at similar levels as before ChatGPT's launch. Despite challenges like tariffs, export controls, and local regulations, China’s tech leaders are heavily investing in AI.\n\n“Ultimately, we expect China to develop an AI ecosystem that is distinct from that in much of the rest of the world. This should lead to significant monetisation potential for China’s AI giants,” UBS said.\n\nIs a company riskier than a country?\n\nThe market capitalisation of AI chipmaker Nvidia recently surpassed $3.3trn, more than double Switzerland’s entire blue-chip stock index and significantly more than China’s CSI 300. This raises questions about the risks of holding a single company versus a country-level index.\n\nWhile individual companies are generally more volatile, not participating in the returns these companies generate could pose a greater risk to investors’ wealth over time, according to the Swiss bank.\n\nInvestors should seek quality growth\n\nFinally, UBS said investors should focus on global quality wealth compounders—companies with a competitive edge, pricing power, and high barriers to entry. Such businesses, with a track record of disciplined capital allocation, strong balance sheets, and consistent profit growth, offer long-term sustainable value.\n\nQuality growth, often driven by structural growth themes like sustainable development, energy transition, and water scarcity, should be a core component of investors’ equity holdings, UBS added.\n\nWatch: Nvidia will remain dominant for next 3-5 years: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\\\">NVDA</a>) has reached<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-became-3t-company-133118501.html\\\"> a $3 trillion market capitalization,</a> surpassing Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\\\">AAPL</a>) to become the second most valuable company in the US. The company's success has been propelled by the continued excitement around artificial intelligence. However, questions linger about the sustainability of this growth trajectory.</p>\\n<p>Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Doug Clinton joins the Morning Brief to share his perspective on Nvidia's soaring valuation. While acknowledging that the current market dynamics might appear \\\"a little scary on the chart,\\\" Clinton believes that the AI rally is still in its early stages, and investors will continue to feel uneasy until the markets reach a point of being in a \\\"true AI bubble.\\\"</p>\\n<p>As Nvidia gears up for its highly anticipated 10-for-1 stock split, Clinton highlights the company's ability to \\\"continue to show business momentum,\\\" a testament to its resilience and adaptability in the face of rapidly evolving market conditions.</p>\\n<p>However, amid the AI frenzy, Clinton raises a question: \\\"Can Nvidia maintain its dominant position, providing the brains to these artificial intelligence models? I think they can for the next 3-5 years.\\\"</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/ecb-decision-nvidia-tops-3t-113411984.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Morning Brief.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/angel-smith/\\\"><em>Angel Smith</em></a>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/VHPzDPKpWMhV.46T4SL9pA--~B/aD0yNTAzO3c9NDQ0NjthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/8eeb7a70-2408-11ef-bbdc-db77b78be4ca\",\"duration\":\"PT3M36S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/f22d956d-a3de-3532-8b01-af1fddb75bf3.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-remain-dominant-next-3-140440910.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"f22d956d-a3de-3532-8b01-af1fddb75bf3\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "It's not too late to start investing in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. While fervor around new generative AI developments has sent many tech stocks zooming higher, there are still plenty of opportunities to invest in the space.\n\nSpending on generative AI hardware, software, and development will increase from $67 billion last year to $1.3 trillion in 2032, according to estimates from Bloomberg Intelligence. That leaves a lot of room for companies to keep growing.\n\nWhile the early winners may not be able to keep up the pace, there are several companies building unique AI capabilities that look attractive in today's market. And you can get started investing in them with as little as $500.\n\nHere are three no-brainer AI stocks to buy right now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) is the leading provider of professional-level design and document management software. It also has a growing suite of tools for digital marketers that includes tools like Photoshop or its Acrobat PDF reader.\n\nThe company introduced its Firefly AI across its creative cloud software package, which makes creating and editing photos and videos easier than ever. Thanks to Adobe's unique access to proprietary data and its growing catalog of stock images, it can provide excellent training material so its AI can perform more accurately than competitors.\n\nAdobe is using Firefly to draw more users to its free version of its creative software suite. And once it gets them using the software, it's improving conversions into paid users. Meanwhile, paid users are spending more to get more access to advanced AI features.\n\nAdobe is copying the playbook across its other software packages, incorporating generative AI across practically every application and solution it offers.\n\nAdobe has a strong competitive advantage thanks to the network effect. It's the industry standard, which means sharing files with others often requires access to Adobe's software. There's also a lock-in effect, whereby creatives and managers are hesitant to switch to another tool, which may be inferior.\n\nShares currently trade around $500, or 25x analysts' estimates for fiscal 2025 earnings. That's a fair price to pay for a company that's growing quickly, benefits from steady cash flow from subscriptions, and could see strong revenue gains from advances in AI.\n\n2. Salesforce\n\nSalesforce(NYSE: CRM) provides the leading customer-relationship management software service. It helps businesses manage their sales leads and opportunities with its core software. It expands on that with software suites for customer service, marketing teams, and others. It ties all of its products together with its new Data Cloud, which provides a \"single source of truth,\" as management calls it, bringing together all of the data generated by its services into a single unified platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nData Cloud underpins Salesforce's efforts in artificial intelligence. CEO Marc Benioff says the biggest differentiating factor in generative AI isn't the models you work with, but the data you train them with. Salesforce has access to a huge amount of proprietary data thanks to its position as the leading enterprise customer relationship management (CRM) software.\n\nSalesforce's Einstein Copilot can help employees accomplish tasks like closing sales and filing customer support tickets faster and easier, and it's adding more and more features every quarter. That could help fuel growth in sales for more access to AI features or Data Cloud.\n\nIn the meantime, Salesforce should see strong free cash flow as it benefits from similar competitive advantages as Adobe. It has a solid network of users that build applications on Salesforce's platform, locking customers into the ecosystem. Additionally, it's unlikely a manager will switch away from the market-leading software.\n\nShares sold off after disappointing first-quarter earnings and a weak outlook. They currently trade around $240, which is good for a forward P/E of 24.4x. With strong free cash flow supporting a significant share repurchase program and a new dividend, it's worth a slight premium to the market. After the recent sell-off, you could afford two shares of the stock with your $500.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is spending huge amounts of cash on developing and training leading-edge generative AI. It has good reason. It uses AI in just about everything it does with a long history of algorithmically ranked and recommended content. AI powers its massive advertising business, and CEO Mark Zuckerberg sees big opportunities in AI for the 3.2 billion people who use at least one of its apps -- Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, or Messenger -- every day.\n\nAlongside its first-quarter earnings release, management increased its outlook for capital expenditures, which will mostly go toward building AI data centers and procuring the expensive chips needed to train large language models. The company now expects to spend between $35 billion and $40 billion this year. Investors initially balked at that outlook, selling shares off, but they've since bounced back to trade near Meta stock's all-time high.\n\nWhile Zuckerberg warned that direct monetization of its AI efforts is still years away, Meta's uniquely positioned to incorporate its AI efforts within its existing products to make them more valuable. Meta already uses AI to increase engagement on its apps; generative AI can produce even more features to engage users like advanced photo editing and making it easier for influencers to interact with fans. It also makes it easier for marketers to create and test new ad campaigns on its platform.\n\nMeta shares currently trade around $500, putting its forward P/E around 25.3x. That price could be a steal considering analysts expect it to grow earnings per share at a compound annual rate of 30% over the next five years. That's supported by a massive share repurchase program and its continued dominance of the digital advertising market. At this price, it's a no-brainer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Adobe right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Adobe, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Adobe wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Wedbush analysts believe the market is starting to recognize that with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence on the horizon, Apple’s “AI-driven super cycle is about to begin.”\n\nAccording to the investment firm, tech giants like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely need to integrate their AI models into Apple Intelligence, as Apple's iOS ecosystem, encompassing 2.2 billion devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, holds the keys to this vast market.\n\n“We expect developers over the next 6 to 12 months will build hundreds of generative AI-driven apps that will be key ingredients in the recipe for success for Apple as its technology stack creates the core building blocks of the consumer AI tidal wave we see coming starting with iPhone 16 in mid-September,” analysts wrote.\n\nApple’s partnership with OpenAI paves the way for developers worldwide to focus on iOS 18, creating numerous monetization opportunities for the iPhone maker, analysts noted.\n\nThey believe the market is underestimating the potential impact, estimating incremental high-margin Services growth of $10 billion annually for Apple. This partnership is expected to launch a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream, driven by both hardware and software.\n\nWedbush also pointed out that signs of iPhone stabilization are emerging based on recent supply chain checks in Asia, which bodes well for the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle. After a better-than-expected March quarter, optimism for iPhone growth is appearing in various markets.\n\nThe firm expects that June will mark the last negative growth quarter for China, with a growth turnaround expected to begin in the September quarter.\n\n“China remains the linchpin of growth for Apple and now this key region is set to see growth once again starting with iPhone 16 in our view,” it said in a note, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush: Apple AI-driven super cycle about to begin\n\nRXO to buy UPSâ€™s Coyote Logistics for $1 billion, shares surge\n\nItaly's Eni likely to finalise Enilive stake sale by year-end, CEO says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy Right Now for Less Than $1,000",
        "content": "If you have some extra cash to invest in the stock market, now could be a great time to put some money to work. The S&P 500 index has returned 42% since bottoming out in 2022. The average duration of a new bull market is about five years, so buying shares of quality growth stocks could deliver sizable returns over the next few years.\n\nCompanies involved in the development of artificial intelligence (AI), including leading semiconductor companies supplying computing hardware for training AI models, are ripe for the picking. Here are two leaders in this burgeoning opportunity that could substantially grow your savings in the coming years.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has become a popular option for investors interested in semiconductor stocks, but the company has been performing at a high level for most of the last 10 years. Its continued innovation and focus on serving the booming data center market make it a no-brainer stock to buy today.\n\nAMD makes chips for consumer PCs, gaming consoles, and cloud computing markets, but the data center business is where the momentum is right now. Semiconductor spending in data centers is projected to grow 25% annually through 2028, according to Dell'Oro Group, and AMD is already capturing a healthy share of that spending increase. Its data center revenue was up 80% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nAfter a strong start to the year, management raised its full-year guidance for data center revenue. This came after the new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) designed for AI workloads became the fastest ramping-up product in company history, which signals tremendous pent-up demand.\n\nAs the data center business continues to show outstanding long-term growth prospects, AMD is also seeing strong demand for its central processing units (CPUs). Its client segment revenue, including sales of Ryzen desktop processors, doubled year over year to $1.4 billion last quarter. It's also seeing significant revenue increases with the ramp-up of its fourth-generation EPYC CPUs for servers.\n\nAMD's new MI300 should continue to experience strong demand, as there haven't been enough GPUs to satisfy AI demand over the past year. The company also expects its next generation of EPYC processors to deliver substantial performance improvements and gain further market share against Intel.\n\nThis is a great time to consider buying the stock. AMD shares trade down about 30% from their previous high, even as Wall Street analysts are raising their growth estimates and now expect the company's earnings to grow at an annualized rate of 43% over the next several years. The share price is currently $160.67, making it very affordable for someone with less than $1,000 to buy one share.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nFacebook and Instagram owner Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) has made a solid recovery over the last year. The stock hit new highs earlier this year, as advertising revenue accelerated after a weak ad spending environment in 2022. The stock could be poised for more gains as the company benefits from the rollout of Meta AI across its family of apps.\n\nMeta is a no-brainer because it has over 3.2 billion daily active users that it can monetize through advertising. Revenue soared 27% year over year to $36 billion in the first quarter, but tighter control of operating expenses drove a more impressive jump in net income of 117% to $12.4 billion.\n\nMeta AI is contributing more to those impressive financial results. Based on Meta's latest Llama 3 large language model, Meta AI is significantly improving content recommendations and ad performance, which, in turn, is driving higher user engagement and more ad spending by brands.\n\nImportantly, the value of the company's wide user reach led to a 6% year-over-year increase in the price per ad, which reflects solid advertising demand. While it's just one quarter, the latest results show how the company can continue to drive growth by investing in more advanced AI models.\n\nIt's encouraging that Meta Platforms recently initiated its first-ever dividend, with the quarterly payment currently set at $0.50 per share. This reflects a financially sound business with great prospects and plenty of resources to invest in the future while rewarding shareholders.\n\nThe stock trades at a reasonable valuation of 25 times expected earnings this year. That is very attractive for a business that analysts think will grow earnings at an annualized rate of 18% over the long term. Meta's share price is hovering around $500, so $1,000 could easily buy one share each of Advanced Micro Devices and Meta Platforms.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy and Hold for Great Long-Term Potential",
        "content": "The era of artificial intelligence (AI) is upon us, and this new technology promises to unleash a new wave of creativity and convenience the likes of which has never been witnessed. AI offers an enticing promise to help automate tasks and achieve feats never accomplished by humans. Investors excited about AI's prospects and wish to ride on this long-term wave can seek growth stocks that utilize AI in their businesses.\n\nBy riding on the tailwinds of this trend, you can slowly but surely increase the value of your investment portfolio. The development of AI is in its infancy as there is so much more that can be done with this groundbreaking technology. Many companies are only starting to uncover AI's potential for a wide range of tasks, from defense and chatbots to assisting with queries and enabling deeper analysis and insights.\n\nIf you are looking for solid AI-related stocks to park your money in, consider the trio featured below. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Palantir\n\nPalantir(NYSE: PLTR) develops software platforms to enable comprehensive data analysis. Engineers are sent to the field to work closely with customers to help integrate their data and optimize workflows, resulting in increased efficiency and a better awareness of how the organization's data can be harnessed for useful insights.\n\nThe company released its AI platform (AIP) developed for industrial and military partners and applied it to customers in the commercial and government sectors. CEO Alex Karp is working with his management team to make Palantir's platform available to a broader range of organizations including overseas businesses, research scientists, and academic institutions.\n\nThe company's progress in growing can be seen in its recent financial numbers. For 2023, revenue increased by 17% year over year to $2.2 billion with U.S. commercial revenue climbing 36% year over year to $457 million. Palantir's free-cash-flow generation also more than tripled year over year to $697 million. The first quarter of 2024 saw revenue continue its upward climb, rising by 21% year over year to $634 million. The business generated its sixth consecutive quarter of net income at $106 million and continued to churn out positive free cash flow of $127 million.\n\nIn particular, U.S. commercial revenue grew 40% year over year to $150 million with Palantir's U.S. commercial customer count surging by 69% year over year to 262. Karp believes that U.S. commercial revenue will be one of Palantir's key growth drivers in the near term.\n\nThe company's steady profitability, consistent free cash flow, and healthy traction in securing both commercial and government customers is a testament to its growing clout. Palantir disclosed during its IPO in 2020 that its total addressable market for the commercial and government sectors stood at around $119 billion. With revenue of just $2.2 billion in 2023, this market estimate represents a sizable growth opportunity for the company.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is a social media company that owns the popular chat program WhatsApp, the photo and video-sharing app Instagram, and the social media site Facebook. In late April, the company rolled out Meta AI, the latest version of its AI assistant, which was built on its large language model (LLM), Llama 3. This AI tool is built into the search boxes for WhatsApp, Facebook, Instagram, and Messenger to allow users to ask questions using natural language that can be easily answered.\n\nThere's more from Meta as the company plans to gradually introduce new capabilities such as longer context windows along with enhanced performance. Meta AI's LLM model is trained on a vast amount of data and CEO Mark Zuckerberg said back in October last year that AI will be Meta's biggest investment area for 2024, with the business set to spend billions of dollars to beef up its AI capabilities.\n\nMeta reported a robust set of earnings for 2023 with revenue rising 16% year over year to $134.9 billion. Net income surged by 69% year over year to $39.1 billion and the business generated a positive free cash flow of $43.8 billion, more than double the $19 billion that was churned out in the previous year. The board also initiated the social media giant's first-ever dividend with a quarterly payout per share of $0.50.\n\nThe strong momentum carried into the first quarter of 2024 (Q1 2024) with revenue climbing 27% year over year to $36.5 billion. Net income for the quarter soared 117% year over year to $12.4 billion. Meta's daily active people rose 7.3% year over year to 3.24 billion, demonstrating the social media company's ability to continue attracting new users.\n\nWith the inclusion of Meta AI into its apps and the promise of continued enhancements, investors can look forward to better numbers ahead as more users flock to use Meta's apps and platform.\n\n3. Adobe\n\nAdobe(NASDAQ: ADBE) has integrated its native generative AI application called Firefly across its Experience and Creative Cloud platforms. By doing so, the company hopes to deliver increased personalization and enable users to automate tasks while reducing search time and effort. Recent innovations include the new Generative Fill for Adobe's Photoshop product that's designed for customers to create stunning images.\n\nFirefly allows customers to generate realistic photos by using natural language, a strong plus for non-technically trained users that helps to reduce the learning curve. This generative AI tool has also been integrated into its core Acrobat product. Customers can ask questions and gain insights across PDFs and other types of documents. This extensive use of Firefly enables Adobe to deliver greater personalization and convenience.\n\nAdobe reported strong earnings for the first half of fiscal 2024 ending May 31. Revenue rose 10.8% year over year to $10.5 billion, a record high. The digital media company saw both operating and net income fall 13% and 13.7% year over year, respectively, because of a $1 billion termination fee related to its aborted attempt to purchase Figma. Excluding this one-time item, operating and net income would have risen by 18% and 25.6% year over year, respectively.\n\nCEO Shantanu Narayen said the company's AI approach has delivered better value and resulted in a larger base of customers.

        "title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Meta Platforms, Inc. (META)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\n\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\n\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\n\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\n\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\n\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\n\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\n\nA team of developers working in unison to create the company's messaging application.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 246\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of the largest social media and communications firms in the world. Its primary social media platform Facebook provides it with a stable revenue base due to a sizeable amount of users that are targetted through advertisements. At the same time, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has made key moves in the AI industry through its Llama model and impressed developers by making Llama open source. To maintain its dominance, the firm has to regularly ensure that users remain engaged on Facebook and Instagram and do not migrate to other social media networks such as Elon Musk's X (formerly Twitter). Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s decision to buy hundreds of thousands of NVIDIA GPUs for AI training have also placed it in a key position in the AI industry since the GPUs are in short supply and those with access can gain advantages in developing new models. Should the firm succeed in commercializing Llama, then the future could be very bright for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nBaron Funds is of the view that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) can maintain its key role in the industry due to its sizeable user base and key ties with advertisers. In its Q1 2024 investor letter, the fund outlined:\n\nShares of Meta Platforms, Inc., the world’s largest social network, rose 37.3% in the quarter due to robust fourth quarter top-line growth of 25% year-over-year with operating margins more than doubling year-over-year to 41%, benefiting from the year of efficiency12 as Meta’s headcount was down 22% year-over-year (note that the profitability of the core business is even stronger as Reality Labs’ losses of over $4.5 billion in the quarter are included in the overall operating income metric). Meta also guided for first- quarter revenue growth of approximately 29% year-over-year, which was better than expected. Advertiser satisfaction and adoption of Meta remains strong, core app engagement is healthy with video daily watch time up 25% year-over-year and the total number of monthly active users up 6% year-on-year to 3.98 billion in the fourth quarter, and Instagram Reels and click-to-message ads monetization continues to improve. Meta also continues to rapidly innovate in GenAI, with its leading research lab releasing widely adopted open-source models (e.g., Llama 2), and internal algorithms and core apps becoming augmented with AI (e.g., Meta’s recommendation engine). We remain shareholders and believe Meta can sustain its leading market share in digital advertising thanks to strong network effects enabled by its massive user and advertiser base. Additionally, we believe the company’s innovative culture, large installed base, and leading GenAI research should enable it to embed AI and GenAI into its offerings with further monetization opportunities ahead. For example, AI agents could help scale business messaging, handling a large volume of customer requests on behalf of business customers, making business messaging at scale more viable.\n\nOverall META ranks 3rd on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "High-growth stocks to buy drove the stock market to record gains in 2023, maintaining their red-hot form so far this year. The buzz surrounding artificial intelligence (AI) tech stocks had investors continue flocking to the stock market, taking all major indices for record highs. Hence, it’s been incredible to be a stock market investor, with the risk-on sentiment set to soar even higher.\n\nGiven the recent softness in inflation numbers, the Federal Reserve is most likely to cut interest rate cuts in the second half of the year. With the market pricing in one or maybe a couple of rate cuts, it is an excellent time to bet on the best growth stocks. A broader rally is in the cards and these high-growth stocks should benefit immensely.\n\nThat said, here are three high-growth stocks to buy that have established a strong foothold in their respective markets. Betting on these stocks could yield impressive returns as they continue thriving and outperforming in the current market landscape.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) stock index is seen on a smartphone screen. It is an American subscription streaming service and production company\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) has been one of the top growth stocks over the past several years. 2023 was particularly rewarding for its investors, with NFLX stock jumping a handsome 59%, eclipsing its 3-year return at 37%.\n\nIts monstrous success is linked to its blow-out quarterly performance last year, marked by comfortable top- and bottom-line beats. Moreover, it continues posting rising subscriber numbers, comfortably trouncing analyst estimates by considerable margins.\n\nIn its first-quarter (Q1) report Netflix posted 9.33 million global streaming paid net additions, ahead of analyst estimates of 4.84 million. This represents a stellar 16% jump in subscriber additions year-over-year (YOY) compared to 4.9% in the prior-year period. However, Netflix is shifting gears to focus more on its bottom line, reporting viewer engagement instead of subscriber counts.\n\nMoreover, it is expanding into live sports and entertainment, having signed a whopping $5 billion deal to stream World Wrestling Entertainment’s episodic TV show Rawnext year. Also, it plans to livestream an NFL game on Christmas Day. Hence, with multiple catalysts in motion, it is the right time to wager on NFLX stock.\n\nShopify (SHOP) shopify logo sign on building facade\n\nSource: Beyond The Scene / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify’s (NYSE:SHOP) dynamic platform is a must-have for businesses looking to build or expand their e-commerce presence amidst the surge in online shopping. Over the years, Shopify has grown at a rapid clip, adding multiple new revenue streams, including subscription sales, payment processing and shipping labels. Consequently, the company has surpassed a whopping $1 trillion in gross merchandise value since its inception.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1, it handily beat estimates across both lines, just as it has for the past six quarters. Revenues shot up to $1.9 billion, a 23% year-over-year increase led by double-digit growth in merchant and subscription solutions. The latter, in particular, grew sharply during the quarter, up 34% from the prior-year period.\n\nAs we advance, Shopify is poised to continue delivering for its shareholders as it implements AI solutions and services targeting larger-scale businesses. Also, the stock is down double-digits in the past year, making it a golden opportunity for investors to pick up SHOP stock on the dip.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a hyper-growth business for the past decade, buoyed by its relentless drive to innovate and robust ad revenue. Advertising remains its core revenue source, powered by its timeless Family of Apps, which continues generating a gusher of free cash flows for its business. Consequently, it has been highly rewarding for investors with its stock jumping over 660% in the past decade, dwarfing broader-market gains. META stock soared 70% last year, driven by efficiency gains and its strategic investments in AI.\n\nOn top of that, the launch of its large language model Meta Llama 3 and the AI assistant Meta AI are massive long-term catalysts. These investments in expanding its AI prowess are set to significantly enhance its ad platforms, making them more appealing to advertisers. Hence, with a strong user base and strategic AI investments, Meta remains a top, strong-buy growth stock to bet on.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Stock to Buy for Long Term?",
        "content": "We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers –  Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,  Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\n\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\n\nKey AI Predictions\n\nThe UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.\n\nBased on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Best AI Stock With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”?\n\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) The Best AI Stock After a New $1.2 Trillion Opportunity?",
        "content": "We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers –  Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,  Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\n\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\n\nKey AI Predictions\n\nThe UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.\n\nBased on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Best AI Stock With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”?\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nIn 2023, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) revealed its first-gen inference accelerator the company produced in-house called Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA). UBS named the accelerator as Meta Platforms’ (NASDAQ:META) strength in the AI Enabling layer, while Llama and advertising are social media giant’s moat points in the Intelligence and Application layers in the AI value chain.\n\nWhy is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "I guess it’s okay to stop worrying about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. While the stock market continued climbing to new all-time highs as we moved from possibly six cuts this year to three, then to one, new reports of much higher-than-expected industrial production in May suggests we may not get any cuts until next year. Still, that’s apparently a risk-off event and the stock market rose yet again.\n\nWhile a rising tide lifts all boats, some growth stocks to buy now look better than others because they have catalysts that are driving them higher. That’s what investors should look for in a frothy market, businesses with fundamental reasons for growing.\n\nThese three growth stocks below should be on your shopping list this month. They all have valid, business-related reasons for their growth trajectories. Although each is trading at or near record highs of their own, they could rise much higher very fast.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMobile handset chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is increasingly immersing itself into artificial intelligence (AI). Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip has the necessary power to handle the complex processing chores the technology demands.\n\nThe 8S Gen 3 supports on-device generative AI and can run large language models (LLM) of up to 10 billion parameters, which includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini Nano from Google.\n\nThe chipset is featured on Samsung’s Galaxy S24 and Qualcomm may become the exclusive provider for the smartphone maker’s new Galaxy S25. Analysts believe the chipmaker’s next chip iteration, the 8S Gen 4, is also in line for a price hike by as much as 25% to 30%. That should significantly boost Qualcomm’s top and bottom lines.\n\nWhile a lot of attention was paid to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introducing AI to the iPhone, Samsung was happy to give its rival a John McClane-esque “welcome to the party, pal” greeting. In acknowledgment of Qualcomm’s chips giving the S24 AI capabilities last year, Samsung tweeted, “Adding ‘Apple’ doesn’t make it new or groundbreaking. Welcome to AI.”\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 57% in 2024 and 85% higher over the past year. If this news of a Samsung partnership proves true, Qualcomm could be starting a new leg of higher growth.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A close-up of the Coinbase (COIN) app install option.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that cryptocurrencies aren’t my thing. I don’t quite understand them and most seem more like penny stocks where traders look for the greater fool to sell to. There is no utility in most of the coins being bid up, which can only lead to disaster. That’s why investors should stick with cryptos that have actual utility, such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD). In that same vein, I’d prefer a picks-and-shovels crypto player that provides the tools investors need versus buying the actual coins themselves. It’s why Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) makes for a natural growth stock to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt offers a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring and storing crypto. It is agnostic regarding which crypto you choose. Investors can use it even if they want to go out on a limb with some riskier coins out there. Not every coin is supported, of course. However, the site says it supports more than 260 digital assets and 300 different trading pairs. It also offers custody for more than 425 digital assets.\n\nAlthough I was skeptical of the staying power of crypto (I told a friend to sell the Bitcoin he bought for $600 when it hit $7,000 — fortunately he didn’t listen), it is clear it is a viable asset to buy, sell and hold. It will also grow in value. Even for a confused doubter like me, Coinbase is an obvious choice to grow even larger in size and value.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation logo on smartphone screen. Against stock prices, stock chart. Investments in securities.. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now the most valuable stock on the market. Having blasted through the $1 trillion and $2 trillion market capitalization marks, it was only a matter of time before it crashed through $3 trillion, too. Then it set its sights on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and quickly achieved the top spot.\n\nSo it’s natural to think that after tripling in value in one year, Nvidia stock is poised for a fall. At the least, it might not have much more to add. I thought that once and was quickly proven wrong.\n\nThe rise of AI is what has Nvidia stock hurtling to new heights. Because the technology is so much in its infancy and the chipmaker is so far out in front of the competition, the increasing demands of the technology will keep powering Nvidia higher.\n\nNvidia also needs to keep innovating to maintain pace with the advances of AI. No sooner did it begin production of its Grace Blackwell superchip than it announced another new AI chip architecture, Rubin. It’s not due out until 2026 but we can see that Nvidia is continuously looking forward.\n\nIt is possible the announcement could hurt sales of the Grace Blackwell chip. Customers might wait for the new chip out of Nvidia instead of buying the “obsolete” technology. Yet it shows how rapidly the AI market is evolving. It also indicates just how far in front of the field Nvidia is. It makes the chipmaker the premiere growth stock to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Social Media Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "The social media stocks still don’t look overly expensive when stacked against other red-hot tech plays using artificial intelligence (AI). Undoubtedly, many social media companies stand out as potentially stealthy ways to play the AI trend. However, it’s unclear when the big payoff will be for these firms.\n\nDespite the AI prowess of various social media firms, the technology just isn’t going to provide a profound near-term sales boost for AI chip stocks.\n\nIf looking for longer-term AI tailwinds (three to five years down the line), the best social media stocks may prove undervalued right now. Given vast amounts of data at their fingertips, it’s a mistake to discount their competitive edge as they wade further into the AI era.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s explore three social media stocks that look cheap with underrated AI prospects.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is still the king of social media through its family of apps. Those include Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Reels. The latter may be a “coiled spring” should U.S. regulators ultimately follow through with the ban of rival platform TikTok.\n\nReportedly, the appeals court will discuss the implications of a TikTok ban just weeks before the U.S. Presidential Election. Indeed, it will be a very interesting fall for America. For now, it’s impossible to tell if China-based TikTok will get banned. If it is, Meta Platforms could have yet another shot in the arm. It would continue investing heavily in AI technologies while still allocating ample time and effort on its metaverse projects.\n\nTikTok ban or not, META stock still looks like one of the cheapest of the Magnificent Seven right now at 28.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). Investors get a founder-led company that’s not afraid to take risks to improve its odds of becoming a leader in emerging technological markets.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Pinterest logo. PINS stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NASDAQ:PINS) is getting serious about AI. With the recent unveiling of its Performance+ AI-driven advertising tool, Pinterest takes a page out of Meta Platforms’ playbook. (Meta’s ad tool, Advantage+, has been helping build value for advertisers.) The more AI innovations Pinterest shoots for, the more room PINS has to go from here as it continues its recovery from its horrid crash of 2021.\n\nApart from Performance+, Pinterest can benefit from AI over the long run as it beefs up the content-recommendation algorithm. And Pinterest Labs seeks to build the next generation of AI and machine learning (ML) technologies. So, it’s about time we gave the underrated image-focused social media platform the respect it deserves.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock may be up over 140% in the last two years. But PINS shares are still well off (around 49%) their 2021 all-time highs of over $85 per share.\n\nSnap (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nUnlike META and PINS stock, Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP) has not been so quick to snap back from its brutal 2021-22 plunge.\n\nAfter rising 23% in the past two years, the stock still remains down over 80% from its peak. It’s not hard to imagine many Snapchat users flocking over to TikTok or Meta’s Reels in recent years. Still, Snapchat has a plan to get back on the high-growth track, even in the face of stiff competition.\n\nAs the company shifts away from augmented reality (AR) and more towards AI (specifically, AI-driven ad optimization), Snap may have a means to boost its ad revenues significantly.\n\nFurthermore, should TikTok be banned from the U.S. market, Snap may just get the windfall to get back on the high track. Until then, expect more turbulence from SNAP stock as it looks to make the most of the broad-based bounce-back in digital ads while fending off a giant in META.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Social Networking Q1 Earnings: Snap (NYSE:SNAP) Simply the Best\n\nQuarterly earnings results are a good time to check in on a company’s progress, especially compared to its peers in the same sector. Today we are looking at Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and the best and worst performers in the social networking industry.\n\nBusinesses must meet their customers where they are, which over the past decade has come to mean on social networks. In 2020, users spent over 2.5 hours a day on social networks, a figure that has increased every year since measurement began. As a result, businesses continue to shift their advertising and marketing dollars online.\n\nThe 5 social networking stocks we track reported an ok Q1; on average, revenues beat analyst consensus estimates by 3.5%. while next quarter's revenue guidance was 1.3% above consensus. Stocks, especially growth stocks where cash flows further in the future are more important to the story, had a good end of 2023. But the beginning of 2024 has seen more volatile stock performance due to mixed inflation data, but social networking stocks have exhibited impressive performance, with the share prices up 13.6% on average since the previous earnings results.\n\nBest Q1: Snap (NYSE:SNAP)\n\nFounded by Stanford University students Evan Spiegel, Reggie Brown, and Bobby Murphy, and originally called Picaboo, Snapchat (NYSE: SNAP) is an image centric social media network.\n\nSnap reported revenues of $1.19 billion, up 20.9% year on year, topping analysts' expectations by 6.6%. It was an impressive quarter for the company, with strong sales guidance for the next quarter and solid growth in its users.\n\n“The value we provide our community and advertising partners has translated into improved financial performance,” said Evan Spiegel, CEO. Snap Total Revenue\n\nSnap pulled off the biggest analyst estimates beat of the whole group. The company reported 422 million daily active users, up 10.2% year on year.

It was a mixed quarter for the company: Yelp's revenue growth regrettably slowed and its revenue missed Wall Street's estimates. On the other hand, adjusted EBITDA came in ahead.\n\nYelp had the weakest performance against analyst estimates and slowest revenue growth in the group. The stock is down 9.2% since the results and currently trades at $36.\n\nRead our full analysis of Yelp's results here.\n\nMeta (NASDAQ:META)\n\nFamously founded by Mark Zuckerberg in his Harvard dorm, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a collection of the largest social networks in the world - Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, along with its metaverse focused Reality Labs.\n\nMeta reported revenues of $36.46 billion, up 27.3% year on year, in line with analysts' expectations.

        "content": "Finding attractive stocks in the financial markets is essential for investors trying to take advantage of expansion prospects. Seven stocks are among the most inexpensive to purchase and keep. These companies are on the cusp on cutting-edge processors, social media and artificial intelligence (AI), semiconductor technology, financial services disruption, cybersecurity solutions leadership, big data analytics specialization and audio streaming dominance.\n\nThese businesses are at the top of their respective industries and setting new standards for innovation and profitability. Examining these companies’ fundamentals, like business practices, competitive positioning and game-changing technology, will help one understand why these stocks are considered excellent investments. Whether it’s how their processors are changing computing environments, their AI-driven digital ecosystem is growing or their deliberate focus on AI and data center advances, each firm provides solid arguments for investors looking for the best cheap stocks to purchase and keep.\n\nHere, the emphasis is on what distinguishes these businesses from the competition in the current market by highlighting critical elements that determine their potential and growth paths.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) designs and produces computer processors and related technologies. Sales in the client category reached $1.4 billion, up 85% from the previous year. Ryzen desktop and mobile CPUs are in high demand, and partners like HP (NYSE:HPQ) have been major adopters of these processors in business PCs. AMD’s client business has grown impressively as well, thanks in part to Ryzen CPUs. Additionally, strong market acceptance and adoption of Ryzen 8000 series CPUs across desktop and mobile platforms reflect the 85% rise in revenue.\n\nIndeed, with its AI accelerators and improved security features, the Ryzen Pro portfolio is designed with industry demands in mind. It has garnered popularity among commercial PC makers, putting AMD in a solid position to take market share in the enterprise PC space. Despite obstacles, particularly in the embedded area, advances in edge AI present significant potential. To sum up, AMD’s Ryzen processors have gained significant market acceptance in both consumer and commercial segments. These elements make AMD an ideal pick among the top undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nMetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META) operates the largest social media network globally, including Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. With $36.5 billion in total sales in Q1 2024, Meta recorded a 27% year-over-year (YoY) rise in revenue. Its Family of Apps category contributes significantly to ad income and is the primary driver of this increase. In particular, the segment’s ad income increased by 27% to $35.6 billion compared to the previous year. Moreover, Meta’s worldwide revenue diversification strategy is seen in the multiple revenue streams across several geographic regions, with major gains in Europe (33% growth) and the Rest of the World (40% growth).\n\nFurther, with its Meta AI driven by the Llama 3 model, Meta has achieved significant advancements in AI research. This AI assistant is compatible with all of its social media platforms, including Messenger. These developments improve the user experience. They also set the stage for future revenue generation via targeted advertising and user engagement.\n\nTo conclude, Meta’s investments in AI and virtual reality (VR) technologies enhance user engagement and broaden its revenue streams, making it an attractive choice on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntel (NASDAQ:INTC) is a leader in semiconductor manufacturing, designing and microprocessor production for various computing devices. Over $2.1 billion was added to its operational profit year over year, bringing its operating margin to over 28% (Q1 2024). Despite sales issues, Intel Foundry is making attempts to enhance profitability. Intel’s operating profit decreased somewhat from the previous year. However, it may increase as the firm moves to more sophisticated nodes and improves factory utilization.\n\nAdditionally, high achievements include the commencement of Intel 20A manufacturing. The launch of Intel 14A utilizes high NA EUV technology. Intel’s position in the AI and data center sectors is strengthened by product launches such as the Intel Gaudi 3 AI accelerator. It promises 40% more efficiency and 50% quicker inference than competitors. Even with a $6.2 billion negative adjusted free cash flow, Intel is confident in its improvements, as good cost control and higher-than-expected gross margins contributed to an EPS that exceeded forecast.\n\nOverall, Intel’s advancements in processor technologies and strategic investments in foundry capabilities position it as a key pick on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ). Smartphone with Square logo on screen in hand on background of Block logo.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) offers financial services and mobile payment solutions through its flagship app. Even though Block devotes less than 3% of its resources to Bitcoin (BTC-USD) related initiatives, its products are now a significant source of income. With very little in associated costs (0.7%) , Cash App’s bitcoin goods contributed 3.3% and 4.2% of Block’s gross profit in 2022 and 2023, respectively. This high-margin industry uses Block’s platform to generate extra income.\n\nMoreover, Block has expanded the range of products it offers, such as Cash App Borrow, Cash App Card, and Buy Now, Pay Later, all of which help to drive the company’s revenue growth. The growth of ecosystem components like Paid in Bitcoin and Bitcoin Roundups increase user adoption and engagement and generates more money. Block’s TBD project intends to create a system for fiat-to-digital currency exchanges to upend the $860 billion global remittance market. Hence, this program takes advantage of a huge market opportunity and supports Square’s objective of democratizing financial access everywhere.\n\nTo sum up, Block’s disruptive approach to financial services and expansion into cryptocurrency and digital payments make it an appealing choice for undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) provides cybersecurity solutions through its Falcon platform, which leverages AI and cloud technologies. The design of the Falcon platform is emphasized as a competitive moat that facilitates cybersecurity solution consolidation. Customers experience less complexity due to this consolidation, improving operational effectiveness and security. Customers who adopt several modules do so at significant rates: 65% adopt five or more modules, 44% adopt six or more, and 28% adopt seven or more modules. The platform’s stickiness and range of capabilities in meeting various cybersecurity demands are shown by its modular adoption.\n\nMoreover, partnerships with major players in the market confirm Crowdstrike’s leadership in supplying cybersecurity solutions for cloud settings while improving product offerings. The speedy release of new solutions like Falcon for Defender and upgrades such as Falcon Cloud Security and Falcon Next-Gen SIEM showcase Crowdstrike’s adaptability and market response. Finally, Crowdstrike’s robust growth in revenue and profitability and strong customer retention rates make it one of the undervalued stocks to buy and hold.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) specializes in big data analytics software, serving government agencies and large enterprises. The business recruited 41 net new clients in Q1 2024 alone in the U.S. commercial market, indicating a 69% YoY and 19% sequential growth. The business signed a seven-figure agreement five days after finishing a bootcamp with a utility provider, demonstrating a notable deal cycle shortening. Current clients are growing in size and the influence of their deployments. Lowe’s (NYSE:LOW) and General Mills (NYSE:GIS) are two examples of companies doing this.\n\nFurther, adjusted operating margin rose to 57% in Q1 2024. This indicates a balanced growth trajectory with concurrent adjusted operating margins and revenue growth increases. The company produced $149 million in adjusted free cash flow — a 23% margin reflects sharp cash management and operational edge. Adjusted expenditures grew by just 2% annually and sequentially, despite growth, highlighting strict cost management. In short, Palantir’s strategic contracts and consistent profitability make it an intriguing pick on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Close up view of a smartphone with Spotify (SPOT) logo on display. Laptop and headphone on background. New technology, social media, network, liquid music concept.\n\nSource: Fabio Principe / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is the leading global audio streaming platform, offering music, podcasts and other audio content. The company reached a record-breaking Q1 2024 gross margin of 27.6%, an increase of 2.43% from the previous year. Favorable content costs and other operational efficiencies were the main drivers of this development, delivering a record-breaking operating income of 168 million euros. This indicates Spotify’s progress toward meeting its financial goals. Spotify was able to offset the impact of higher-than-expected social charge accruals by controlling costs and reducing operational expenditures.\n\nMoreover, Spotify produced a positive 207 million euros in free cash flow during the first quarter, demonstrating excellent operational cash production capabilities. Spotify must maintain this positive cash flow position to fortify its financial position and reinvest in its expansion plans. It had 4.7 billion euros in short-term investments and cash in Q1 2024. Thanks to its strong liquidity, Spotify has the financial flexibility to fund its current operations and strategic initiatives.\n\nFinally, Spotify’s focus on expanding its content library, enhancing the user experience through personalized recommendations and diversifying revenue streams through new features solidifies its presence on the undervalued stocks to buy and hold list.\n\nAs of this writing, Yiannis Zourmpanos held long positions in AMD, META, INTC and PLTR.

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Cathie Wood Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Investors looking for long-term returns should consider investing in strong buy Cathie Wood stocks this month.\n\nThe ARK Invest Chief Executive Officer (CEO) gained a massive following in 2020 after all six of her exchange traded funds (ETFs) saw returns above 100%. Since then, Wood has been hailed as a star stock picker for her well-justified high risk/high reward plays.\n\nFour years later, Wood is still going strong and appealing to investors with her belief in disruptive technologies and contrarian positions in turbulent markets. Wood has often stressed the long-term potential of her ETFs with many of her investments leaning toward growth stocks. And with her stock picks rarely conservative, she has demonstrated a strong track record of investing in long-term winners.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, it’s unsurprising that many of Wood’s top choices have received a strong buy rating from several analysts. Let’s delve in.\n\nIntellia Therapeutics Inc. (NTLA) Intellia Therapeutics (NTLA Stock) logo on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCathie Wood doesn’t shy away from biotech stocks, as evidenced in her strong position in Intellia Therapeutics Inc. (NASDAQ:NTLA). The company specializes in gene therapy and has ongoing clinical trials to treat rare illnesses.\n\nAlso, the company’s financials are promising. In its last quarter, Intellia Therapeutics Inc. reported $28.9 million collaborative revenue, up from $12.6 million a year ago. In addition, it maintains a strong liquid position with nearly $1 billion in cash equivalents and marketable securities.\n\nHowever, the biotech firm’s biggest catalyst is its partnership with Regeneron Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ:REGN). As per the agreement Regeneron will take on 25% of the total costs and profits. This will prove lucrative for NTLA once its gene therapy goes to market.\n\nHence, it’s unsurprising that Cathie Wood and other prominent investors are bullish on Intellia Therapeutics Inc. stock. Ark Invest has consistently added to its NTLA holdings and has  an 8% stake in the company. Her shares make up 3% of Ark’s portfolio. Analysts seem to mirror these bullish sentiments, giving the stock a strong buy rating and a price target of $64.7.\n\nRocket Lab (RKLB) (RKLB stock, space stocks) satellite over the Earth\n\nSource: Andrzej Puchta / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith space stocks, the opportunity for innovation is virtually limitless. And while SpaceX remains the undefeated leader, the aerospace manufacturer, Rocket Lab (NASDAQ:RKLB) is definitely making its mark. The company is on track to launch its rocket Neutron this year, which is a competitor to SpaceX’s Falcon 9.\n\nStory continues\n\nRocket Lab’s financials are not too shabby either. In its previous quarter, the company reported a 69% increase in revenue year-over-year (YOY) at $92.7 million and $365.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. The highlight of the earnings report was the strong guidance.\n\nAdditionally, Rocket Lab signed a lucrative agreement with the U.S. Space Forces Space Systems Command and plans to make progress on this contract this year. And, the company closed the quarter with over $1 billion in its backlog- signaling strong revenue growth. Thus, Q2 revenue is expected to be in the $105 million to $110 million range.\n\nTherefore, given the optimistic outlook for Rocket Lab, Cathie Wood was quick to purchase 1.5 million shares in the company in Q1. It brought her total investment in the company to $26 million. The analyst consensus on this stock a strong buy with a projected price of $6.7.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter predicting that the next big artificial intelligence (AI) opportunity is in software companies, Wood’s sentiment was bullish enough to snap up shares in major tech giants. One of her more notable investments was in MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ:META), investing billions of dollars in its AI services. Ark Invest currently holds 2.13% ownership stake in the company.\n\nMoreover, META was quick to jump on the AI bandwagon with the launch of Meta AI. According to CEO Mark Zuckerberg, AI will be instrumental in improving its core offering. Keeping with this theme, Meta Platforms invests heavily in several AI initiatives. And, it recently launched its AI assistant, Llama 3. The company hopes to keep this momentum going and increase its expected AI capital expenditure to $40 billion.\n\nAlthough Meta’s AI investment might take a while to generate returns, analysts still rate this stock a strong buy. The confidence in Meta Platform’s performance stems from its stellar Q1 earnings report with revenue up 27% YOY at $36.5 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe broadening of the stock market rally hasn’t yet arrived as investors keep piling into (just about) anything AI touches.\n\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\n\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\n\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\n\nSo far this year, SMCI is up over 200%. Dell, which to some harkens back to a PC 1.0 world, has seen its stock nearly double.\n\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\n\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market’s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nThe Super Micro news has a clear Musk dimension, and part of the multi-CEO’s dynamism is that his businesses cross into different industries and are themselves interconnected. But since Tesla is the only public Musk company, most investors can only get in on his other ventures indirectly. If you can’t buy into xAI, why not acquire a piece of its suppliers?

(Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) (Marc Piasecki via Getty Images)\n\nA similar dynamic is at play within the world of AI.\n\nThe AI rally extends beyond hardware manufacturers too. Investors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\n\nPowering the computer systems that train and run AI systems requires huge amounts of energy. Utility companies are catching a ride on the AI wave.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, which will include building and running data centers. In turn, power demand from US data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, in part because of AI, according to estimates from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nStory continues\n\nGetting in early is nice. But the AI frenzy is proving that getting in at all is more than enough. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "content": "Seasoned tech investor Paul Wick of Seligman Investments has been reducing his holdings in Nvidia Corp . (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently, voicing doubts about the company’s future earnings growth, Bloomberg News reported.\n\n“Our enthusiasm has moderated somewhat over the last one to two weeks,” Wick said during a video call at a UBS Group's event in Singapore on Friday, without specifying the extent of the stake cut.\n\nWick, a veteran technology investor of nearly three decades, compared Nvidia’s current situation to Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) during the dot-com bubble.\n\nWick pointed out that Nvidia derives about 60% to 70% of its revenue from its 10 largest customers, making it “inherently a much riskier company than Microsoft or Google who have very low customer concentration and thousands upon thousands of customers.”\n\nNvidia briefly held the title of the world’s most valuable company this week, with its shares tripling over the past year due to AI optimism. Despite this, many investors, including Wick and Rob Arnott of Research Affiliates, remain skeptical about the rally’s sustainability.\n\nNvidia trades at 43 times its projected earnings for the next year, a valuation higher than all but one of its peers in the Philadelphia Semiconductor Index.\n\nWick, who manages the $13.5 billion Columbia Seligman Technology&Information Fund, also mentioned that generative AI companies, which have invested billions in Nvidia systems, show low returns on invested capital.\n\nHe noted that “many of Nvidia’s largest customers are aggressively designing their own processors,” such as Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT)., and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nFor now, Nvidia remains one of the top holdings in Wick’s fund, which has outperformed 97% of its peers over the past three years, according to Bloomberg data.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nProminent fund manager cuts his Nvidia stake\n\nBoeing nearing deal with Spirit AeroSystems after prolonged negotiations - report\n\nBidders line up for HSBC's German fund administration and custody units, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "content": "During 2023, Coolest Gadgets reported a 31% increase in annual sales of virtual reality (VR) headsets. 2024 is heading in the same direction, with an estimated 14.31 million units sold versus 11.2 million units sold in 2023. This bodes well for long-term metaverse exposure as a VR-enhanced experience across immersive environments and seamless interactions, although some analysts suggest there are specific metaverse stocks to sell.\n\nHowever, only a few companies, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), have the deep pockets to splurge on metaverse content, as Meta’s Reality Labs is still bleeding money. Moreover, although AI is adjacent to the metaverse, it keeps diverting investor attention from various metaverse aspects.\n\nLikewise, the complexity of intellectual property within the virtual environment injects regulatory uncertainty similar to the crypto space. Simultaneously, ManpowerGroup’s survey found that the hiring rate is deteriorating faster than during pre-government lockdowns, with hiring intentions falling by 8% year-over-year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis macro signal elevates the riskiness of metaverse stocks as an emergent market, making it a good idea to revisit your portfolio and see which metaverse stocks to sell at this point.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) An Autodesk (ADSK) sign on an office in Toronto, Canada.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor many years, Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) has been the industry standard for all things related to digital content creation, be it movies, commercials, engineering, architecture or games. As such, Autodesk is one of the base layers for metaverse content creation owing to its 3D modeling and simulation tools.\n\nAutodesk is of particular interest to shareholders, given the recent focus from the Starboard Value activist fund. The fund took a stake in the company worth around $500 million, following the accounting irregularities about Autodesk’s free cash flow and operating margin but leading to no restatement of prior earnings reports.\n\nJeff Smith-run Starboard Value posits that the timing of the probe’s results is suspicious because they came just over a week after the closure of the deadline to nominate the board of directors. As of June 17th, Autodesk responded, noting that “re-opening the advance notice period would not be in the best interests of Autodesk or its shareholders.”\n\nIn this 3-month period, ADSK stock saw turbulent activity, netting a negative 5.5% performance but rallying 9% over the last 30 days. These types of situations typically signal restructuring, costly legal proceedings and investor uncertainty.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a precautionary measure, investors should consider ADSK as one of the metaverse stocks to sell. At the present price of $240.51, ADSK shares are above the 52-week average of $224.50, creating a robust exit point. Regarding Starboard’s positive influence on ADSK stock, shareholders should still think of market downturns given current macro indicators.\n\nDisney (DIS) The Walt Disney Company (DIS) logo\n\nThe entertainment conglomerate Disney (NYSE:DIS) has become synonymous with social engineering activism instead of catering to audiences and its bottom line. Owning multiple IPs and franchises, Disney is the primary source for interactive metaverse expansions.\n\nHowever, the media company regularly causes friction with its audiences, so much so that Florida stripped Disney of its autonomy and special tax status as a reaction to the company’s ideological activism.\n\nAlthough Disney’s umbrella is expansive, the company’s streaming service growth seems to have flatlined, with a revenue increase of just 1.3% in Q2 2024 compared to the year-ago quarter. In other words, despite divided opinions on Disney’s brand of activism, its lack of neutrality ensures its growth plateau.\n\nThis provides an opportunity to sell for investors looking for more promising and business-oriented metaverse exposures. At $101.52, DIS stock is up from its 52-week average of $95.94 and significantly up from its 52-week low point of $78.73 per share.\n\nMatch (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nAs a parent company of popular dating apps like Tinder, Hinge, PlentyOfFish and OkCupid, Match (NASDAQ:MTCH) entered the metaverse landscape in 2021 with the acquisition of Hyperconnect video and social discovery tech firm. Moreover, present CEO Bernard Kim was the president of the mobile gaming company Zynga.\n\nAt face value, this represents a natural expansion into virtual dating, leveraging augmented (AR) and virtual reality (VR). That said, dating app users consistently show a lack of satisfaction with such experiences compared to offline ventures.\n\nOne study from last June pointed to a satisfaction score of 2.39 out of a 4-point scale. For comparison, offline dating was 3.05 on a 5-point scale. Although similar, it varies greatly based on age and motivation and great efficacy divergence between the two sexes.\n\nThe bottom line is, if online dating, bound by algorithms, curtails people’s multidimensionality and people notice this effect, is Match Group’s business model poised for the growth shareholders want?\n\nIn May’s Q1 earnings, the company reported 2% net earnings growth to $123.2 million from the year-ago quarter. At the same time, the cost of revenue increased by 30%. Likewise, Match Group’s operating income margin decreased from 25% to 21%, indicating a downward trend.\n\nIn addition to Match Group showing a cyclical revenue pattern, the stock shows continued valuation loss. MTCH is down 27% year-to-date, settling for $30.54 per share. This is just above its 52-week low of $27.66 per share, making it a solid candidate for cutting investor losses.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "1 Stock to Buy With Ambitions of Becoming the Leading Artificial Intelligence (AI) Company in the World",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has permeated nearly every industry over the last 18 months since the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT.\n\nThere have been several big winners amid the AI arms race. Nvidia is selling its powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) faster than it can make them, leading to massive profits for the chipmaker. Microsoft, an investor in OpenAI, has seen its cloud platform revenue surge amid demand for compute power and access to AI models.\n\nBut one company has been working on advanced AI algorithms for over 15 years and publishing research in the field for the last 10 years. It's made several major advancements in generative AI and large language models, and its CEO believes it can become \"the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\nThis isn't some obscure tech company. You likely use one of its products every day, along with over 3 billion other people. I'm talking about Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), the company behind Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, Messenger, and the Llama 3 large language model. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta's putting its AI to use across all of its products\n\nMeta has been working on AI algorithms for over a decade and a half. It developed a new machine-learning algorithm in the early 2010s to recommend content in users' feeds. AI then powered its advertising business, ensuring the right users saw the right ad at the right time.\n\nMeta developed AI that can understand the things people type on Facebook or Instagram (natural language processing) and the photos users post (computer vision). That helps it understand the content it's showing other users and makes it easier to block hate speech and other violence on its platforms.\n\nMeta's also working on generative AI. Its large language model, Llama, is now on its third version, which is open source. Llama 3 has proven more cost-effective for developers to use than OpenAI's models, but it often falls short of the capabilities of OpenAI's newest GPT-4o model.\n\nMeta integrated its generative AI capabilities into its ad platform, making it easier for marketers to create and test ad campaigns. CEO Mark Zuckerberg says revenue flowing through its AI advertising tools has doubled since last year.\n\nThe Llama 3 model also powers Meta AI, the new AI assistant built into Meta's family of apps. Management reported \"tens of millions\" of users within a week of its launch in April.\n\nMeta's also using generative AI to help creators interact with fans, to help businesses connect with customers, and for its internal development team.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuilding the world's leading AI models won't come cheap\n\nIf you want to train a big large language model to be able to come up with accurate and creative answers to questions, help create winning ad campaigns, or generate realistic photos from a text description, it takes a lot of compute power. That means spending a lot on new GPUs, building new data centers, and paying for all the electricity to run them.\n\nZuckerberg isn't backing down from the high costs associated with his ambition of becoming the leading AI company in the world. \"We should invest significantly more over the coming years to build even more advanced models and the largest scale AI services in the world,\" he said during Meta's first-quarter earnings call.\n\nMeta increased its outlook for this year's capital expenditures from between $30 billion and $37 billion to between $35 billion and $40 billion alongside its Q1 earnings release.\n\nZuckerberg also thinks it's going to take some time for Meta to generate meaningful revenue from its AI efforts. While Meta will integrate its advances in AI across its various products, direct monetization such as advanced business messaging services, ads and paid content within AI interactions, and charging a fee for access to premium AI models (like OpenAI does) won't materialize for years. But he said, \"If the technology and products evolve in the way we hope, each of those will unlock massive amounts of value for people and ... [businesses] for us over time.\"\n\nThe best AI stock to buy right now\n\nMeta remains one of the most attractive AI stocks on the market.\n\nWhile investors initially sent the stock price down following the news that Meta plans to spend billions more than originally planned building out AI data centers, the stock has since recovered. It now trades near its all-time high, but it could still climb higher.\n\nIts forward price-to-earnings of 25.5 gives it a slight premium to the S&P 500. But analysts expect Meta's earnings per share to grow by about 30% per year over the next five years. That growth is supported by a massive share repurchase program. Meta held about $58 billion in cash on its balance sheet at the end of the first quarter, and it could generate another $50 billion in free cash flow this year despite the increase in capital expenditures.\n\nMeta's ambitions in artificial intelligence could propel another period of strong growth for the tech company. At its current share price, it looks like a fair value. And if it builds a big business around its AI models, that could provide significant upside for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "How the psychology of fraud drove a rising DEI star to steal more than $5 million from Meta and Nike: ‘The world is filled with Barbaras’",
        "content": "Good morning, Broadsheet readers! A new bill against AI deepfakes is introduced in the Senate, X CEO Linda Yaccarino eyes sports docuseries, and Fortune writer Lila MacLellan dives into how a rising DEI star stole more than $5 million from Meta and Nike. Have a terrific Thursday.\n\n- The Facebook fraudster. Barbara Furlow-Smiles was once a rising star in DEI at Facebook. Hired in 2017, she spent more than four years leading the company’s employee resource group before taking a job for more money and a bigger title at Nike, where she worked until early 2023. If you’re familiar with her name, however, it’s likely because of what she was doing in the shadows at both firms.\n\nAs I report in a recent Fortune feature, Furlow-Smiles pleaded guilty last December to stealing $4.9 million from the social media giant now called Meta and taking more than $100,000 from Nike. She faces a five-year prison sentence that will begin next month. The FBI found that she had siphoned the money by setting up kickback schemes with both real and invented vendors, and by linking her personal payment apps—like PayPal and Venmo—to the corporate credit card. The fake vendors, the agents found, were friends and family who invoiced Facebook through Furlow-Smiles and then sent some of the money they “earned” back to her in cash.\n\nFurlow-Smiles’s crimes shocked people who knew or worked with her because she was known as an exceptionally conscientious and generous person. Coworkers described her as compassionate and effective. Even after this debacle, one of her former colleagues told me, “I’d hire her.”\n\nAs it turns out, however, generosity was at least part of what brought down the former DEI manager. In a sentencing memo for the judge, her defense team depicted Furlow-Smiles as a brilliant woman who was burdened by a sense that she needed to share her wealth with her family and friends of lesser means. At one previous job, the document stated, she paid what’s known as the “Black tax” by giving out credit cards to family members. “It was ingrained in her that ‘your money is not just your money, [and] your privilege is not just your privilege,’\" the lawyers wrote, quoting their client. “That meant any bonus, and any raise, belonged to the collective.”\n\n“As I got to speak with Barbara more, I realized that the world is filled with Barbaras,” defense lawyer Lance Clarke said at the sentencing hearing.\n\nOne friend of the former Facebook manager told me that once she got past the shock of the news and learned more about what her friend had done, she thought to herself: “That’s Barbara trying to help too many people.” (To be sure, Furlow-Smiles spent some stolen money on what federal prosecutors called a “lavish lifestyle” for herself, her husband, and her young daughter.)\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile her story is unique, it also fits the mold of what financial crime experts call the “fraud triangle” that enables corporate misdeeds: She felt financial pressures, had the capacity to justify taking the money, and saw an opportunity to enrich herself at a company where large amounts of money flowed and—in her telling, according to her lawyers’ sentencing memo—controls were lacking.\n\nRead my full piece here.\n\nLila MacLellan\r\nlila.maclellan@fortune.com\n\nThe Broadsheet is Fortune's newsletter for and about the world's most powerful women.

        "title": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is Reinvesting To Multiply In Value",
        "content": "If you're looking for a multi-bagger, there's a few things to keep an eye out for. Amongst other things, we'll want to see two things; firstly, a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an expansion in the company's amount of capital employed. If you see this, it typically means it's a company with a great business model and plenty of profitable reinvestment opportunities. Ergo, when we looked at the ROCE trends at Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), we liked what we saw.\n\nReturn On Capital Employed (ROCE): What Is It?\n\nFor those who don't know, ROCE is a measure of a company's yearly pre-tax profit (its return), relative to the capital employed in the business. Analysts use this formula to calculate it for Meta Platforms:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.29 = US$56b ÷ (US$223b - US$28b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nThus, Meta Platforms has an ROCE of 29%.  That's a fantastic return and not only that, it outpaces the average of 6.4% earned by companies in a similar industry.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Meta Platforms  roce\n\nAbove you can see how the current ROCE for Meta Platforms compares to its prior returns on capital, but there's only so much you can tell from the past. If you'd like to see what analysts are forecasting going forward, you should check out our free analyst report for Meta Platforms .\n\nSo How Is Meta Platforms' ROCE Trending?\n\nWe'd be pretty happy with returns on capital like Meta Platforms. The company has employed 96% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 29%. With returns that high, it's great that the business can continually reinvest its money at such appealing rates of return. If these trends can continue, it wouldn't surprise us if the company became a multi-bagger.\n\nThe Bottom Line On Meta Platforms' ROCE\n\nIn short, we'd argue Meta Platforms has the makings of a multi-bagger since its been able to compound its capital at very profitable rates of return. On top of that, the stock has rewarded shareholders with a remarkable 167% return to those who've held over the last five years. So while the positive underlying trends may be accounted for by investors, we still think this stock is worth looking into further.\n\nLike most companies, Meta Platforms does come with some risks, and we've found 1 warning sign that you should be aware of.\n\nIf you'd like to see other companies earning high returns, check out our freelist of companies earning high returns with solid balance sheets here.\n\nStory continues\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Amazon's Dr. Angela Shippy wants to help AI transform the healthcare system",
        "content": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning roll out across virtually every sector of the economy, helping fuel the stock market to record highs, the biggest tech companies are racing to bring those efficiencies over to healthcare, a sector that spent $4.5 trillion in 2022.\n\nDr. Angela Shippy, a medical doctor turned executive at Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, is leading the charge for the world's biggest cloud provider. At Houston Medical Center, where Shippy previously saw patients, she now meets with hospital executives to discuss how tech can be incorporated into patient care.\n\n“I have the opportunity to really bridge that gap between what's happening day-to-day within healthcare organizations and technology that can help them really transform and really find the solutions to any pain points that they have,” Shippy said. An Amazon Echo Spot sits among the smart devices being studied in a lab at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass., on Oct. 14, 2021. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nShippy works directly with at least 700 healthcare providers across the country to expand their use of AWS-backed technology.\n\nAmong the tools are AI-powered rooms that transcribe conversations and take notes for doctors, Echo Dot devices that patients can use to order things like ice, and even virtual intensive care services, which decrease burnout in providers by allowing them to focus on patient care.\n\n“If we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow [care providers] to do what they truly love, then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control,” Shippy said.\n\nAWS is not alone in this effort. Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) said this earnings season they are investing another $16 billion in AI this year, a 31% increase from last year.

(Jordan Pettitt/PA Images via Getty Images) (Jordan Pettitt - PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlthough more than half of hospitals' total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field remains challenged by labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff.\n\nBecause of her previous work as a healthcare provider, Shippy is uniquely positioned as fluent in both the medical and tech worlds. Prior to joining AWS, she was the chief medical and quality officer at the Memorial Hermann Health System, where she used her affinity for technology to develop a COVID-19 dashboard at the height of the pandemic.\n\n\"I saw the power of technology, and how it would be used to transform healthcare,\" Shippy said. \"And that's really what made coming to a role like this at AWS possible for me because I saw what that transformation could really lead to.\"\n\nStory continues New technology allows doctors and care providers to interact with a virtual reality 3D heart. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne example of that transformation is a virtual reality headset that projects 3D images. The AWS executive donned the headset, which allowed her to flip and turn the three-dimensional beating heart of a hypothetical patient. “This patient is having a heart attack,” Shippy explained to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe 3D virtual heart is among the more futuristic tools in the hospital, but Shippy sees value in tools across the spectrum of technology. That vision and her experience during the pandemic informed her decision to move from health to tech — a leap of faith for a doctor who decided her career path at just 9 years old.\n\n“When ... somebody like me at 9 years old says, 'I want be a doctor. I want to help people,' that never goes away,” Shippy said. “Being from an underrepresented community or being in a community where maybe healthcare isn't like what you've seen in the Texas Medical Center today, we want to close those gaps.” Lead This Way\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "History Says the Nasdaq Could Soar: 2 AI Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is up 30% over the last 12 months, kicking off a strong bull market. This market enthusiasm has significance for new investors, because the average duration of a bull market historically is 4.9 years, according to investment firm Stifel -- about three times longer than bear markets.\n\nMuch of the growth in the Nasdaq Composite in this bull market is related to enthusiasm for all things connected to artificial intelligence (AI). The potential of this evolving technology has investors and market traders excited. Investors who focus on buying reasonably priced AI growth stocks now could have several years of handsome gains to look forward to. Here are two quality AI growth stocks to buy today.\n\n1. Alphabet (Google)\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is using AI technology it's developing to generate significant improvements across its business, including improving search results for users on multiple platforms it operates and boosting ad performance for advertisers.\n\nAlphabet began investing in generative AI technology in 2016, and its latest iteration is Gemini, a series of AI models it plans to use to lay the groundwork for the company's future. Gemini can generatively process and produce text, images, audio, and video based on user prompts, and the enthusiasm among users is already driving substantial growth for the company.\n\nIt's yet to be seen how these latest AI efforts will actually affect Alphabet's financials, but its prior AI investments over the past two decades definitely help it maintain growth. The already huge tech company reported a year-over-year revenue increase of 15% in the first quarter. It's also keeping tight control of operating costs, which led to robust earnings growth of 61% over the year-ago quarter. The company's strong fundamentals are generating so much excess free cash flow that management felt comfortable implementing its first-ever quarterly dividend of $0.20 per share (which will result in an annual dividend yield of 0.45%) in addition to a $70 billion share repurchase program.\n\nGoogle's ad-based business earns very high margins that will be able to fund a growing dividend for years. The company earned $82 billion of net income on a trailing-12-month basis through Q1 -- up nearly threefold over the last five years.\n\nImportantly, this AI stock offers attractive value, with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23 based on this year's consensus earnings estimate. Analysts expect Alphabet to grow earnings at an annualized rate of 17%, so investors should expect the stock to deliver similar returns.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nAn improving digital advertising market is also boosting the operations of social media giant Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Meta is also a big user of generative AI models, which is driving more relevant content recommendations for users of apps like Facebook and Instagram and boosting ad performance.\n\nIn April, Meta introduced its open-source large language model called Llama 3. Llama is powering the new version of Meta AI, which enables users to get relevant answers across its family of social media platforms, and the positive early feedback suggests it will help Meta's apps drive higher user engagement.\n\nMeta said revenue increased 27% year over year in the first quarter. The strong growth was driven by a combination of a 20% increase in ad impressions and a 6% increase in average price per ad, suggesting advertisers are placing a high value on reaching the company's 3.2 billion daily users across its apps.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta is a highly profitable business that is starting to return capital to shareholders through dividends. Meta currently pays a quarterly dividend of $0.50 per share, bringing the annual yield to 0.4%. Its net profit continues to grow and reached $45 billion over the last year, so it has the makings of a quality dividend growth stock.\n\nThe current Wall Street consensus calls for earnings to grow 18% per year, which could lead to similar returns, as the stock trades at a very reasonable forward P/E of 25.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhen the AI revolution started with the launch of ChatGPT, investors started pouring money into a handful of companies that are leading AI technology development, thanks to their industry position and unending free cash flows. Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we’re all familiar with. Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the “AI Big Ten” group.\n\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P’s large cap index. You can check out the latest list here: 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at the Big 10 AI stocks Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett highlighted in his report. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, as of the end of the March quarter. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) in ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024\n\nPhoto by Alexander Shatov on Unsplash\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is one of the top Big 10 AI stocks highlighted by BofA in its latest report.\n\nWhy is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

Short-term results are naturally volatile, swinging drastically depending on recent economic news. In this setting, even a single piece of unexpected economic news can significantly alter market dynamics, highlighting the uncertainty and randomness inherent in short-term investing.\n\nMoving forward from this volatility, the picture established by the Federal Reserve’s stable interest rates in last week’s meeting and the S&P 500’s robust comeback recently demonstrates a market full of potential and pitfalls.

Its stock has increased by 80% year-over-year (YOY) and a whopping 168% in the past five years, which makes it a solid long-term bet. META now focuses on metaverse and artificial intelligence (AI), allowing it to escalate its value and scale up even more.\n\nDespite losing over $45 billion in Reality Labs since late 2020, Meta remains committed to metaverse innovations. This dedication is clear in its shift from the Workplace app to cutting-edge technologies like Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses.\n\nMoreover, Meta’s release of the open-source AI model Llama 3 showcases its forward-thinking approach. The AI model’s use on platforms like Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp enhances safety and conversation reliability, leading users to learn efficiently from AI technologies.\n\nLastly, META is a lucrative choice for investors with $12.53 billion in free cash flow and a low debt-to-equity ratio of 0.25.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.

This variation fits their broader strategy to expand in the $300 billion high-performance computing market. By doing so, AMD is set to keep cashing for a sustained period.\n\nFinancially, AMD crushed it this quarter, pulling $5.5 billion in revenue, a 47% sales margin, and $123 million in net income.

It has since gown to a $62 billion valuation and amassed 615 million users globally.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company hopes to continue this upward trajectory by actively expanding its subscriber base and creating new avenues for advertising on its platform. In its efforts to drive this innovation, Spotify recently announced a hike in its membership prices. The news was well-received by analysts who praised the move.\n\nMorgan Stanley’s Benjamin Swinburne remains optimistic about the stock’s performance giving it a $370 price target. Also, Guggenheim analyst Michael Morris shares a similar sentiment and has maintained a buy rating on this stock since March 2023.

These investments are expected to yield long-term returns for the company.\n\nMeta Platform’s diverse offering and strong market presence have led several analysts to rate the stock as a strong buy. Following Q1 earnings, Goldman Sachs’ Eric Sheridan maintained a buy rating on the stock. He remains confident in META’s leadership to navigate investment cycles despite short-term volatility.

        "title": "The Largest Company in the US",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 50 Largest Companies in Every State in the US, and in this article we will look at the largest company.\n\nEconomy of  US\n\nThe United States holds the title of the largest economy in the world, according to the IMF in 2024 the United States had a GDP of approximately $28.78 trillion, a GDP per capita of around $85,370, and an annual GDP growth rate of 2.7%. In 2025, GDP is expected to rise to $29.84 trillion whereas GDP per capita is expected to rise around $87,980. The United States possesses a large and skilled labor force, a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit along with highly diversified companies in technology, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment which generate productivity and economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency and is used to facilitate international trade and investment.\n\nCertain regions in the United States stand out as hubs of economic power and innovation. Silicon Valley in the San Franciso Bay Area, California has long been the hub of technological innovation in software, hardware, and biotechnology. Some of the largest tech giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) among many others are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Wall Street, the financial district in Lower Manhattan in New York City on the other side is home to major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Wall Street serves as the center of the world's financial markets and facilitates the flow of capital, investments, and trading activities on a massive scale. In recent years, there has been a notable trend of companies relocating from high-tax states to low-tax states in pursuit of cost savings and favorable business environments. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are some of the largest companies that moved their incorporations from California to Texas. According to CNBC, more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Delaware. Delaware is one of the top choices for corporations due to their business-friendly policies, lower taxes, reduced regulation, and incentives for relocation. Delaware has a strategic location and its corporate law is highly developed, the state's Court of Chancery, a specialized court for business disputes, is known for its efficient resolution of legal cases. It allows businesses to maintain confidentiality and offers incentives for relocation such as tax credits, grants, and loans. Delaware does not have a state sales tax, and its corporate income tax of 8.7% is considered one of the lowest in the United States. You can also take a look at 15 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Rates in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargest Company in the US\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a globally recognized company known for its software products, such as the Windows operating system and Office productivity tools. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure AI has also continued to lead in innovation by offering advanced APIs and models that are revolutionizing industries with its responsible AI solutions that facilitate the creation, reception, and interaction with images, videos, and audio. Azure's market share is expanding due to its extensive portfolio of AI and cloud services. Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 53,000 customers now use the Azure OpenAI Service. The introduction of the Models as a Service API and partnerships with Nvidia and AMD for AI hardware accelerators are significantly boosting the growth of Microsoft's cloud business. Additionally, Microsoft's Copilot offerings, integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, are transforming productivity and democratizing AI-powered capabilities, further increasing Microsoft's share in office productivity tools.\n\nAzure AI Services has also impacted the legal industry by efficiently managing and analyzing vast amounts of data in the fast-paced legal environment and the legal field is highly exposed to the effects of new AI technologies. With traditional data sources like emails and documents now supplemented by complex data types such as chat data and video recordings, legal teams face significant challenges. AI is increasingly used to streamline processes, reduce risks, and boost efficiency. Companies like Icertis, Relativity, and Clifford Chance are at the forefront of integrating AI into their operations by leveraging Azure AI Services to enhance contract management, e-discovery, and overall legal service delivery. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) commitment to responsible AI, ensuring data privacy, security, and governance highlights how AI advancements are driving growth, productivity, and innovation across industries.\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that its revenue for the three months ended March 31, increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion and net income increased by 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. The company’s Azure and cloud services revenue increased 31% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue amounted to $35.1 billion.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley, leads the world in technology and innovation and New York’s Wall Street serves as the global hub for banking, investments, and trading, each state in the United States possesses its own unique strengths and specialties. With this context, let’s take a look at the list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US. The Largest Company in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US, we scanned the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners to find the largest companies by market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024. Then we checked where the headquarters of these companies are located. To quantify the \"value\" or \"size\" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to the availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. We have ranked the 50 largest companies in every state in the US in ascending order of largest companies incorporated in that state according to their market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "content": "The augmented reality (AR) market is expanding rapidly, set to be worth $50.25 billion in 2024 and expected to expand 35% annually to $570.79 billion by 2032. AR stocks will continue to attract attention due to the astronomical value proposition on offer as the sector grows. Due to U.S. government funding and immersive technology expenditures, North America is expected to dominate the industry.\n\nCompanies are increasingly adding AR to a wide range of products and services. As an example, ActiveLookhas connected its micro-projection technology to the CrewNerd app so that rowers can see their real-time AR success data. The official AmazeVR Concerts app also launched with a special concert by Zara Larsson, showing how AR can be used in entertainment.​\n\nFurthermore, during its Worldwide Developers Conference 2024 event, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently showed off new features for its Vision Pro AR device. These features could help the gadget become more popular with regular people; Apple thinks that between 500,000 and 600,000 Vision Pros will sell this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is updating HoloLens with AR functionality and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues innovating in AR by overhauling its Quest 3 headset.\n\nThe latest industry moves and multi-billion dollar market size will inevitably lead to more investors searching for AR stocks. Itt’s a savvy move, so let’s explore some that are getting plenty of analyst love.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the Magnificent Seven equities, is now the most valuable firm in the world after growing 239% in 2023 and 181% this year. NVDA has numerous business lines, including AR.\n\nAt Computex 2024, NVDA demonstrated better AR immersion with RTX computers powered by artificial intelligence (AI). With these advancements, developers may leverage Nvidia’s AI-AR technique to create more engaging AR applications.\n\nNvidia’s Omniverse offers CloudXR virtual reality (VR) add-ons. AR devices provide and receive 3D data and position virtual objects in real life. Professionals may immerse themselves with graphics and industrial AR. Foxconn builds digital twins and improves robotic facilities utilizing Nvidia’s Omniverse, Isaac and Metropolis platforms to further industrial digitalization.\n\nNvidia’s CloudXR software allows mobile devices to enjoy high-fidelity AR and VR. GPU virtualization and Nvidia RTX servers let CloudXR distribute complex AR applications across 5G and Wi-Fi.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop PC manufacturers are building AI factories using Nvidia’s MGX flexible reference design tool. Spectrum-X Ethernet improved the AI task network, speeding AI solution processing and delivery. Furthermore, Nvidia microservices improve gene analysis, pictures and surgical robots with AI.\n\nOverall, creative AI applications are simpler to design and utilize with NVIDIA NIM. Building AI applications is simpler with its inference APIs, which execute models effectively in containers, making NVDA one of the best AR stocks out there.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is coming off substantial momentum in recent months, thanks to declaring its first-ever dividend of 20 cents per share, greenlighting the buyback of an additional $70 billion in stock and posting better-than-expected first-quarter results. All the while it has been pursuing its AR ambitions, making it one of the top stocks in the field.\n\nAlphabet’s interest in AR is not new. It purchased Raxium to improve its AR capabilities and strengthen Google’s market position by integrating advanced display technology with its AR goods and services. In addition, Alphabet is actively working on providing high-fidelity AR experiences across devices for the company. These initiatives enable developers and companies to build more engaging AR applications.\n\nA recent strategic technical alliance between Magic Leap and Google has increased the commercial use of AR solutions based on Magic Leap’s excellent AR technology and Google’s software and cloud services. Google is also experimenting with YouTube’s creative AI, leveraging powerful AI to make videos easier to produce and view. Additionally, AI21 Labs and Google Cloud are adding creative AI tools to BigQuery to accelerate data processing.​\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM), for the first time in a while, is trading at a very attractive valuation after falling 31% this year. Much of that loss came after posting weaker than expected earnings and outlook.\n\nHowever, investors who are bullish on AR stocks should remember that Symbotic made Fast Company’s list of the 2024 World’s Most Innovative Companies because of how it uses robots and AI in the supply chain. This includes the self-driving SymBot robot, which makes things faster, more flexible and more efficient while also dropping costs. Other features include those that work with AR technology to make logistics processes easier to see and automate.\n\nSymbotic has persisted in growing its alliances, most notably via its joint venture with GreenBox. Although there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with this project that might affect its performance, the goal is to improve their outsourcing skills.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the earnings report that caused SYM to dip did have some notable positive beats, with second-quarter sales increasing to $424 million with adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. In the last four quarters, SYM has surpassed Wall Street estimates three times, cementing its place among top AR stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "It’s been a few years since we heard about the metaverse as a hot theme of investment. Undoubtedly, virtual, augmented and mixed reality seems to have nothing on generative artificial intelligence (gen AI). And though the metaverse may very well represent the next big leap in computing, I’m still not sure just how many people will be willing to spend hundreds or, for higher-end headsets, thousands on a device that one may not even know how to utilize fully.\n\nFurther, we don’t know if we’ll be consistent users of headsets or if they’ll sit on the shelf all day as we continue to use devices we’ve grown used to over the past few decades. Undoubtedly, there’s a great deal of risk for consumers when shelling out a big chunk of cash on a device whose future is highly uncertain.\n\nIt’s up to the spatial computing pioneers to convince us to pay to plug into the metaverse. And until the hardware and software are in the right spot, the metaverse may be a somewhat abstract term for most people, perhaps akin to gen AI before ChatGPT. Regardless, here are some metaverse stocks to buy now for investors who believe that technology is the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, still desire to invest in the future of the metaverse, even though gen AI and other priorities have taken hold in recent years. Undoubtedly, the company has invested billions in creating the metaverse and will need to contribute billions more before Meta Quest headsets become as used as PCs.\n\nThough the metaverse headlines have stopped coming in at a rapid pace, while investors cool on the trend at large, I still view the metaverse as one of the biggest growth drivers for Meta over the next 20 years. Perhaps Meta’s gen AI expertise and its vast trove of data resources could help accelerate progress on the metaverse in the next 10 years.\n\nIn any case, META stock stands out as thinking at least a decade ahead of the rest of us when it comes to mixed reality and the metaverse. When metaverse active users stand to really take off, though, remains the big unknown.\n\nFor now, it’s not yet certain that the metaverse will be the next big technological marvel. If it is, I expect Meta will play a big part in the new market, which could see the next generation plug into worlds we cannot even begin to fathom.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) is a popular video game developer recently touted as an attractive metaverse play by analysts over at Macquarie. With RBLX stock in a rough spot, down more than 73% from its 2021 all-time highs, the intriguing metaverse pure-play certainly seems intriguing while it’s still grounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Macquarie is a fan of the socialization aspect. Undoubtedly, the metaverse isn’t just about gaming; it’s about interacting with friends in a so-called third space. And while third spaces may be declining realms of the physical, I do see their rise in the virtual realm as providing a long-term boon for Roblox.\n\nIndeed, Roblox’s social and experiential aspects are nothing new to investors. Arguably, Roblox and Meta Platforms are going after the same holy grail: becoming the go-to “place” to interact with friends and loved ones. With a modest $23 billion market cap, perhaps investors are underestimating the firm’s growth.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just loves to give its unique take on various emerging technologies while steering clear of buzzwords. Whether we’re talking about limited use of the buzzy word “AI,” even during its latest unveiling of Apple Intelligence, or not using the term “metaverse” when referencing the potential of its Vision Pro spatial computer, Apple just loves to live up to its motto of thinking differently.\n\nWith regard to the metaverse, perhaps Apple is smart to distance itself from Meta Platforms, a firm that pretty much coined the term. Either way, Apple is an impressive play on mixed reality, even though we’re more hyped up about Apple Intelligence rather than the Vision Pro, a profound device many investors don’t seem to care much about any longer.\n\nWith the Apple Vision Pro device slated to hit new international markets this summer, it will be fascinating to see if the first iteration of the product will be met with upbeat demand. Specifically, China and Japan are top markets to watch closely as the device nears its launch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "title": "7 Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Small-cap stocks tend to outperform their larger brethren over time. Coming out of the pandemic, the Russell 2000 small-cap index was handily beating the barometer of the 500 largest stocks on the market.\n\nHowever, after government spending caused inflation to rise to its highest levels in 40 years, the Federal Reserve enacted an unprecedented series of 11 hikes in interest rates. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed Funds rate rose from 0% to between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it stands today.\n\nThe effect was devastating on small-cap stocks. Because small companies don’t have the same financial resources as their large-cap stocks, their borrowing costs soar, causing a hit to their bottom line. It took a toll on businesses. The Russell 2000 went from matching the performance of the S&P 500 throughout 2022 to falling behind beginning in March 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOver the past 15 months, the broad market index returned more than 25% compared to just 7.4% for their smaller cousins. This year the Russell 2000 is basically at break-even, while the S&P 500 is up 15%.\n\nBut the following seven Russell 2000 stocks to buy now hold the promise of not only outperforming their index but also their bigger siblings.\n\nPaysafe (PSFE) Paysafe (PSFE) Card Apple Store Apps on Iphone Screen on a Wooden Summer Floor with Aces Card and Green Climbing Plants\n\nSource: Devina Saputri / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments processor for the entertainment industry Paysafe (NYSE:PSFE) is the first small-cap stock to buy. Almost a year ago I highlighted it as a company to consider for a breakout performance.\n\nAlthough the payments space is crowded with larger, better-financed peers like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block (NYSE:SQ). Paysafe reorganized its business and zeroed in on a niche market. It primarily targets online sports, casino games, poker and video gaming, as well as the hospitality industry and cryptocurrencies.\n\nI noted Paysafe’s business was gaining traction and its stock is up 43% since then. Its shares trade under $18, up 38% this year alone. And PSFE stock is still a bargain. Wall Street forecasted earnings to grow 163.8% next year, and shares go for just 17x forward p/e earnings. It also trades at a fraction of its sales and an incredible 3x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces.\n\nAnalysts have a $25.02 per share one-year price target on the stock, implying 43% more upside, and Paysafe stock may not stop there.\n\nQXO (QXO) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration.

He might not be a household name, but he is brilliantly successful as a serial kingmaker. Jacobs took United Rentals (NYSE:URI) from a small equipment rental company to the national stage by buying up smaller rental shops. He did the same thing with United Waste Systems until he sold it to trash-hauling giant Waste Management (NYSE:WM) for $2.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobs also turned Express-1 Expedited Solutions into the massive logistics powerhouse known as XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO). He subsequently spun off both RXO (NYSE:RXO) and GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO) from XPO, respectively, turning them into some of the largest trucking and logistics businesses in their own right. Now he is doing it again.\n\nJacobs recently invested $1 billion in SilverSun Technologies and rebranded it as QXO (NYSE:QXO). I’m sensing a pattern here. He is breaking into the $800 billion building products distribution market and will use his proven strategy of rolling up the industry under QXO’s umbrella. Jacobs said he expects “to achieve a revenue run-rate of at least $1 billion by the end of year one, at least $5 billion within three years, and tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.”\n\nAs everything Jacobs touches turns to gold, I expect he will be wildly successful with QXO. What happens when he runs out of letters to tack onto his companies, however, remains to be seen.\n\nRackspace Technology (RXT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nCloud computing platform Rackspace Technology (NASDAQ:RXT) is benefiting from the rush by businesses to put their data in the cloud. It is also enhanced by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), giving its hybrid and multi-cloud platform greater resonance with customers.\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, it launched a new AI unit called Foundry for Generative AI by Rackspace (FAIR). Its purpose was to provide a comprehensive set of generative AI solutions across multiple cloud computing platforms. It then partnered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to give Rackspace customers access to Google Cloud’s portfolio of generative AI tools.\n\nRackspace Technology is a company in transition as it stumbled when competing against the likes of Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as cloud services grew. It considered going private in 2022 but couldn’t find a buyer. It ultimately reorganized itself into a services-led sales business and is now gaining traction.\n\nAlthough sales were down year-over-year (YOY), it handily beat estimates, and the stock is marching higher. Shares are up 26% this year and have more than doubled from their 52-week low. Rackspace Technology is proving it has more growth in the cards.\n\nTutor Perini (TPC) An image of a blurry magnifying glass lens focusing on a screen displaying a white box with a grey top outline and a green bottom outline with the text \"Tutor Perini\" in a grey and green font.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nTutor Perini (NYSE:TPC) is the third-largest construction and engineering firm in the country behind its two better-known peers Jacobs Solutions (NYSE:J) and AECOM (NYSE:ACM). Yet, at a market cap of just $1.1 billion, it is one-tenth the size. It generated $3.9 billion in revenue last year or about one-tenth of what Jacobs produces in one quarter.\n\nBusiness is booming, though. Revenue surged 35% in the first quarter to $1.05 billion, and its backlog of projects grew to $10 billion, up 26% year over year. It forecasts equally strong backlog growth for the full year and all of 2025.\n\nSpurred, in part, by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Tutor Perini has been winning contracts for complex megaprojects that other contractors can’t handle and don’t bid on. That allows it to demand partial payment of the contracts upfront, forcing the client to finance the cost of labor and materials from Day 1. It helped the construction and engineering firm post a $15.8 million profit in the first quarter compared to a $49 million loss a year ago.\n\nTutor Perini stock is up 136% so far this year and has tripled over the last 12 months. Despite the gains, with such a backlog of projects in the pipeline, TPC stock can build on its gains and grow even more.\n\nRocky Brands (RCKY) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nFootwear manufacturer Rocky Brands (NASDAQ:RCKY) owns well-known shoe and boot brands, including its namesake banner Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango and the Original Muck Boot Company. It is another stock trying to make a turnaround, and there are signs it may be successful.\n\nRocky reported first-quarter earnings in May that showed a 2.2% rise in sales to $113 million on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, though, excluding the Servus brand it divested in March 2023, revenues jumped 7.6%. Even better, operating profits surged 90% YOY to $8 million. That led to net profits of $2.6 million or 34 cents per share. It was a big reversal from the losses recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nThe footwear maker spent most of 2023 shoring up its financials by reducing inventories and paying down debt. Rocky Brands is now in a much better position than last year or even at the start of 2024. The market is starting to catch on to its resurgence, and shares are up 26% this year. Rocky Brands stock is 81% over the last 12 months and has more than tripled from its 52-week low.\n\nNow that it has greater freedom of movement, expect Rocky Brands to take it to the next level.\n\nConsol Energy (CEIX) A man holds coal in his hands over a pile of more coal.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFew industries have been as vilified as coal, and politicians have been promising to bankrupt producers for years. Over the past decade, the number of coal-fired power plants was cut in half. The Energy Information Administration says 557 coal plants were operating in 2012 but fell to 242 in 2022, the last year data is available.\n\nDespite coal being a cheap and plentiful source of energy, policies prefer so-called cleaner forms, primarily natural gas. That has weighed on coal producers like Consol Energy (NYSE:CEIX), which operates the largest underground coal mine in the United States. Consol’s Pennsylvania Mining Complex is really a series of three underground mines.\n\nConsol also operates a marine terminal in the Port of Baltimore. The port was recently in the news because of a cargo ship that rammed the bridge spanning the waterway, causing it to collapse and block ocean-going traffic.\n\nThat was hard for Consol because its coal shipments bound for international markets ship from there. But the waterway was reopened in May, and Consol began moving coal once again.\n\nAlthough Consol stock is down 5% year-to-date, shares are up 55% from their 12-month lows and will be steaming higher still.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBefore the arrival of artificial intelligence, one of the premier technologies people considered was haptics, or the ability to use touch to provide sensory feedback to technology users. The digital keyboard on your smartphone, for example, is possible because of haptics, as are the vibrations it emits when someone calls. Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is one of the leading providers of haptics technology that it licenses to some of the biggest names in tech today.\n\nMost recently, Immersion renewed its license agreement with Samsung for its devices. Previously it did so with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for use in their respective gaming systems, hardware, software and virtual reality products. Because haptics is so ubiquitous and commonplace, we hardly even consider it anymore. One day, AI will likely be the same.\n\nImmersion’s first-quarter revenue soared to almost $44 million from $7 million last year. While not even the company expects that kind of performance to repeat, chairman and CEO Eric Singer says, “Immersion is operating from a position of strength as we work to protect and monetize our intellectual property.”\n\nProfits also more than doubled during the quarter to 59 cents per share from 25 cents. Immersion made its seventh quarterly dividend payment of 4.5 cents. Shares are up 54% in 2024, but almost all of the gains came since May 1. Trading just under $11 a share, Immersion stock is an affordable entry into this newly strengthened tech player.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When it comes to investing, there’s no telling which of the best growth stocks to buy could yield the most profit. However, there are patterns in the market, and studying these patterns will, more often than not, help you generate massive profits. An example is investing in growth stocks, particularly those consistently outperforming the S&P 500.\n\nIn fact, possessing a growth stock has been proven to yield massive returns and boost investor portfolios countless times — so much so that it has become a popular investor tactic.  There is much upside to holding a growth stock long-term, as these investments have the potential to grow massively as the years go by.\n\nHere’s everything you need to know about the three best growth stocks that every investor looking for stocks to buy should consider going into the second half of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a global giant in the digital payments sector. The company is most notable for producing credit and debit cards and a host of other products that make global payments quick and seamless. It recently announced plans to integrate the Solana blockchain to power fast and efficient crypto transactions for its users.\n\nOn the financial front, Visa is performing exceedingly well. According to its latest quarterly report, the company is up across key metrics like net revenue, GAAP earnings per share, and non-GAAP earnings per share.\n\nAdditionally, Visa’s overall payments and cross-border payments volume grew by 8% and 16%, respectively. This momentum is expected to continue for the remainder of the year.\n\nVisa’s performance this year will be no surprise to spectators who have followed the company over the last few years. Last year alone, it handled over $10 trillion in payments across 276 billion transactions. Despite this, Visa is still growing and has begun expanding into emerging markets. This could see its stock significantly over the next few years.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) tmobile (TMUS) logo on an office building facade\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) is a mobile communications giant that has spent the better part of the last decade expanding its customer base, investing in network infrastructure, and obtaining spectrum licenses. The results of all that work are now showing in the market.\n\nFor instance, T-Mobile executives estimate it will produce $16.9 billion in free cash this year alone. The company has been at the end of some recent developments suggesting this will most definitely happen. For example, last month, it announced plans to purchase all of U.S. Cellular’s wireless operations for around $4.4 billion. This includes all their stores and customers too.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrom all indications, T-Mobile is set to have an impressive year financially. After including home internet as part of its services, the company has over 20 million registered postpaid accounts and over five million home internet connections. It’s easy to see why it is a growth stock that every investor should consider going into the second half of the year.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is the parent company for some of the world’s biggest and most popular social media platforms, including Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp. This will put the company’s monthly users somewhere around four billion, a very attractive factor for investors, advertisers, and spectators alike.\n\nAdvertisers are especially drawn to the reach of Meta and its subsidiaries. According to Meta’s first quarter report, advertisers spent around $35 billion running ads on Meta’s platforms. There were also significant increases across key metrics, such as daily active users, revenue, and costs and expenses. All indications point towards a highly profitable year for Meta, which will surely reflect on its stock.\n\nFurthermore, Meta has announced some developments that could greatly impact its share price. The company has made significant investments in artificial intelligence over the last few years, investments that could start to reap rewards shortly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Lim did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "By Jonathan Stempel\n\n(Reuters) - A U.S. judge rejected Meta Platforms' bid to dismiss a lawsuit by billionaire Australian mining magnate Andrew Forrest over scam Facebook advertisements that show him promoting fake cryptocurrency and other fraudulent investments.\n\nIn a decision on Monday, U.S. District Judge Casey Pitts in San Jose, California said Australia's second-richest person can try to prove that Meta's negligence in allowing the ads breached its duty to operate in a commercially reasonable manner.\n\nForrest can also try to prove that his name and likeness was misappropriated by Meta, and not just by fraudsters behind the bogus ads.\n\n\"Dr. Forrest claims that Meta profited more from ads that included his likeness than it would have if the ads had not,\" Pitts wrote. \"This is enough to adequately plead that the alleged misappropriation was to Meta's advantage.\"\n\nLawyers for Meta declined to comment on Tuesday.\n\nThe Palo Alto, California-based company had argued that Section 230 of the federal Communications Decency Act immunized it from liability as a publisher of third-party content.\n\nBut the judge said Forrest's claims \"present a factual dispute regarding whether Meta's ad systems were neutral tools that anyone could use (or misuse) or whether the tools themselves contributed to the content of the ads.\"\n\nForrest said more than 1,000 of the ads appeared on Facebook in Australia between April and November 2023, leading to millions of dollars in losses for victims.\n\nThe 62-year-old is executive chairman of iron ore producer Fortescue Metals Group, and with his family is worth US$16.5 billion (AUD$24.8 billion), according to Forbes magazine.\n\nIn a statement, Forrest said Pitts' decision was the first where a social media company was unable to invoke Section 230 immunity in a U.S. civil case over its advertising business.\n\n\"This is a crucial strategic victory in the battle to hold Facebook accountable,\" he said.\n\nForrest is seeking compensatory and punitive damages.\n\nIn April, Australian prosecutors declined to pursue criminal charges that he brought against Meta in that country over scam cryptocurrency ads.\n\nForrest had sued under Australian laws that let individuals criminally prosecute foreign companies upon receiving prosecutors' consent.\n\nThe case is Forrest v Facebook Inc et al, U.S. District Court, Northern District of California, No. 22-03699.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Stempel in New York; Editing by Marguerita Choy)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 7 Blue-Chip Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "It is a great time to look for blue-chip stocks to buy. Buying and holding reliable companies can result in steady returns without stress. You don’t have to actively monitor price fluctuations or swing trade to generate massive profits in the stock market. Time in the market instead of timing the market can work wonders, but you have to pick the right stocks.\n\nSome blue-chip stocks offer a good mix of stability and growth. It’s possible to outperform the stock market by comparing blue-chip stocks and strategically constructing your portfolio, but what should you look for? While each investor has different philosophies, it’s good to look for companies that can deliver rising revenue and profit margins. Corporations with vast competitive moats are also less likely to lose market share or get replaced entirely.\n\nYou don’t have to find moonshot stocks to accumulate solid gains. Here are the blue-chip stocks to buy that can continue to gain momentum and reward patient investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Meta Platforms (META) A character inside a virtual world. Metaverse.\n\nSource: Led Gapline / Shutterstock\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has become a compelling leader in the advertising industry after a commitment to efficiency. Net income more than doubled year-over-year in Q1 2024 while revenue jumped by 27% year-over-year. Investors have accumulated positions in the social media giant due to the solid financials. Shares are up by 46% year-to-date and have gained 164% over the past five years. Thus, I think it is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nThe company’s continued user base growth should spark additional revenue growth. Daily active users across Meta Platforms’ social networks reached 3.24 billion, up 7% year-over-year. A few months ago, the company generated many headlines for offering its first dividend. Meta Platforms distributed $1.27 billion to investors via dividends and repurchased $14.64 billion of shares.\n\nMeta Platforms’ growth comes amid significant cost-cutting measures. The company’s headcount is down by 10% year-over-year, and more cuts can come. Meta Platforms recently announced that it will trim the number of VP positions.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) Broadcom Stock Is a Winner With Big Upside Potential\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has been on a tear. Shares are up by 60% year-to-date and have soared by 533% over the past five years. The chipmaker has been a semiconductor leader for many years, and recent AI chips have accelerated revenue.\n\nBroadcom reported $12.5 billion in Q2 2024 revenue, a 43% improvement from the same quarter last year. Revenue from AI products reached a record $3.1 billion in the quarter, while Infrastructure revenue also accelerated due to VMware. Revenue was up by 12% year-over-year, excluding VMware.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chipmaker recently attracted more investors with its 10-for-1 stock split. Broadcom is following in Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) footsteps with the split that has generated more interest for the stock. Broadcom currently has a market cap above $800 billion, and it’s realistic for the company to surpass the $1 trillion milestone this year or the next. While investors wait for that milestone, they enjoy a 1.21% yield and an impressive dividend growth rate.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Microsoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has branched out into many industries and might as well be a fund at this point. The company is leading high-growth verticals like cloud computing, artificial intelligence, business software, social media, advertising, gaming, and others.\n\nIt has a chorus of supporters on Wall Street. Analysts have rated the stock as a Strong Buy with an average price target that suggests a 13% upside. The highest price target of $600 per share implies that shares can march 35% higher from current levels.\n\nMicrosoft has been delivering solid quarters for years, and Q3 FY24 was no different. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year, while net income increased by 20% year-over-year. Microsoft Copilot allows the firm to strengthen its product line across multiple industries, which should lead to additional revenue. Copilot for Security is an example of this trend, and it positions Microsoft to gain more market share in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nVisa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNot every blue-chip stock is a flashy tech company. Many of these stocks are hidden in plain sight. Whenever you use a credit or debit card to buy goods or services, the company creating those cards receives a small percentage of the transaction.\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that regularly generates net profit margins above 50%. The fintech stock is up 5% year-to-date and has gained 56% over the past five years. It trades at a 33 P/E ratio and offers a 0.77% yield. While the yield is low, Visa has maintained a double-digit dividend growth rate for over a decade.\n\nWall Street analysts liked the stock and gave it a consensus Strong Buy rating. The average price target implies a 17% gain from current levels. As consumers remained resilient, Visa delivered 10% year-over-year revenue and net income growth in Q2 FY24. These growth rates give Visa plenty of capital for stock buybacks and dividend distributions.\n\nBlue-Chip Stocks to Buy: Chipotle (CMG) Chipotle - Sign on building, CMG stock\n\nSource: Retail Photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeople need to eat, but not everyone has the time or patience to make meals from home. Fast-food restaurants have capitalized on this trend, but the industry is shifting. More consumers are becoming health-conscious, which has put some of the most established fast-food restaurant chains at risk of declining growth.\n\nLuckily, those problems don’t affect Chipotle (NYSE:CMG), a top restaurant chain known for healthier food options than most competitors. Chipotle has repeatedly raised prices while retaining customers and delivering higher profit margins.\n\nThe Mexican Grill chain reported 14.1% year-over-year growth, with net sales at $2.7 billion. Some of that growth is due to Chipotle’s new restaurant openings, but comparable restaurant sales were up by 7.0% year-over-year. Chipotle remains on target to open 285-315 new restaurants in 2024, increasing the likelihood of double-digit revenue growth rates. Net income was up by 23.2% year-over-year. As such, I think it is one of the best blue-chip stocks to buy.\n\nCommVault Systems (CVLT) Techy looking chip on circuit board with \"blue chip stocks\" engraved in blue light on semiconductor chip\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Mahambah\n\nCommVault Systems (NASDAQ:CVLT) is a cloud security firm with a 31 P/E ratio and a $5 billion market cap. The Russell 2000 member is relatively hidden compared to other cybersecurity companies, but it has the potential to outperform many of them.\n\nCommVault Systems has outperformed the stock market in recent years. Shares are up by 51% year-to-date and have gained 139% over the past five years. CommVault Systems should continue to generate additional gains as its annual recurring revenue (ARR) picks up. The firm currently has $770 million in total ARR, up by 16% year-over-year. Subscription ARR reached $597 million and is up by 25% year-over-year. Success with annual recurring revenue should translate into accelerating growth rates for revenue and net income.\n\nInvestors saw both of those outcomes in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024. Full-year revenue increased by 7% year-over-year while Q4 FY24 revenue was up by 10% year-over-year. Net income came to $23.1 million if we exclude an income tax windfall. If we exclude tax benefits, that’s compared to $83.6 million in full-year revenue. 27.6% of the company’s total profits came in the last quarter. It represents accelerated growth which can translate into meaningful long-term gains.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) provides business safety equipment and supplies for more than one million North American businesses. The company regularly reports double-digit net profit margins and has been crushing the stock market. Shares are up by 18% year-to-date and have roughly tripled over the past five years.\n\nCintas currently trades at a 48 P/E ratio and offers a 0.79% yield. The firm has maintained a double-digit annualized dividend growth rate for several years and has regularly returned capital to its investors. Cintas’ Q3 FY24 earnings results suggest it should have no issue providing shareholders with additional capital and long-term growth. Revenue increased by 9.9% year-over-year to reach $2.41 billion. Net income totaled $397.6 million, a 22.0% improvement compared to last year’s quarter.\n\nWall Street analysts have mostly rated Cintas as a Moderate Buy, with a projected 4% upside from current levels. The highest price target of $790 per share indicates that Cintas can gain an additional 13.5%.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in AVGO, MSFT, and CVLT.

        "title": "AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has experienced a significant surge so far this year, pushing the stock to nearly a 40% premium over its previous peak set in 2021, primarily due to its comeback in the social media advertising space after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Tracking Transparency update, which had severely impacted its targeting capabilities.\n\nFigure 1: Meta Platforms' shares up 44% year to date\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nDespite this recovery, the first-quarter earnings season has generally been disappointing, and investors have found few reasons to chase market highs, resulting in Meta's stock plummeting by over 13% post-earnings report. The social media giant's decision to increase its capital expenditure outlook for the year without a corresponding uptick in growth led to investor skepticism about the efficiency of its spending. Meta's operational expenses are now projected to be between $96 billion and $99 billion, a $2 billion increase at the low end of the previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion. This new range represents a 9% year-over-year increase in operating expenses compared to $88.20 billion in 2023.\n\nRegardless of these challenges, I believe Meta's updated fundamentals and its position as a leader in adopting artificial intelligence transformation support a positive long-term growth and margin expansion trajectory. This outlook underpins its valuation prospects and maintains a robust outlook for the company, even with the unexpected capital expenditure increase. Although Meta's earnings dropped by double digits, the stock is still up more than 40% year to date. This recent dip presents a substantial opportunity for investors to buy into the Meta rally if they have not already.\n\nAdvertising business recovery fueled by AI investments\n\nMuch of Meta's $70 billion capital expenditure over the past two years, in addition to its research and development efforts, has been directed toward the development and deployment of AI technologies. These investments have paid off significantly. The recovery Meta experienced following Apple's ATT update in 2022 can be largely attributed to its AI initiatives, which helped restore its targeting capabilities and sustain its advertising business. As one of the tech giants with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion, Meta continues to grow its revenue at an impressive rate of over 20% annually. As a growth stock, it is logical for Meta to continue channeling resources into further growth initiatives.\n\nRecent industry data highlights the impact of Meta's AI investments. More than half of the content viewed by Instagram users is now recommended by AI algorithms. A survey revealed that 53% of Facebook and Instagram users spent more time on these apps compared to last year, whereas TikTok reported a 25% increase in user engagement over the same period. This underscores the effectiveness of Meta's AI in enhancing user engagement. Additionally, the company has consistently improved return on ad spend (ROAS) for advertisers through AI-enabled tools. The number of ad impressions served increased by 20% year over year and the average price per ad rose by 6%, reversing previous downward trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nFigure 2: Ad impressions growth year over year AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nFigure 3: Average price per ad growth year over year AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nLooking forward, Meta's ongoing commitment to AI developments is expected to bolster its strategy for monetizing its extensive user and merchant base. The company is also advancing its next-generation Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), following in the footsteps of other tech giants who are enhancing their in-house silicon capabilities to reduce dependency on third-party hardware essential for AI advancements. This development complements Meta's AI investment cycle, which includes acquiring up to 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPUs. Continued vertical integration and diversified hardware reliance are anticipated to support the long-term success of its AI strategy and drive margin expansion at scale.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nMeta continues to see an increase in daily active users across its platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. With 3.24 billion daily users, the social media giant boasts one of the strongest network effects in the industry. The company has not only rebounded in user activity, but has also achieved robust growth. From first-quarter 2022 to first-quarter 2023, Meta's monthly active users grew by 15 million. From the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, this number increased by 22 million, marking almost a 50% rise in growth. This is particularly impressive considering the company already engages 40% of the global population as monthly active users, underscoring how integral its platforms are to daily life.\n\nFigure 4: Meta daily active people AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nNo competitor has been able to challenge Meta's dominance effectively. While companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could develop their own social networks, the established user base of Facebook and Instagram creates a substantial barrier to entry. Google might integrate AI features into Bing and Apple might impose privacy settings to hinder Meta, but its investment in AI has allowed it to overcome these obstacles and continue to deliver personalized advertising. Even TikTok, Meta's closest competitor, faces significant operational challenges in the West with potential bans looming.\n\nDiversification potential\n\nMeta also has significant potential for diversification beyond its traditional revenue streams, particularly in the augmented reality and virtual reality markets. These efforts are encapsulated in the Reality Labs segment, which, despite being loss-making, represents a long-term investment.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Reality Labs reported $3.8 billion in losses, a slight improvement year over year. Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the business will not be profitable until 2030, so immediate substantial cash flows are not expected. The Metaverse project, still in its early stages, requires years for consumer habits to adapt. Despite its current unprofitability, Meta holds a significant share of the AR and VR market. Few other companies are willing or able to invest as heavily in this space. Even Apple's entry with the Vision Pro has not made the expected impact, leaving Meta as a dominant player in the long-term development of these technologies.\n\nFinancial performance and outlook\n\nMeta has consistently demonstrated robust revenue growth, except in 2022 when its advertising business faced challenges due to Apple's ATT. The resurgence of Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein, which have heavily invested in Meta's ad solutions, has significantly boosted ad revenue over the past several quarters. The company's free cash flow margin currently stands at 35%, with the potential to exceed 40% if the capital expenditure is reduced in the coming years.\n\nFigure 5: Meta's financials recovery following slump in 2022  AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta's core social media business continues to perform well, particularly outside its primary markets, with revenue reaching $36.50 billion, up nearly 20% year over year. Notably, there was an almost 50% increase in revenue from the \"Rest of World\" segment. For 2024, I anticipate 16% year-over-year revenue growth to $156.60 billion, driven by sustained demand for advertising across the Family of Apps and the expansion of business messaging opportunities. Advertising will remain central to Meta's business as online ad demand grows and Facebook maintains its significant market share.\n\nFigure 6: Meta ad revenue by geography AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nDespite increased spending, Meta has significantly improved its operating margins. In the first quarter, the company reported $13.80 billion in operating profit, nearly doubling year over year, with operating margin rising from 25% in the prior year to 38% in the most recent quarter. However, the overall operating margin fell quarter over quarter, impacted by widening losses in the Reality Labs segment and a decline in the Family of Apps segment's operating margin, which constitutes 98.90% of total revenue. The decrease in operating margin is attributed to substantial investments in AI infrastructure.\n\nFor 2024, I expect profit margins to remain relatively flat compared to 2023, as margin expansion driven by strong ad demand will likely be offset by increased losses in Reality Labs and additional short-term investments in the AI roadmap.\n\nFigure 7: Meta's operating margin  AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nMETA Data by GuruFocus\n\nMeta's cash flow remains robust despite continued losses from Reality Labs. The company's annualized free cash flow has surpassed $50 billion, an impressive figure for a company with a market capitalization of nearly $1.20 trillion, equating to an almost 5% FCF yield. This is despite significant capital investments, which amounted to nearly $30 billion in 2023. Meta now projects capital expenditures of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. This is considerably higher than the average capex over the previous two years.\n\nIn the long term, I anticipate a reduction in these capital expenditures as the majority of these investments are one-time expenses aimed at building out AI infrastructure. Consequently, Meta's ability to generate cash flows is expected to strengthen significantly once these investments are completed.\n\nFigure 8: Meta's capex AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta's financial performance underscores its resilience and growth potential, driven by strategic investments in AI and robust revenue growth from its core social media platforms. While current expenditures are high, they are largely one-off investments that will position Meta for stronger cash flow generation and sustained profitability in the long term. Despite some short-term margin pressures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive, making it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nValuation perspective: Assessing Meta's growth potential\n\nI remain confident that Meta is well-positioned for an upside scenario, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and the 6% increase in average price per ad during the first quarter, despite the seasonal slowdown. Additionally, given its significant advancements with large language models, I believe Meta has a promising future in the AI market. The market seems to agree with this outlook, even after the post-earnings drop. Although current metrics suggest the market already values the stock at a premium for its robust business model, I believe the shares are still undervalued. Trading at about 8 times estimated sales and 24 times estimated earnings, Meta's valuation is lower than its mega-cap rivals by wide margins, yet remains consistent with its peers relative to their growth profiles.\n\nFigure 9: DCF Calculation AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nConsidering upside scenario cash flows while maintaining base case valuation assumptionsan 11.10% weighted average cost of capital and an expected earnings per share growth rate of 18.41% (achievable given that the expected 10-year earing per share without NRI growth rate is less than the historical 10-year earnings growth rate of 35.70%)I calculate Meta's margin of safety or upside potential at around 9%, with an intrinsic value of approximately $548.44 per share. This would take the stock to new record levels, which seems likely by year-end considering the upcoming cyclical tailwinds. Additionally, this model does not account for Meta's significant share buyback program. The company is spending tens of billions on share repurchases, which will positively impact the fair value per share. The company has a $50 billion authorized buyback program, enough to cover almost 5% of outstanding shares, potentially completing it in just one and a half years.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms is well-positioned for substantial growth, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and strategic investments in AI. Despite some short-term challenges and increased expenditures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive. With robust revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and a significant share buyback program, Meta presents a compelling investment opportunity. The potential upside, driven by AI advancements and cyclical tailwinds, reinforces the company's promising future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing in dividend stocks can result in a golden nest egg that delivers steady cash flow. Receiving dividends from stocks allows you to hold onto your shares while receiving the cash you need to address living expenses.\n\nIt takes a long time to grow a dividend portfolio and be in a position where it can cover most or all of your expenses. Even if the dividend portfolio falls short, social security may be enough to cover your remaining costs.\n\nHowever, you first have to pick the right dividend stocks and make frequent investments into those positions. It gets easier if you reinvest every dividend you receive leading up to retirement. Every reinvestment ensures that your next dividend payout is higher than your most recent one.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese top dividend stocks are leaders in their respective industries that regularly exhibit rising revenue and net income. You’ll also get steady cash flow and dividend growth while holding onto these investments.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) logo on a store front\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) has delivered solid returns for long-term investors. Many people visit the retailer’s locations for affordable groceries and goods. Investors get a 1.19% yield at current levels. Shares have gained 14% year-to-date and are up by 30% over the past five years.\n\nThe global retailer reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 FY25. Global e-commerce and advertising both exhibited strong gains, up by 21% and 24% year-over-year, respectively. It also reported $5.1 billion in net income and closed out with a 3.2% net profit margin.\n\nWall Street remains bullish on the retailer. Walmart stock is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” with a projected 9% upside. The highest price target of $81 per share suggests that the stock can gain an additional 21% from current levels.\n\nWhile the company hasn’t been known for meaningful dividend hikes, Walmart changed the script earlier this year. The company raised its dividend by 9% year-over-year. Investors now receive a quarterly dividend of $0.21 per share.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) makes a small percentage of every credit and debit card transaction for its products and it’s translated into meaningful financial growth. Revenue and net income both increased by 10% year-over-year in Q2 FY24, as cross-border volume remained elevated. Profit margins came in at 53.1% for the quarter. Visa regularly reports net profit margins above 50%.\n\nThe stock currently trades at a 30 P/E ratio and offers a 0.77% y yield. Shares are up by 4.75% year-to-date and have gained 56% over the past five years. Wall Street is optimistic about the stock’s long-term prospects. The average price target suggests a 17% upside from current levels. Visa is currently rated as a “Strong Buy” with zero sell ratings.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa regularly reinvests into its shareholders. The company allocated $3.8 billion toward stock buybacks and dividends. Visa has also maintained an excellent dividend growth rate for several years. The compounded annual dividend growth rate has been 18.05% over the past decade.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues to expand its profit margins while delivering enticing revenue growth. The company reported 27% year-over-year revenue growth and 117% year-over-year net income growth in Q1 2024.\n\nGrowth should continue as the firm attracts more users. The number of daily active users across the company’s social networks reached 3.24 billion. It’s a 7% year-over-year increase. Meta Platforms does a good job at keeping people on their platforms and generating ad revenue, so the influx of users should translate into outsized revenue growth rates.\n\nMeta Platforms is still growing, but that hasn’t stopped the company from initiating aggressive stock repurchasing programs. The company allocated $14.64 billion toward stock buybacks and paid out $1.27 billion worth of dividends to its investors. Meta Platforms will likely maintain a double-digit dividend growth rate for several years due to its strong balance sheet and commitment to efficiency. The stock currently yields 0.39% and trades at a 29.15 P/E ratio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Low-Debt Stocks Delivering High Returns",
        "content": "Zero or low-debt stocks have gained popularity recently as they avoid additional financial costs associated with debt servicing. Companies without interest payments on loans have more funds to return to shareholders, potentially leading to higher stock prices. This is separate from the advantage of being more insulated from market fluctuations since there is no constant drain on company finances. Therefore, low debt is one trait that many defensive investors consider when buying stocks.\r\n\r\nWhile the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates once or twice this year, rates are forecast to remain elevated for a little longer, significantly higher than pre-pandemic levels. This could mean zero or low-debt stocks continue trading at a premium for an extended period. Analysts in this scenario are focusing on companies with substantial cash reserves and little to no debt, able to sustain dividend payments even if rates stay high or economic issues emerge.\r\n\r\nTypically, highly cash-generative companies carry low debt since there is minimal need to take on obligations to expand. This enables some low-debt firms to achieve high returns, making them particularly suitable for the current investment environment.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) designs and develops robotic surgical assistance systems all while it carries no debt. As a healthcare organization with technology at its core, Intuitive Surgical unveiled its latest product in April, the da Vinci 5 system. Industry experts praised it for being groundbreaking in its field, with investors clearly welcoming these developments. ISRG stock has risen over 26% to record highs since the beginning of the year, with 17% of the gains since April.\r\n\r\nWhere Intuitive Surgical differs is in its substantial financial reserves. While many technology firms utilize cash reserves quickly, Intuitive has $7.3 billion available even as earnings and EPS grew over 50% in the past year alone. This impressive performance is reflected in Intuitive’s valuation, trading at a relatively high price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 76.9x. Yet, it does not currently offer a dividend to shareholders. However, given strong results and significant cash holdings, initiating a dividend is a possibility as the business continues to grow its portfolio.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nIndeed, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has invested heavily in artificial intelligence (AI). Also, it offers compelling advantages to investors seeking low-debt stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt generates substantial cash flow, doubled its EPS over the previous year and more than doubled free cash flow (FCF). Last year, it produced $43 billion in cash, above the $19 billion from the prior year. META’s debt-to-equity ratio was 0.123 as of June 2024, suggesting it has a low amount of debt relative to its equity.\n\nMeta Platforms began rewarding the confidence of its shareholders earlier in 2024. It announced a dividend of 50 cents per share and added $50 billion to its share buyback program. That was on top of the over $30 billion previously authorized! In total, it has generated over a 70% return for investors over the last 12 months. Despite these positives, META trades at a relatively reasonable P/E ratio of 29x, which is lower than the average of 35.5x for the technology sector.\n\nCadence Design (CDNS) A Cadence corporate office building has a sign with the company logo out front\n\nSource: mrinalpal / Shutterstock.com\n\nCadence Design (NASDAQ:CDNS) is a multinational technology and software company. It develops fundamental IT solutions such as circuit boards, radio frequency and analog signaling integration into custom integrated circuits.\n\nThis allows the company to operate in high-growth sectors while maintaining a steady presence over many decades. For example, it recently partnered with Samsung to enhance the development of AI chips. As a result, Cadence Design has a relatively low beta of 1.04, indicating its volatility closely matches the benchmark S&P 500 index. This represents a secure position for a technology firm.\r\n\r\nFurther, CDNS is a low-debt stock with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.08. This means that for every dollar of equity, the company has only eight cents of debt. Even as interest rates increased, Cadence Design reduced its debt further while its share price continued rising, demonstrating continual improvement. Analysts remain positive about the company’s prospects, forecasting five percent growth to reach analyst average price targets.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While artificial intelligence has captured headlines since ChatGPT, the industry is still growing. The AI market is projected to maintain a compounded annual growth rate of 36.6% until 2030, suggesting that many of the industry’s top corporations will continue to win.\n\nInvestors have different ideas about what makes a stock successful, but they monitor a few things. Corporations should exhibit rising revenue and profit margins. Advantages over competitors are also important, as a moat makes it easier for a firm to exceed investors’ expectations. These are the AI stocks to buy now that look poised to outperform the stock market.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a quick and easy choice in the artificial intelligence industry. Even though the corporation has been mentioned many times and has become a household name, its financial growth is still spectacular.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRevenue increased by 262% year-over-year to reach $26 billion in Q1 FY25. Net income also soared by 628% year-over-year, reaching $14.9 billion. Nvidia has maintained net profit margins above 50% as big tech companies rush to buy the company’s AI chips. This trend doesn’t show any immediate signs of slowing down, which indicates more gains for long-term investors.\n\nNVDA stock has almost tripled year-to-date and is up by more than 3,300% over the past five years. Nvidia recently concluded a 10-for-1 stock split that suddenly puts it in a position to get added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Nvidia has the financials to back its success, and Wall Street is also convinced. The stock is currently rated as a Strong Buy among 40 analysts.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) is a leading provider of cybersecurity solutions for businesses. Cybersecurity is getting more important with each passing month as companies continue to rely on the internet for data storage and hackers get smarter.\n\nSome cyber hackers use artificial intelligence to hack more companies and conduct deeper attacks on isolated targets. Crowdstrike has also been upping its game with artificial intelligence defense systems. The Falcon Platform makes it easy for cybersecurity professionals to detect and address threats before companies get hacked.\n\nWhile most cybersecurity firms are experiencing headwinds, Crowdstrike continues to charge forward. Q1 FY25 revenue increased by 33% year-over-year to reach $921.0 million. Net income was $42.8 million compared to a $0.5 million profit in the same quarter last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdstrike generates most of its business from subscriptions, which means plenty of annual recurring revenue (ARR). The company’s ARR stood at $3.65 billion at the end of the first quarter. That’s up by 33% year-over-year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) has been using artificial intelligence for numerous years to offer relevant search results for its users. Many business owners try to rank on top of these search engines and run advertisements to skip organic SEO. The strong demand for Google and YouTube ad placements has created a multi-billion dollar that keeps giving.\n\nThe tech giant reported 15% year-over-year revenue growth and 57% year-over-year net income growth in the first quarter. Cost-cutting measures continue to strengthen the bottom line while Alphabet diversifies beyond advertising. While ad platforms still make up most of the company’s revenue, Google Cloud now makes up more than 10% of the firm’s total revenue. Google Cloud is projected to get a boost from artificial intelligence that should translate into healthy profit margins.\n\nInvestors may be underestimating how quickly Alphabet can raise its net profit margins. The company seems to follow a similar playbook to Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which focuses on efficiency. Alphabet only has a 28 P/E ratio and is up by 28% year-to-date. Further profit margin expansion should lead to considerable upside for the stock.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in NVDA, CRWD and GOOG.

        "title": "Don't count software out of Gen-AI - Goldman",
        "content": "Investing.com - A number of high-profile software companies offered up weak forward-looking guidance during the last quarter’s earnings season, but Goldman Sachs has advised investors not to rule the sector out of the excitement surrounding Gen-AI.\n\nThe influential investment bank noted the unusual strength in fourth-quarter results of 2023 for several software companies coinciding with expectations for rate cuts and slowing inflation. Those expectations changed very sharply in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) and Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) offered up reasonably healthy numbers last week, but the likes of Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) recently forecast disappointing first-quarter product revenue on expectations that customers would cut back on spending in an uncertain economy.\n\nThis news came despite accelerating hyperscaler growth, raising the question of whether the issues driving weaker demand are cyclical or structural.\n\nHyperscalers are large cloud service providers, which can provide services such as computing and storage at enterprise scale, and include the likes of Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThe divergence between hyperscaler acceleration and deceleration in enterprise software has been notable, said analysts at Goldman Sachs said, in a note dated June 3, as the hyperscalers have been able to invest considerable amounts of incremental capital in order to generate revenues from generative artificial intelligence (Gen-AI).\n\n“We estimate the incremental capital spending above regular cloud CapEx to be in the annual run rate of $60 to $80 billion. This has driven an estimated incremental Gen-AI related revenues in the $14 to $16 billion range,” Goldman said.\n\nThe global software industry is now pushing $700 billion and is one of the largest capital spending items, if not the largest, which makes it susceptible to high cost of capital.\n\nThere is a reasonable case to be made that new AI priorities have pushed aside consideration for more mature well-established spending items, the bank added. Software has always been about productivity and now a cognition aspect has been added, which changes the value proposition and sales cycles as a result.\n\nThis raises the question whether hardware is finally disrupting software, after software dominated for much of the last decade.\n\nTo answer this, Goldman pointed out that tech cycles tend to follow a pattern - at first, the cycle is about infrastructure build out. Then there are platforms that allow the best use of that infrastructure, while providing building blocks to build next generation applications, and the final leg is the build out of applications.\n\nStory continues\n\n“In order for any tech cycle to be successful, there has to be a killer application,” Goldman said, citing enterprise resource planning in the late 90s, search and e-commerce during the dot-com bubble, and cloud applications following the Great Financial Crisis.\"\n\n“In each of these cycles the value creation started with the infrastructure layer and moved to platforms and applications,” Goldman said. “In the case of generative AI, we are still waiting for a killer application or a few that can produce results at scale for different end user domains, be it front office, middle office or back office.”\n\nWhile the pace of Gen-AI technology continues to evolve, it is not quite to the point where the killer applications are obvious today.\n\nA big difference in this cycle of generative AI is that while the incumbents in the prior client server cycle were slow to adopt the cloud, the application software incumbents in this cycle, be it Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), SAP (ETR:SAPG), Oracle, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Adobe, Intuit (NASDAQ:INTU) or Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY), are developing Gen-AI products with a heightened sense of urgency.\n\nAdditionally, data will be a critical element for the success for an AI company, and the data incumbency advantage enjoyed by companies like Salesforce, Adobe, Intuit, ServiceNow, and Snowflake cannot be taken too lightly.\n\nApplication software companies are trading at cyclically depressed valuation multiples, the bank said, and it is a concerning time.\n\n“We do believe that in the short-term, the cyclical aspect of higher rates, if alleviated, will cause buying cycles to ease up and therefore the demand picture for the group should get better in the subsequent quarters,” Goldman Sachs said.\n\nThe companies that take generative AI technology architectures more seriously and are open to the thorough examination and re-architecting of their platforms will end up being successful.\n\nAfter all, a surprising amount of the shareholder value creation from 2010 to 2020 came from incumbent software companies such as Adobe, Microsoft, Intuit, and Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK), who embraced the changing technology and business models much to the surprise of investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nDon't count software out of Gen-AI - Goldman\n\nSnap launches AI tools for advanced augmented reality\n\nGoldman: Mixed signals in labor market could impact rate cuts path\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia and Broadcom Have Each Announced Stock Splits: These Are the 3 Most-Logical Candidates to Become Wall Street's Next Stock-Split Stocks",
        "content": "What's rarer than the planets aligning in the night sky? The answer is Wall Street's two hottest trends intersecting: artificial intelligence (AI) and stock splits.\n\nAI, which involves the use of software and systems for tasks that humans would normally undertake or oversee, has the potential to completely change the long-term growth arc for businesses worldwide. In a report released last year, the analysts at PwC estimated AI could add $15.7 trillion to the global economy by 2030. With numbers this large, it's not a surprise to see AI stocks soaring. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeanwhile, a stock split is an entirely cosmetic event that allows a publicly traded company to change its outstanding share count and share price by the same factor. It's \"cosmetic\" in the sense that stock splits don't alter a company's market cap or operating performance.\n\nStock splits have different purposes, depending on the type of split. A forward-stock split is designed to make shares more nominally affordable for retail investors. On the other hand, a reverse-stock split increases a company's share price in order to meet minimum listing standards on a major stock exchange. Most investors tend to gravitate to companies enacting forward splits, like we've recently witnessed among AI stocks.\n\nNvidia and Broadcom kick off stock-split mania among artificial intelligence stocks\n\nIn a matter of weeks, we've seen the two most-influential AI companies announce stock splits. Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) board gave the green light for a 10-for-1 stock split on May 22, which was ultimately completed following the close of business on June 7. Meanwhile, Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) announced its first-ever stock split (also 10-for-1) on June 12, with an effective date of July 15.\n\nNvidia's high-powered graphics processing units (GPUs) have quickly become the must-have chip for businesses operating AI-accelerated data centers. Orders of the H100 GPU have swamped supply, which has allowed Nvidia to dramatically increase the price of these chips and pump up its adjusted gross margin.\n\nAccording to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia accounted for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million total AI-GPUs shipped in 2023. Having first-mover advantages, a 98% market share, and a long list of AI-GPU successor architecture (Blackwell and Rubin), gave Nvidia's board every incentive to conduct the company's second split in three years.\n\nAs for Broadcom, it's become something of a staple in AI-accelerated networking. The company's Jericho3-AI chip is capable of connecting up to 32,000 GPUs, which can harness their full processing capacity, reduce tail latency, and power the training of large language models and generative AI solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom has forged a handful of AI partnerships, as well. Last year, it teamed up with Alphabet to improve generative AI cybersecurity on Google Cloud. More recently, Broadcom forged a working relationship with Dell Technologies to supply the latter with the AI connectivity solutions that its customers are looking for.\n\nBut it's not just AI stocks that look primed for stock splits. What follows are the three most-logical candidates to become Wall Street's next stock-split stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCostco Wholesale\n\nThe first stock that seems like a no-brainer to announce a split sooner than later is warehouse club Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST). Not including the spin-off of Price Enterprises in 1994, Costco has conducted three splits since becoming a public company, the last of which occurred in January 2000. With its shares closing at an all-time high of nearly $856 on June 14, the stage is absolutely set for a stock split.\n\nCostco's vast outperformance of the benchmark S&P 500 over multiple decades boils down to its undeniable competitive advantages, the first of which is its size. Buying its products in bulk helps to reduce the cost of each unit it purchases. This allows it to undercut local shops and even national grocery chains on price. The company's management team learned a long time ago that price advantages help to draw consumers into its stores.\n\nTo add to this point, Costco has been quite successful getting its members to purchase items not on their shopping lists. Though grocery items have razor-thin margins, discretionary purchases have a tendency to lift Costco's operating margin.\n\nThe other advantage for Costco is its membership model. Paying $60 or $120 for an annual membership is going to encourage consumers and businesses to get the most bang out of their membership buck. In other words, they're going to make Costco their one-stop destination whenever possible. The high-margin subscription revenue Costco brings in buffers its razor-thin margins on groceries.\n\nMicroStrategy\n\nAnother logical candidate to conduct a stock split is enterprise-analytics software provider MicroStrategy(NASDAQ: MSTR). MicroStrategy completed a 2-for-1 split in January 2000, but was compelled to conduct a reverse 1-for-10 split in July 2002 to ensure continued listing on the Nasdaq stock exchange following the dot-com bubble bursting. Shares of the company ended last week at almost $1,496 per share.\n\nAlthough MicroStrategy has its analytics software operations, the lion's share of its nearly $27 billion valuation is based on its ties to Bitcoin(CRYPTO: BTC). CEO Michael Saylor, who strongly believes that Bitcoin is the future, has overseen the acquisition of around 214,400 Bitcoin for his company. Based on a fully mined supply of 21 million tokens for Bitcoin, MicroStrategy owns more than 1% of the world's largest cryptocurrency by market value.\n\nThe company also borders on being a meme stock. Most cryptocurrency-driven businesses are heavily influenced by retail investors who aren't too focused on traditional fundamental valuation metrics. A share price that's nearing $1,500 can be a constraint for retail investors without access to fractional-share purchases.\n\nBut unlike Costco, there are no competitive advantages with MicroStrategy. Though it is the largest publicly listed holder of Bitcoin, the company's software sales have been trending lower for a decade.\n\nIts valuation is even more worrisome. Whereas approximately 214,400 Bitcoin have a current market value of $14.2 billion, MicroStrategy's Bitcoin holdings are being valued at close to an 80% premium. Given Bitcoin's deficiencies as a currency and investment, MicroStrategy is a potential stock-split stock worth avoiding.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe third logical candidate to become Wall Street's next stock-split stock is the only member of the \"Magnificent Seven\" that's never conducted a split: social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Since going public in May 2012, shares of Meta have gained more than 1,200%, with shares ending at more than $500 on June 14.\n\nMeta's outperformance has everything to do with its premier social media \"real estate.\" It's the owner of Facebook, the most-popular social media platform globally, as well as Instagram, WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger, and Threads. Collectively, all of its apps helped to attract a whopping 3.24 billion daily active users in the March-ended quarter. Businesses are willing to pay an ad premium to get their message(s) in front of Meta's broad audience.\n\nBeyond its foundational ad revenue, Meta is also gaining traction for its AI ambitions. Meta's money-losing Reality Labs segment is aggressively investing in virtual/augmented reality devices, the metaverse, and AI solutions. While Reality Labs has been a drag on the bottom line, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a lengthy and successful track record of developing new platforms and waiting until they've matured to fully monetize them.\n\nThe last puzzle piece that explains Meta's ongoing success is its bountiful balance sheet. Meta closed out March with over $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and has generated more than $76 billion in operating cash flow on a trailing-12-month basis. There's little reason to believe its shares aren't headed higher over the long run, which makes a stock split all the more logical.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Causeway Capital Commentary: Investing Across the AI Cycle",
        "content": "Major technology cycles typically offer three phases of investment opportunities: building, delivery, and deployment. In the first phase, semiconductor companies provide the essential building blocks for computing infrastructure. The second phase features network and end-device manufacturers, the conduits for the technology. In the third phase, software and service providers apply the technology to drive productivity, innovation, and market expansion.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 9 Warning Signs with XKRX:005930.\n\nCurrently we are in phase one of generative AI's technology cycle, as evidenced by strong stock returns for the direct and immediate beneficiaries: AI server and component suppliers.\n\nCauseway Global Value and International Value strategies currently are invested in what we believe are underappreciated beneficiaries that span all three phases. Fundamental client portfolios have meaningful exposure to the AI cycle via holdings that, in our view, have reasonable valuations not yet incorporating the next five years of growth. Causeway Capital Commentary: Investing Across the AI Cycle\n\nHere, we outline the phases of the AI investment cycle, with Causeway fundamental portfolio holdings highlighted in blue.\n\nPhase One | Building: Semiconductors for AI Computing Infrastructure\n\nMemory\n\nThe memory essential for AI data center functions is sold by three key suppliers: Samsung Electronics (XKRX:005930), SK Hynix (XKRX:000660), and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). AI applications need more memory, including high-bandwidth memory (HBM) for faster, lower-latency data transfer. According to our analysis, we expect AI server growth to drive over 100% HBM annual demand growth over the next three years. SK Hynix currently leads in HBM technology and production. Micron matches SK Hynix in technology but lags in production capacity. Samsung Electronics has similar production capacity to SK Hynix but faces challenges in HBM technology and production, which we believe should be resolved within a year.\n\nDRAM\n\nThe rise of AI data centers should drive a meaningful dynamic random-access memory (DRAM) pricing cycle as HBM production crowds out conventional DRAM. We expect limited factory space and shifts in production capacity to HBM to squeeze DRAM memory supply through mid-2026. This should lead to stronger DRAM pricing in late 2024.\n\nData Storage\n\nWe believe databoth quantity and qualitywill become the most important differentiating factor for any generative AI applications. High-density solid-state drives (SSDs) are the premium data storage solutionsdevices designed to provide large but compact storage capacity. Samsung Electronics and SK Hynix are currently the dominant SSD suppliers. Seagate Technology (NASDAQ:STX),which produces hard disk drives for cost-effective data storage, should also benefit.\n\nStory continues\n\nPower Management\n\nAI data centers need effective power and thermal management to optimize their performance. Infineon Technologies (XTER:IFX), Analog Devices (NASDAQ:ADI), and Renesas Electronics (TSE:6723) specialize in advanced semiconductor solutions for these challenges, such as integrated circuits that optimize energy efficiency, and power delivery and thermal monitoring and management equipment.\n\nPhase Two | Delivery: Network Infrastructure and End-Devices\n\nCloud Migration\n\nEnterprises will need to modernize IT infrastructure for generative AI applications, which should benefit cloud hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) that offer cloud computing and infrastructure services. We expect an AI-driven enterprise cloud migration to continue for years.\n\nEnd-Devices\n\nPCs and smartphones likely will offer more AI features locally (on the device) requiring powerful processors and more memory in the coming years. This should accelerate the replacement cycle for these devices. Samsung Electronics, as a leader in smartphones and memory, appears well-positioned to benefit from on-device AI. Electrical component supplier Murata Manufacturing (TSE:6981) should see robust growth from AI PCs and smartphones. TD-Synnex (NYSE:SNX), the largest IT distributor, also should benefit from this accelerating replacement cycle.\n\nPhase Three | Deployment: AI Software and Services\n\nDigital Ads\n\nCompanies like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and Tencent (TCEHY) already use AI to enhance advertising efficiency and automate customer processes, which has led to revenue growth. Alphabet and Meta will soon introduce consumer-facing generative AI services, such as enhanced search and chat functionality, content creation tools, and tailored advertising and shopping recommendations. These features should allow them to capture more user engagement market share from smaller competitors.\n\nEnterprise AI\n\nUnlike consumer applications, generative AI adoption in businesses may progress more gradually. Outdated IT infrastructure, potential data and brand risks, and the complexity of integrating new AI applications into existing workflows could lead to this slower pace of implementation. Critical considerations include improving data quality and managing the unique requirements of AI training and inference.\n\nContrary to the prevailing view that generative AI will supersede people-driven IT service businesses, we believe IT and business process outsourcing companies like Cognizant Technology Solutions (CTSH), Genpact (G), Concentrix (CNXC), and Fujitsu (TSE:6702) should play a critical role assisting enterprises adopt and integrate AI technologies. Successful IT services companies will be those that best collaborate with their clients to design and maintain AI applications, sharing the associated benefits and risks. This cooperation should gradually shift the IT services business model from headcount-based to outcome-based. IT services companies that adapt should thrive.\n\nA post-COVID slowdown in IT project spending has put additional pressure on valuations for these IT services companies. However, our analysis indicates that the spending environment has stabilized and should improve later this year and into 2025. Businesses cannot defer their necessary transformation and growth initiatives indefinitely.\n\nWe believe SAP (SAP) is another potential beneficiary of enterprise AI adoption. By embedding AI technologies in its software, SAP enables its customers to enhance supply chain resiliency, better manage human and other resources, and improve the pace and accuracy of financial reporting.\n\nHistorically, each technological wave, such as cloud computing and mobile technology, has expanded the market size for technology service providers. We expect generative AI to drive additional growth.\n\nThrough diligent fundamental research anchored in valuation analysis, we aim to identify lesser-known beneficiaries across all three phases of the technology cycle, so that our clients may potentially participate in the full spectrum of opportunities presented by the evolution of AI.\n\nThis market commentary expresses Causeway's views as of June 2024 and should not be relied on as research or investment advice regarding any stock.

        "title": "Meta and Apple will likely be the first targets of Europe’s new antitrust powers",
        "content": "Meta already has a good reason to be mad at European tech regulators. On Friday, it had to effectively pause its rollout of Meta AI in Europe, at the request of its main privacy regulator in Ireland, after privacy advocates loudly complained that Meta can't train its AI on the personal data of European Facebook and Instagram users without their consent.\n\n“Without including local information we’d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience,” Meta griped, calling it “a step backwards for European innovation.” But that annoyance is nothing compared to what’s reportedly around the corner.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the European Commission is gearing up to make Meta and Apple the first targets of its new antitrust powers, based on the Digital Markets Act that took effect a few months ago. As also reported by the Financial Times, Apple’s charges will likely arrive first, followed by those for Meta.\n\nWe’ll get to the Apple issues in a moment, but those that will reportedly lead to Meta charges are not a million miles away from those holding up its European AI ambitions.\n\nIn the case of Meta AI, the problem is that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands that any processing of personal data needs a solid legal basis—there’s a list of six potential options. Meta had been hoping that it could get away with claiming vaguely that its “legitimate interests” justify the use of European users’ data as model-training fodder, but that didn’t fly with the regulators, so its only plausible option is to get each user’s consent. For whatever reason, it isn’t taking that option just yet.\n\nMeta’s DMA woes are also down to data protection and the need for consent, only this time it’s about tracking users for ad-targeting purposes.\n\nOver the years, a succession of legal cases (initiated by the Austrian activist lawyer Max Schrems) has systemically removed the legal justifications that Meta can use for this tracking, again leaving it with valid consent as the only remaining option. But because few people would naturally choose to opt into online surveillance, Meta attempted a subscription gambit in which users could pay as much as $13 monthly to get ad-free Meta services, otherwise they would have to consent to tracking in order to use Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs I wrote in April, Europe’s privacy regulators agreed with Schrems and other activists, deciding that Big Tech platforms generally can’t claim they have valid consent for tracking if the only alternative is paying a fee. And because antitrust and privacy law have been blurring into each other in recent years—regulators have realized that market-dominating companies maintain their positions partly through the accumulation of data—this tactic arguably manages to fall foul of both the GDPR and the DMA.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta declined to comment on the Reuters report, saying it was speculative.\n\nAs for Apple, well, if you followed the drama of that company’s sullen attempts to comply with the letter of the DMA while trampling over its spirit, you can guess what those charges will likely be about. If you managed to stay blissfully unaware of the drama, here’s the gist: The DMA forced Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe, but when it did so, it introduced a €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” for every first installation of each app published by a developer who chose to make its apps available in a third-party app store.\n\nIn other words, developers were finally free to steer clear of Apple’s distribution mechanism and the revenue cut that Apple demands, but they'd lose a ton of money if their app was free to download, as most are.\n\nCompanies with plans to introduce third-party app stores on iOS, like Meta and Microsoft, complained that Apple’s new fee made the concept unviable. As the DMA demands that platform “gatekeepers” like Apple apply “fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory general conditions of access” for other businesses, I wrote at the time that Apple was unlikely to get away with this tactic. And here we are—this is reportedly going to be the crux of the EU’s charges.\n\nLike Meta, Apple declined to comment on the report of this oncoming train, which will bring with it the threat of fines running to a maximum of 10% of global annual revenue.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "RGA Investment Advisors, an investment management company released its first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the letter can be downloaded here. Strong economic growth combined with frustratingly resilient inflation defined the macroeconomic environment in the first quarter. The large caps outperformed their smaller counterparts in Q1. It may be the result of continued momentum in the market. Kindly check the top 5 stocks of the strategy to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors highlighted stocks like Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), in the first quarter 2024 investor letter. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is a technology company that develops products to connect people. The one-month return of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) was 7.53%, and its shares gained 79.42% of their value over the last 52 weeks. On June 14, 2024, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock closed at $504.16 per share with a market capitalization of $1.279 trillion.\n\nRGA Investment Advisors stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"We believe this section is crucial for highlighting some of the key lessons we have learned since 2022. At the outset, let us clarify that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) remains one of our three largest positions, fluctuating based on daily market movements. As you read this, it might in fact be our largest holding. In the closing remarks of our Q4 2022 commentary, we noted that we had “made…META substantially larger” during the quarter. Never did we expect the stock to generate such substantial returns in a short period of time. Between Mark Zuckerberg’s “Year of Efficiency,” a recovery in the digital ad market and an improving macro backdrop, META’s key multiples recovered to a comfortable level within their long-term ranges:\n\nAlthough these multiples are now back to “normal” levels, they are hardly expensive for a company whose top line growth re-accelerated into the double digits, with operating leverage and despite ongoing heavy investments in the Reality Labs segment. These are the reasons why we continue to hold a large position in META. As for why we did some selling, we want to emphasize a few key points:...\" (Click here to read the full text)\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is in third position on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. As per our database, 246 hedge fund portfolios held Meta Platforms, Inc.

        "title": "Meta Platforms, Inc. (META) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +6.8%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.7% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has gained 1.1%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nHere at Zacks, we prioritize appraising the change in the projection of a company's future earnings over anything else. That's because we believe the present value of its future stream of earnings is what determines the fair value for its stock.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.66 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.3%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed 0%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $20.16 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +35.6%. This estimate has changed -0.2% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.04 indicates a change of +14.3% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nFor Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate for the current quarter of $38.15 billion indicates a year-over-year change of +19.2%. For the current and next fiscal years, $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates indicate +17.8% and +13.1% changes, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 17, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Airbnb ABNB, Uber Technologies UBER, Robinhood HOOD, Meta Platforms META and Reddit RDDT.\n\nHow to Trade IPOs: Private vs. Public Investing\n\nInvesting in private and public markets are entirely different endeavors, though they share some similarities: innovation, earnings growth and sound management are integral drivers that determine investment performance of both.\n\nUnderstanding Private Markets vs. Public Markets\n\nBelow are five main distinctions between private and public markets that investors must understand, including:\n\nRisk Appetite\n\nWhether you're investing in private or public companies, each endeavor is risky. However, assuming all else is equal, private firms are far riskier than public firms. Private firms are often earlier in their growth curve (or are just an idea) and do not have to meet the same stringent requirements of a public stock exchange. That said, if successful, the reward for investing in a private firm is far greater because investors on the ground floor can enjoy the company's full growth and potentially take advantage of an IPO.\n\nA private investor or VC (venture capitalist) should be considered a home run hitter. While private investors will \"strike out\" more, they can be successful by hitting home runs and gaining a piece of the next Airbnb or Uber Technologies before everyone else.\n\nLiquidity and Holding Period\n\nBecause public companies are traded each weekday on a major stock exchange like the S&P 500 Index, they offer far more liquidity. Whether this is an advantage or a disadvantage depends on the eye of the investor. For example, a private investor may be forced to hold for years before they can even think about selling.\n\nIn other words, if the investment is good, they will be forced to hold and can potentially catch the next multi-bagger (however, this works in both directions). Conversely, a public investor can quickly and easily exit a position they do not feel comfortable in.\n\nAccess\n\nPublic markets have an overwhelming advantage in terms of access. A public investor only needs to fund an account at a discount broker such as Robinhood to take advantage of fresh IPOs. Conversely, private investors must become \"accredited\" to invest in less-regulated securities like private firms. Accredited investors must have a certain income. Furthermore, most private companies require a minimum investment, while public investors can invest any amount they wish.\n\nAvoid Common IPO Pitfalls\n\nLike most investments, the individual investor's personal situation and investing framework will play an important role in which direction to take. Success can be found in both public and private investing but since most investors only have access to public markets, we will break down some common IPO pitfalls to avoid.\n\nStory continues\n\n1. Insider Selling and Lockup Expiry\n\nWait for Price Discovery\n\nBuying an IPO on day one is a bad decision for most investors for two reasons: First, it generally takes time for the market to find equilibrium or price discovery. Second, insiders and early investors can use the liquidity event to sell shares. The Meta Platforms (formerly Facebook) IPO was a perfect example. Facebook went public in May 2012. However, shares did not eclipse the IPO high until late 2013.\n\nSolution: Wait for the lockup expiry (the period insiders must wait before selling shares) to pass, and let the price settle and form a base structure.\n\n2. Slower Growth\n\nIn a 2016 interview, Mark Cuban explained the problem with IPOs: \"Companies are waiting seven, nine, ten years or longer to go public and by then their hyper-growth is typically gone.\" In other words, instead of going public while the company is still growing rapidly, firms wait until growth is slow, and worse, use the IPO as a liquidity event to sell into.\n\nSolution: Look for stocks with a strong Zacks Rank or robust EPS estimates. Zacks Consensus Estimates aggregate earnings estimates from several prominent banks to derive a consensus estimate. Ideally, an IPO should have double-digit or triple-digit EPS growth.\n\n3. Lack of Fundamental Catalysts\n\nBullish catalysts are necessary for a stock to grow because competition is fierce on Wall Street.\n\nSolution: Find a company with a unique and new bullish catalyst. For example, social media firm Reddit, which just went public, benefits from the AI revolution because its platform is optimal for training large language models (LLM) such as ChatGPT.\n\nBottom Line\n\nPublic and private investing each have pros and cons. To be successful in public investing, investors should avoid three common pitfalls.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mega-cap technology stocks will see a \"material\" increase in expenditures in 2024 as they push to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities.\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, the analysts predicted that Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will see annual capital spending on servers and equipment jump by 43% compared to the prior year to $91 billion. Overall estimated expenditures will rise by 35% year on year to $145 billion, the analysts projected.\n\nOf the three companies, the BofA analysts said they expect Meta to spend the most as a percentage of revenue, adding that the investment \"should ensure [its] AI capabilities are best of breed.\" Investors will subsequently be keen to see if Meta can churn out any new products from its AI spending, the analysts noted.\n\nThey said markets should also be looking for employee reductions at these firms to help offset the impact of the higher expenditures, with the rate of workforce growth tipped to slow to an average yearly uptick of 3%. From 2016 to 2022, headcount grew by 26% on average.\n\nDespite forecasting the surge in spending, the analysts retained their positive view of the AI cycle for the tech industry, saying they anticipated that average free cash flow margins for Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon will be stable in 2024 and expand in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMega-cap tech stocks to see steep jump in annual spending on AI equipment - BofA\n\nEU regulators to decide on Bunge and Viterra's $34 billion deal by July 18\n\nEarnings call: MSC Industrial Supply revises full-year outlook amid sales dip\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Goldman Sachs has lifted its year-end target price on the benchmark S&P 500 index, citing strong earnings growth, particularly from the mega-cap tech stocks, and increased fair value.\n\nThe bank now sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5600, up from its previous target of 5200, offering around 3% from Friday’s 5431.60 closing price.\n\nThe aggregate S&P 500 index has returned 15% since the start of the year, with five stocks accounting for 60% of the aggregate index’s year to date return - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThese stocks have collectively surged by 45% and now comprise 25% of the S&P 500 equity cap, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a note dated June 14.\n\nThe drivers of the rally include upward revisions to consensus 2024 earnings estimates for these same tech companies, and valuation expansion stemming from increased investor enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe five companies listed above posted 1Q year/year EPS growth of 84% vs 5% for the typical S&P 500 stock, prompting analysts to raise their 2024 EPS forecasts by 38% for these five tech stocks. In contrast, the profit forecast for the other 495 stocks in the index have been reduced by 5%.\n\nConsensus 2024 forecasts imply a 31 percentage point gap between EPS growth for these five stocks and the median S&P 500 firm (37% vs. 6%), Goldman said, but this gap is expected to narrow to 8 percentage points in 2025 and 4 percentage points in 2026.\n\nThe bank now expects the current bottom-up consensus 2025 EPS estimate will be lowered by just 2% through year-end, half the average historical revision.\n\n“We expect revisions to consensus S&P 500 EPS estimates will continue to be milder-than-average through year-end given the upward revisions to mega-cap tech earnings that have already taken place this year,” the bank said.\n\n“However, we maintain our earnings forecasts for 2024, as we believe consensus margin estimates for next year remain too optimistic.”\n\nLooking ahead, the bank's valuation model suggests the S&P 500 P/E will be 20.4x by year-end, 3% below the current multiple of 21.1x. Strong consensus 2025 earnings growth and a roughly unchanged real yield imply a year-end 2024 fair value P/E multiple of 15x for the equal-weight S&P 500.\n\nThe election remains a key risk to the S&P 500 level and falls between our 3-month and year-end forecast horizons, the bank said.\n\nHistorically, during election years index volatility has increased before the election and the S&P 500 index has declined by 4% between late October and early November. Nevertheless, volatility typically subsides and the index rebounds to an even higher level following the election.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks edged higher; BOE meeting, inflation data due this week\n\nUBS sets aside $900 million to repay investors in collapsed Greensill funds\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI come to you today from a hotel room at the Cannes Lions advertising festival in France, readying to drop a ton of on-air, investor-friendly content for Yahoo Finance this week alongside esteemed colleague Rachelle Akuffo.\n\nWe'll be catching up with companies in attendance, including Spotify (SPOT), Pinterest (PINS), Meta (META), and Google (GOOG).\n\nKeep up with the action from Yahoo Finance here.\n\nNow, while I am on the topic of tech meets beach and loud music...\n\nThere have been lots headlines the past several weeks on Silicon Valley increasingly tossing support to former President Donald Trump (which has upset many on the left).\n\nNoted tech entrepreneur David Sacks threw a fundraiser for Trump in San Francisco earlier this month that reportedly netted millions for his presidential campaign.\n\nBefore that, on May 30, Sequoia Capital partner Shaun Maguire uncorked a lengthy post on X, voicing support for Trump.\n\n\"I just donated $300k to Trump. I’m prepared to lose friends. Here’s why. Back in 2016 I had drunk the media Kool-Aid and was scared out of my mind about Trump. As such I donated to Hilary Clinton’s campaign and voted for her. By 2020 I was disillusioned and didn’t vote — I didn’t like either option. Now, in 2024, I believe this is one of the most important elections of my lifetime, and I’m supporting Trump,\" Maguire wrote.\n\nTesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk — who has increasingly warmed up to Trump — responded to the post by saying, \"I think you are right.\"\n\nSomewhat of an interesting reply, considering the Biden administration has bent over backward to turbocharge the EV industry — of which Musk and Tesla are still viewed as the leaders.\n\nAt first glance, Silicon Valley elites' public support of Trump after his latest bout of legal troubles seems surprising.\n\nJoe Biden won California in the 2020 presidential election by about 30 points. This marked the fourth consecutive election that the Democratic nominee has surpassed 60% of the votes in the state.\n\nNext, the Biden administration has doubled down on investing in semiconductor manufacturing in the US. That has lifted sentiment on the tech industry's future and arguably added another layer of bullishness to its stocks.\n\nAnd last but not least, the stock market continues to hit records under Biden. Meaning: The wealthy in Silicon Valley have become even wealthier!\n\nStory continues\n\nBut when it's all said and done, maybe this Trump back-slapping shouldn't surprise anyone.\n\nThese are forward thinkers thinking forward, considering how to protect their immense wealth (and it is, in fact, immense, as this new data from San Jose State University shows), their businesses, and their investments.\n\nA lot of them foresee tougher regulation under a Democratic president, especially as AI speeds ahead and puts jobs at risk.\n\nIt's not my position to say if they are wrong or right; I just want to share how some of these folks I chat up are thinking right now.\n\nTake the level-headed veteran tech entrepreneur Max Levchin, CEO of Affirm (AFRM), who came to the US from Ukraine as a teenager.\n\nHe has long stayed out of making public statements on politics but did bring up a fair point in the Opening Bid podcast this week (listen here) that may reflect the sentiment of many in the Valley.\n\n\"I pride myself in staying out of politics for pretty good reasons. I think one of the things that I learned pretty early on in Affirm is what we have appeals to both sides of the aisle,\" Levchin said. \"San Francisco leans left of left, left of center — and yet you're building products that are going to get used by someone in a MAGA hat.\"\n\nLevchin adds he will never host political fundraisers at his home.\n\nExpect others in the Valley to, however, as it appears to be a good wealth-protecting business tactic. morning brief image\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Stock Splits Ahead? 3 AI Stocks Poised to Split After Nvidia",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) superstar stock Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) announced a stock split on May 22 this year. Share prices have climbed 36% since then. The wild success could have some other AI companies on Wall Street contemplating following suit (even if the split isn't necessarily the sole reason behind the stock's performance).\n\nRemember, a stock split doesn't change anything about the underlying business or the stock's fundamentals. It just divides the stock into more shares with proportionally lower prices and per-share financials. Companies split their stock for numerous reasons, including making shares easier to buy and sell for employees (who might get them as stock options in lieu of payment) and investors.\n\nWith Nvidia finalizing its stock split on June 10, the question that naturally follows is: Which AI companies might be next for a stock split? Three Fool.com contributors identified Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) as those most likely AI stocks to split next.\n\nHere is why.\n\nThis venerable tech giant looks primed for a split\n\nWill Healy(Microsoft): As the company that until very recently had the world's most valuable market cap, Microsoft is not a surprising candidate for a stock split. Considering how much stock price appreciation it has seen in the past few years, the surprising thing about Microsoft's stock is that it has been more than 21 years since Microsoft last split its stock.\n\nBetween the late 1980s and early 2000s, when Microsoft was the dominated PC operating system company, stock splits were much more common. During that period, the stock split nine times.\n\nHowever, the Dot-Com market crash and then the rise of Apple chipped away at Microsoft's leadership over time, particularly after it launched the iPhone in 2007. Between 2000 and 2014, when Steve Ballmer was CEO, Microsoft stock lost 37% of its value.\n\nThe state of the company finally improved when Satya Nadella took the CEO position in 2014. He redefined Microsoft as a cloud company and, later, a leader in AI. Over Nadella's 10-year tenure, Microsoft stock has risen more than 1,110%, taking it to $440 per share as of this writing. MSFT Chart\n\nGiven that level of stock price growth, the need for a split grew as well. The company's growth suggests that stock price appreciation is likely to continue. In the first three quarters of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), net income increased by 26% year over year. The company's outlook for the rest of the fiscal year points to double-digit percentage revenue growth as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnother factor pointing to a stock split involves Microsoft being a component of the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Since the Dow is price-weighted, Microsoft will probably need to split its stock so as not to have an outsized effect on the index's movement. That should ensure that the 21-year stock split drought finally comes to an end.\n\nMeta Platforms has never issued a stock split, but the time may finally be here\n\nJake Lerch (Meta Platforms):All in all, 2024 has been a great year for the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Indeed, six of the seven (Tesla being the only exception) have recorded double-digit percentage gains year to date. Yet of these stocks, only one has never split its shares: Meta Platforms. The time for that first-ever split has arrived. Here's why.\n\nFirst off, the stock is expensive. A Meta share trades for around $504 -- placing the stock beyond the reach of many retail investors. By implementing a 3-for-1 or even 5-for-1 stock split, Meta could significantly lower its share price and make the stock more accessible to retail investors who might not be able to buy fractional shares, potentially reducing the price to a more reasonable range of $100 to $175.\n\nA recent study from Bank of America revealed another compelling reason for Meta to split its shares: outperformance. The study, which examined stock splits since 1980, found that stocks that were split beat the S&P 500 during the 12 months that followed the split. This was true in each of the last four decades (see chart below). Image source: Statista\n\nWhile many investors would likely cheer a Meta stock split, it's far from a given. Meta's management isn't a fan of stock splits. In its 12 years as a public company, Meta has never performed a stock split. That's in stark contrast to other tech megacaps like Adobe and Microsoft, who split their shares four and seven times, respectively, in the first 12 years of their existence as public companies.\n\nAt any rate, investors should keep a close eye on Meta Platforms. Stock split or not, the company remains one of the top-performing tech stocks thanks to its lucrative digital advertising business. With its Q1 revenue growing at 27% year over year and earnings soaring 127%, long-term investors would be wise to consider Meta as a buy-and-hold candidate.\n\nSuper Micro Computer could opt to refuel its rally with a stock split\n\nJustin Pope (Super Micro Computer): For a while, Super Micro Computer was seemingly the AI version of Robin to Nvidia's Batman. But share prices have stalled and declined after topping out at $1,229. Meanwhile, Nvidia keeps climbing to new highs. Here is why Super Micro Computer, or Supermicro as it's also known, could still get back on track, necessitating a stock split.\n\nThe company sells modular server systems for data centers. This is great for companies that don't have the expertise or time to custom-build their own and just want to deploy compute as quickly as possible. Like Nvidia, Supermicro has become a \"go-to\" choice as AI spending surges. You can see below how revenue growth has accelerated to 200% year over year, and management has underlined this by noting that demand for its products is dramatically outpacing the broader industry. SMCI Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nEvidence suggests that Supermicro could benefit from data center tailwinds for some time. According to Newmark, AI will drive enough data center demand to double its power consumption by 2030 from current levels. Supermicro has done nearly $12 billion in trailing-12-month revenue; analysts believe annual revenue could double to over $23 billion by next June.\n\nMeanwhile, the company has a healthy outlook for earnings growth. Analysts believe earnings per share will grow by an average of 52% annually for the next three to five years. In other words, AI tailwinds remain intact, and fundamental strength should eventually push shares higher. Today, the stock trades at a forward P/E of 33, making it a bargain if Supermicro realizes such strong earnings growth. These catalysts could drive Super Micro Computer higher, an exciting prospect for investors.\n\nSo why split the stock?\n\nThe company has never split its stock despite shares appreciating over 9,400% since its IPO. Now, trading at over $800 per share, the stock is harder to buy and sell (less liquid). It's harder for investors to slowly buy shares over time without having a ton of money. Employees sitting on profitable equity in the company must sell in chunks when shares trade at such a price. Splitting the stock lowers the share price and alleviates these problems. Plus, the positive attention a stock split usually generates could help move the share price again after shares have stalled in recent weeks. It's a potential win-win for everyone.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "6 Artficial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Worth Over $1 Trillion. Here Are the 2 Most Likely to Join the Club Next.",
        "content": "Take a look at a list of the largest companies in the world based on market cap, and you might notice a common thread for most of them: The biggest members of the group have bet heavily on artificial intelligence (AI). And those bets seem to be paying off.\n\nCurrently, six AI stocks are worth over $1 trillion. They could have company in the not-too-distant future. Here are the top six -- and the two AI stocks most likely to join the club next.\n\nThe $1 trillion six-pack\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are in a close race to be the world's biggest company. Both of their market caps hover around $3.3 trillion.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Apple could be left in the dust in the race to develop AI technology. Its Siri AI assistant seemed almost antiquated compared to new large language models (LLMs).\n\nHowever, Apple's recent launch of new generative AI capabilities has changed the narrative. Some think the new Apple Intelligence features might even spark an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nMicrosoft has benefited tremendously from its relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant's cloud business has especially grown thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind. The company's introduction of AI-powered Copilot+ PCs should also provide a nice boost to its operating system sales.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is nipping at Apple's and Microsoft's heels with a market cap of around $3.2 trillion. The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has been the poster child of the AI boom over the last 18 months. Nvidia's forthcoming rollout of its Blackwell GPU architecture could keep it at the top of the AI chip market.\n\nWe could say that Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are in the second tier of megacap AI stocks. Alphabet's market cap is around $2.2 trillion, while Amazon's is slightly under $2 trillion.\n\nBoth companies, like Microsoft, are cloud service providers. Generative AI could be the strongest growth driver for the cloud so far. Both Alphabet and Amazon are using AI to increase revenue in their core non-cloud businesses (search for Alphabet and e-commerce for Amazon). They're also hoping to be winners in self-driving car technology -- Alphabet with its Waymo unit and Amazon with Zoox.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) lags behind the other AI leaders with a market cap of close to $1.3 trillion. The company uses AI extensively throughout its social media apps, including Facebook and Instagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted in late 2023 that AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext in the club\n\nWhich AI companies are in the best position to join these six in the $1 trillion club? My votes go to Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nBroadcom's market cap now stands close to $780 billion. The stock surged last week after the semiconductor maker reported great fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. Revenue jumped 43% year over year, driven primarily by its acquisition of VMware and strong demand for its networking products in AI data centers.\n\nThe company also announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. Although this split won't impact Broadcom's underlying business, it could make the stock more attractive to retail investors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's market cap of around $740 billion isn't too far behind Broadcom's. The company makes chips for many of the top AI leaders, including Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom.\n\nAs its name indicates, the company is based in Taiwan. However, it expects to begin production at its first advanced chip fabrication facility in Arizona next year. It's also building another fab plant in that state, with plans for a third. These investments could cement the company's status as the go-to chipmaker for the world's best AI companies.\n\nAre Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor smart picks?\n\nWhile I predict Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor will be the next AI stocks with market caps of $1 trillion or more, I don't know how long they will take to reach that threshold. But I think both are smart stocks to buy right now for aggressive growth investors.\n\nIncome investors and value investors will probably want to look elsewhere. Neither stock is cheap. Although both pay dividends, their yields are only in the ballpark of 1.4% -- not enough to entice many income investors.\n\nIf you're looking for growth, though, and don't mind potential volatility, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could be great fits. I expect both stocks to continue to beat the market in the coming years as the adoption of AI increases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Ready for a Bull Run",
        "content": "Leading companies benefiting from the booming demand for artificial intelligence (AI) services have been one of the main catalysts sending the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite to new highs this year. Investors who put their money in the right stocks could make a lot of money over the next decade in this burgeoning new industry.\n\nHere are two promising stocks that could deliver wealth-building returns for shareholders.\n\n1. C3.ai\n\nC3.ai(NYSE: AI) is a leading AI enterprise software developer. Some of the largest companies in the world use C3.ai, including the federal government. The U.S. Air Force uses C3.ai to predict points of failure during operation and identify the spare parts that are needed for repairs. Shell uses C3's advanced software to monitor and maintain more than 10,000 pieces of equipment across its energy assets. While the stock hasn't kept up with the broader market this year, these relationships with large organizations point to a massive opportunity on the horizon.\n\nThe company's partnerships with leading cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Alphabet's Google Cloud are working to its advantage. These partnerships are a key driver of C3.ai's growth and are helping to reduce friction in new customer acquisitions.\n\nC3.ai recently switched to a consumption-based pricing model, where customers pay for the resources they use, which is the standard by which cloud service providers price their products. While this lowered the cost for customers, it caused revenue growth to slow over a year ago, but it's starting to pick up. Management's guidance calls for full-year revenue growth between 19% and 27%, which is a catalyst for the stock.\n\nC3 continues to report high interest from many organizations. In the most recent earnings report, the company said it received nearly 50,000 inquiries from businesses for its generative AI applications. This shows the transition to a consumption-based model has made its offering more attractive to new customers by lowering the cost.\n\nThe recent acceleration in growth has brought the price-to-sales ratio from 16 a year ago down to a more reasonable 12. Assuming the company delivers on its revenue guidance, the lower valuation could attract more investors and lift the stock to new highs later this year.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nA stronger digital advertising market has driven accelerating revenue growth for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) over the last year, but the stock still trades at a reasonable valuation that could justify more new highs. Meta is making progress integrating AI services across its social media platforms, which is contributing to revenue growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta AI has rolled out on Instagram, Facebook, WhatsApp, and Messenger, and it is already helping to drive higher user engagement. The bonus is higher advertising revenue, which is how Meta Platforms monetizes the billions of users across its platforms.\n\nMeta's revenue grew 27% year over year in the first quarter, with AI-driven recommendation systems and advertising tools contributing to the company's top-line momentum.\n\nInvestors have been concerned about increasing competition from other social media apps, such as TikTok. However, Meta's AI infrastructure is becoming a competitive advantage. Over half of the content recommended on Instagram is AI driven, with short-form video on Instagram's Reels being a significant driver of engagement.\n\nMeta has plenty of cash to continue investing heavily in AI. The company produced $49 billion in trailing-12-month free cash flow, and its growth prospects look solid. Analysts expect earnings per share to grow 18% on an annualized basis over the next several years, which should translate to similar returns for shareholders, given that the stock is priced at a market-average forward price-to-earnings ratio of 25.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in C3.ai right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in C3.ai, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and C3.ai wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Small-Cap Showdown: 3 Mighty Stocks Punching Above Their Weight",
        "content": "It’s time to look into small-cap stocks as the mega-cap tech titans have hogged the spotlight, especially in recent weeks, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joining the red-hot AI rally with its recent reveal of Apple Intelligence. This may be the generative AI tech of choice once it’s in the palms of iPhone users later this year. Indeed, Apple deserves an “A” grade for how it debuted its most ambitious AI offering to date. Apple’s entry into the AI race also seems to have given a lift to its mega-cap peers in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWith so much concentration in the mega-caps, questions linger as to how things will ultimately settle. Markets could certainly become even more top-heavy as time goes on. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore the small- and mid-cap companies as they do their best to embrace new technologies and grow their way into investor’s radars.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll look at three small-cap stocks deserving of your attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks: Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) Several women walk past a Bath & Body Works (BBWI) retail store.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’ve been to the mall with your kids, you’re probably well aware of Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW), a retail store that allows you to customize and stuff your very own plush animal. Building your own stuffed toy is a great experience worth paying a premium for, even if you’re an adult.\n\nIn recent years, BBW stock has been on a choppy ride higher. At the time of writing, the stock’s up over 333% in the past five years and around 22% in the past year. The market cap sits at a mere $376.1 million.\n\nWith the reintroduction of the incredibly cute Mini Beans collection and collaborations with big brand names, including Pokémon and Disney (NYSE:DIS), I find BBW stock has what it takes to rebound after a rough 19% spill off its recent highs.\n\nWith an ongoing legal battle with Squishmallow, a subsidiary of Jazwares, which itself is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), over allegations that Build-A-Bear “copied” its designs, things could certainly get messy from here. Either way, BBW stock looks super cheap at 7.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). Definitely one of the small-cap stocks to buy, at least in my opinion.\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoconut water maker Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) has been on a hot run since bottoming out back in February 2024, now up more than 57% from those lows. The natural beverage maker has seen blistering growth in recent years. And though there have been dips along the way, COCO stock continues to look like a great small-cap growth stock as it expands its product further, perhaps in a way to disrupt the large-cap beverage firms in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm boasts a $1.75 billion market cap, leaving Vita Coco a pretty long runway to take market share from a wide range of rivals. Despite dominating the coconut water market, with a 50% share in the U.S. market, Vita Coco still has the international market to tackle. Additionally, as consumers opt for healthier options in the drink fridge of their local grocery store, I view Vita Coco as having the edge over even the big-name soda makers.\n\nAt 33.89 times trailing P/E, I still view COCO stock as cheap relative to its growth potential. Perhaps new drink categories can help keep growth rates moving back into the high double-digits.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) wants to harness the profound power of AI to help daters get better matches or, at the very least, save them a bit of time and heartache. Indeed, the market seems quite skeptical of Bumble’s AI ambitions.\n\nOn one hand, a Bumble-developed AI may help future daters find that perfect someone. However, companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) could implement the same thing. Arguably, Meta’s Facebook looks like it could do a better job of matching since it already has a slew of user data and their relationship statuses.\n\nThough Facebook Dating has been met with limited success, I do think it can improve matching through the power of AI. Given competitive threats in the AI-focused dating world, I just can’t recommend BMBL stock. Not while it’s in a historic funk, with shares down over 85% from peak levels. However, it will be interesting to see how the $1.9 billion company aims to take on some giants in the scene with AI at its side.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held Apple, Disney, and Berkshire Hathaway.

        "title": "A Look At The Fair Value Of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nMeta Platforms' estimated fair value is US$561 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity With US$504 share price, Meta Platforms appears to be trading close to its estimated fair value Our fair value estimate is 7.7% higher than Meta Platforms' analyst price target of US$521\n\nHow far off is Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) from its intrinsic value? Using the most recent financial data, we'll take a look at whether the stock is fairly priced by projecting its future cash flows and then discounting them to today's value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Models like these may appear beyond the comprehension of a lay person, but they're fairly easy to follow.\n\nCompanies can be valued in a lot of ways, so we would point out that a DCF is not perfect for every situation. If you still have some burning questions about this type of valuation, take a look at the Simply Wall St analysis model.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStep By Step Through The Calculation\n\nWe use what is known as a 2-stage model, which simply means we have two different periods of growth rates for the company's cash flows. Generally the first stage is higher growth, and the second stage is a lower growth phase. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we need to discount the sum of these future cash flows to arrive at a present value estimate:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$45.7b US$52.2b US$58.9b US$66.7b US$72.5b US$76.9b US$80.8b US$84.2b US$87.3b US$90.1b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x19 Analyst x19 Analyst x9 Analyst x4 Analyst x3 Est @ 6.11% Est @ 4.99% Est @ 4.21% Est @ 3.66% Est @ 3.27% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.2%  US$42.7k US$45.4k US$47.8k US$50.4k US$51.2k US$50.6k US$49.6k US$48.2k US$46.6k US$44.8k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$477b\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter calculating the present value of future cash flows in the initial 10-year period, we need to calculate the Terminal Value, which accounts for all future cash flows beyond the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.2%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$90b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.2%– 2.4%) = US$1.9t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$1.9t÷ ( 1 + 7.2%)10= US$946b\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$1.4t. In the final step we divide the equity value by the number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$504, the company appears about fair value at a 10% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Remember though, that this is just an approximate valuation, and like any complex formula - garbage in, garbage out. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. If you don't agree with these result, have a go at the calculation yourself and play with the assumptions. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Meta Platforms as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.2%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.055. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nDividend is low compared to the top 25% of dividend payers in the Interactive Media and Services market.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual revenue is forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nGood value based on P/E ratio and estimated fair value.\n\nThreat\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow slower than the American market.\n\nMoving On:\n\nValuation is only one side of the coin in terms of building your investment thesis, and it is only one of many factors that you need to assess for a company. The DCF model is not a perfect stock valuation tool. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different.

        "content": "Recently, Facebook (NASDAQ:META) and X (formerly Twitter) have been under intense scrutiny by users and various governing bodies. The EU has criticized Facebook and Instagram for allegedly failing to protect children online.\n\nThe SEC is investigating X and its new owner, Elon Musk, regarding Musk’s purchase of Twitter in 2022.\n\nFurthermore, the relationship between these major social media networks and their users has become increasingly complex. Algorithmic changes, data privacy concerns, content moderation, advertising choices and the issue of misinformation have left many users looking elsewhere for social communication.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey, 64% of Americans believe social media has a mostly negative effect on the country’s current state.\n\nEven though Facebook, Instagram and X remain leaders in their respective industries, the growing tensions around the giants incentivize users and investors to look elsewhere.\n\nAs a result, this shift has opened up new opportunities for smaller-cap social media stocks, including Match Group, Bumble and Pinterest.\n\nMatch Group (MTCH) MTCH stock: the Match group logo on a computer screen with a phone displaying its site\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nMatch Group (NASDAQ:MTCH) is an American, Dallas-based online dating group that owns brands like Tinder, Match.com, Hinge and Meetic.\n\nAs of 2023, Match Group employed around 2,600 people across all its divisions. For the same year, Match Group generated a total revenue of $3.36 billion and a net income of $651 million.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, Match Group reported $0.81 per share, an increase of $0.30 per share reported during the same quarter of 2022.\n\nMatch Group’s main strength lies in its diverse portfolio of dating platforms, each targeting different demographics. Tinder, for instance, focusing on a younger demographic, had 75 million monthly active users and 10.4 million subscribers in 2023.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) is another major player in the online dating industry and Match Group’s main competitor.\n\nThe Texas-based company has around 1,200 employees and is the parent company of Bumble, Badoo, Fruitz and Official.\n\nWhitney Wolfe Herd, the founder of Bumble, was a former employee of Tinder. Shortly after leaving her position as VP of Marketing, she founded Bumble with the main goal of democratizing dating.\n\nIn 2023, Bumble Inc. generated a total revenue of $1.05 billion — an increase of 16.42% year over year. However, it still lost $4.21 million. In comparison, in 2022, Bumble lost $79.75 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the fourth quarter of 2023, Bumble’s total paying users increased to 3.7 million, compared to 3.2 million in the previous year.\n\nTherefore, given Bumble’s improving financial performance, retail investors should definitely monitor the company’s performance and consider adding the social network to their portfolios.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Smart phone with the Pinterest (PINS) logo in front of blurred out pinterest post pictures, Pinterest layoffs\n\nSource: DANIEL CONSTANTE / Shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is an American social media platform for sharing images and other visual content, such as recipes, home design inspirations, style and motivation.\n\nOf the three small-cap stocks above, Pinterest is the main competitor of Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs of 2023, Pinterest employed around 4,000 people for its massive base of 518 million monthly active users.\n\nIn 2023, Pinterest generated a total revenue of $3.06 billion, an increase of 9.01% compared to 2022. They lost $35.61 million, compared to $96.05 million in 2022.\n\nSince Pinterest’s user base has been growing consistently since Q2 of 2022, this social media network could be a great small-cap option for investors to consider.\n\nOn the date of publication, Dmytro Spilka did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is This Trillion-Dollar Company About to Join Nvidia in the Stock-Split Club?",
        "content": "Stock splits are back in focus once again, after semiconductor giant Nvidia announced during its fiscal 2025 first-quarter report (for the quarter ended May 22) that it intended to split.\n\nNvidia's 10-for-1 forward stock split went into effect on June 7. It wasn't surprising to see Nvidia take this step, even though a stock split is simply a cosmetic move that reduces the price per share of a company in lieu of an increase in outstanding shares. After all, Nvidia stock has climbed a tremendous 727% since the beginning of 2023 thanks to the robust demand for its artificial intelligence (AI) chips.\n\nNvidia management pointed out that the split has been done \"to make stock ownership more accessible to employees and investors.\" It's also worth noting that Nvidia is the sixth S&P 500 company to execute a stock split this year, and Bank of America analysts believe that more splits in the technology arena could be on the way.\n\nThis is the reason Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), a stock that gained 322% since the beginning of 2023 and has a market cap of $1.29 trillion, could undergo a stock split. Each share of Meta is trading at just over $500, and management may want to reduce the price of each share through a split to make it accessible to more investors, even though the move won't alter the company's fundamentals.\n\nIt's worth noting that Meta has never split its stock. It remains to be seen whether management will decide to make such a move. However, it would be prudent for investors to take a closer look at its fundamentals, which won't be affected by a stock split, as they are going to play a critical role in deciding the stock's future direction.\n\nMeta Platforms' solid prospects make the stock an attractive investment\n\nThough Meta's share price is north of $500, retail investors can still get to invest in the stock through brokers who allow purchases of fractional shares. That's why it's important to take a closer look at the social media and digital advertising giant's business prospects as smaller investors can still buy fractional shares even if there isn't a split.\n\nMeta operates in the multibillion-dollar digital advertising market, which was worth an estimated $680 billion last year. Last year, Meta's advertising revenue came in at $132 billion, indicating that its share of the digital ad space stood at just over 19% last year. This year, global digital ad spending is forecast to increase by almost 9% to $740 billion. The good part is that Meta's growth indicates that it's gaining more share in this space.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's ad revenue increased 26% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $35.6 billion. Meta expects overall revenue to increase to almost $38 billion in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range, which would be a jump of 19% year over year. It's worth noting that Meta's revenue increased 11% in the same period last year.\n\nSo the company's digital ad business is gaining momentum, and that's good news for investors, as the global digital ad market is expected to clock $966 billion in revenue in 2028. A key reason Meta has been gaining traction in this market is its focus on integrating AI tools into its popular applications such as Instagram, Facebook, and WhatsApp.\n\nIts AI tools are meant to help both creators and advertisers using its platforms, and the good part is that its tools are driving an acceleration in growth. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said on the company's April earnings conference call: \"AI has also always been a huge part of how we create value for advertisers by showing people more relevant ads, and if you look at our two end-to-end AI-powered tools, Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns, revenue flowing through those has more than doubled since last year.\"\n\nMore importantly, Meta is continuing to push the envelope in the digital ad market by launching more AI-focused tools. The company recently announced an AI-powered ad program for businesses on WhatsApp, a move that could help it monetize its popular messaging service. Given that AI is expected to account for more than 90% of ad purchases by 2029, according to GroupM, then Meta is doing the right thing by focusing on integrating this technology into its business.\n\nAs such, it's easy to see why analysts are expecting Meta's earnings to grow at an annual rate of 30% for the next five years, compared with 11% annual growth in the past five.\n\nThe stock is worth buying thanks to its valuation\n\nWhile each share of Meta is priced at over $500, a closer look at the company's valuation indicates that it's cheap considering the impressive growth it's been delivering. Meta stock is trading at 29 times trailing earnings, and 26 times forward earnings. Both multiples are cheaper than the Nasdaq 100 index's earnings multiple of 30 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks).\n\nSmaller investors with the ability to buy fractional shares can consider buying Meta irrespective of a split. And those looking to add a potential AI winner to their portfolios would do well to buy Meta Platforms considering its attractive valuation and the potential growth it could deliver in the long run.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This article takes a look at the one major mistake to avoid with your Roth IRA. Check out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nBuilding a Million-Dollar Roth IRA\n\nAccording to a survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), individuals think they need at least $1.8 million to live a comfortable retirement. Based on the figure, it is safe to say that the average American, who has only $120,300 saved up for their retirement, is in for a bumpy ride if they don’t start saving up. Thankfully, there are quite a few ways through which an individual can stack up a million dollars in retirement. One such example is through a Roth IRA.\n\nA Roth IRA is a special type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in which an individual pays taxes on their contributions, and then receives all future withdrawals tax-free. Many individuals believe that contribution limits imposed by the IRS make it difficult to build up a fat nest egg for retirement through such accounts. However, that’s where they are wrong. This is because with consistency, and with the power of compounding, it is quite easy to be a retirement millionaire yourself.\n\nSo how is it possible to raise over a million dollars in your Roth IRA? More importantly, why is a million-dollar Roth IRA so attractive to retirees? The answer lies in its tax-free withdrawals. Since a Roth IRA requires after-tax contributions, an individual who has amassed over a million dollars in retirement will be able to enjoy it tax-free in their retirement years.  However, there are many things that can go wrong with a Roth IRA. For this reason, we have compiled a list of all the mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA. Before we move on to that, let’s get back to the question: how to build a million dollar Roth IRA account?\n\nWhich Stocks to Add to Your Retirement Portfolio\n\nWe at Insider Monkey recently compiled a list of the Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. To compile the list of the top 5, we ranked the holdings of Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023 and chose the top 5. These top stocks were chosen based on hedge fund sentiments, where the top consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on our list, the top five growth stocks to buy and hold on to are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The top growth stock to buy and hold is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the world’s largest personal computing operating system provider. The company boasts strong financials and significant growth potential, with Azure, AI integration, and its diversified business model being the key drivers of the company’s revenues and profitability. Undoubtedly, the stock is a strong buy and hold, with shares having popped up 35% since May 2023. Posting its Q3 2024 earnings, the company’s revenue rose by 17% year-over-year to $62 billion, $1 billion higher than analyst expectations. One Major Mistake to Avoid with Your Roth IRA\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, we consulted a number of sources such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Bankrate, Investopedia, and District Capital Management, to name a few. A consensus approach was adopted to choose the top 11 mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, with one point awarded each time it was recommended by a source. Mistakes have been ranked in an ascending order based on the number of times recommended.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nHere are the 11 Mistakes to Avoid with Your Roth IRA:\n\n1. Failing to Invest Your Roth IRA Funds\n\nBased on our methodology, one major mistake to avoid with your Roth IRA is failing to invest your Roth IRA funds. A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account where an individual contributes their after-tax dollars. However, many individuals believe contributing to a Roth IRA is an investment in itself when it is not. Just because an individual contributes to a Roth IRA doesn’t mean that the money is automatically invested. In fact, an individual must go into the account, select the investments, and then manage them. This is the best advice for a Roth IRA. Some popular investments for Roth IRAs are stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), Target-date Funds (TDFs), and Real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, it is not allowed to invest in collectibles in a Roth IRA. This includes automobiles, artwork, stamps, rugs, and other items.\n\nCheck out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best AI travel apps; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than NVDA but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:\n\n25 Popular Small Towns to Live in the USand 11 Best Travel-Sized Fragrances For Your Next Vacation.\n\nDisclosure: None.

On Friday, it updated that statement to say those plans have been delayed indefinitely after the Irish Data Protection Commission pushed back on the decision.\n\n“This is a step backwards for European innovation, competition in AI development and further delays bringing the benefits of AI to people in Europe,” Meta wrote in a blog post. “Put simply, without including local information we’d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience. This means we aren’t able to launch Meta AI in Europe at the moment.”\n\nA Meta spokesperson confirmed the company still plans to bring these products to Europe, but declined to share a timeline for when that will happen. At the end of 2023, Facebook had 308 million daily active users in Europe, according to the company’s financial statements.\n\nMeta has been pouring significant resources into artificial intelligence technology in an effort to keep pace with other tech giants, including Alphabet Inc.’s Google, Microsoft Corp. and OpenAI. The company debuted its latest LLM, Llama 3, in April, and already offers its Meta AI assistant to users of its apps in the US.

        "content": "Retirement may feel distant, but it’s important to save up now. Accumulating more money will give you more choices when you are ready to retire. Even if you want to work forever, extra cash gives you more options about the type of work that you pursue.\n\nRetirement stocks can help investors reach their long-term financial goals sooner. Capital gains and dividends can lead to a higher net worth. Solid retirement stocks like the ones on this list can generate those results. These stocks have impressive records and have been around for a while. There’s a time and place for high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities, but retirement stocks tend to offer more stability.\n\nInvestors should look for companies with multiple decades of experience, rising revenue, and improving profit margins. These components are the foundation for many top-tier retirement stocks. The stock market offers many choices, but investors who want stability and have multi-decade time horizons may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) combines value with growth. The tech giant trades at a 27.5x price-to-earnings ratio while offering a 0.45% yield for investors. Shares are up by 27% year to date and gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nWhile the company makes most of its revenue from advertising, Google Cloud has become a larger segment of the corporation’s business model. Google Cloud made up over 10% of the company’s revenue in the first quarter. The quarter also featured 15% revenue growth from a year ago and 57% net income growth.\n\nAlphabet’s net income should continue to exhibit an elevated growth rate as the company trims costs and becomes more efficient. Artificial intelligence can also lead to more revenue growth for the company. Gemini is Alphabet’s response to ChatGPT, and AI can also increase demand for cloud computing platforms. A potential acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) would expand Alphabet’s offerings and can help the company reach new heights.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) current valuation doesn’t resemble a retirement stock. The company trades at a P/E ratio north of 700x, but its 87x forward P/E ratio makes it look more reasonable.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while many competitors are struggling. Revenue increased by 33% year over year to reach $921 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Annual recurring revenue grew at the same rate, reaching $3.65 billion. Crowdstrike’s annual recurring revenue gives it a good foundation to deliver compelling growth rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income has been surging for the cybersecurity firm, and that can result in a more favorable P/E ratio for patient investors. Crowdstrike reported $500,000 in GAAP net income in Q1 2023. Meanwhile, GAAP net income came to $42.8 million in Q1 2024. Companies will have to invest more money to strengthen their digital defenses. Crowdstrike looks like a top beneficiary of this trend, and investors with a five- to 10-year horizon can be greatly rewarded.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NYSE:TXRH) is a steakhouse restaurant chain with fast-food restaurants. The company presents “growth at a reasonable price,” as it trades at a P/E ratio of 34x. Other fast-growing restaurant stocks have much higher P/E ratios. Texas Roadhouse stock is up by 42% in 2024 and has more than tripled over the past five years. Investors receive a 1.4% yield while they wait for the stock price to rally.\n\nRecent financial results suggest Texas Roadhouse can continue with its growth streak. Revenue increased by 12.5% year over year in the first quarter while net income sprang up by 31.4% year over year. Texas Roadhouse commanded an 8.4% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales at company-owned restaurants. Comparable franchise restaurant sales were up by 7.7% year over year.\n\nTexas Roadhouse currently has 753 total restaurants. The split comes to 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise-owned restaurants. The restaurant chain opened 12 additional restaurants this quarter.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to diversify into multiple fast-food restaurant stocks, you may also want to consider Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). The restaurant chain has healthier food options than most fast food giants. This distinction helped Chipotle set higher prices for its food without losing customers.\n\nThe company’s stock is up by 39% year-to-date leading to its 50-for-1 stock split that will take effect June 26. Shares also gained 322% over the past five years. Financials continue to be an area of strength for the chain. Revenue increased by 14.1% in the last year to $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Net income grew by 23.2% to $359.3 million. Chipotle closed the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin, which is above average.\n\nChipotle remains on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year. Each time Chipotle opens that many restaurants, the company puts itself in a good financial position to open more in the following years. It’s feasible to see Chipotle open more than 1,000 new restaurants before 2030. That development should result in meaningful gains for long-term investors.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that charges a percentage of every transaction. These plastic cards are more convenient than cash and offer enticing rewards and enhanced security.\n\nDebit and credit cards will be used across multiple generations, and that should result in steady revenue growth for Visa. The fintech firm reported 10% year-over-year improvements to its revenue and net income in the second quarter . Visa’s leadership regularly rewards shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. The company allocated $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter toward those initiatives.\n\nVisa only has a 0.7% yield, but it maintained an annualized 18% growth rate over the past decade. This high growth rate can result in significant cash flow by the time you are ready to retire. Visa stock is up by 6% year to date and gained 62% over the past five years. The firm regularly has net profit margins that exceed 50%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) outperformed the S&P 500 with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares of the global retailer are up by 84% over the past five years. While Walmart is a reliable resource for groceries and affordable prices, the company is dabbling in two verticals that can stimulate growth.\n\nE-commerce is the first exciting opportunity. While Walmart reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, e-commerce was up by 21%. Walmart’s continued success in e-commerce can help it compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and it can gobble up market share from Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nWalmart’s advertising segment is another area of strength, but it will take longer for advertising to meaningfully impact Walmart’s financials. Advertising increased by 24% year over year, including a 26% growth rate for Walmart Connect in the U.S. Investors with lengthy time horizons can see advertising impact Walmart’s profit margins meaningfully. Most of Walmart’s business model revolves around low-margin sales. Growth in Walmart’s advertising segment should translate into healthier profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a top online advertising stock for several years. While a poor 2022 resulted in a meaningful price cut, the company flipped the script last year and recently touched an all-time high. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and gained 177% over the past five years.\n\nJust like Alphabet, Meta Platforms trades at a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has a P/E of 29x and offers a 0.4% yield. Recent financial results suggest that Meta Platforms can become more affordable for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year over year while net income was up by 117%. Meta Platforms continues to trim its headcount, which is 10% lower now than it was last year. Meta Platforms also wrapped up the quarter with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The social media giant has plenty of capital to invest in new ventures while generating healthy profit margins for its investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, CRWD, and TXRH.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple and Meta Platforms will likely face charges for failing to comply with landmark EU rules aimed at reining in their power before the summer, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\n\nThe European Commission, which launched investigations into the two companies and Alphabet's Google in March under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), sees Apple and Meta as priority cases, the people said.\n\nThe DMA requires Big Tech to open up space for smaller rivals to compete and make it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores.\n\nEU regulators will issue preliminary findings which are similar to antitrust charges before the summer break in August, with Apple the first to be charged, followed by Meta, the sources said.\n\nThe Commission and Meta declined to comment. Apple referred to its March statement where it said that it was confident that its plan complies with the DMA and that it continues to constructively engage with the Commission.\n\nCompanies can offer remedies to address concerns laid out in the findings before a final decision expected before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves office in November, which could include fines up to 10% of a company's global annual turnover for breaches.\n\nThe EU investigation targets Apple's steering rules, which regulators say impose limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge, and also its new fees levied on apps developers.\n\nEU regulators are expected to charge Apple related to this issue, the people said, adding that a second investigation focusing on its choice screen for its Safari web browser will likely take more time.\n\nThe preliminary finding on Meta focuses on its recently introduced pay or consent model where users pay a subscription fee for an ad-free Facebook and Instagram, the people said.\n\nThe FT was the first to report that Apple would face EU charges.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "One can barely go far today without seeing or hearing the term AI. Artificial intelligence, or AI, has grown exponentially. Many of the world’s greatest minds have touted AI as the next great technology and a moment reminiscent of the invention of the internet. There you have it, then, investors. We can make ourselves available to this technological revolution with AI stocks.\n\nHere are three AI stocks to own in every growth portfolio.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a social media and technology giant whose flagship products include Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. There is an aggressive investment in AI to improve its ad targeting and content recommendation systems, radically improving user engagement and advertising revenue on its platform.

Get in touch: money@telegraph.co.uk\n\nTaylor Swift fans have been left hundreds of pounds out of pocket by fraudsters hijacking their friends’ social media accounts to flog non-existent tickets.\n\nScores of Facebook users have reported that their accounts have been compromised and scammers are using them to lure in fans with the promise of cheap tickets.\n\nHigh street bank TSB said it has been forced to issue hundreds of refunds to fraud victims as scammers prey on the desperation of Ms Swift’s fans and their parents.\n\nThe bank said it has seen “a number of cases where fraudsters have hacked into social media accounts to sell Taylor Swift tickets that simply do not exist”.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTSB said that in one case it had refunded £600 to a customer after they interacted with a friend’s account on Facebook that was selling Taylor Swift tickets.\n\n“Once contact ceased, the customer contacted her friend by different means and was told that the account had been hacked by a scammer,” a spokesman said.\n\nIn other instances seen by this newspaper, scammers hack into a Facebook account, then use it to claim they have tickets for “excellent seats with a great view of the stage”.\n\nThe post then encourages the account holder’s friends to get in touch, adding: “I’m willing to sell them at a discount price.”\n\nWhen contacted, scammers, posing as a friend, convince victims to transfer hundreds of pounds to an unknown account.\n\nMs Swift’s wildly popular Eras Tour kicked off its UK leg in Edinburgh’s Murrayfield Stadium last week and is tipped to boost Britain’s economy by £1bn this summer.\n\nNicola Bannister, TSB’s customer support director, said: “If you see a friend or someone you’re following advertising tickets from their profile, it’s best to confirm in person, or via a phone call before making a purchase.”\n\nIn April, Lloyds bank warned that Taylor Swift fans had lost out on £1m to fake ticket scams. It said more than 600 of its customers had come forward so far to report being scammed.\n\nStory continues\n\nBritain’s economy is tipped for a welcome boost this summer, with Taylor Swift fans spending an average of £206 each on outfits, eating out and accommodation, according to a report published by Barclays.\n\nThe Eras tour kicked off on 7 June in Edinburgh and will come to a close on 20 August in London.\n\nA Meta spokesman said: “Fraudulent activity is not allowed on our platforms and we are continually investing in new technologies to tackle this industry-wide issue.\n\n“We take the safety and security of our community seriously and encourage everyone to create a strong password, enable two-factor authentication and be suspicious of emails or messages asking for personal details.\n\n“We also have a feature called Security Checkup to help people keep their Instagram and Facebook accounts secure”.\n\nRepresentatives for Taylor Swift did not respond to requests for comment.",

        "content": "Dividends are in high demand among investors, and companies are responding. Tech giant Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) declared its first dividend earlier this year. At the same time, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) hiked its distribution to shareholders by 150%, and Costco (NASDAQ:COST) issued a special one-time dividend payment of $15 per share. Increasingly, investors see dividends as a reason to hold a stock long-term.\n\nIt’s important to understand that not all dividends are equal. The average dividend yield among S&P 500 listed companies is currently 1.35%. Many companies pay quarterly distributions of less than 1% of their stock price. That said, a select few companies pay generous dividends with yields much higher than average. These companies also prioritize steadily growing their dividends over time.\n\nHere are the three top-performing dividend stocks so far in June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTop-Performing Dividend Stocks: Diamondback Energy (FANG) Diamondback Energy Inc (NASDAQ:FANG)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOil producer Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ:FANG) pays a hefty quarterly dividend of $2.32 per share, giving the stock a robust yield of 4.80%. Shareholders can earn a healthy income from Diamondback Energy’s generous distribution. At the same time, FANG stock is trading at a low multiple of 10 times future earnings estimates, and its share price has risen nearly 50% in the last 12 months.\n\nWhile the stock has pulled back since the end of April due to slumping crude oil prices, the shares look to have bottomed at $189 at the start of June and have since bounced higher. FANG stock looks to have a big catalyst ahead as Diamondback Energy completes its $26 billion acquisition of privately held Endeavour Energy. The purchase of Endeavour will make Diamondback Energy the third-largest oil producer in the Permian Basin of Texas.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon store sign. VZ stock.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nVerizon Communications (NYSE:VZ) has one of the highest dividend yields around, at 6.60%. VZ stock currently pays its shareholders 67 cents per share each quarter. Verizon stock also has an attractive valuation, trading at 15 times future earnings estimates. The share price has been on an upswing, rising 13% in the last 12 months. The stock got a lift after the company’s first-quarter financial results turned out better than expected.\n\nInvestors cheered as Verizon reported solid earnings and stemmed losses among its wireless subscribers. Management credited the positive results to its flexible plans and streaming bundles, including discounted prices for services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). In the future, Verizon plans to build on the success of its customizable “myPlan” offering, which has proven popular with consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDick’s Sporting Goods (DKS) Exterior of Dick's Sporting Goods retail store including sign and logo.\n\nSource: George Sheldon via Shutterstock\n\nEarlier this year, retailer Dick’s Sporting Goods (NYSE:DKS) raised its dividend by 10%. Dick’s now pays a quarterly dividend of $1.10 per share, giving it a yield of 2.02%. A year earlier, the company doubled its dividend payment to $1 a share. Dick’s Sporting Goods continues to prioritize its dividend as it reports record financial results. DKS stock has gained 12% since the company’s last print at the end of May.\n\nSo far in 2024, Dick’s stock has risen nearly 50%. The company most recently reported Q1 EPS of $3.30 versus $2.95, which was expected among analysts. In the first three months of this year, revenue totaled $3.02 billion versus $2.94 billion, the consensus forecast on Wall Street. Sales rose 6% from a year earlier. Management attributed the strong results to consumers spending more on sneakers and athletic gear.\n\nDespite the big run higher, DKS stock still trades at a reasonable valuation of 18 times future earnings estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "The Only 7 Data Center Stocks Investors Need In Order to Capitalize on AI",
        "content": "It’s hard to argue against the notion that artificial intelligence (AI) is the biggest opportunity that most of us will ever see in our lifetimes. AI is already changing the way humans work and will continue to do so. AI is not only changing work, it is also changing all aspects of society. Name something humans do and AI is likely being applied to improve that process. That said, the current biggest opportunity appears to be in data centers, at least for stock investors.\n\nData centers account for the majority of demand for AI chips at this point. Thus, investors should simply follow the money in order to capture returns. These companies are investing heavily in AI and have tremendous opportunities to grow as AI matures.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock represents the parent company of Google. The two names are used synonymously but for the purpose of ease I’ll just use Google. Anyway, Google is one of the biggest data center stocks and represents a clear opportunity to capitalize massively on AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA report from a few months ago is very telling. It noted that Google is pouring billions into increasing its overall data center footprint. That investment includes several massive capital outlays for data centers across the United States. It also includes plans for substantial data center investments in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, Greece, Norway, Austria and Sweden.\n\nEssentially, Alphabet is rapidly investing to build out the infrastructure necessary for its AI aspirations. It is one of several important hyperscaler companies with the resources to capture a significant portion of the AI market.\n\nInvestors should expect Google to continue thriving throughout 2024, especially in light of its strong first-quarter results. Ad revenues are again strong and those results, along with the data center investment, imply that the stock is a strong buy at the moment\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up nearly 20% in 2024. A lot of that strong performance is attributable to the company’s future opportunity in AI. The company is heavily promoting its recent investment in data centers, sending a strong signal to markets.\n\nAmazon is set to spend an average of $10 billion annually over the next 15 years to retain its dominant cloud position. The company announced the $150 billion bet in late March. The heavy capital infusion will go toward creating the necessary resources to handle an anticipated spike in AI application demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is unloading the majority of that capital infusion early on. The company has already announced well over $20 billion in data center project investments in 2024. The company is also directing some of that investment toward the creation of wind and solar farms. That is unsurprising as data center energy consumption is rapidly increasing. Companies like Amazon have also promised to reduce their carbon emissions. They will therefore rely on clean energy sources including solar and wind to power the increased data center footprint.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has capitalized on the AI boom as well as any company. The stock exploded upward in 2023, primarily as a result of its investment in OpenAI. Microsoft’s heavy connection to the ChatGPT creator gives the company a strong head start in AI over many of its competitors.\n\nWhile that shrewd investment sent shares skyrocketing in 2023, 2024 has been slower. Microsoft stock is up a very respectable 13% during the year, but that remains somewhat behind the growth of its peer group.\n\nData center investments may be the catalyst to propel it upward again with greater velocity. In April it was reported that Microsoft had more than 5 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity at its disposal. Microsoft added 500 megawatts of that overall capacity since July of 2023. The company intends to add one additional gigawatt of capacity during the first half of 2024. In 2025, Microsoft intends to add an additional 1.5 gigawatts of data center capacity during H1.\n\nMicrosoft continues to gobble up the AI GPUs necessary for use in those data centers. It’s news to no one, but Microsoft continues to be an excellent AI stock.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who have been paying attention know that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also placed its bets on AI digital infrastructure this year. That’s an excellent reason to invest in the stock at this time.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 it was reported that Meta Platforms expected to spend between $30 to $37 billion on digital infrastructure investments in 2024. That was an increase of $2 billion over previous expectations at the high end. When the company released first quarter earnings in late April, that range increased again to between $35 to $40 billion.\n\nIf AI is truly the next groundbreaking opportunity then it’s clear the infrastructure required to process the workloads is the current prime opportunity. If it weren’t, the Meta Platforms of the world wouldn’t be so rapidly increasing their data center investments.\n\nInvest in Meta Platforms because its ad business is again thriving but understand that the company is making massive headway in relation to AI. That investment promises to strengthen what is already one of the  strongest companies globally.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quickly become the most important AI stock. Investors are well aware that the company’s chips dominate AI and remain in high demand. However, those same investors may not realize how important data center opportunities are to Nvidia overall.\n\nThose investors who do dig a little bit deeper will quickly realize that data center revenues are far and away the primary driver for Nvidia. Company-wide revenues grew by 18% during the most recent quarter, reaching $26.0 billion. $22.6 billion of those revenues were attributable to data center sales. All of the aforementioned hyperscaler companies above continue to gobble up Nvidia’s chips for use in their data centers.\n\nNvidia’s gross margins continue to grow and are fast approaching 80% overall. Margins at that level suggest incredible economics at the company. Nvidia benefits from a clear competitive advantage that makes it highly investable even today With prices above $1,200 per share. Shares will trade for much less by the time you read this as the company will have affected a stock split that lowers the price. That promises to increase liquidity which should drive demand higher, sending prices higher in the process.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is clearly the riskiest stock on this list of data center investments to capitalize on AI. Share prices have risen from $285 at the beginning of the year to a high of $1,200 mid-March. They have since retreated to $800 but there’s reason to believe that now is time to invest again.\n\nSuper Micro Computer leverages leading chip technology, integrating it into modular plug-and-play AI-enabled hardware currently in high demand. That includes Nvidia’s newest Blackwell GPU chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s hardware like its AI SuperCluster will continue to be in high demand for data center applications. The company is one of the newer and more interesting generative AI plays available to investors.\n\nI would argue that now is an excellent time to pick up Super Micro Computer following Nvidia’s recent strong performance. Nvidia’s earnings report should have sent a wave of relief across the markets in relation to AI. I believe that relief will manifest as renewed demand in companies like Super Micro Computer moving forward.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the more risk-averse investor looking to capitalize on data center AI, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is an excellent stock choice. The company sells Internet Protocol (IP) networking equipment and touches heavily on data center products overall.\n\nIt is one of the first investments to consider for those seeking income from the tech sector. Cisco Systems includes a healthy dividend yielding nearly 3.5%. So, investors should consider it for the combination of stable income and strong data center/AI exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, Cisco Systems also recently launched a $1 billion dollar AI fund aiming to take stakes in upstart AI companies. That investment exposes Cisco Systems to Greater future growth potential which could in turn increase the income its stock provides.Furthermore, Cisco Systems is working hand in hand with Nvidia to simplify the deployment of generative AI applications.\n\nCSCO shares continue to represent an excellent and safe investment in AI growth that won’t keep you up at night while also exposing you to secular growth across AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The metaverse is still alive and well, creating big opportunities for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy. IKEA, for example, is launching a virtual universe on Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). Its “The Co-Worker Game,” which will allow users “to live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.” Users inside the game will be able to virtually help customers and get promoted, just like in the real world.\n\nA McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald’s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nHugo Boss (OTCMKTS:BOSSY) is heading to the metaverse with Roblox to market to Generation Z. Nike (NYSE:NKE) is working with Roblox with its virtual world. Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) is working with Roblox, too.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to Market.us, the metaverse market could be worth about $2.3 trillion by 2032. That being said, investors should consider jumping into some of the best metaverse stocks to buy. Here are three you may want to invest in now.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox. Granted, recent earnings and full-year booking forecasts weren’t so hot. It posted an EPS loss of 43 cents, which beat by 10 cents. Bookings of $923.76 million, up 19.4% year over year, missed by $5.34 million.\n\nIt also offered a weaker-than-expected bookings forecast, expecting bookings of $870 million to $900 million. That was below expectations of $902.5 million. It also lowered its full-year bookings forecast to between $4 billion and $4.1 billion, which is down from its prior outlook of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion.\n\nHowever, despite the weak bookings forecast, Roblox did raise its full-year sales outlook, now seeing full-year revenue of between $3.45 billion and $3.53 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Also, despite recent negativity, traders are bidding the RBLX stock higher.\n\nIn fact, since earnings, RBLX rallied from about $30 to $36.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $169, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is gaining momentum.\n\nFor one, the artificial intelligence story is still heating up. Two, demand for AMD chips is only expected to gain momentum. According to AMD’s CEO Lisa Su, the company expects to see about $4 billion in AI chip sales, an increase of $500 million from prior estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree, analysts at Edward Jones just initiated a “buy” rating on AMD. Analysts at Jefferies also initiated coverage of AMD with a “buy” rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nAMD plays a big role in the metaverse, too. After all, companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundHill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nYou can always take the exchange-traded fund (ETF) route with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nFor one, after bottoming out around $11.40, the METV ETF rallied back to $13.08, where it’s still a “strong buy.” From here, I’d like to see the ETF closer to $20 a share, especially with the metaverse story heading up again.\n\nFurther, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF is the world’s largest metaverse fund and should benefit from two key areas of growth. These include that the Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033. And, VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to name a few of the top ones.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock",
        "content": "In this article, I will outline three of the reasons why I hold a bullish position on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. These reasons are tailwinds in advertising spending, cloud potential, and the stock’s reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet has performed relatively well in 2024, delivering nearly twice the return you would have received by investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This performance aligns with the company’s growth expectations, particularly in its key markets, such as advertising, where AI innovations in Google Search are being incorporated.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that certain segments, such as the cloud, are overlooked by the market when assessing Alphabet’s future potential. This might be why the stock is traded at reasonably valued multiples compared to other major tech companies.\n\nPoised to Benefit from Tailwinds in Advertising Spending\n\nAlphabet currently holds the title of the most dominant advertising company globally, and the digital advertising sector is poised for significant growth in the years ahead.\n\nAccording to projections, digital advertising spending worldwide is expected to surge from $679 billion in 2023 (with 40% specifically in search advertising) to $965 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%. With Alphabet leading the pack in digital advertising, it stands to reap substantial benefits from this upward trajectory.\n\nDigital advertising offers distinct advantages over traditional linear advertising. It enables more precise measurement of results and facilitates targeted advertising to specific audiences, rendering it a more appealing option with significantly higher returns from both business and marketing perspectives.\n\nGoogle Search, with its commanding market share in the search engine sector, and YouTube, boasting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, are pivotal assets bolstering Alphabet’s competitive edge. The incorporation of generative AI features, such as products leveraging LLMs (large language models) to match ads to relevant searches, enables users to find answers to more complex queries and increases usage and satisfaction with the results.\n\nGoogle Cloud Potential\n\nAccording to Alphabet’s management, the Google Cloud segment and YouTube are anticipated to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by 2024.\n\nIn pursuit of this goal, the company has committed to investing in infrastructure, especially servers, nearly doubling its capital expenditures to $12 billion in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Despite the Google Cloud segment operating at a loss in recent years due to reinvesting all profits into growth, Alphabet’s cloud computing business remains in a growth stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the segment reported an operating margin of 9% and generated $900 million in operating income in Q1 2024 (see below), this likely has not yet translated into free cash flow, in my opinion (Alphabet doesn’t disclose the segment’s free cash flow figures). Source: Alphabet’s Q1-2024 Report\n\nFor comparison, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS boasts an operating margin of around 37%. As Alphabet strives to enhance the efficiency of Google Cloud through its investments, achieving margins akin to AWS could result in the company generating billions in annual operating income from this segment. This would represent a significant source of profit beyond its core search business.\n\nA Fairly Priced Big Tech Stock\n\nDespite a 26% increase in its stock price year-to-date, Alphabet maintains a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its main big tech peers.\n\nConsidering a consensus that implies roughly 30% EPS growth for Alphabet this year, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23x, which is the lowest among its “Magnificent 7” peers. This includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which trades at 25x and is much more discounted than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the member of this group that’s trading at the highest multiple of 67x.\n\nWhen considering cash flows, Alphabet’s price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio over the trailing 12 months stands at 20x, slightly above Amazon’s 19x and Meta’s 16x, based on its $2.19 trillion market cap. Despite this, I still find this valuation reasonably justified. Alphabet continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, which should drive future expansion. However, these investments negatively impact short-term cash flows, resulting in a higher P/CF multiple.\n\nRegardless, Alphabet has strong net profit margins (nearly 26%), an effective monopoly in its core search business, and a pristine balance sheet within an industry approaching a trillion dollars in value and continuing to grow. These factors would typically justify a higher valuation multiple, but that is not necessarily the case for Alphabet right now.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish about the future of Alphabet stock, with the consensus rating being a Strong Buy, and 32 out of 37 analysts recommending buying GOOGL. The average GOOGL stock price target is $197.67, implying upside potential of 12.2%.\n\nAmong the bulls, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth asserts that GOOGL deserves a Buy rating due to confidence in the company’s ability to enhance its products with generative AI technology. This enhancement is anticipated to significantly boost revenues, supported by the company’s ability to invest in key growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, thanks to its strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere are numerous reasons to maintain a bullish stance on Alphabet that extend beyond just three factors. Still, to reiterate, I firmly believe that the company’s dominant position and its ongoing investment efforts in search will yield significant returns as the industry continues to experience robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, I find that other segments, such as cloud computing, are still undervalued by the market, and there is substantial potential for value creation as investments lead to even stronger cash flows in the future.\n\nWhen considering these factors alongside the company’s attractive valuation compared to other big tech firms, I maintain a highly bullish position on Alphabet stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg’s ‘year of efficiency’ at Meta has spread to the company’s upper ranks and incompetent VPs are next to be culled",
        "content": "Nobody is safe from Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s now permanent efficiency measures, not even the company’s upper echelons.\n\nAs of last year, Meta employed an army of 300 vice presidents staggered into five levels of seniority that are now the prime targets of Zuck’s efficiency cuts, Business Insider reported, citing three people with knowledge of the company. In previous years, there were half as many VPs at Meta, Business Insider noted, and Zuckerberg reportedly wants to slice the roster down to 250.\n\nThe VP massacre comes after Zuckerberg first declared 2023 the “year of efficiency” last February, which resulted in more than 20,000 layoffs that year, according to BI. Zuckerberg later made the changes permanent after witnessing employees “execute better and faster,” and promised a “leaner” operating structure that included a flatter hierarchy.\n\nTo help cull supposedly lagging VPs, Meta is leaning on midyear performance reviews and formal annual performance reviews usually conducted in the first quarter. VPs who don’t measure up to their peers through a process called “stack ranking” are likely to get the ax.\n\nThe VPs are also under the microscope of their superiors, who under company rules are required to label 10% to 12.5% of their reports as underperforming. The tactic could lead to these employees being put on a performance improvement plan and then being laid off.\n\nA spokesperson for Meta declined to comment and referred Fortune to a February Facebook post by Zuckerberg where he went into detail on Meta’s earnings and added that his “year of efficiency” changes would become “a permanent part of how we operate.”\n\nZuckerberg’s productivity measures stand in stark contrast with Meta’s growth of between 20% and 30% every year prior. But since Meta started its layoffs last year, it hasn’t stopped, and other big companies including Google, Microsoft, and Tesla also joined in. Overall more than 250,000 tech employees were laid off last year, according to Layoffs.fyi.\r\nZuckerberg’s risk in making the major job cuts has been rewarded by investors over the past year. Some analysts have lauded the CEO’s efforts, including those at MoffettNathanson, who in a research note candidly wrote: “Mr. Zuckerberg is a capitalist after all.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy in the Wake of Nvidia’s 10-for-1 Split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently completed its much-anticipated 10-for-1 stock split. That means traders who held one share of Nvida at around $1,200 per share now own ten Nvidia shares trading at around $120 per share. Investors have started considering other stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split. Given the reduced barrier for buying whole shares, it is typical for share prices to increase in the days and weeks following a split.\n\nA stock split also signals management confidence in the company’s long-term outlook. Nvidia’s shares rose modestly on the first day of trading after the split. However, several analysts adjusted their price targets upward.\r\n\r\nThe broader sentiment appears to be that confidence remains strong about the ongoing growth of artificial intelligence (AI). While some debate exists around whether this growth constitutes a bubble, most analysts do not believe it is near bursting.\n\nGiven Nvidia’s leadership position, its actions will likely impact other companies within the sector. Its success has even led to discussions about replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Competitors like Intel may face challenges, but other firms could find opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Nvidia is attractive because it sells AI cards, then the semiconductor manufacturer producing the chips needed for those cards deserves attention. The less prominent TSM (NYSE:TSM) counts Nvidia as its second-largest customer. Even if rivals start designing and manufacturing their own AI servers, they will still likely require TSM for chip production.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on its own AI chips and is TSM’s largest customer. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are also said to work on custom chips and are TSM customers. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) chips are also manufactured by TSM. In other words, if an AI requires a chip to function, it likely has a TSM component, making this a logical consideration as one of the AI stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese semiconductor foundry trades at a relatively affordable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.3x for a technology company, just over half of Nvidia’s 71.6x. Analysts overwhelmingly have a positive outlook for TSC stock, with a history of exceeding estimates. Taiwan semi also offers shareholders a more generous dividend yield of 1.5% compared to Nvidia’s minimal 0.035%.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Nvidia’s recent stock split, looking for chip stocks in the 5G and data centers sectors is prudent. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) designs AI chips and infrastructure that major technology firms use. The company has seen solid gains, but analysts believe there is further upside potential thanks to expected growth in custom AI chips.\n\nMarvell provided strong guidance in its latest earnings report, expecting 8% revenue growth in a single quarter and an even stronger second half of the year. Despite lacking a P/E ratio following its reported losses, its forward P/E of 51.16x suggests investors are willing to pay the premium after Nvidia’s stock split.\r\n\r\nWhile the company remains unprofitable, analysts are optimistic about the MRPV stock and anticipate reporting its first profits in the second quarter. The average price target is $88.92 per share, representing a 26% upside from the current price. Its 52-week high hovers marginally lowered at $85.76 per share, still offering a 22% upside.\n\n​Arista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cloud networking solutions provider is one of the ancillary beneficiaries of the surge in AI demand. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) high-performance networking solutions and data center switches are integral to building out AI systems, making them an essential element of the expansion of AI.\n\nAs one of the stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split, the company is targeting revenue from its AI solutions business to reach $750 million next year, becoming the largest component of its sales. That’s up from near nothing just two years ago. The company saw its EPS grow by 44% over the last year, with its gross margin up to 63.7% from 59.5% as it leverages into the higher-margin AI segment.\r\n\r\nEven considering this growth, the company still maintains a relatively appealing P/E ratio of 41.3x, just below the average for the tech sector at 45.2x. Analysts recommend buying the stock, with most setting an average price target of $319.29 per share.\r\n\r\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Billionaire Israel Englander’s Top Stock Pick for 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 5th in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses.  To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control.  A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\n\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”\n\nThe FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,  13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\n\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) Billionaire Israel Englander's Top Stock Pick for 2024?\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nMeta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander’s Stake Value:$1,196,554,582\n\nRaymond James recently upgraded Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) shares citing the company’s generative AI ambitions. The firm’s analyst Josh Beck increased his price target on the stock to $550 from $525. Why is Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta’s earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Instagram boss Adam Mosseri reveals he argued a lot with Mark Zuckerberg in the early years, which he describes as ‘bad career advice’",
        "content": "Instagram’s chief, Adam Mosseri, has shared a glimpse of what it's like to report to Meta’s mastermind, Mark Zuckerberg.\n\nMosseri has enjoyed a rapid rise at the social media giant since since joining Facebook in 2008, and although the pair clearly get on now, the product designer-turned-head of Instagram revealed that their relationship wasn’t always smooth sailing.\n\n\"We argued a lot in the early years,\" Mosseri said. \"I remember pushing back a lot on a number of random unimportant design specifics.\n\n“He was very results-focused and I cared about things I still care about now, but I didn’t care enough about other things. “He was pushing me hard on the things I didn’t care about enough that I should have cared about.\n\nLooking back at his “26-year-old hotheaded self”, he added that defying what’s important to your boss is “probably not good career advice.”\n\nBut now, Mosseri insisted that he has learned how to better balance what he holds dear at work with whatever’s at the top of Zuckerberg’s priority list.\n\n“Mark is very consistent,\" Mosseri said on the podcast The Colin and Samir Show. \"He is always going to hold a really, really high bar. He's always going to push you really, really hard. He's always going to have very high expectations.\n\n“You can, when you've worked with anybody for long enough, start to anticipate what their feedback's going to be, what they care about.\n\n\"So as long as you make sure you embrace that in addition to embracing whatever you believe in and how you want to approach the role, you have to find that balance.\n\n“With Mark, I have that balance most of the time.”\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDzhA_UFrnA&ab_channel=ColinandSamir\n\nHow Mosseri built his success\n\nBefore joining the tech world, Mosseri had the far less glamorous experience of washing dishes and waiting tables.\n\nHe graduated from New York University in 2005 and worked as a product designer and UI engineer for TokBox for two years before getting his big break at Facebook.\n\nIn the 16 years since, he’s scaled the company’s ranks from the bottom to the top, and he credits being a jack of all trades and “reliable” for his success.\n\n“I wasn’t very good, I just had a lot of range,” Mosseri said. “I’m decent at a strangely large number of things—and I think that has really helped me.”\n\nHe was made head of Instagram following the resignation of the app’s founders in 2018, six years after Zuckerberg bought it for $1 billion, and has been unofficially placed in charge of Meta’s new darling, Threads.\n\nOn his transition from product design to management, he continued: “Being more of a generalist is more advantageous.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Being an executive is a very generalist type of role, so my career really accelerated when I leaned into that and was honest about what I wasn’t good at.”\n\nFortune reached Meta for comment.\n\nThe lesson: Work on what your boss cares about\n\nMeta’s CTO Andrew \"Boz\" Bosworth similarly worked his way up the ranks.\n\nHaving started out as one of Facebook’s first engineers before being plucked out for promotion after promotion, Bosworth said the difference between him and his peers wasn’t simply who could work the hardest.\n\nIn an interview on Lenny's Podcast, Bosworth revealed that he worked 120 hours a week and didn't sleep more than four hours consecutively a day for two years.\n\n\"There are other people who do the exact same thing, maybe they worked harder, maybe they were smarter, maybe they did better,\" he cautioned. \"And it didn't play out for them and it's a big sacrifice.\"\n\nInstead, like Mosseri, he credits his success with putting himself forward for projects that are important to his boss and a result ending up under the “Eye of Sauron”—otherwise, Zuckerberg’s beady watch.\n\n\"If it's the most important thing, you're going to get a smaller piece. Everyone wants to be there,\" Bosworth advised. \"Get the piece that you can crush, kill, do a great job at, and grow from.\"\n\nThe Facebook veteran also recommended volunteering to help out in an area that the company isn't paying a lot of attention to, but is still really important to the business.\n\n“As an executive, when there's a huge dam holding up the floodwaters, you respect the heck out of that person who is holding that dam up.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?",
        "content": "President and CEO of Nvidia Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, 2 June 2024. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nEarlier this week Nvidia (NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split, following its original announcement in May. This means the company's share price is now trading around its lowest level since late 2022.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) firm is the sixth member of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to announce a stock split just this year, up from four in 2023.\n\nAnalysts believe this is a sign of more to come in the technology sector.\n\nThey have pointed to Meta Platforms Inc (META) as one of next companies to possibly announce a stock split. The tech conglomerate, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp is the only firm in the “Magnificent Seven” that has not yet split shares.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrading at over $500 a share, Meta is considered “ripe for a split,” Ken Mahoney, president of Mahoney Asset Management, said.\n\nMeta’s stock has surged more than 450% from its 2022 low, driven by AI interest, buybacks, and a new dividend.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nWhat is a stock split?\n\nA stock split is a decision by a company's board of directors to increase the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders (without diluting the value of their stakes).\n\nThe number of outstanding shares rises and the price per share decreases proportionally, while the market capitalisation and value of the company stays the same.\n\nFor example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, a shareholder receives an additional share for each share held. So, if a company had 1 million shares outstanding before the split, it would have 2 million shares outstanding after a 2-for-1 split.\n\nIn Nvidia's case, the company split its shares on a 10-for-1 basis based on the closing share price on Friday 7 June of $1,210. Shareholders were awarded 10 shares for each of their existing shares, and the stock was trading at around $120 per share on Monday 10 June.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, reverse stock splits happen when a company reduces the number of shares outstanding, thereby raising the market price of each share.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy do they happen?\n\nStock splits often result in a share price increase as small investors and employees perceive the stock as more affordable. Retail traders in particular find this appealing as they may only be able to buy shares in full on their trading platforms or within ISAs, with limits on buying fractional shares.\n\nCompanies often perform stock splits to make their stock more accessible to a wider range of investors,” explains Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro. “A stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy.\"\n\nLower share prices are also useful to companies when it comes to remunerating staff members with share options. The move also brings a company's share price to a similar range to others in the same sector.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\nStock splits can often improve trading liquidity, effectively boosting demand for the stock and driving up prices.\n\nAnother possible reason for the price increase is that a stock split provides a signal to the market that the company's share price has been increasing over time — people may assume this growth will continue in the future. This further lifts demand and prices.\n\nReverse stock splits often happen when a company wants to meet the minimum requirements to remain listed on an exchange. Firms can get ousted off an exchange if their price drops too far, so the move can help a company survive and recover from a rough patch.\n\nRecent stock splits\n\nSeveral high-profile stock splits have taken place this year including Walmart (WMT), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Lam Research (LRCX), Sony Group (SONY), Amphenol Corporation (APH), and Cintas (CTAS).\n\nRetailer Walmart announced a 3-for-1 stock split on 30 January, and completed its first split in 25 years after the market closed on February 23, while Chipotle Mexican Grill approved a 50-for-1 split on March 19, which will take effect after the closing bell on 25 June.\n\nCorporate identity uniforms company Cintas approved a 4-for-1 stock split on 2 May 2and shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis after the market close on 11 September.\n\nSony's board greenlit a 5-for-1 stock split last month, which goes into effect on 8 October, while electronic components firm Amphenol revealed a 2-for-1 forward split on 20 May, which was completed on 11 June.\n\nWafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research also approved a 10-for-1 stock split, which will become effective after closing bell on 2 October.\n\nRead more: The stock market rally has been all about large caps\n\nIt comes as Amazon (AMZN) has so far split its stock three times in its history. The latest one was announced in March 2022 on a 20:1 basis.\n\nOther big-tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have also carried out stock splits in the past.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nInvestors should weigh up stock splits on a case-by-case basis. Overall, historical stats indicate that they tend to outperform the S&P 500 index over the next 12 months, but of course it can all be subject to change.\n\nHowever, stock splits like Nvidia, and now potentially Meta, can make them more attractive candidates for the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Currently, no stock in the Dow index trades above $500 a share.\n\nThe Bank of America (BoA) (BAC) has already predicted more splits in the tech sector, including the likes of Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Netflix Inc (NFLX).\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "She was a top DEI manager at Facebook and Nike. Then the feds showed up at her door",
        "content": "By now, you’ve likely heard about the case of Barbara Furlow-Smiles.\n\nFor those not yet in the know, here’s a quick recap: Furlow-Smiles held prominent DEI roles at Nike and Facebook (now Meta) and was allegedly in the running for a role at Pixar before news broke that she’d been accused of stealing $5 million to fund a high-priced luxury lifestyle. In May, a judge sentenced her to five years in prison and ordered her to return the stolen funds.\n\nAt first glance, this seems like any other white-collar scheme. But in a deeply riveting and colorfully written feature, my colleague Lila MacLellan uncovers the humanity behind the crime and explores what led someone who, by many accounts, seemed to live comfortably—and made her name in a field that’s perceived as more values-driven and moralistic than others—to steal millions of dollars earmarked for underrepresented people.\n\nWhile the insider backstory is a fascinating one, MacLellan also teases out the racial elements and potential hypocrisy in how punishment is meted out to Black people. MacLellan spoke to several of Furlow-Smiles’s friends and former colleagues who argue that while the ex-DEI head is rightfully being held accountable for her crimes, her sentence is too harsh for behavior they view as rampant at large firms, especially in tech.\n\n“White executives commit wrongdoing and walk away with a multimillion-dollar package,” one professional friend of Furlow-Smiles told MacLellan. The rules, however, are different for people of color. “They can do whatever they want to do, but if you're Black, you keep your nose clean.”\n\nThe importance of a healthy organizational culture is also an undercurrent in this tale. Furlow-Smiles’s lawyers allege that she got caught up in what they describe as Facebook's move-fast and win-at-all-costs mentality.\n\nMeta declined to comment on its history with Furlow-Smiles, instead directing Fortune to a Department of Justice press release about the case. Nike did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nRead the full article here. I’ll get you started:\n\nIt was a cool, mostly cloudy Thursday in late October when two men in suits turned up outside the Portland home of Barbara Furlow-Smiles, a DEI executive between jobs. According to a sentencing memo that would be filed by her lawyers months later, Furlow-Smiles knew she was in trouble because, let’s face it, “no one wears suits in Oregon.”\n\nRuth Umoh @ruthumohnews\r\nruth.umoh@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How a powerful executive at Nike and Facebook secretly stole millions",
        "content": "It was a cool, mostly cloudy Thursday in late October when two men in suits turned up outside the Portland home of Barbara Furlow-Smiles, a DEI executive between jobs. According to a sentencing memo that would be filed by her lawyers months later, Furlow-Smiles knew she was in trouble because, let’s face it, “no one wears suits in Oregon.\"\n\nEight months earlier, Furlow-Smiles had been laid off from Nike, where she’d been the senior director of diversity, equity, and inclusion for more than a year. This role followed a nearly five-year stint in a similar job at Facebook (now Meta) in San Francisco. That fall day, she had just returned to Portland from a job interview with Pixar in Emeryville, Calif., and was at home with her daughter, who is nine.\n\nFurlow-Smiles was right to be worried about the well-dressed men in a city known for fleece. They were FBI agents who’d been investigating the former executive, 38, for stealing funds from her employers in a crime spree that began shortly after she joined Meta and continued for six years at two Fortune 100 companies.\n\nTwo months later, Furlow-Smiles pleaded guilty to wire fraud in an Atlanta federal court and admitted to siphoning $4.9 million from Facebook and more than $100,000 from the sports apparel maker through an elaborate scheme involving fake vendors and bogus expense reports. Her crime shocked the DEI community, already under fire from conservative groups who claim that corporate spending on diversity is wasteful and an affront to shareholder rights. Not only had Furlow-Smiles stained a mission-driven, justice-focused profession and pocketed millions earmarked for programs meant to uplift underrepresented people, but she did so at the worst possible cultural moment.\n\nA judge sentenced Furlow-Smiles to a five-year prison sentence in May and ordered her to return the stolen funds. (It’s unclear whether she has the money or enough assets to sell to do so.) In a pre-hearing letter to the judge, she said she takes full responsibility for the crimes and couldn’t explain how she “squandered” a dream career. But she also attributed her mistakes to an entrenched people-pleasing problem and a “savior complex” that caused her to lie to friends and family about having the means to support them financially. The complex, she added, was a coping mechanism she developed after surviving physical and sexual trauma as a child and teenager. “I am pleading for your mercy not as a dismissal of my actions but as an appeal to your understanding of human imperfection,” Furlow-Smiles wrote.\n\nStory continues\n\nFriends who have known Furlow-Smiles for years confirmed for Fortune that, from a young age, she strongly desired to give back to her community and the “village” that raised her, as her lawyers explained in their memo for the judge. “I see her as a Robin Hood,” said one friend, who requested anonymity because of the online backlash that Furlow-Smiles faced when news of her guilty plea went public last December. To this friend’s knowledge, her now-convicted chum used some of the stolen money to help friends and family in need. This acquaintance, who worked with Furlow-Smiles at an early job at Cox Communications and later at Facebook, also rejected the notion that Furlow-Smiles was motivated by greed. “She was well liked, well known. She made things happen,” she said, and people turned to her for support. When she heard the specifics about Furlow-Smiles’s crime, says the friend, “I thought, that’s Barbara trying to help too many people.”\n\nAt her sentencing hearing, Furlow-Smiles’s defense attorney, Lance Clarke, also depicted Furlow-Smiles as a woman who felt obligated to support friends and family who came to her with requests for aid. At the same time, the defense team wrote in their letter to the judge, Furlow-Smiles was a striver who got caught up in the “move fast and break things” culture at Facebook and made bad decisions under pressure. Accounts of Furlow-Smile's experiences and onboarding at Facebook that Clarke shared in the memo further suggest the actions Furlow-Smiles took to enrich herself were not entirely unusual at her former employer.\n\nIndeed, several of Furlow-Smiles’s friends and former colleagues similarly argued that while the ex-DEI head is rightfully being held accountable for her crimes, her sentence is too harsh for behavior they see as rampant at large tech firms and elsewhere. And as such, she shouldn’t be the only person facing penalties. (Meta declined to comment on its history with Furlow-Smiles and instead directed Fortune to a Department of Justice press release about the case. Nike did not respond to a request for comment.)\n\nJuliet Jacob, a formerly licensed therapist who has recently come to know Furlow-Smiles through a support group for women impacted by the justice system, told Fortune that she believes Furlow-Smiles is a high performer who developed ambition addiction. Our work culture is about \"performance at any cost,\" which can lead to an addiction for some and drive self-sabotaging and other wrongful behaviors., she said. But Jacob also thinks Furlow-Smiles was “low-hanging fruit” for federal prosecutors. “Women and people of color are often picked up for problems because they’re the easiest to reach,” said Jacob, who was formerly incarcerated for Medicaid fraud.\n\nStill, Furlow-Smiles understood the severity of her crimes before and after she was caught. In court, her lawyer told the judge that when the FBI agents first identified themselves, she almost fell into one officer’s arms, crying “not because she was afraid [but] because it was a sigh of relief, it was a weight that was lifted off her shoulders.” Finally, she was forced to stop.\n\nDream job, big budget\n\nGrowing up, Furlow-Smiles was one of the few Black people in the mostly white town of Katy, Texas. Census data from 1990 shows that only 5% of the town’s 8,000 residents identified as Black. In high school, when Furlow-Smiles asked for permission to create a Minority Heritage Club for non-white students like her, her principal initially declined, reportedly saying that if he approved it, he might one day be forced to say yes to a KKK club, according to a character reference letter submitted by one of Furlow-Smiles’s childhood friends. Furlow-Smiles persevered, eventually convincing the school superintendent of her support group’s necessity. It was her first win as a champion for inclusion.\n\nShe moved to Atlanta to complete a degree in political science at the prestigious historically Black Spelman College and completed a master's in public administration at Baruch College. She landed her first job in diversity and inclusion at MTV’s New York City headquarters, where she met the man who became her husband, and later moved to Atlanta to work at Cox Communications. When Facebook recruited Furlow-Smiles in 2017, the company asked her to move to San Francisco. She became the global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement, responsible for planning events around Black History Month, Pride, and other cultural and identity-related holidays. “She had been training her whole life for an opportunity like this,” her lawyers wrote in the letter to the court. “She firmly believed she could and would deliver for her community and make Facebook a better, more inclusive, diverse, and supportive space.”\n\nFurlow-Smiles excelled at her job, attracting a top-level “redefine” ranking in Facebook’s notoriously tough performance reviews, according to her defense team's statement. (Facebook said it could not confirm this as it does not share employee information.) “At Facebook, Barbara was a rock star. She put together a lot of programs that were seen worldwide,” said the friend who worked with her at Cox and followed her to Facebook, taking on a DEI role in an adjacent department. Furlow-Smiles won kudos for a virtual Juneteenth celebration in 2021, for which Facebook gave her a $10 million production budget. Her goal was to land a “big get” speaker, the sentencing memo said, and she delivered by booking Tina Knowles-Lawson, aka Beyoncé’s mother, as a guest speaker, among other notable Black figures.\n\nPrivately, Furlow-Smiles was struggling with anxiety and burnout. Soon after arriving at Facebook in 2017, she began experiencing new levels of pressure and exhaustion. The defense team claimed a litany of other factors contributed to her mindset at the time, including the high cost of living in San Francisco, the expectation that she maintain a standard of living that suited her role, and the ill health of her husband, Ernst. He had developed a rare autoimmune disease that would require extra medical expenses, and he was the primary caregiver for the couple’s daughter.\n\nFurlow-Smiles responded to these stressors by enacting various illegal schemes. According to the Department of Justice, she submitted invoices to Facebook from friends and family whom she passed off as vendors and then had those associates funnel most of their payments back to her. She also falsified expense reports and set up a system where actual vendors sent her kickbacks. The prosecution found that 39 people, who have not been publicly identified, were part of the fraud ring. They include babysitters, former interns, hair stylists, and Furlow-Smiles’s university tutor. It’s unclear how many understood the scam and their role in it. The prosecutor’s investigation is ongoing.\n\nThe FBI also determined that Furlow-Smiles linked her personal PayPal, Venmo, and Cash App accounts to her work credit cards and spent lavishly on herself and her family. She directed $18,000 to pay for her daughter’s preschool and spent $10,000 on “specialty portraits.”  Her kickbacks were delivered as cash, sometimes in person, or by mail or FedEx, and often camouflaged by decoy items, like t-shirts.\n\nHow the kickbacks began\n\nThe reasoning that Furlow-Smiles used to justify these crimes is contradictory at times. Her defense argued that Furlow-Smiles discovered a new world when she began working at Facebook, where controls were lax, and corporate leaders regularly pitched and produced multimillion-dollar projects with little oversight.\n\nWhile Furlow-Smiles was onboarding at Facebook, a colleague who formerly ran employee resource groups there told the new hire that Facebook’s culture was anti-corporate and that she didn’t need to be as strict about rules and expense limits as she had been at her previous job, according to the defense team's sentencing memo. “Why are you coming in with all these rules? As long as you’re doing what you need to do and perform, you’re good,” the colleague allegedly told Furlow-Smiles after she attempted to set up new expense guidelines for ERG members. That onboarding manager also suggested that Furlow-Smith have Facebook foot the bill for whatever was necessary to support her needs, especially as she juggled parenting and travel. “If your baby needs something, you get it, and you expense it,” this person allegedly said, the filing states. Furlow-Smiles was even led to believe it was acceptable to have Facebook pay for the cost of bringing her husband, daughter, and a babysitter on a work trip overseas. Facebook flagged the expense, according to the court memo, but Furlow-Smiles’s manager approved it when she explained her family’s situation and her husband’s illness.\n\nAnd yet, even though Facebook apparently approved of these steep expenses, Furlow-Smiles felt she wasn’t paid enough to live a lifestyle that would “put her in the same rooms” as people like Beyoncé’s mother and enjoy a high quality of life, her lawyers wrote. Facebook declined to give her a requested raise; the timing of her request is unclear. Court documents do not disclose Furlow-Smiles’s salary, but Glassdoor statistics suggest managers at Meta earn $227,000- $351,000.\n\n“She took her requests and justifications to her superiors and asked, ‘What do I have to do to get paid more here?’” her lawyers wrote. “Barbara was emotionally on the verge of having a nervous breakdown. She was reaching her breaking point from the pace, the pressure to deliver, and the constant need to innovate and one-up her own accomplishments. Unfortunately, Barbara’s raise never came, despite consistently outperforming her peers.”\n\nFurlow-Smiles pocketed the money she felt she deserved, justifying her transgressions by reminding herself that she gave Facebook her all.\n\nJust after starting at Facebook, Furlow-Smiles also discovered that her coworkers were friendly with vendors who supplied items like swag for company events or photography and other services. Several of her coworkers allegedly relied on vendors to provide kickbacks, according to the sentencing letter. “It was the norm,” her lawyers wrote.\n\nAt one point early in Furlow-Smiles’s tenure at the social media giant, a vendor pulled her aside and propositioned her, per the sentencing document. The vendor explained that they went to school with one of Furlow-Smiles’s colleagues and had set up a kickback arrangement with that person. Would she like to set up a similar deal? Furlow-Smiles turned down that offer but took note of the opportunity to earn extra money. Then, she learned from members of Facebook’s recruiting team that they often received invoices for millions of dollars that they paid dutifully, even though they didn’t know what product or service the vendor had provided. According to her recollection, and as stated in the sentencing memo, the invoices often didn’t even include contact information.\n\nFurlow-Smiles came to understand that what mattered most was getting the job done at whatever cost. When she was later propositioned again, “it became easier to say ‘yes’ to these things,” she told her lawyer.\n\nAndi McNeal, chief training officer at the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, says these types of rationalizations—claiming that everyone is doing it or feeling entitled to taking money one believes is owed them—are exceedingly common in cases of white-collar crimes. People frequently find themselves in a perfect “fraud triangle” storm. They feel financial pressure, have an opportunity to commit fraud, and are able to rationalize it.\n\n“Most fraud perpetrators see themselves as good, law-abiding citizens,” McNeal said. Though one can’t blame company culture for a personal choice or use it as a legal defense, a workplace riddled with ethical breaches, and Facebook has weathered several such crises, can set a tone that makes it easier for people to find the emotional excuse they need to do the wrong thing.\n\nFurlow-Smiles’s lawyers allege this was true at Facebook, writing, “Normal employee behavior at Facebook was relative, and, from the top down, money stealing and scandals were woven into the Facebook fabric.” They claim this culture ensnared leadership, pointing to the controversy surrounding former Meta COO Sheryl Sandberg, whom the company investigated for using corporate resources to plan her wedding. (The status of the investigation has not been publicized and Meta did not immediately respond to a request for comment.)\n\nAgain, this is the part that goads Furlow-Smiles’s former colleagues about their friend’s case: It feels cosmically unfair. A professional friend and fellow DEI leader who once worked with Furlow-Smiles and asked for anonymity says that, in his experience at large firms, fudging expenses and receiving payback for setting associates up with vendor contracts is a common practice by executives. “I’ve seen it in plenty of places, across industries, including in tech,” this person said. “I’ve seen leaders paying their country club for whatever, and it’s disguised as a charitable donation.”\n\nWhite executives commit wrongdoing and walk away with a multimillion-dollar package, he noted. But the rules are different for people of color. “They can do whatever they want to do, but if you're Black, you keep your nose clean.”\n\nIn Furlow-Smiles’s case, he charged that people above her must have known what was happening or been involved. “There are several chains of approval that those things need to go through,” he said. “The reality is [DEI] is not a revenue-generating space, so every dollar has to be accounted for.”\n\nFor a Black woman to be invited into a boys club in tech where everyone is blurring the lines and making unethical choices creates another tricky dynamic, he added, because a woman like Furlow-Smiles might fear being fired for speaking up and doing the right thing. “These crimes are not 100% on her,” he said.\n\nDuring the sentencing hearing, Furlow-Smiles’s attorney referenced some beneficiaries of the fraud scheme who allegedly threatened to report Furlow-Smiles if the money stopped flowing. Clarke, her attorney, did not respond to a request for more information about that claim and court documents that might contain details are sealed.\n\n\"Beyond the pale\"\n\nWhen it came time for her sentencing, Furlow-Smiles’s personal history and the environment she described at Facebook could not offset an essential fact: The size of the fraud was massive. Neama Rahmani, a former federal prosecutor who is now a private practice criminal defense attorney in Los Angeles, says this fraud is “beyond the pale.” No matter what her defense team argues, he said, there is no gray zone here.\n\nThe median amount companies lose in fraud cases is $145,000, according to the Association of Certified Fraud Examiners, but the average amount lost is much higher at $1.7 million. That’s because long-running scams have an outsized impact on averages, while most fraudsters are caught long before they can cause millions in damages. Furlow-Smiles’s crime was more than twice as large, and it’s unclear how much of the $5 million Facebook and Nike will be able to recover.\n\nThe impact of these crimes also went beyond financial considerations. Furlow-Smiles promised young individuals she knew from her past that participating in her scheme would enhance their career prospects, prosecutors explained in a letter to the judge. Instead, those young people are now viewed as possible accomplices in a massive crime operation, with their professional futures tarnished by Furlow-Smiles's deceit.\n\nOne such victim is a young man Furlow-Smiles met while serving as his college intern coordinator at Cox Communications. Furlow-Smiles stayed in touch with him after he graduated. Once she was at Meta, she hired the former intern to do personal work for her and to complete “projects for Facebook,” the prosecution wrote in a court filing. She then invited him to work under her as a vendor when she moved to Nike. There, “she continued to promise him guidance, assuring him that he would be able to maintain his connections at Facebook,” the document stated, adding, “She not only stole money that was earmarked for DEI programs, but she also manipulated those who respected and held her in high esteem to fuel her greed.”\n\nAt Furlow-Smiles’s sentencing, Assistant U.S. Attorney Stephen McClain noted that the former executive had flown some of her associates and mentees to Los Angeles, where they withdrew $10,000 from several ATMs to make it difficult to trace it to her. “It was very elaborate and she did cover her tracks pretty well,” McClain said. “That resulted in her receiving millions of dollars in cash kickbacks both in person, ATM, and mailing.”\n\nMeta and Nike, in their victim statements, underlined the human cost of Furlow-Smiles’s actions, according to the sentence hearing transcript, stating that colleagues had trusted her and felt “anguish” after they were made aware of her duplicity.\n\nSometime before Furlow-Smiles left Facebook, the company became aware of Furlow-Smiles’s ruse (it’s unclear how) and launched an internal investigation of its DEI manager gone rogue. The tech giant downloaded data from her phones and computers to piece together the fraud’s reach before calling law enforcement. “It was hard to figure out who was being paid and what they were being paid for. But [Facebook] did an internal investigation and then presented the results to us,” McClain said during the sentencing hearing. By that time, Furlow-Smiles had already landed a job at Nike, where she began working in the fall of 2021. This was a chance for Furlow-Smiles to start anew, but she began committing what McClain called a “brazen” fraud immediately.\n\nIn early 2023, Nike laid off Furlow-Smiles during a restructuring that saw the departure of other DEI professionals. Her former coworker recalls that Furlow-Smiles was among the first to start receiving calls from recruiters that year. “I even had someone reach out to me about her because they knew that we were friends,” the person said. “I connected them.” In the course of those conversations, the DOJ published its press release about Furlow-Smiles pleading guilty to fraud.\n\nThose job talks ended.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Digital Advertising Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Today, we discuss three of the most undervalued digital advertising stocks to consider in the second half 2024. The digital advertising landscape continues its relentless expansion. As consumers spend more time glued to their screens, brands fiercely compete for attention across websites, social media platforms and mobile apps. This has fueled a surge in digital ad spending, with Statista projecting it to reach a staggering $870 billion globally in 2027.\n\nFor investors seeking a slice of this growing pie, the challenge lies in identifying undervalued opportunities. While established giants like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) dominate the market, numerous smaller players are also carving out their niches. These companies are capitalizing on emerging trends and thus offering investors the potential for substantial returns. In this article, we’ll explore three undervalued digital advertising stocks for your June 2024 portfolio.\n\nMagnite (MGNI) trade desk stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFirst on our list of most undervalued digital advertising stocks is Magnite (NASDAQ:MGNI). The company operates a notable independent sell-side advertising platform, connecting publishers with advertisers. Additionally, it offers advertisers access to premium ad space across the web, mobile apps, Connected TV (CTV) and audio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMagnite reported robust results for the first quarter of 2024. Revenue increased 15% year-over-year (YOY) to $149.3 million. Net income surged 38.8% to $7.98 million, while adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 25% to 5 cents. The CTV segment stood out, with contributions excluding Traffic Acquisition Costs (ex-TAC) growing 18% YOY to $55 million.\n\nInvestors were pleased when Magnite announced a deal with Mediaocean, a platform for omnichannel advertising. This partnership aims to streamline CTV and Online Video (OLV) ad buying for Mediaocean’s Prisma platform users. As a result, this exclusive partnership leverages Magnite’s ClearLine solution to provide Prisma buyers with direct access to premium video sellers’ inventory.\n\nSo far, in 2024, MGNI stock has surged more than 40%. Yet, shares are reasonably valued at 13.2x forward earnings and 2.8x sales. Analysts have a 12-month price target of $16 for MGNI, signaling a 22% upside.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nNext, we discuss Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU) as one of today’s most undervalued digital advertising platforms. The company offers popular hardware devices that enable users to access a vast library of streaming services. Beyond hardware, Roku operates its own Roku Channel, featuring a curated selection of free and ad-supported content. This dual approach allows the company to capture revenue from device sales and advertising on its platform. Furthermore, Roku leverages user data to provide targeted advertising solutions, generating an additional revenue stream.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku’s first quarter 2024 earnings report highlighted several key achievements. The company reported a 14% YOY increase in streaming households and a 23% rise in streaming hours. Platform revenue grew by 19% to $881 million. Meanwhile, net loss and net loss per share declined around 75% to $50.9 million and 35 cents, respectively.\n\nRoku and the advertising tech giant The Trade Desk (NASDAQ:TTD) have recently announced a strategic partnership to enhance TV streaming ad experiences. This collaboration empowers advertisers using The Trade Desk platform to leverage Roku’s user data and audience insights.\n\nDespite these positive developments, ROKU stock has slumped 37% year-to-date (YTD) and is trading 2.3 times sales. Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $74.30 for ROKU, suggesting a nearly 29% upside.\n\nDoubleVerify Holdings (DV) graphic of laptop screens displaying ad space. advertising stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRounding out our discussion on the most undervalued digital advertising stocks is the digital advertising industry watchdog DoubleVerify Holdings (NYSE:DV). The company provides a software platform for digital media measurement, analytics, essential verification and brand safety solutions. DoubleVerify utilizes advanced technologies to detect and prevent ad fraud. Additionally, the company aims to safeguard brand reputations by filtering out inappropriate or unsuitable advertisement content placements.\n\nIn early May, DoubleVerify reported strong financial results for the first quarter of 20 in early May 24, surpassing analyst expectations. Total revenue grew 15% YOY to $140.8 million, driven by double-digit growth in activation and measurement solutions. Due to higher expenses, net income and diluted EPS dropped around 42% to $7.16 million and 4 cents, respectively. The company also highlighted strong growth ithe n social and international measurement revenue segments.\n\nDoubleVerify recently announced that it has secured Media Rating Council accreditation for video viewable impressions within the CTV space. This achievement strengthens DV’s position as a leader in CTV measurement by ensuring data accuracy and transparency.\n\nYet, despite these developments, DV stock has plunged more than 50% YTD.  As a result, the shares are trading at 33.9 times forward earnings and 5.5 times sales. Finally, analysts remain bullish, setting a 12-month price target of $31 for DV, signaling almost 70% upside.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTezcan Gecgil, PhD, began contributing to InvestorPlace in 2018.

        "title": "Have $10,000? 3 Growth Stocks on Track to Double by 2028",
        "content": "Growth stocks have always captured investors’ attention due to their potential for explosive returns. As we look ahead to 2028, several growth stocks will potentially double in value.\n\nThese companies typically operate in high growth sectors, such as technology, healthcare and renewable energy. Investors recognize this robust potential, showcased through their strong market positioning, revenue, earnings and free cash flow growth. These companies often reinvest their profits to spur further innovation and expansion. This provides ample opportunities to buy these companies on the dip if you have a long-term investment horizon.\n\nNow, let’s unpack the top 3 growth stocks on track to double by 2028.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSpotify (SPOT) Spotify (SPOT) app on smartphone iPhone 13 Pro screen on green background.\n\nSource: Diego Thomazini / Shutterstock.com\n\nSpotify (NYSE:SPOT) is undoubtedly one of the top growth stocks to double by 2028. While its growing user base and profitability are good signs, its incredible pricing power capabilities are taking the spotlight.\n\nSpotify has been off to an incredible start so far in 2024. The stock is up 64% YTD, as Wall Street is starting to recognize its long-term potential. While the company lost money in the 2023 fiscal year, its revenue increased 13% from the year prior. Additionally, its annual subscribers grew 20% year over year to a staggering 220 million. Spotify’s monthly active users (MAUs) are growing sequentially, driven by an expanding base in emerging markets.\n\nFurthermore, Spotify’s operating margins increased by 243 basis points to 27.6% in its latest quarterly results. This was accompanied by strong double-digit growth in MAUs and premium subscribers. The company’s recent announcement to raise prices on multiple premium subscription plans further showcases its pricing power capabilities. As the tide turns in 2024, Spotify’s increasing profitability makes it one of the top growth stocks to double by 2028.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) has emerged as one of the best growth stocks to buy and hold for the next decade. As a pioneer in artificial intelligence and machine learning, Palantir’s expertise is just beginning to get a taste of the commercial market in 2024.\n\nDuring Palantir’s early IPO days, it often had the reputation as a one trick pony. This is largely due to its reliance on government contracts that has spurred the company’s growth since its founding in the early 2000’s. However, the narrative is beginning to shift as a result of their growing commercial platform. After achieving its first year of GAAP profitability in 2023, CEO Alex Karp forecasts this trend to continue. Moreover, their AIP Platform is showing a lot of promise thus far, with commercial revenues outpacing government revenues in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1 FY24, commercial revenue increased 27% year over year, compared to government revenue increasing 16% year over year. The company has also achieved its 6th consecutive quarter of GAAP profitability. With management forecasting free cash flow in the $800 million to $1 billion range in FY24, the sky is truly the limit.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), formally known as Facebook, is a social media and advertising powerhouse. The company’s cost-cutting efforts in 2023 have paid off tremendously. Additionally, its strategic investments in the metaverse and artificial intelligence provide ample room for growth through 2028.\n\nMeta Platforms family of Apps, including Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger, continues its growth streak. Their user growth metrics remained strong in the first quarter of 2024, with daily active people up 7% year over year to 3.24 billion. The company is also benefiting from increased spending in the advertising market after its slump in the back half of 2022.\n\nBusinesses have been more aggressive in their advertising spend as the prospects of lower interest rates and a strong economy fuel confidence. Its CFO Susan Li, reiterated that it will commit between $35 – $40 billion in infrastructure costs in 2024. This will go toward developing its AI roadmap and enhancing its AI-powered features across the family of apps. With Meta issuing its first ever dividend of $0.50 per share earlier this year, its next stage of growth looks extremely promising.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks Primed for a June Boom",
        "content": "Most of the narrative among equity investors right now centers on growth stocks. Questions about whether interest rates will decline, how robust spending will be, and the AI boom apply to a wide range of higher-growth companies in specific industries. This dynamic hasn’t really changed over the past decade or so, but it’s also a trend that appears to be accelerating.\n\nIn June, we received plenty of data to suggest that job growth (at least in the U.S.) remains strong, and macro data is pointing to a “good news is bad news” type of setup for interest rate cuts. While the market is pricing in one to two cuts this year, it’s clear that higher for longer is indeed here to stay.\n\nIf that’s the case, investors may want to focus on companies with the most robust growth prospects that can be sustained in any environment. These are three growth stocks that fit the bill.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify’s (NYSW:SHOP) stock price has certainly fluctuated greatly over the past year, with the stock taking a recent hit after the company announced earnings. Despite robust growth and stable financials, many seem to view Shopify as more cyclical (which makes sense). With interest rate cuts pushed out, this is an e-commerce play many aren’t viewing as favorable right now.\n\nRevenue continues to grow, as does the company’s user count. With notable technological improvements, including the introduction of new AI features, Shopify’s growth trajectory could improve in the coming quarters. The company’s consistent growth in recent years can be tied to strong trends in the global e-commerce space, which is forecasted to grow at an 11.2% pace annually from 2023 to 2027.\n\nFor those who believe in the long-term secular growth catalysts underpinning this sector, Shopify remains a top pick to consider because of its double-digit growth rate and ability to see valuation multiple expansion if macro conditions improve.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome of the most notable news around semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is that it just surpassedApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in market capitalization, surging above the $3 trillion mark. Its share price surged to more than $1,200 per share (pre-split) driven by expectations of continued growth driven by AI investments from the company’s growing list of clients. Nvidia now trails only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in terms of valuation and could theoretically eclipse the software giant’s valuation if this kind of stock price appreciation continues.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, trees don’t grow to the sky, but Nvidia’s recent revenue and earnings growth has been off the charts. The company has provided investors with triple-digit growth on both the top- and bottom-lines, and the demand underpinning this growth appears very robust.\n\nThe company’s H100 AI processor, introduced in 2022, costs between $25,000 and $40,000 and remains in high demand. The successor, Blackwell B200, cost $10 billion to develop and is expected to be four times as powerful, priced at $30,000 to $40,000. Despite high share prices and skepticism around its valuation, Nvidia consistently outperforms expectations. The AI catalysts we’re seeing are very real for companies like Nvidia, and this is a stock investors looking to play a growth-driven rally during this cycle should be in.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a prominent trillion-dollar mega-cap company with quite the turnaround over the past couple of years. Last year’s focus on efficiency has translated into strong fundamentals, and investors continue to see this growth continue into Q1 of 2024. Meta posted a net income that doubled year-over-year and revenue growth of 27%. Those numbers alone speak to the efficiency story the company is chasing.\n\nThe company is now increasingly focusing on monetizing messaging apps by introducing free AI chatbots on WhatsApp. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to evolve his strategy around monetization with its suite of apps, integrating AI into the company’s portfolio in a way that makes sense. Over time, I expect these moves to generate strong revenue growth and improved monetization, which could mean we’re still in the early innings of this fundamentals-led rally in META stock.\n\nThe launch of AI-driven ad targeting on WhatsApp has signaled a significant shift. This approach leverages user behavior from Facebook and Instagram for optimized message delivery. This approach is crucial for businesses paying for messages to reach receptive users. For those bullish on the long-term prospects of the social media space and Meta’s ability to continue to integrate AI and improve its monetization efforts, this is a company that looks reasonably valued relative to its growth outlook.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL stock spiked +7% today to fresh 52-week highs after the renowned iPhone maker announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iconic product line and services.\n\nWith that being said, investors may certainly be wondering if it's time to buy Apple’s stock with its operating system getting an innovative makeover.\n\nApple Intelligence Overview\n\nJoining the lineup of big tech companies that are accelerating and utilizing the capabilities of artificial intelligence through generative AI chatbots, Apple joins Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT in this regard.\n\nSiri, Apple’s iconic voice-embedded virtual assistant will be upgraded with AI chatbot features as part of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI platform that will be integrated into the iOS 18 which is the next-generation operating system that will power its iconic devices including the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and smartwatch.\n\nRecent Performance & Valuation\n\nSoaring to over $200 a share on Tuesday, Apple’s stock is now in positive territory for the year and sitting on +7% gains. Although this has slightly edged the benchmark S&P 500, Apple has underperformed Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft’s stock with the tech-centric Nasdaq up +15% for the year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt current levels, Apple’s 29.3X forward earnings multiple is a slight premium to the P/E valuation of Meta Platforms and Alphabet along with the benchmark’s 21.7X but is beneath Microsoft’s 36.3X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Apple’s total sales are now expected to be virtually flat in fiscal 2024 but are projected to rise 5% in FY25 to $405.81 billion. Notably, Apple’s top line is more robust than any of its aforementioned big tech peers with the closest being Alphabet whose total sales are expected to cross $300 billion next year.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple’s annual earnings are projected to be up 7% this year and are forecasted to rise another 9% in FY25 to $7.21 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nWhile it’s far too soon to say Apple may be at another inflection point due to its artificial intelligence offerings, AAPL does land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, there could be better buying opportunities after the smoke clears from the recent rally atttribued to the announcement of Apple Intelligence and the collaboration with OpenAI.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- An uptick in the number of companies enacting stock splits this year has Wall Street looking at who could be next — with some analysts pointing to Meta Platforms Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Apple’s ‘AI for the Rest of Us’ Plan Gets Lukewarm Reaction NYC Landlord to Sell Office Building at Roughly 67% Discount Russia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine\n\nMeta is the only stock in the so-called Magnificent Seven that hasn’t ever split shares. And, though the stock is off all-time highs hit in April, it’s up more than 450% from a 2022 trough.\n\nTrading at more than $500 a share, “Meta is ripe for a split,” said Ken Mahoney, president of Mahoney Asset Management, referring to what’s seen as a key level for investors. The stock has benefited from appetite for AI exposure, buybacks and the introduction of a dividend in the past year.\n\nMeta shares slipped as much as 0.7% in early trading Tuesday.\n\nSplitting shares doesn’t change underlying fundamentals for a company, but does lower the price per share. This can make a stock more appealing for smaller retail investors and employees, who may otherwise be deterred by high share prices. It could also make top technology stocks more likely candidates for potential inclusion in the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average — currently, no stock in the index trades above $500 a share.\n\nThe practice is back in focus after Nvidia Corp. shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis Monday, following its announcement of a 10-for-1 split in May — with the stock up 28% since then. The artificial intelligence company is the sixth member of the S&P 500 to announce a stock split this year, up from four in 2023.\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America think it’s a sign of more to come in the technology sector. Nvidia’s split marks the fourth Magnificent Seven company to make such a move since 2022 — the others are Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc. and Tesla Inc. — and Apple Inc. did its own share split a few years earlier, in 2020.\n\nBank of America recently identified potential candidates for stock splits including technology companies such Broadcom Inc., Lam Research Corp., Super Micro Computer Inc., KLA Corp. and Netflix Inc. The analysts also noted that Microsoft Corp., though not near $500 a share, could be poised for a stock split as it hasn’t done one in more than two decades.\n\nTo be sure, splitting shares doesn’t guarantee outperformance; some 30% of stocks that split shares saw negative returns 12 months later, according to Bank of America. In addition, an analysis from Trivariate Research found that megacap companies that split shares had mixed results in the next year, highlighting slumps in Tesla after its most recent split and Nike Inc. after its 2015 split.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc. took the wraps off long-awaited new artificial intelligence features, including a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, betting that a personalized and understated approach to the technology will win over customers.\n\nBillionaire Elon Musk said he would ban Apple Inc. devices from his companies if OpenAI’s artificial intelligence software is integrated at the operating system level, calling the tie-up a security risk. British personal computer maker Raspberry Pi shares jumped on its first day as a public company, offering a boost to London’s struggling market for new stock listings. Saudi Aramco’s venture capital arm has deployed more cash to Tenderd, a United Arab Emirates-based firm backed by Peter Thiel, which uses AI-generated insights to help reduce emissions. A California lawmaker has dropped his proposed ban of social media app TikTok on state government devices as a result of a federal law that forces its parent company to sell its app or be shut down in the US.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nOracle\n\n(Adds stock move at market open in fourth paragraph.

        "content": "Market momentum continues to carry equities higher. On June 6, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at another record high, led by technology stocks. With rates backing off, growth stock picks will continue to rally.\n\nThere is a strong case for growth over value. Notably, growth outperformed value since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Due to low rates near zero, investors were willing to pay for growth. Although rates have risen sharply, we are still in the sweet spot for growth.\n\nEconomic data is robust, with the U.S. economy adding 272,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations. Another highlight was the June 7 Atalanta GDPNow model projecting 3.1% real GDP growth in the second quarter. As long as there is economic growth, corporate earnings will be healthy and in support of growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stock picks have material upside due to their industry-leading earnings-per-share growth. At first glance, they look overvalued on a price-to-earnings basis. However, when assessed on the best metric for growth stocks – price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) – they are cheap.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Chinese new year lanterns in china town\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis Chinese e-commerce giant is one of the top growth stock picks. Despite the naysayers, PDD Holdings (NYSE:PDD) is advancing its reach beyond China with tremendous success. A successful entry into Europe and the U.S. will turbocharge the stock higher.\n\nThe e-commerce retailer launched Temu in the U.S. in 2022, to much fanfare. After an aggressive marketing blitz on sites like TikTok and Instagram, it’s winning over American shoppers. Analysts at Goldman Sachs point to the $1.2 billion it splashed on ads on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) sites in 2023. It also ramped up ads on other channels, with its Super Bowl ads drawing keen interest.\n\nData suggests the aggressive campaign is working and Temu is taking share from some competitors. Indeed, analysts noted that it has emerged as a threat to discounters like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).\n\nTo be sure, PDD Holdings is reaping the rewards of its low-priced products and viral marketing approach. Revenues soared, with Q1 revenues increasing by 124% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per American depositary share growth was also off the charts at 199%. At a forward PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.33, PDD stock is one of the best bargain growth stock picks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) stack of Amazon (AMZN) delivery boxes at a front door\n\nSource: Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn this bull market, one of the best growth stocks to buy is economic bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This retail and tech giant extends its reach to key sectors of the economy. It’s the largest e-commerce retailer and its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, leads the industry by market share. Furthermore, its digital advertising business is the third-largest by market share, bringing in $49 billion in revenues on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this firepower, Amazon will continue to compound for decades. After all, it has two massive tailwinds pushing the stock higher: e-commerce penetration and adoption of cloud computing. These multi-year tailwinds make it one of my favorite growth stock picks.\n\nAnother catalyst for the stock is a downshift in capital expenditures and management efforts in cost efficiencies. Its retail division is coming off a peak investment cycle and moved to a regional fulfillment network that has lowered costs to serve. Besides, management plans to increase cost efficiencies by integrating automation and artificial intelligence.\n\nRiding on the back of these initiatives, Amazon will see substantial earnings growth. Wall Street analysts expect 56% and 26% earnings growth in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In parallel with this view, analysts are very bullish, with a median price target of $221.\n\nShift4 Payments (FOUR) The word \"INSIDER\" displayed in a blue and green ticker tape.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most bullish signals for a stock is massive insider buying. That’s exactly what Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) CEO Jared Isaacman has been doing. Over the past year, he has executed several purchases with no sales.\n\nCurrently, this is one of the top growth stock picks based on management’s guidance for 39% EBITDA growth in 2024. Over the years, Shift4 Payments adopted a roll-up strategy acquiring point-of-sales systems and payment processors. With these attractively priced acquisitions, it has expanded geographically.\n\nShift4 Payments has shown impressive growth across all verticals. In Q1 2024, its SkyTab point-of-sale system saw remarkable growth due to increased awareness and its value proposition. Installs grew 38% quarter-over-quarter, with 9,400 installs in the quarter. As a result, end-to-end payment volume rose by 50%.\n\nDue to the value proposition offered by the SkyTab product suit, it continues to add restaurant customers. Another significant boost has been entering new verticals, particularly sports and entertainment. It recently announced deals with sports franchises like the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago White Sox.\n\nLastly, Shift4 is implementing the same playbook in Europe, where it’s massively underpenetrated. Notable wins in Q1 included Leonardo hotels with hundreds of locations in the U.K. and Europe and the FC Barcelona stadium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in FOUR but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The stock market rally has been all about large caps",
        "content": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nBespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC) into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by market cap size. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year.\n\nTo Bespoke, this shows the recent trend in markets has generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\"\n\nThe move into large-cap stocks comes as investors have scaled back bets on interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports.\n\nThe larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected.\n\nThat's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" — which includes the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE) — grew 39% compared to the S&P 500's 5.9% year-over-year growth. The NVIDIA logo and the Apple logo are pictured in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province, China, June 6, 2024. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\nThis fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growth have become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon.\n\n\"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit — a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nHe added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\"\n\nThe top-heavy AI trade\n\nBigger stocks are also winning the AI trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade.\n\nThe team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date.\n\nNotably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA (NVDA), that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Nvidia stock rises after 10-for-1 stock split",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the shares' Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The stock closed up nearly 1% in its first day following the split.\n\nThe split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform, called Blackwell Ultra, is coming in 2025 as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Nvidia shares are up about 27% since the company announced its split on May 22.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Apple debuts Apple Intelligence AI platform for iPhone, Mac",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) announced its long-awaited generative AI initiative called Apple Intelligence during its WWDC conference in Cupertino, Calif., on Monday. The technology, Apple's first step into generative AI, will be deeply integrated across the company's hardware and software products ranging from the iPhone and Mac to Mail, Messages, and Photos.\n\nApple is positioning Apple Intelligence as a unique offering that can understand you and your data, rather than a broad-based AI system like ChatGPT or Google's AI Overview.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer later this fall.\n\nThe biggest changes are coming to Apple's Siri. The original smartphone voice assistant, Siri has been in desperate need of a fresh coat of paint for years, and Apple Intelligence will offer just that. The company says the assistant will feature a new look, feel more natural, and be more responsive.\n\nLike other generative AI-powered assistants, you'll be able to ask follow-up questions and interrupt yourself while making requests. Siri can now respond to requests via typed text if you don't feel like making them out loud. You'll also be able to ask Siri to use ChatGPT, rather than Apple's own models to make requests.\n\nApple says its updated version of Siri is more context-aware of Apple products, allowing you to ask questions about how different features and settings work and get accurate responses. Onscreen awareness will let Siri understand and take action about things on your screen. So, if a friend sends an address in Messages, you can have Siri save it for you. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during an announcement of new products on the Apple campus in Cupertino, Calif., Monday, June 10, 2024. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nApple is specifically pushing Siri's ability to understand users' own data. For instance, you'll be able to ask questions like \"Show me photos of Stacy in New York wearing a pink coat,\" and the assistant will provide you with the exact photo you're looking for from your Photos app. You can then tell Siri to move the photo to another app, such as an email in Mail. These requests will also work across third-party apps.\n\nIf you need to pick up someone at the airport, you can ask Siri when the person lands, and it will find the flight information the person previously shared with you in Mail and check real-time flight tracking data to determine when you should hit the road.\n\nBeyond Siri, your devices can now prioritize your notifications to bring up the most important notes and minimize less relevant ones. Writing tools can rewrite, write, or summarize information for you, automatically available across Notes, Mail, and a host of third-party apps. You'll be able to create generative AI images of people, places, and animals across your apps in three different styles.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple says many of its generative AI models will run on-device, though some will need to access the cloud. But because Apple has traditionally eschewed forcing people to use cloud-based services when it comes to their private data, the company says it has developed a new cloud service called Private Cloud Compute.\n\nPrivate Cloud Compute servers are specially created using Apple Silicon with built-in privacy capabilities. When you make a request, Apple Intelligence determines if it can complete it using on-device processing or if it needs to connect to the cloud. Apple, however, says it won't store any of your information used to complete Apple Intelligence requests in the cloud.\n\nWall Street has been anxiously waiting for Apple to debut its generative capabilities ever since Microsoft (MSFT) announced its OpenAI-powered Bing chatbot, now called Copilot, in 2023. Google (GOOG, GOOGL) quickly followed Microsoft's lead with its Bard chatbot, which it subsequently renamed Gemini. Social media giant Meta (META) has also incorporated AI into its platform offerings via behind-the-scenes recommendation software and its Meta AI chatbot.\n\nBut the companies have struggled with their AI rollouts as well. Google's Bard famously debuted with an advertisement showing the incorrect answer to a prompt and its Gemini image generator app showed historically inaccurate images of individuals from different time periods. More recently, its big AI Overview rollout, a major initiative meant to transform its all-important Search platform, drew jeers after it generated results telling people it was safe to eat rocks and add glue to their pizza.\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, debuted its Copilot+PC standard for laptops and desktops ahead of its Build conference, as well as its new Recall app for Windows 11. The software is meant to take a screenshot of virtually everything you use on your computer to help you pull up apps and information you've previously used. But the app was blasted as a potential security nightmare, forcing Microsoft to update the software before releasing it to the public, make it opt-in rather than on by default, and enhance its security.\n\nMeta, for its part, faced heavy criticism for not allowing consumers to turn off the Meta AI chatbot in the company's apps.\n\nThose hiccups haven't exactly slowed the companies down, but Apple is a different beast altogether. The iPhone maker has built up a reputation for itself based on security and software that, largely, works out of the box. If its generative AI efforts suffer from similar flaws as Google and Microsoft's, it could have a negative impact on the brand's reputation.\n\nMoreover, a flub by Apple could hurt generative AI's image more broadly. After all, if three of the world's biggest tech companies can't roll out a new kind of software without major problems, then can users really trust generative AI?\n\nApple still has time to work on its Apple Intelligence offering before it hits users' devices sometime this September.

        "content": "LONDON (AP) — Meta wants to use data from users in privacy-conscious Europe to train its artificial intelligence models, the social media giant said Monday as it faces concerns about data protection while battling to keep up with rivals like OpenAI and Google.\n\nThe company, which owns Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, said that in order to better reflect the “languages, geography and cultural references\" of its users in Europe, it needs to use public data from those users to teach its Llama AI large language model.\n\nMeta's AI training efforts are hampered by stringent European Union data privacy laws, which give people control over how their personal information is used. Vienna-based group NOYB, led by activist Max Schrems, complained last week to 11 national privacy watchdogs about Meta’s AI training plans and urged them to stop the company before it starts training Llama's next generation.\n\nAI language models are trained on vast pools of data that help them predict the most plausible next word in a sentence, with newer versions typically smarter and more capable than their predecessors. Meta's AI assistant feature has been baked into Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp for users in the U.S. and 13 other countries, but notably not Europe.\n\n“If we don’t train our models on the public content that Europeans share on our services and others, such as public posts or comments, then models and the AI features they power won’t accurately understand important regional languages, cultures or trending topics on social media,” Stefano , global engagement director of Meta's privacy policy, said in blog post.\n\n“We believe that Europeans will be ill-served by AI models that are Frattanot informed by Europe’s rich cultural, social and historical contributions.”\n\nFratta said other companies including Google and OpenAI have already trained on European data. Meta won't use private messages to friends and family nor content from European users who are under 18, he said.\n\nSince May 22, the company has sent 2 billion notifications and emails to European users explaining its plans and linking to an online form to opt out, Fratta said.\n\nThe latest version of Meta's privacy policy is set to take effect on June 26, indicating that training for the next model will start soon after.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "WASHINGTON (AP) — The Supreme Court said Monday it will consider shutting down a multibillion-dollar class action investors' lawsuit against Facebook parent Meta stemming from the privacy scandal involving the Cambridge Analytica political consulting firm.\n\nThe justices agreed to hear Meta's appeal of a lower-court ruling that allowed the class action to go forward. Investors allege that Meta did not fully disclose the risks that Facebook users' personal information would be misused by Cambridge Analytica, a firm that supported Donald Trump’s successful Republican presidential campaign in 2016.\n\nInadequacy of the disclosures led to two significant price drops in the price of the company's shares in 2018, after the public learned about the extent of the privacy scandal, the investors say.\n\nThe case will be argued in the fall.\n\nMeta already has paid a $5.1 billion fine and reached a $725 million privacy settlement with users.\n\nCambridge Analytica had ties to Trump political strategist Stephen Bannon. It had paid a Facebook app developer for access to the personal information of about 87 million Facebook users. That data was then used to target U.S. voters during the 2016 campaign.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The US Supreme Court agreed to consider killing a multibillion-dollar shareholder lawsuit that accuses Meta Platforms Inc. of misleading investors about the data-harvesting scandal involving political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Macron and Scholz Get Trounced by Far Right in EU Elections Putin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine Macron Gambles on Snap French Election in Bid to Stop Le Pen Singapore Banks Probe Rich Clients After Laundering Case\n\nThe justices said Monday they will decide whether a federal appeals court was wrong to let the lawsuit go forward based on allegations that the company, then known as Facebook, inflated share prices by inadequately disclosing the risk that its user data would be misused.\n\nThe investors say revelations about the scandal contributed to two 2018 price drops that cost the company more than $200 billion in market capitalization.\n\nThe case could reset the legal rules governing corporate disclosure. Business groups led by the Chamber of Commerce urged the court to take up the case, saying that risk-disclosure allegations “have contributed to a wave of meritless securities-fraud suits.”\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission since 2005 has required companies to disclose material factors that would make an investment risky.\n\nThe first hint of the Cambridge Analytica controversy came in December 2015, when The Guardian reported that the British firm was using a database of information gleaned from Facebook users to help the presidential primary campaign of Senator Ted Cruz. At the time, Facebook said it was investigating.\n\nThe suing shareholders say Facebook quickly concluded that Cambridge Analytica had obtained the private information of more than 30 million users without their consent.\n\n‘Shock and Fury’\n\nBut the shareholders say the company publicly characterized the risk of a breach as hypothetical and didn’t change that stance until March 2018, when it issued a statement to preempt more far-reaching stories in The New York Times and The Guardian. The investors say those revelations caused the share price to plunge.\n\n“The public reacted with shock and fury,” they argued in court papers. “Many expressed dismay that Facebook had been aware of the breach for years but failed to disclose it to the public or affected users.”\n\nThe shareholders say the company’s inadequate disclosures also contributed to a July 2018 stock plunge that at the time was the largest one-day drop in value in US history.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals said the allegations were sufficient to let the lawsuit go forward.\n\nMeta says it didn’t have any reason to think the scandal would harm the company because details had already been published without any impact on the stock price. Meta says the 9th Circuit’s reasoning would require companies to disclose risks that occurred years earlier even if they don’t pose any known current threat of business harm.\n\n“The 9th Circuit’s rule reflects a misguided conception of falsity and the nature of risk, and it flies in the face of Congress’s efforts to rein in private securities lawsuits,” Meta argued.\n\nThe company could face a $2 billion settlement if it can’t keep the case from going to trial, according to Matthew Schettenhelm, an analyst for Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nThe high court will hear arguments and rule in the nine-month term that starts in October.\n\nThe case is Facebook v. Amalgamated Bank, 23-980.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "content": "Investing in blue-chip stocks this summer is a smart choice for any investor who wants to grow their portfolio. By buying stocks that represent established, financially sound companies, blue-chip stocks offer stability that investors can count on to anchor their holdings.\n\nSo far in 2024, the S&P 500 is up 12% and the Nasdaq Composite jumped 14%. However, the Dow Jones Industrial Average, which includes many blue-chip stocks, has only increased by 3%. So, choosing which blue-chip stocks to buy is of paramount importance. In today’s market, I would favor blue-chip stocks that have a technology background.\n\nGiven the current market conditions, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite posting significant gains, there are advantages to including the best blue-chip stocks into your portfolio. We’ll use the Portfolio Grader to identify the best blue-chip stocks to buy, based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBy choosing blue-chip stocks with a proven track record, stability, and potential for long-term growth, you will set yourself up to have a profitable summer investing season.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is one of the best blue-chip stocks you can buy. They don’t get any bigger than Microsoft — the company has a market capitalization of more than $3.1 trillion, making it the most valuable company in the world.\n\nAnd you can make the argument that they don’t come any better than Microsoft, either. The company’s Microsoft Office 365 suite of products is used by businesses and individuals around the world and includes some of the most popular software on the planet, including Word, Excel, PowerPoint and Outlook.\n\nThe company’s Microsoft Teams platform allows co-workers to share files on Microsoft’s cloud, collaborate and have both one-on-one and group meetings — an essential component for doing business in a hybrid work environment.\n\nMicrosoft also has an important partnership with OpenAI, the developer of the generative artificial intelligence product ChatGPT, and was an early adopter in incorporating generative AI into its products.\n\nEarnings for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 included $61.9 billion in revenue, up 17% from a year ago. Net income of $21.9 billion and earnings per share of $2.94 was a 20% increase from last year.\n\nMicrosoft is continuing to show a growth mindset that bodes well for today’s investor. The stock is up 14% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ;GOOG;NASDAQ:GOOGL) is an outstanding name in itself. It has tremendous advertising power through its Google search engine, which maintains about 90% of global search traffic.\n\nThat makes the Google platform one of the most important places for advertisers to target with their messaging.\n\nAnd that’s a huge money-maker for Alphabet. Revenue in the first quarter of the year just from Google search was $46.1 billion, up from $40.3 billion a year ago. Alphabet also got another $8 billion in revenue from YouTube ads and $7.4 billion from its Google Network.\n\nAll in all, Google services and advertising accounted for $70.3 billion of the company’s $80.5 billion in revenue for the quarter.\n\nAnd true to the nature of a blue-chip stock, Alphabet also is starting to pay a quarterly dividend, with 20 cents per share payable to shareholders of record on June 10. It’s the company’s first dividend, but management indicates that it intends to at least maintain the quarterly payout in the future.\n\nGOOG stock is up 32% since March and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere must be something in the water these days, because Alphabet isn’t the only blue-chip tech company that is starting to pay a dividend. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced in February that it would begin paying a dividend, and the first payment of 50 cents per share went out on Feb. 21.\n\nIt’s notable that tech companies are making dividend payments because they have been solely focused on growth — increasing market share, position and pumping revenues into new products to grow the business.\n\nBut a quarterly dividend payout indicates that the company sees value in its shareholders as well, and is one of the hallmarks of a true blue-chip company.\n\nMeta Platforms has plenty of money to keep the dividend going, as well. The owner of the Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp platforms saw revenue in the first quarter of $36.4 billion, up 27% from a year ago.\n\nNet income was $12.3 billion, an increase of 117% from last year, and EPS was $4.71, up from $2.20 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nMETA stock is up 39% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInternational Business Machines (IBM) The IBM 5160 is a version of the IBM PC with a built-in hard drive. Released on March 8, 1983. The 5100 series are knowns as one of the first home computers.\n\nSource: Twin Design / Shutterstock.com\n\nYou have to consider International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) a blue-chip stock when you consider its history.\n\nIt’s one of the most well-known names in computing, tracing its history back for generations and punch-card based data processing machines in the 1880s.\n\nIBM was responsible for the first electronic computer, launched in 1943, and the first personal computer in 1981.\n\nBut it doesn’t get to be a top-rated blue-chip stock just for its history. Today’s IBM remains relevant by being one of the biggest cloud infrastructure providers on the planet. It offers its Watson AI engine and the Watsonx generative AI platform to enterprise customers.\n\nFirst-quarter earnings saw $14.5 billion in revenue, which was up 1% from a year ago. Net income was $1.6 billion, however, up 69% increase from last year. EPS of $1.69 was up 66% from the first quarter of 2023.\n\nIBM expects full-year revenue growth in 2024 in the mid- single digits, and expects to generate roughly $12 billion in free cash flow for the year.\n\nThe stock is up 3% so far this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) The Netflix (NFLX) logo on a tablet with earbuds and a bowl of popcorn nearby.\n\nSource: Riccosta / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) doesn’t have the long history of IBM boasts. But for a streaming service, Netflix is one of the oldest and best — and it’s still performing well.\n\nNetflix dates its history to the days of video rental stores. It emerged as a disruptive force by allowing customers to rent movies by mail — and they could keep them as long as they wanted.\n\nWhen they wanted to watch something different, all they had to do was send the movie back in the pre-paid envelope and choose something else.\n\nThe convenient business model utterly destroyed the video rental store business, but Netflix continued to evolve into a streaming service that offered movies and reruns of TV programming, as well as original content.\n\nEven after other streaming services emerged as competition, Netflix remains the gold standard. Netflix reported 269.6 million paid memberships in the first quarter, up 16% from a year ago.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $9.3 billion, up from $8.1 billion a year ago. Net income was $2.3 billion and $5.2 per share versus $1.3 billion and $2.88 per share in the same quarter a year ago.\n\nNFLX stock is up 33% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) isn’t a technology company, although it uses tech to its advantage to operate its warehouses, manage supplies and interact with customers. It also has a growing e-commerce presence that is heavily reliant on technology.\n\nBut what makes Walmart a blue-chip stock is its position as a brick-and-mortar retailer. It’s the biggest retailer in the world, with more than 10,800 locations that includes every U.S. state and two dozen countries.\n\nWalmart’s low-cost strategy is ideal as customers are looking to stretch their dollars in an inflationary environment. Walmart artificially keeps the prices of its own brands low to force name-brand suppliers to lower their prices as well. And because Walmart has so many stores, it has unmatched negotiating power in pressuring name brands.\n\nRevenue in the first fiscal quarter of 2025 was $161.5 billion, up 6% from the previous year. That include e-commerce says that were up an impressive 21%.\n\nWalmart also issued revised full-year guidance that indicates the company should come in at the high end or slightly exceed its prediction that net sales would increase 3% to 4% for the year. The company also says it may exceed its EPS prediction of a range between $2.23 to $2.37 for the year.\n\nWMT stock is up 27% this year and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nEli Lilly & Co. (NYSE:LLY) is a top biotech company that offers a range of drugs and treatments. But it’s getting the most attention for its entry into the popular field of weight loss drugs.\n\nAbout 42% of the U.S. population is obese, and there are hundreds of diet programs, weight-loss schemes and products on the market for people who want to drop some pounds. But it wasn’t until November 2023 that the Food and Drug Administration finally approved Lilly’s drug, Zepbound, as a treatment specifically to help people lose weight.\n\nAbout 1 in 3 people who took the injectable drug at its highest dose (15 mg) report losing more than 58 pounds over a 72-week period.\n\nThe drug in Zepbound, tirzepatide, is also used in another highly successful Lilly product called Mounjaro, which is used to treat type 2 diabetes.\n\nThe drugs are so popular that Lilly is increasing its investment in its Indiana manufacturing facility from $3.7 billion to $9 billion to increase the production of tirzepatide and other pipeline products.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $8.76 billion, up 26% from a year ago thanks to Mounjaro, Zepbound, Verzenio and Jardiance. Income of $2.2 billion was up 67% from last year, and EPS of $2.48 was an improvement from $1.49 in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nLLY stock is up 43% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in MSFT and LLY.

        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock from its Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat's sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform called Blackwell Ultra is coming in 2025, as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Here's My Best Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock, and It's Not Even Close",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is all the rage on Wall Street these days. While there's a good chance AI technology will end up changing many aspects of the world around us, it could be a slower process than some anticipate. Many companies have discussed AI, but far fewer are seeing real-world results.\n\nAI chip superstar Nvidia is the most obvious exception, but is it the best AI stock you can buy today? I don't think so. One stellar AI company isn't getting nearly the same level of spotlight: Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). It may be known more for its social media empire, but CEO Mark Zuckerberg is leaning hard into AI technology, which makes it a long-term wildcard for investors.\n\nHere's why Meta Platforms is by far the best AI stock you can buy today.\n\nMeta is putting its weight into building AI\n\nToday, deep-pocketed technology companies are investing billions of dollars to accumulate the broad computing power needed to develop, train, and use AI models. Meta is one of the companies leading the pack. Zuckerberg disclosed earlier this year that Meta aims to accumulate 350,000 of Nvidia's flagship H100 graphics processing chips by year-end, giving the company a total compute capacity of roughly 600,000 H100 equivalents when factoring in Meta's total chip hoard.\n\nThe H100 chip is easily optimized for AI workloads, cementing it as the must-have AI chip in the technology industry at the moment. These chips cost over $40,000 each, giving you an idea of Meta's astronomical investment in AI. Management has guided for capital expenditures in 2024 to fall between $35 billion and $40 billion.\n\nZuckerberg noted AI will become prevalent in Meta's business. Already, the company has developed and integrated its large language model, Llama 3, into its social media apps and deployed AI tools to help advertisers optimize their marketing dollars. AI will continue appearing in Meta's augmented reality business, including the Quest headset line and the Ray-Ban Meta smart glasses.\n\nSupercharging Meta's cash engine\n\nMeta's already a vast and profitable company, and its AI ambitions are icing on the cake. The company hopes AI can enhance its existing business, primarily social media advertising, while opening up new revenue streams.\n\nMeta isn't borrowing money to build out its AI or neglecting other parts of the company. This is a rare breed of business, one that's so profitable it can invest all this cash with little to no short-term return, and still grow free cash flow at the same time. META Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nSuch a robust financial backdrop takes much of the risk out of Meta as an AI stock. AI could eventually be a fad (I don't think that's the case), and Meta will still be one of the best businesses you can invest in. Even the mighty Nvidia would be in serious trouble if all these big technology companies stopped buying hundreds of thousands of its AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe cherry on top\n\nThe stock's inexplicably cheap valuation seals the deal for Meta. Calling Meta stock cheap feels off, considering shares have climbed over 80% in just the past year, but a look at the numbers reveals how inexpensive the stock is today.\n\nAnalysts believe Meta will earn $20.16 per share this year, which values the stock at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24. They also believe Meta will grow its earnings over 19% annually for the next three to five years. Remember Meta's Reality Labs segment is currently dragging on profits because it's losing money. Eventually, that segment could come alive.\n\nI use the PEG ratio to evaluate how attractive a stock's valuation is relative to the company's expected growth. Meta's PEG ratio is currently 1.3, a good deal if the business can meet growth estimates.\n\nNow, projections and estimates aren't guaranteed, so investors should consider the odds of Meta coming up short. However, the business is investing tens of billions of dollars with a track record of generating outstanding returns on its capital. Its 10-year average return on invested capital (ROIC) of 21% implies Meta can expect around $1.21 back for each dollar it invests in its business.\n\nThat should spell great business results and strong returns for long-term investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 4 Measures Indicate That Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Is Using Debt Safely",
        "content": "Legendary fund manager Li Lu (who Charlie Munger backed) once said, 'The biggest investment risk is not the volatility of prices, but whether you will suffer a permanent loss of capital.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. We can see that Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) does use debt in its business. But the more important question is: how much risk is that debt creating?\n\nWhy Does Debt Bring Risk?\n\nDebt and other liabilities become risky for a business when it cannot easily fulfill those obligations, either with free cash flow or by raising capital at an attractive price. Ultimately, if the company can't fulfill its legal obligations to repay debt, shareholders could walk away with nothing. While that is not too common, we often do see indebted companies permanently diluting shareholders because lenders force them to raise capital at a distressed price. Of course, plenty of companies use debt to fund growth, without any negative consequences. When we examine debt levels, we first consider both cash and debt levels, together.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nHow Much Debt Does Meta Platforms Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that as of March 2024 Meta Platforms had US$18.4b of debt, an increase on US$9.93b, over one year. However, its balance sheet shows it holds US$58.1b in cash, so it actually has US$39.7b net cash. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Healthy Is Meta Platforms' Balance Sheet?\n\nZooming in on the latest balance sheet data, we can see that Meta Platforms had liabilities of US$28.1b due within 12 months and liabilities of US$45.2b due beyond that. Offsetting these obligations, it had cash of US$58.1b as well as receivables valued at US$13.4b due within 12 months. So it has liabilities totalling US$1.77b more than its cash and near-term receivables, combined.\n\nThis state of affairs indicates that Meta Platforms' balance sheet looks quite solid, as its total liabilities are just about equal to its liquid assets. So while it's hard to imagine that the US$1.25t company is struggling for cash, we still think it's worth monitoring its balance sheet. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Meta Platforms also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\n\nOn top of that, Meta Platforms grew its EBIT by 72% over the last twelve months, and that growth will make it easier to handle its debt. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Meta Platforms's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, a business needs free cash flow to pay off debt; accounting profits just don't cut it. While Meta Platforms has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. During the last three years, Meta Platforms generated free cash flow amounting to a very robust 80% of its EBIT, more than we'd expect. That positions it well to pay down debt if desirable to do so.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile it is always sensible to look at a company's total liabilities, it is very reassuring that Meta Platforms has US$39.7b in net cash. And it impressed us with free cash flow of US$50b, being 80% of its EBIT. So is Meta Platforms's debt a risk? It doesn't seem so to us. There's no doubt that we learn most about debt from the balance sheet. But ultimately, every company can contain risks that exist outside of the balance sheet. These risks can be hard to spot. Every company has them, and we've spotted  1 warning sign for Meta Platforms  you should know about.\n\nWhen all is said and done, sometimes its easier to focus on companies that don't even need debt.

        "title": "Beyond Nvidia: 3 Proven Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Split Their Shares in 2024",
        "content": "One of the most notable trends for investors this year is the resurgence in the popularity of stock splits. The ongoing bull market is fueling a rise in stock prices, as evidenced by stock split announcements by Chipotle and Walmart.\n\nHowever, the rapid adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) is also driving up stock prices, thanks to surging sales and profits. The flag bearer for this trend is Nvidia, which announced a 10-for-1 stock split after its stock price soared 728% since the start of last year (as of market close on Thursday), which coincides with the advent of generative AI.\n\nThe speed at which AI has taken hold has boosted the fortunes of a number of companies, and the resulting share-price increases make them prime candidates for stock splits. Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard noted that many companies begin considering a stock split when their share prices surpasses $500.\n\nA look at a few of the top-performing stocks since the start of 2023 suggests there could be more stock splits ahead over the coming year. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nSuper Micro Computer: Current price around $778\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI), also called Supermicro, is best known for incorporating cutting-edge chips into its state-of-the-art servers, designed to withstand the rigors of AI training and inference. The company offers a variety of servers featuring free-air, liquid-cooling, and traditional air cooling, with plenty of options for companies operating anywhere along the AI spectrum.\n\nClose-knit partnerships with the major AI chipmakers help Supermicro maintain a steady supply of the most in-demand AI chips to power its servers, and demand has been off the charts. In the company's fiscal 2024 third quarter, Supermicro generated revenue that grew 201% year over year to $3.85 billion, while its adjusted earnings per share (EPS) jumped 308% to $6.65.\n\nThe company is scrambling to expand its facilities to meet this accelerating demand. Management believes it will be able to increase production to $25 billion annually in the coming years.\n\nDuring its 31-year history, Supermicro has never split its shares, but until recently, it hadn't experienced a growth spurt quite like this. Since the start of last year, the stock has soared more than 848%, but the results are even more pronounced when taking a step back.\n\nOver the past 10 years, Supermicro's revenue jumped 799%, while net income has surged more than 2,330%. These results have fueled a stock price that soared 2,980%. Despite its blistering performance, Supermicro stock is surprisingly cheap, selling for just 2x forward sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf growth continues along its current trajectory -- and there's every indication that it will -- Supermicro shares will be out of reach of all but the most affluent investors, save those who have access to fractional shares. That provides the company with an incentive to make its shares more accessible to everyday investors, which would result in a stock split.\n\nMicrosoft: Current price around $425\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is no wallflower, thanks to its ubiquitous Windows PC operating system and Office suite of workplace productivity tools. More recently, however, the company got a jump on the competition for its early moves in the field of generative AI.\n\nMicrosoft's stake in OpenAI gave the company unfettered access to the early stages of this breakthrough technology. This, in turn, resulted in Copilot, the company's suite of AI-powered digital assistants.\n\nThese tools are deeply integrated into a broad cross-section of Microsoft's products and services, and demand for AI has ignited growth for the company's cloud infrastructure service. Revenue from Azure Cloud grew 31% year over year in the first quarter, outpacing both Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Alphabet's Google Cloud, which grew 17% and 28%, respectively, according to research firm Canalys.\n\nFor its fiscal 2024 third quarter (ended March 31), Microsoft's revenue growth accelerated to 17% year over year, while EPS climbed 20%. During its earnings call, the company noted that AI services contributed seven points of its cloud growth. This shows that AI is having a halo effect on Azure Cloud, increasing adoption.\n\nMicrosoft's track record of growth is undeniable, but recent results have made it the world's most valuable company, with a market cap of more than $3.1 trillion and driving its stock price up 77% since the start of last year. The results are even more compelling when viewed over the long term.\n\nOver the past 10 years, revenue has grown 165%, driving net income up 376%. As a result, Microsoft's stock price has surged nearly 918%, with a current price of $425. The stock is a bit pricey at 36 times forward earnings, but given its track record and the vast opportunity ahead, it's worthy of a premium.\n\nThe company hasn't split its shares since 2003, but that was a lifetime ago. Microsoft is currently trading just off a new all-time high, and we're seeing just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the company's AI opportunity.\n\nWith all that as a backdrop, we may finally see another stock split from Microsoft this year.\n\nMeta Platforms: Current price around $494\n\nAfter suffering through a trough in digital ad spending during the downturn, Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) stock has come roaring back. The seeds planted during the company's cost-cutting campaign are bearing fruit, and the advertising market is staging a rebound. Meta has a long history of deploying AI in its everyday operations, but the dawn of generative AI has taken that to the next level.\n\nEarlier versions of AI helped Meta choose more relevant content for users on its social media platforms, match up advertising with the right viewer, and tag photos, among other uses. This experience helped the company move quickly to deploy AI more extensively when generative AI came calling.\n\nMeta developed its Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), now on its third edition. Llama is among the leading AI systems and is available across all the major cloud infrastructure services, which pay Meta for the privilege of offering it on their platforms. This is the first in what are expected to be several new ways Meta will generate revenue from AI.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta's revenue of $36.4 billion climbed 27% year over year, while its EPS of $4.71 surged 114%. This could be just the beginning as the recovery in digital marketing gains steam. As ad spending gathers momentum, Meta should continue to benefit.\n\nThe company is also working to help advertisers on its platform be more successful. Chief among its offerings is Meta Advantage+, a suite of AI-powered tools that has become \"one of the fastest-growing ad products\" in the company's history.\n\nA test run generated a 35% increase in incremental return on ad spend and a 58% decrease in incremental cost per purchase. Not only are advertisers getting better results, but they're doing so more cost-effectively. These automated tools help simplify the creation of ad campaigns and make them more lucrative, thereby attracting and retaining more advertisers.\n\nSince the start of last year, Meta Platforms stock has surged 310%, but that's not unusual. The past 10 years have marked a lucrative period for Meta and its investors. Revenue has grown by 1,150%, while net income surged 1,460%.\n\nThis has fueled Meta's robust stock price gains of 681%. With a stock price of roughly $494, Meta is less than 6% off its recent new all-time high set in April. Furthermore, the stock is currently selling for just 25 times forward earnings, an attractive price, considering Meta's history.\n\nGiven the company's track record of consistent performance, multiple growth drivers, and the opportunity presented by AI, this could be the year Meta finally embraces a stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Super Micro Computer right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Super Micro Computer, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Super Micro Computer wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "These 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Innovators Could Be the Next Stock Splits After Nvidia's Big Announcement",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the latest high-flying tech stock to conduct a stock split, but it won't be the last.\n\nNvidia's share price increased a whopping 550% from the start of 2023 to the time it announced its 10-for-1 stock split on May 22. That growth was fueled by a rapid rise in demand for generative artificial intelligence (AI). Nvidia's GPUs play a crucial role in developing generative AI applications because they're extremely efficient at training large language models.\n\nWith the surging interest in AI, Nvidia couldn't keep up with demand for its GPUs. Prices for its chips soared along with its gross margin and profit. Investors who saw the potential in the current trend have done well by investing in Nvidia.\n\nA stock split doesn't change any of the underlying fundamentals of the business or stock. It just divides the business up into smaller pieces. That said, it can have practical uses. A lower share price is more appealing to retail investors who may be turned off by a four-figure price tag. It also makes stock-based compensation easier to manage for the company. Stock splits may also signal confidence from management that shares are currently priced appropriately and they expect the price to keep climbing. If management thinks shares are overpriced and will eventually decline in value, a stock split wouldn't be necessary.\n\nAfter AI helped fuel Nvidia's stock to the point where a stock split made sense, two other AI leaders might be considering a stock split in the near future. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is best known for its social media apps Facebook, Instagram, Messenger, and WhatsApp. The four combine to service around 4 billion monthly users.\n\nBehind the scenes, though, artificial intelligence has been a huge focus for the company for well over a decade. AI powers the recommendation algorithms that determine what content and advertisements users see and when they see them. Over the last few years, Meta has stepped up its AI investments. During the company's first-quarter earnings call, CEO Mark Zuckerberg said, \"We're in a place where we've shown that we can build leading models and be the leading AI company in the world.\"\n\nMeta's efforts have already shown good results in its family of apps. Revenue increased 27% year over year in Q1, with net income up 117%. That said, many investors are concerned about the level of spending necessary to build and train Meta's AI models. The company plans to spend $35 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures this year, with net expenses approaching $100 billion. It's certainly an investment phase for Meta, but it's historically been able to see great returns on its investments over time.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite those concerns, investors continue to pile into the stock. Meta's share price has nearly quadrupled since the start of 2023, reaching an all-time high earlier this year. With share prices hovering around $500, it could be time for its first-ever stock split.\n\nManagement has expressed confidence in the stock with a massive share buyback program. And with shares trading around 24x forward earnings, it's one of the less expensive stocks among the \"Magnificent Seven\" in terms of valuation.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) cemented its spot as an AI leader when it added $10 billion to its OpenAI investment in early 2023. The move made its public cloud computing platform, Azure, the top choice for developers looking to capitalize on the AI trend.\n\nThe company has leaned heavily into AI. Its Azure OpenAI Service is driving new customers and migrations from competitors, enabling it to gain share in the cloud computing market. It's also managed to roll out new services, giving its existing customers opportunities to spend more on its platform. Overall, Azure revenue grew 31% year over year during the company's third quarter (ended in March).\n\nMicrosoft is also injecting AI capabilities into its enterprise software business, which includes its Office productivity suite and its Dynamics sales and marketing software. Its AI feature is called Copilot, which can help users improve productivity and creativity across its various software suites. Copilot has seen a strong uptake among existing customers, and its Copilot Studio allows businesses to use Microsoft's AI foundations and apply them to specific applications.\n\nShare prices of Microsoft are up 80% since the start of 2023 and the stock trades at well over $400 per share. It's been over 20 years since the company's last stock split. Shares traded for less than $25 each after that split in 2003. It could be time for another.\n\nWith shares valued at around 31 times forward earnings estimates, Microsoft trades at a premium to the overall market. However, as it gains market share in the valuable cloud computing space and remains a dominant force in enterprise software, it should be able to keep expanding its revenue and operating margins and grow into that valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could Meta Platforms Stock Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) has been a fantastic investment historically. Despite bouts of gut-wrenching volatility, shares of the tech titan have skyrocketed 1,150% since their initial public offering (IPO) in late 2012. This gain easily outpaces the broader S&P 500.\n\nExisting shareholders, as well as those who might not have ever owned this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock, might be wondering if Meta has the potential to make them a millionaire in the future. If getting to a seven-figure net worth is your goal, then continue reading to see if this company's shares deserve a place in your portfolio.\n\nDominant tech enterprise\n\nOne sign of a great business is the presence of an economic moat, a single trait or combination of traits that protects a company's industry position, while at the same time allowing it to produce strong fundamental performance for extended periods. Meta easily falls into this category.\n\nThe business operates some of the most successful social media apps on the planet, in Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. In total, these services had a combined 3.24 billion daily active users as of March 31. That's a truly gargantuan sum, representing 40% of the world's population. But the figure was still up 7% year over year.\n\nThese apps also benefit from powerful network effects. With more users, the service becomes more valuable to everyone. Anyone with technical know-how and some funding could probably launch a new social media site in no time. But to achieve the broad adoption that Meta has would be a near-impossible task.\n\nThis situation has created a financial juggernaut. Meta registered $135 billion in revenue in 2023, mainly from digital advertising, a 16% jump from the year before. The company produced $47 billion of operating income last year, good for a stellar 35% margin.\n\nThere's no reason to worry about Meta losing its standing anytime soon. Management touts strong engagement trends, an encouraging sign given the rise of TikTok.\n\nAnd Meta is focused on its artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives. The business is investing aggressively in building out servers and data centers that provide the infrastructure that can improve the experience for both users of its apps and the advertisers that depend on Meta to target large audiences. This should keep the company in a favorable position for a long time.\n\nOn the road to $1 million\n\nIf someone were lucky and smart enough to have invested $81,000 at Meta's (then called Facebook) IPO price of over $38, their holding would be worth an astonishing $1 million today. This translates to a more than 12-fold gain.\n\nStory continues\n\nToday, the company carries a massive market cap of $1.2 trillion. This makes it the world's seventh-most valuable business. That scale means Meta's forward returns will undoubtedly lag what was achieved in the past. As a company gets larger, it becomes more and more difficult to drive meaningful growth that moves the needle.\n\nHowever, I still think Meta looks like a smart investment candidate. Despite its size, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.9. That's a reasonable valuation to pay for a business as competitively advantaged as this one.\n\nAccording to Wall Street consensus analyst estimates, Meta is expected to grow its revenue and earnings per share at compound annual rates of 14.1% and 20.5%, respectively, between 2023 and 2026. Take these forecasts with a grain of salt, but you get an idea of the company's potential.\n\nInvestors who are willing and able to put more money to work buying Meta's stock, while also having a longer time horizon, are in a good position to become millionaires from this social media and digital advertising powerhouse.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Utility Stocks That Are Even Hotter AI Plays Than Nvidia",
        "content": "Utility stocks weren’t the best investment in 2023. Despite reporting decent earnings and offering solid dividend increases, the utility sector lost about 10% last year compared to a 26% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nIn fact, if it wasn’t for dividends, utilities would have gone nowhere for the past two years. The payouts were the sector’s saving grace, underscoring why income investors repeatedly turn to these stocks. Dividends are why utilities have long been considered widows-and-orphans investments. You can always count on their income stream.\n\nBut 2024 is shaping up as a far different story. Utilities are one of the hottest plays around and are even outperforming the broad market index. This year, the sector is only behind tech and telecom stocks as the leading investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the primary reason for the turnaround. Not only does AI require vast amounts of computing power, but it puts enormous demands on energy consumption. The Energy Information Administration says data centers are “one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.”\n\nUtilities are now using AI to reduce the very high energy demands it is causing. While AI chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are a foundational basis for the technology, the AI trade is now moving far beyond those narrow confines. Investors should look to utility stocks to play the next leg higher in the AI industrial revolution.\n\nEntergy (ETR) 5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable Portfolio. undervalued utilities stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEntergy (NYSE:ETR) provides electricity to the Southeast. It is arguably one of the best-positioned utilities to capitalize on data center AI demands. Electricity costs are lower in the region than in much of the country. That’s key because the Electric Reliability Council of Texas recently said it expects a dramatic increase in electricity demand in the state over the next five years. The state’s electric grid could see some 152 gigawatts of demand by 2030, or double the level placed on it only four years ago.\n\nEntergy is investing billions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure. In Louisiana, for example, the utility intends to invest $1.9 billion in the first phase of its grid there to make it more resilient. The plan includes 2,100 projects that will reinforce critical structures in its transmission and distribution systems. Entergy also spends $1.46 billion on its 754-gigawatt (GW) Legend Power Station in southeast Texas.\n\nOf course, Entergy faces one risk: storms in the Gulf Coast region. Hurricanes can cause billions of dollars in damage. Investors should consider if this risk is worth it. Entergy stock trades at 11 times trailing earnings and less than twice revenue. Look for ETR to be a unique AI stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Entergy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is located in the Southeast and benefits from the region’s cost advantages. The utility stock has also invested heavily in renewable energy to become the world’s largest generator of wind and sun energy and a top-tier participant in battery storage.\n\nNextEra Energy is also building out its project portfolio despite having substantial assets already in play. The utility has 65 GW of energy capacity at its disposal, some 36 GW of which comes from renewable sources. NextEra continues to add to it each quarter. There is about 3.5 GW of data center capacity and another nearly 3.5 GW in its backlog. It also has a pipeline of 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage in various stages of development.\n\nThe Florida-based utility runs some of the same risks as Entergy concerning severe weather. Although its stock has already seen tremendous gains this year, up 26% in 2024 and 63% over the past 12 months, the growth in AI demand suggests this utility stock is only just getting started in lighting up its capital appreciation opportunity.\n\nSouthern (SO) the southern company logo displayed several times on a screen\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthern (NYSE:SO) is the third utility stock investors should buy to capitalize on the AI boom. And if you’re sensing a trend about location here, you’re not wrong. Hyperscalers are flocking to the Southeast, so utilities here are primed to win investments.\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is building ​​a $600 million data center in a former semiconductor manufacturing facility in Tennessee. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently announced it was building a new $800 million data center campus in Montgomery, Alabama. The Midwest is also a focus of new data center construction, with Google, Meta, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) building new facilities there.\n\nSouthern, though, is also investing in new projects to expand its generation capacity. However, it is focusing on nuclear energy. It put its Plant Vogtle Unit 3 into operation last July and just started up Unit 4 at the end of April.\n\nLike NextEra, Southern’s stock has been part of the utility group driving the sector higher. Shares are up 14% this year and 30% above their lows. With the data center construction explosion, expect the utility stock to brighten up your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Resilient Picks Poised to Weather Any Storm",
        "content": "When times get tough, invest in resilient growth stocks. These are the companies with strong revenue and earnings growth. They’re the ones that are reinvesting their earnings for growth instead of distributing it as a dividend. In fact, when it comes to investing in growth stocks, investors aren’t typically after dividends. They just want exposure to exponential growth.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Stefon Walters noted, “Growth stocks are companies expected to outperform the U.S. stock market (generally using the S&P 500 as a proxy) because of their potential for high earnings growth. This growth potential is largely why growth stocks have been the darlings of the market for quite a while now. After all, why wouldn’t investors take a liking to companies that can produce market-beating returns?”\n\nHere are just a few of the most resilient growth stocks you may want to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the top growth stocks to buy and hold.\n\nSince bottoming out around $60 in late 2022, AMD hit a high of $227.30. Now consolidating at $166.77, I’d like to see AMD initially retest its prior high, especially with the artificial intelligence boom just starting to get hot.\n\nHelping, AMDjust unveiled its latest AI chips, intensifying its competition against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThat includes the Instinct MI325X accelerators, which are planned for availability in the fourth quarter. All as the “race to develop generative artificial intelligence programs has led to towering demand for the advanced chips used in AI data centers able to support these complex applications,” says Reuters.\n\nIn addition, the company introduced an upcoming series of chips titled MI350, which is expected to be available in 2025. AMD said the MI350 will likely perform 35 times better in inference, the process of computing generative AI responses.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors may also want to pay close attention to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), even with its countless issues. Down but not out, it could benefit from reaccelerating electric vehicle (EV) sales this year.\n\nFor 2024, EV industry sales are expected to increase anywhere from 20% to 30%. Plus, according to Michelle Krebs, executive auto analyst for Cox, “EV sales are increasing faster than any other segment in the industry.”\n\nBetter, TSLA sales could accelerate with the potential for newer, cheaper electric vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs noted in a first-quarter earnings report, “We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” the company added.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a no-brainer when it comes to resilient growth stocks to buy. Since bottoming out in early 2023 at around $220, MSFT is now up to $424.52 and could see higher highs. For one, the software company has evolved into a tech giant with its operating systems, cloud services, game consoles and artificial intelligence.\n\nTwo, the company is launching its first artificial intelligence personal computer product, the Surface model laptop with built-in AI capabilities.\n\nThree, as noted by Investorplace’s Louis Navallier:\n\n“The company may be just starting to monetize its AI technology within its customer-facing segment, but AI integration has already had a major impact on Azure’s fiscal performance. Last quarter, Azure revenue was up 31% because of this factor.”\n\nAll are serving as significant catalysts for future growth at Microsoft. Even better, analysts believe Microsoft could grow its EPS by about 13.8% a year over the next three to five years.\n\nSchwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) charles schwab sign outside of a building. SCHD stock\n\nSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also find resiliency with exchange-traded funds (ETF) like the Schwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHG). With an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF offers exposure to 249 holdings and tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEven better, if I wanted to buy 100 shares of the SCHG ETF, it would cost me $9,726, which is far less than buying just one of its 249 holdings. Not only does the ETF offer me solid diversification, it does so at a low price.\n\nEven better, since its inception, the ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) image of vanguard website to represent index funds to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot growth stock ETF to buy and hold is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index in an attempt to match the performance of the nation’s top 200 growth stocks. Some of its top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nSince bottoming out in early 2023 at around $210, the VUG ETF is now up to $361.50. From here, given the growing demand for growth stocks, I’d like to see the ETF closer to $400 this year. Even better, the VUG ETF is seeing massive inflows. According to BNK Invest, the VUG ETF recently saw an inflow of about $1.3 billion, a 1.1% increase from the prior week.\n\nIn addition, according to TipRanks, “The VUG ETF has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 200 stocks held, 173 have Buys and 27 have a Hold rating.”\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is another strong growth stock to buy on a recent dip.\n\nAfter running from about $410 to a high of $490, Mastercard slipped to $440. All of that happened after cutting guidance and better-than-expected earnings. However, MA did find strong double-bottom support at $440 and is starting to bounce, last trading at $448.68.\n\nFrom that price, I’d like to see Mastercard initially retest its prior high of $490.\n\nHelping, analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) just initiated an Overweight rating on MA. The firm cited MA’s “scale, hard-to-replicate networks, and fintech ecosystem partnerships, all tied to sustainable secular growth within digital payments.”\n\nThe firm added that “Mastercard should be able to boost revenue by 11% this year and by 12.7% in FY204, driven by 9.5%/13.5% payment network revenue growth and value-added services and solutions growth of 13.7%/11.5% in FY24/FY25.”\n\nWe also have to remember that more Americans are heavily dependent on credit cards these days. As noted by Fox Business, “35% of Americans said they have maxed out their credit cards in recent years. Of those who had maxed out their credit cards, 85% said they were pushed to use their cards to the limit because of price increases from inflation.”\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top resilient growth stocks to buy and hold is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).\n\nFor one, it’s a leader in zero trust and cloud cybersecurity trading at less than growth. Second, it just unveiled multiple innovations to its “AI Data Protection Platform that leverage the world’s largest security cloud and the power of AI,” as noted by the company.\n\nThat includes its Gen AI App Security, offering “context-rich user and risk correlation, providing insights into risky prompts, AI app usage and granular policy controls,” reported TechnologyMagazine. The feature is reportedly critical, as the “adoption of AI technologies continues to accelerate, presenting new security challenges.”\n\nTwo, recent earnings were solid. In its third quarter, earnings per share of 88 cents beat estimates by 23 cents. Revenue of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year over year, beat by $17.6 million. Moving forward, Zscaler forecasts revenue of $565 million to $567 million, a possible growth of $12.8 million at the mid-point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "Meet the Only \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock That Has Never Had a Stock Split. That Could Be About to Change.",
        "content": "Stock splits have been all the rage in recent years and have become a calling card among many of the market's most successful companies. The group of stocks collectively known as the \"Magnificent Seven\" has handily outperformed the S&P 500 since the start of last year.\n\nHere's how the member companies have performed since the beginning of 2023:\n\nNvidia: Up 686% Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META): Up 297% Amazon: Up 112% Alphabet: Up 96% Microsoft: Up 72% Apple: Up 49% Tesla: Up 43%\n\nStock splits are historically preceded by a long period of strong business and operating performance, which gives rise to a surging stock price.\n\nIt's also no coincidence that over the past several years, most of these companies have initiated at least one stock split. Investors might be surprised to learn, however, that just one of the Magnificent Seven companies has never split its shares. However, given the company's recent performance, the prevailing tailwinds, and ongoing macroeconomic recovery, the final holdout -- Meta Platforms -- might finally consider a stock split. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nUnparalleled social media reach\n\nNormally, when you see the word \"unparalleled,\" it tends to be hyperbole, but in the case of Meta Platforms, it happens to be true. The company has unparalleled reach with its suite of social media platforms, which includes three of the world's largest when measured by monthly active users. In the first quarter, Meta's family of apps reached 3.24 billion people or roughly 40% of the worldwide population.\n\nThat extensive reach, combined with the company's massive treasure trove of user data, allows Meta to more effectively target the advertising that generates the bulk of the company's revenue.\n\nMarketing demand dried up in the face of the downturn, but a rebound in ad spending has already begun. Furthermore, estimates regarding market growth have begun to ratchet higher, with digital ad revenue expected to grow by 11% this year, according to estimates by S&P Global. As the world's second-largest digital advertiser, Meta Platforms is well positioned to benefit from the increase in ad spending.\n\nThe AI wildcard\n\nAnother factor that could fuel Meta's fortunes is the rise of artificial intelligence (AI). The company tapped into the aforementioned treasure trove of data to train its Llama (Large Language Model Meta AI), the model that forms the foundation for its Llama 3, which Meta describes as \"one of the world's leading AI assistants.\" The company charges large cloud providers to include Llama in their offerings, but it's free to users.\n\nStory continues\n\nCFO Susan Li said on an earnings call in April, \"We continue to see compelling investment opportunities to both improve our core business in the near term and capture significant longer-term opportunities in generative AI and Reality Labs.\" Meta has been integrating generative AI into a broad cross section of its offerings, including providing AI-powered tools to advertisers on its platform and using AI to surface more relevant content for users.\n\nIt's still early days for AI, so we don't yet know the full extent of how Meta will leverage the technology to boost its business and financial performance -- but the potential is there.\n\nIs a stock split on the horizon?\n\nHistory shows that stock splits tend to come in waves, a point highlighted by Bank of America analyst Jared Woodard. The analyst noted that Nvidia is \"another large-cap tech pursuing shareholder-friendly policies.\" The chipmaker is the fourth of the Magnificent Seven stocks to pursue a stock split since 2022, preceded by Alphabet, Amazon, and Tesla. \"Big Tech is going bite-sized,\" the analyst wrote in a note to clients.\n\nWoodard went on to point out that companies begin to consider enacting a stock split once their share price surpasses a threshold of about $500.\n\nThere's more good news on the stock split front. Companies that pare their shares tend to outperform the S&P 500 in the year following the split. \"Stocks have notched 25% total returns in the 12 months after a split is announced, compared to 12% for the broad index. Splits have boosted returns in every decade including the early 2000s when the S&P 500 struggled,\" the analyst wrote.\n\nMeta Platforms has a sterling track record of long-term growth. Over the past decade, its revenue has grown 1,150%, while net income has soared 1,460%. This has driven its stock price up more than 656%, more than 3 times the return of the S&P 500. Yet the stock is currently selling for 27 times earnings, on par with the S&P 500, despite its superior performance.\n\nWith a stock price of roughly $475 (as of this writing), Meta is approaching the threshold at which companies begin considering a stock split, according to the research. While this is all speculation on my part, I wouldn't be surprised if Meta were to announce a stock split later this year, if for nothing more than to get investors excited about its stock once again.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "New York lawmakers pass measure to protect youths on social media",
        "content": "By Jonathan Allen and Steve Gorman\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - New York state lawmakers on Friday passed legislation to bar social media platforms from exposing \"addictive\" algorithmic content to users under age 18 without parental consent, becoming the latest of several states moving to limit online risks to children.\n\nA companion bill to restrict online sites from collecting and selling the personal data of underage users also gained final legislative approval in the New York Assembly on Friday, a day after both measures cleared the state Senate.\n\nGovernor Kathy Hochul is expected to sign both into law.\n\nShe hailed the two measures as a \"historic step forward in our efforts to address the youth mental health crisis and create a safer digital environment for young people.\"\n\nSocial media companies such as Meta Platforms, whose platforms include Facebook and Instagram, could take a hit to their revenues.\n\nSupporters of the legislation pointed to a recent Harvard University study that found the six largest social media platforms generated $11 billion from advertising to minors in 2022.\n\nThe bills' sponsors also cite studies linking higher rates of depression, anxiety, sleep disorders and other mental health woes to what they define as excessive social media use by adolescents.\n\nThe industry association NetChoice condemned the legislation, calling it in a statement an \"assault on free speech and the open internet\" by \"forcing websites to censor all content unless visitors provide an ID to verify their age.\"\n\nThe organization said it had successfully challenged similar measures from three other states in court as unconstitutional.\n\nA spokesperson for the governor said the law would not censor a site's content and said it provides for using one or more age-verification methods that retains a user's anonymity.\n\nMeta, whose chairman and CEO Mark Zuckerberg co-founded Facebook, offered some support for the bill.\n\n\"While we don’t agree with every aspect of these bills, we welcome New York becoming the first state to pass legislation recognizing the responsibility of app stores,\" the company said in a statement.\n\nUnder the bill dubbed the SAFE (Stop Addictive Feeds Exploitation) for Kids Act, social media users under 18 must obtain parental consent to view \"addictive\" feeds. This is generally defined as content that comes from accounts they do not follow or subscribe to but is delivered by algorithms designed to keep them on a platform for as long as possible.\n\nInstead, minors on social media may receive a chronological feed of content from accounts they already follow or from generally popular content, the way sponsors say social media feeds worked before the advent of \"addictive\" algorithms.\n\nStory continues\n\nYoung users can still search for specific topics of interest, connect with friends and join online groups, while non-addictive algorithms used for search functions or filtering unwanted or obscene content would still be permitted without a parent's consent.\n\nAccording to a bill summary from the New York attorney general, the legislation would apply to platforms whose feeds consist largely of user-generated content and material recommended to users based on the data it collects from them.\n\nThe summary named Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, Twitter and Alphabet Inc's YouTube as among platforms that would likely be subject to the measure.\n\nThe companion bill, called the New York Child Data Protection Act, would bar all online sites from collecting, using, sharing or selling personal data of anyone under 18 unless they receive \"informed consent,\" or unless collecting and sharing such data is strictly necessary to the site's purpose.\n\nFor users under the age of 13, informed consent would have to come from a parent.\n\nViolators could be subject to civil damages or penalties of up to $5,000 per violation.\n\nIn March 2023, Utah became the first U.S. state to adopt laws regulating children's access to social media, followed by others, including Arkansas, Louisiana, Ohio, Texas and Florida.\n\n(Reporting by Jonathan Allen in New York and Steve Gorman in Los Angeles; Editing by Leslie Adler)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies won the dismissal of novel claims in hundreds of lawsuits brought by school districts seeking to recover costs for addressing the negative impacts of students’ social media use.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nReal Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans Here’s Everything Apple Plans to Show at Its AI-Focused WWDC Event Behind ‘Suicide Squad,’ the Year’s Biggest Video-Game Flop Putin’s Wartime Central Banker Tells Him What He Doesn’t Want to Hear GameStop Slumps on Share Sale Plan as Gill Makes YouTube Return\n\nA California state judge sided Friday with Meta, Snap Inc., TikTok Inc. and Google LLC in throwing out the districts’ allegations that social media has increased the cost of education because it makes students more distracted and disruptive, driving up the need for classroom discipline, employee training and communication with parents.\n\nThe cases are among hundreds in state and federal court alleging that social media platforms are designed to be addictive and are dangerous for youths.\n\nLos Angeles Superior Court Judge Carolyn Kuhl wrote that there must be limits on liability — otherwise any company could be held responsible when “emotional harm” it inflicts on individuals then causes those individuals to “act out.”\n\n“A restaurateur who negligently sold a diner spoiled food would be liable to the person who was later struck by the diner’s car, given that the diner’s poor driving may have resulted from suffering under the effects of food poisoning,” Kuhl said in her ruling.\n\nSchools Crack Down on Big Tech: Public Nuisance Theory Explained\n\nThe school districts alleged that the companies engineered their platforms to hook young users using algorithms and features such as the “like” button, in ways that hurt society — akin to cigarette manufacturers that designed their products to be addictive. They also alleged that they spent “significant resources” dealing with the fallout from social media, including from challenges circulated on the platforms that allegedly encouraged students to damage school property.\n\nThe social media companies countered that they couldn’t be held responsible for content posted by third parties.\n\n“We believe the court made the right decision in this ruling,” Meta said in a statement. “Meta is committed to supporting young people and their families, and we will continue to defend against all cases claiming otherwise.”\n\nRepresentatives of Google, TikTok, and Snap didn’t immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nAs of May 9 the cases pending before Kuhl in a so-called Judicial Council Coordinated Proceeding included 617 school district plaintiffs from 34 states, according to a court filing. Kuhl heard arguments last month from four school districts acting as test plaintiffs to present the claims common to the broader litigation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The school district plaintiffs are disappointed with the court’s decision and are evaluating all appellate options,” according to a statement issued by lead lawyers for the districts. “Nevertheless, this decision impacts a limited number of school plaintiffs in the JCCP, and counsel will continue to vigorously litigate claims on behalf of school districts with active cases in the JCCP.”\n\nThe school districts already faced steep odds using the public nuisance legal theory that they successfully employed against vape pen sellers because the districts don’t themselves experience social media addiction, nor does the addiction physically injure them, Kuhl wrote.\n\nSection 230 of the 1996 Communications Decency Act, the federal liability shield protecting online publishers from content-based lawsuits, is too powerful to allow the novel twist on common law to proceed, she reasoned.\n\nExpanding the public nuisance theory to let school districts sue despite being “indirectly affected by the negative consequences of social media for youth would create a broad web of indeterminate liability that the common law has heretofore refused to impose,” Kuhl wrote.\n\nA federal judge in Oakland overseeing hundreds of other cases recently held a hearing on the same issues and is expected to rule soon.\n\nHow Lawsuits Seek to Make Social Media Safer for Kids: QuickTake\n\nThe Los Angeles and Oakland judges are also overseeing personal injury suits by youths and families alleging that the social media companies are responsible for causing widespread psychological distress and even suicides. The judges have allowed some claims to proceed against the companies while dismissing others. The companies have denied wrongdoing, saying they’ve taken steps to keep young users safe on the platforms.\n\nThe state case is Social Media Cases JCCP 22STCV21355, California Superior Court, County of Los Angeles.\n\n(Updates with judge’s reasoning)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Meta Platforms ranks 2nd in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\n\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future — productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn’t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\n\nOne doesn’t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\n\nPhoto by Chris Liverani on Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 246\n\nRaymond James recently upgraded Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) shares citing Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) generative AI ambitions. The firm's analyst Josh Beck increased his price target on the stock to $550 from $525. Why is Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) a promising AI stock? The social media giant is using AI for optimizing ad targeting and recommendation systems to boost engagement and ads revenue. In the first quarter, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) revenue jumped 27% to $36.5 billion. A whopping 97% of this revenue came courtesy of ads. In 2024, Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) ads revenue is expected to rise by 17%. Reels, which is posting solid numbers and engagement lately, saw a 20% ad load in the first quarter, compared with 16.2% in the same quarter last year. Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) recently posted speculator Q1 results but the stock slipped after the company revealed that Meta Platforms Inc’s (NASDAQ:META) CapEx will come in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion, higher than the previous forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion.  However, long-term analysts believe since most of this spending will go into AI projects, it’ll bode well for the stock down the road.\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on its 2025 EPS estimate of $23.11 set by Wall Street, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a forward P/E of 21, which makes the stock attractively valued given Meta Platforms Inc's (NASDAQ:META) earnings are expected to grow 14.50% next year and by 30% over the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META): Meta was a top contributor in the quarter following fourth quarter earnings results in which the company reported accelerating revenue growth and expanding margins driven by a rebound in online advertising and strong user growth. On February 2nd, Meta reported 4Q23 revenue of $40.1 billion (+25% y/y up from +23% in 3Q23) and EPS of $5.33 (+203% y/y), and the midpoint of 1Q24 revenue guidance was $35.8 billion (+25% y/y), all well ahead of investors’ expectations. The company reported impressive revenue acceleration in its core advertising businesses, including new products like Reels and Threads. Advertiser adoption of Meta’s AI targeting tools helped drive strong ROI and higher spend across multiple categories.\n\nMETA owns multiple social media platforms, each with more than one billion users, has an 81% gross margin, and generated $44 billion of FCF in 2023. Both its Facebook and its Instagram franchises have more than 2 billion Daily Active Users and generate the bulk of the company’s revenue. Recently, the company’s short form video offering, Reels, and public text-sharing app, Threads, achieved mass user engagement and growing advertiser adoption which have helped return the company to strong revenue and free cash flow growth. Even after the recent stock price advance, META shares trade at 20x Wall Street’s consensus estimates for 2025 EPS, estimates that we think could prove to be too low.”\n\nOverall, Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) ranks 2nd in Insider Monkey’s list of Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks.You can visit Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks to see the other AI stocks stocks that are on the hedge fund radar.

        "content": "Meta Platforms META has been leveraging AI and machine learning to boost the potency of its social-media offerings, including WhatsApp, Instagram, Facebook and Threads.\r\n\r\nThe rapid adoption of Generative AI (GenAI) is transforming conversational messaging platforms like WhatsApp to perform conversational commerce, including transactions like ride-hailing and grocery purchases.\n\nMETA Integrates AI Tools Into WhatsApp Business\n\nMETA is now incorporating AI tools into WhatsApp to make businesses more customer-oriented.\r\n\r\nThe AI tools will enable businesses to help customers in finding new products. META is training AI to help businesses quickly answer the most popular questions they receive from customers on WhatsApp. AI integration will help businesses create ads on Facebook and Instagram.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. Stock Price and Consensus Meta Platforms, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Meta Platforms, Inc. Quote\n\nMoreover, Meta Platforms is leveraging AI to boost Facebook’s appeal among young adults, a demographic that prefers Alphabet’s GOOGL YouTube and Snap’s SNAP Snapchat.\r\n\r\nPer Statista, Snapchat, TikTok and Instagram have been the most used social media for 18-29 users. According to a Pew Research 2023 study, YouTube was the most used social media among U.S. teenagers, followed by TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.\r\n\r\nHowever, Meta Platforms shares have returned 39.5% year to date, outperforming both Alphabet and Snap. While Alphabet has returned 26.5% over the same timeframe, Snap has lost 10.2%.\n\nAI Capabilities Lift META’s Prospects\n\nPowered by cutting-edge AI, META is offering user-centric features, positioning Facebook as a platform that resonates with young adults. It has upgraded Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. A newly developed model architecture allows for efficient learning from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of Facebook Reels.\r\n\r\nMETA is advancing its GenAI capabilities with Meta Llama, providing Facebook users with more interactive and personalized experiences. Currently, 30% of the posts on Facebook feed are delivered by Meta Platforms’ AI recommendation system.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms is currently developing several AI services, including its AI assistant, Meta AI, creator AI and business AI, as well as internal coding and development AIs. Meta AI is currently powered by its latest model, Llama 3.\r\n\r\nIts AI-powered ad tools — Advantage+ Shopping and Advantage+ App Campaigns — have also reported robust revenue performance.\n\nKey Headwinds for Meta: Higher Spending, Regulatory Troubles\n\nMeta Platforms now expects to invest significantly more over the next few years in developing more advanced models and the largest AI services in the world. However, monetization of these AI services will take considerable time, which is a concern.\r\n\r\nGrowing regulatory concerns don’t bode well for META’s prospects. It is suffering from privacy regulations in Europe and the United States and is also expected to face antitrust issues in its usage of AI.\r\n\r\nMETA recently changed its European privacy policy to let it use people’s public personal posts and media, and data from other online sources, for an unspecified “AI technology” that can share data with third parties. However, it has been alleged that this policy is violating Europe’s General Data Protection Regulation.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms AI focus bodes well for its long-term prospects. However, higher investments in AI infrastructure development are expected to keep top-line growth and margins under pressure in the near term.\r\n\r\nFull-year 2024 total expenses are now expected between $96 and $99 billion, up from its prior outlook of $94-$99 billion due to higher infrastructure and legal costs.\r\n\r\nCapital expenditures will be in the range of $35-$40 billion, up from the prior range of $30-$37 billion for 2024. Meta Platforms expect capex will continue to increase in 2025 driven by ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is currently pegged at $158.97 billion, indicating 17.84% growth over 2023. The consensus mark for earnings is pegged at $20.16 per share, suggesting 35.57% year-over-year growth.\r\n\r\nMoreover, META is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 7.46X compared with the Zacks Internet Software industry’s 2.59X and higher than the median of 5.89X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\r\n\r\nHence, investors should wait for a better entry point for Meta Platforms, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Is Meta the Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Dan Loeb?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Growth Stocks to Buy According to Billionaire Dan Loeb and in this article we will discuss the activist investor's position in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META).\n\nBillionaire investor Dan Loeb's hedge fund Third Point had a strong start to 2024 after its offshore fund posted returns of 7.8% in the first quarter chugging along with the broader market's 10.6% gain. AI has been one of his top investing themes for some time now and the activist shareholder maintains his bullish view on the technology. In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\n\nLoeb Thinks Vistra's Capital Allocation Strategy is \"Brilliant\"\n\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though Vistra's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, the power company's \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, Vistra made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\n\nLoeb's Bullish on LSEG, and For Good Reason\n\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Third Point’s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund’s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we've also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 6. Is Meta Stock a Good Long Term Buy?\n\nGiuseppe Costantino / Shutterstock.com\n\nIs Meta the Best Growth Stock to Buy According to Dan Loeb?\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nThird Point's Stake Value: $600,176,880\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 246\n\nLoeb upped his stakes in Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) by 7% in Q1 2024, ending the quarter with a position of over $600 million. In total, 246 hedge funds were bullish on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) and ended the quarter with positions worth $47 billion. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is one of Dan Loeb's top growth stock picks.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) is seeing robust ad revenue growth. Its Family of Apps (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp and Messenger) generated ad revenue of $35.6 billion, up 27% year over year, and about 3.2 billion people use one of its apps each day. However, the company's AR/VR business Reality Labs keeps bleeding cash and logged losses of $3.85 billion in Q1. Management said its AR/VR business is supporting its AI initiatives and it continues to be optimistic about the future of the metaverse and mixed-reality ecosystem. The company is sticking to its strategy of collaborating with eyewear brands such as EssilorLuxottica to build virtual and mixed reality headsets to boost its market share. Meta is also making progress on the AI front and successfully rolled out its AI assistant Meta AI and is currently in the process of training Meta Llama 3, a 400-billion+ parameter large language model. What's interesting about Meta's two long-term focus areas is the fusion of AI and mixed reality. While still in its infancy, the metaverse concept shows more promise with the addition of AI to it. Meta is integrating AI functionalities into its smart glasses which will give users access to real-time information related to their surroundings.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) also raised its capital expenditures guidance for 2024, saying it expects CapEx to range between $35 billion and $40 billion, up from its prior guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. The group is investing heavily in infrastructure and AI, and is reportedly working on its own in-house AI chips. By developing its own AI chips, Meta can gain a competitive advantage in the market, reducing its reliance on external providers and improving the performance of its AI applications.\n\nWhy should growth investors consider Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)? The company has grown at double digits consistently over the past 10 years, growing its revenue by a CAGR of 32% and net income by 37.3%. The company has also started paying dividends and exited Q1 2024 with $16 billion in capital returns through dividends and buybacks. In a world where cash is king, Meta doesn't lose. The company has grown its free cash flow by a compound annual growth rate of 23% over the past 10 years. In 2023, Meta's net income was $39 billion and it ended the year with a free cash flow of $44 billion, its FCF to net income ratio is 113%. Meta is an extremely profitable company that is pioneering disruptive technologies and with its strong near-monopoly position in social media and digital advertising, we think it's a good idea while it trades at 24.5 times its forward earnings, close to its 5-year average multiple of 23.7x.\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc.

A lack of near-term catalysts and concerns about future guidance are cited as contributing factors.\n\nMizuho expresses specific worries regarding potential announcements during the upcoming July earnings call.

Additionally, they highlight ongoing worries about weakening ad spend from China due to regulatory issues surrounding US companies like Temu and Shein.\n\nDespite these concerns, Mizuho emphasizes the stock's reasonable valuation, strong annual revenue growth, and continued shareholder returns. \"I still love the stock here,\" conclude the Mizuho analysts, acknowledging the inherent risk-reward proposition for investors.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMizuho analysts see 'growing risks' for Meta Platforms stock\n\nGameStop slumps as 'Roaring Kitty' kicks off livestream\n\nGameStop's sales continue to slide in surprise earnings release\n\nView comments",

The trend seems to have persisted, and the Nasdaq Composite is up by 14% so far in 2024.\n\nInvestors may now feel uncomfortable picking up high-flying Nasdaq stocks after such an exceptional rally. However, some of these AI-powered companies are dramatically reshaping industries with their technological innovations and can be smart picks for astute retail investors even at elevated share prices. Here's why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) fit the bill.\n\nNvidia\n\nIt's no surprise that semiconductor giant Nvidia is on this list. With its comprehensive portfolio of cutting-edge CPUs, GPUs, and superchips (GPUs + CPUs), a robust software ecosystem, and strong partnerships with technology titans, the company emerged as one of the major beneficiaries of the ongoing AI boom.\n\nThe dramatically rising demand for Nvidia's full-stack AI computing platform was pivotal in driving its data center revenue by an explosive 427% year over year to $22.6 billion in the first quarter of fiscal 2025 (ending April 28, 2024). Data center business now makes up nearly 87% of the company's total revenue and shows no signs of slowing -- especially in the backdrop of rising adoption of generative AI technologies and large language models.\n\nCloud service providers, technology titans, and start-ups are heavily investing in large language models (LLMs) for content creation, chatbots, code generation, and more. Training and inferencing LLMs requires a huge amount of computing power, and Nvidia's recently introduced H200 and next-generation Blackwell architecture chips seem ideally positioned to cater to these needs. Nvidia, however, expects the supply of H200 and Blackwell chips to fall short of demand until the next year -- thereby giving the company significant pricing power.\n\nWhile the supply/demand mismatch may theoretically open up an opportunity for competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel, Nvidia can still protect its turf owing to technological superiority and well-established strategic relationships with clients. The company accelerated the pace of launch for new chips from two years to one, which means its clients get access to the latest technologies much faster. It also helps that Nvidia's new chips are backwards compatible, and its software ecosystem works with both Hopper and Blackwell systems.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company also introduced certain innovations to its Compute Unified Device Architecture (CUDA) software stack. The supporting software platform is optimized for accelerated computing across the company's hardware portfolio, which helped improve the performance and cost utilization of its blockbuster H100 chip in running inferencing workloads for certain models. All this helped Nvidia build a sticky customer base.\n\nTrading at 36.7 times forward earnings, Nvidia is not a cheap stock. But the recently announced 10-for-1 stock split, effective June 10, 2024, will make the stock much more accessible to retail investors -- although it does not change anything fundamental about the company.\n\nConsidering Nvidia's prowess in capitalizing on the ever-expanding AI opportunities, its commitment to innovation, and increasing accessibility for retail investors, it can be a compelling pick in 2024.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms came out with impressive results for the first quarter (ending March 31, 2024), with revenue and earnings surpassing consensus estimates. However, since the results were declared on April 24, the stock has seen some pullback as investors are concerned about the company's higher expense outlook for the year. Despite this short-term hiccup, there is still a lot to like about this social media and digital advertising stock in the long run.\n\nNearly 3.24 billion people -- 40% of the global population -- use Meta's social media applications (Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger) daily. This huge audience base gives Meta access to large amounts of personalized data. Meta is leveraging advanced AI technologies with this data to recommend more relevant and personalized content to users, which helps drive user engagement on its social media applications.\n\nAbout 30% of posts on Facebook feeds and 50% of Instagram content is AI-recommended. A more engaged user base translates to more ad views, purchase conversions, and more revenue for Meta. This is evident considering the number of ad impressions on Meta's apps worldwide grew 24% year over year, while the average price per ad was up by 6% year over year in the first quarter.\n\nMeta sees even more potential for content personalization by using a unified AI-based recommendation system across all its applications and all content formats (Reels, long-video format, Stories, Feeds), instead of using individual AI models for different products. The company is testing the new model architecture and is seeing significant improvement in certain key metrics.\n\nTo support its investments in building AI infrastructure, Meta guided for capital expenditures (capex) of $35 billion to $40 billion in fiscal 2024 (up from its previous estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion). While the accelerated pace of capex may seem challenging in the short run, it can help Meta outpace AI competition in the long term. Meta also has the financial resources to support its plans, since it is highly profitable and free-cash-flow positive.\n\nConsidering these aspects, Meta is positioned to continue dominating the global digital advertising market, estimated to grow from $550 billion in 2023 to $1.36 trillion in 2033. It makes sense for retail investors to buy the dip in this solid stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "You don’t have to buy speculative stocks to triple your money in a few years.\n\nIn fact, it’s even easier to triple your money if you set a lengthy time horizon. A slow and steady approach can yield better results than a high-risk, high-reward portfolio.\n\nBlue-chip stocks with immense potential tend to have a few things in common. These companies have rising revenue and profit margins. They also have tremendous long-term growth opportunities and strong demand for their offers. These three blue-chip stocks seem to fit the bill and have the potential to generate meaningful gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSteakhouse chain Texas Roadhouse (NASDAQ:TXRH) has 753 restaurants and uses a mix of its own restaurants and franchises. It has 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise restaurants. Company-owned restaurants grew by 5.4% year-over-year (YOY) while the total number of franchise restaurants was up by 17.2% YOY.\n\nCurrently, the corporation has an $11.5 billion market cap and a 35 P/E ratio. That valuation is more reasonable than most restaurant chains that are growing at similar rates as Texas Roadhouse. Also, the stock has a 1.41% yield along with an annualized dividend growth rate of 16.05% over the past decade.\n\nTexas Roadhouse reported 12.5% YOY revenue growth and 31.0% YOY net income growth in Q1 of 2024. More investors are loading up on restaurants with compelling growth prospects.\n\nIt’s a bit shocking that Texas Roadhouse hasn’t soared higher based on the current demand for these stocks. However, it’s to the benefit of investors who spot this under-the-radar pick. The hidden gem has held its own compared to most indices. Shares are up by 45% YTD and have gained 211% over the past five years.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) isn’t exactly a hidden gem. The tech giant is a trillion-dollar corporation that captures headlines as a member of the Magnificent Seven. However, this blue-chip stock still has the potential to triple its returns over the next decade.\n\nInvestors may feel as if a 35% year-to-date (YTD) gain and a 5-year gain of 170% make Meta Platforms due for a correction. However, the company’s financials support those returns. Net income more than doubled YOY in Q1 of 2024 as the social media giant aims to become more efficient. Revenue increased by 27% YOY, indicating that the company can trim its headcount while gaining market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlmost all of the company’s revenue comes from advertising. While Meta Platforms’ strides in artificial intelligence (AI) can lead to new income streams, investors have to treat it primarily as an ad company rather than a tech conglomerate.\n\nEven though advertising is the company’s make-or-break source of revenue, it’s a compelling pick for patient investors. Meta Platforms does very well in that department, and users continue to flock to the company’s social networks. Family daily active users reached 3.24 billion which is a 7% YOY improvement.\n\nElf Beauty (ELF) Image of teen girls taking a selfie on a shopping trip.\n\nSource: Studio Lucky/Shutterstock.com\n\nBeauty company Elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF) continues to exceed investors’ expectations while delivering impressive returns. The company is pricier than the others on this list with its 85 P/E ratio. Elf Beauty has the high valuation because investors have been rushing to buy shares. The stock is up by 34% YTD and has gained a superb 1,470% over the past five years.\n\nAlso, the cosmetics firm delivered its 21st consecutive quarter of net sales growth in Q4 of 2024. Revenue increased by 71% YOY in the quarter and resulted in the company’s first year of more than $1 billion in net sales. Also, the firm gained market share in the beauty industry for the fifth consecutive year.\n\nWhile its guidance initially spooked investors, Elf Beauty issued low guidance last year and proceeded to comfortably beat its guidance each quarter. The company has a vast opportunity as it taps into international markets. Leadership believes that it is still in its early innings of capitalizing on that opportunity.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in TXRH and ELF.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks to Buy in June for Great Gains",
        "content": "If you’re looking to maximize your returns in June, you should strongly consider growth stocks for your portfolio. So far in 2024, the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 are up over 12%, demonstrating that there’s a robust market environment that is conducive to the best growth stocks.\n\nGrowth stocks refer to shares in companies that are expected to grow at an above-average rate compared to others in the market. These firms typically reinvest their earnings back into the business rather than paying dividends. Instead, the focus is on expanding market share, developing new products or entering new markets.\n\nThe recent success in the Nasdaq composite and the S&P 500 creates an opportune moment to find growth stocks to buy. The tech-heavy Nasdaq, in particular, includes many prominent growth companies that have significant earnings momentum.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe are using the Portfolio Grader to identify the best growth stocks to buy, based on earnings performance, growth, momentum and analyst sentiment. Each of these outstanding equities gets an “A” or a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader and should not be ignored by investors seeking growth.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft (MSFT) sign outside of office building\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for consistency and long-term performance in a growth stock, it would be hard to top Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThe software company’s package of office products — Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook and Teams — are must-own products for businesses and individual users.\n\nMicrosoft is now the world’s most valuable publicly traded company publicly traded company in the world, valued at $3.15 trillion.\n\nIt used its $13 billion investment in OpenAI to bring generative AI to everyday use through ChatGPT, incorporating it into its products like Edge and Bing.\n\nAnd there’s no indications that Microsoft is going to slow down. CEO Satya Nadella told Fortune that his company must “stay humble, stay hungry, and exhibit a growth mindset.”\n\nMicrosoft’s new Surface model laptops could be a big part of that strategy. The company says the Surface are the “ultimate Copilot+ PCs, delivering incredible performance and brand-new AI experiences.”\n\nIf Microsoft can revolutionize the computer/hardware industry as much as it has the software industry, there’s no telling how high MSFT stock could climb. It’s not out of the question that it could touch $500 per share.\n\nMicrosoft stock is up 12% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) In this photo illustration, a woman holds a smartphone with the Nvidia Corporation (NVDA) logo displayed on the screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Microsoft is the most valuable company, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is newly minted as No. 2 on the list. The semiconductor company has now topped $3 trillion in market cap and I wouldn’t be surprised to see it surpass Microsoft by the end of the summer.\n\nNvidia’s mammoth run — the stock is up 212% in the last 12 months — is fueled by generative AI as well. Nvidia makes the powerful graphics processing units that are required to operate machine learning and generative AI applications, and has a mammoth market share of that business.\n\nAnd the business is just getting bigger. Elon Musk is creating a generative AI startup, xAI, to compete with OpenAI, and he reportedly plans to buy 100,000 of Nvidia’s H100 GPUs to power his business. Each of those H100 GPUs could cost $40,000, so the purchase order would be roughly $4 billion, for one company.\n\nAnd don’t forget that Nvidia declared a 10-for-1 stock split effective at the end of the business day June 7, so when the market opens on June 10, NVDA shares will be priced at $120 instead of $1,200. That’s much more appealing to retail investors and should give the stock yet another boost.\n\nNVDA stock is up 147% in 2024 and gets and “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) A photo of someone typing on a computer whose browser is open to Alphabet's Google search page.\n\nSource: Castleski / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ;GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another blue-chip name that’s a great growth stock. Its search engine, Google, has roughly 90% of global search traffic.\n\nThe company’s Chrome browser and YouTube platform add to the company’s mighty portfolio that brought in $80.5 billion in the first quarter. The majority of that was the result of advertising revenue.\n\nWhile Bing is powered by ChatGPT, Alphabet isn’t sitting still. The company is working to improve its Gemini generative AI product and allow it to do everything from captioning photos and videos to generating artwork.\n\nAnd this is a stock that has plenty of momentum. After a lackluster second half of 2023, GOOG stock is up 32% since March as investors have shaken off fears that the company could lose market share in its lucrative search engine business. I’m expecting the stock to continue to increase to the $200 mark.\n\nGOOG stock gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) In this photo illustration, the SoundHound logo seen displayed on a smartphone. SOUN stock\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) is an innovative AI company that makes voice recognition products that are powered by AI. The company’s platform allows users to ask questions about vehicle maintenance and provides step-by-step interactive training for employees.\n\nSoundHound’s platform is also used by restaurants to automate food ordering. Through its Dynamic Interaction platform, customers can verbally place complicated orders at a kiosk and pay without the intervention of an employee.\n\nShares of SOUN stock really took off earlier this year when Nvidia disclosed that it invested $3.7 million in the company, taking a 0.6% stake.\n\nRevenue in the first quarter was $11.6 million, up 73% for the fast-growing company. And while the company hasn’t yet posted a profit, it has dynamic potential — its subscription and booking backlog was $682 million, up 80% from just a year ago.\n\nSOUN stock is up 134% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) In this photo illustration, the Super Micro Computer, Inc. (SMCI) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere may be some who believe that Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) grew too much, too fast in the last year. The stock is up 258% in the last year, but pulled back dramatically since April, falling from $1,188 to around $800 at the time of this writing.\n\nBut I’m not bailing out on this one. I think Supermicro has a lot of juice left in it, and the success of companies like Nvidia and the AI craze have a lot to do with it.\n\nSupermicro designs and manufactures server architecture and hardware that is essential to cluster Nvidia’s GPUs so they can perform generative AI tasks. That’s why the company’s sales have tripled from a year ago, and why Supermicro increased its guidance from $14.3 billion to $14.7 billion previously, to $14.7 billion to $15.1 billion currently.\n\nBernstein analysts project that Big Tech capital expenditures could total $200 billion this year, with much of this figure going into the build out of AI capability. Supermicro will get a healthy percentage of that kind of business.\n\nEven with the recent pullback, SMCI stock is up 180% in 2024. It gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) famously changed its name from Facebook in 2021 in order to focus its attention on CEO Mark Zuckerberg’s vision of the future — the metaverse. But it’s been a return to the company’s core values that really triggered growth in META stock over the last year.\n\nAfter struggling through 2022 and spending tens of billions of dollars on the metaverse, Zuckerberg wisely reduced spending and staff to reorient the business on profitability. While the metaverse is still an aspiration, Meta is doing a much better job in 2023 and 2024 on improving its core assets and bringing value to META stock.\n\nIts using AI wisely — to create interesting generative AI products that improve the user experience for Facebook, Instagram, Threads and WhatsApp. AI also helps the advertising platform to efficiently get targeted messages to the users who are most likely to interact with them.\n\nMeta is looking to do more, including reportedly looking to form deals with media publishers to access to content for use in training its large-language models. Meta may also be making strides with its move into AI video generation software.\n\nI would not be surprised to see META shares at $600 within a year. The stock is up 39% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nInnovative Eyewear (LUCY) Smart glasses.

LUCY stock\n\nSource: tete_escape / Shutterstock.com\n\nTrue, there are a lot of blue-chip names on this list of growth stocks. But it’s also worth taking a look at a smaller name like Innovative Eyewear (NASDAQ:LUCY), whose shares are still priced at less than $1 and sports only a market cap of $17 million.\n\nInnovative Eyewear makes smart glasses — eyeglass frames that can incorporate wearable technology. Powered by ChatGPT, the company’s Lucyd glasses responds to voice commands to play music, take phone calls, or respond to queries.\n\nThe company launched a partnership with Eddie Bauer devices that includes four distinct styles that feature polarized sunglasses lenses and the first sale of smart glasses without rims.\n\nLUCY stock is up 81% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, Louis Navellier had long positions in MSFT, NVDA and SMCI.

        "title": "\"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Split: Who Will Be Next After Nvidia?",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split is a milestone for the artificial intelligence (AI) chip leader.\n\nIt's the company's first stock split in nearly three years after it split its shares during the pandemic-era tech boom. It also adds to a streak of stock splits enacted by the \"Magnificent Seven\" since this group of high-flying tech players began soaring at the start of the pandemic.\n\nOf the group, five of the seven stocks have split their shares in the last four years, and two -- including Nvidia's split set to take effect on June 7 -- have done it twice.\n\nThe table below shows which of the Magnificent Seven stocks have split in recent years and when.\n\nCompany Date Size of Split Apple Aug. 28, 2020 4-for-1 Tesla Aug. 31, 2020 5-for-1 Nvidia July 20, 2021 4-for-1 Amazon June 6, 2022 20-for-1 Alphabet July 15, 2022 20-for-1 Tesla Aug. 24, 2022 3-for-1 Nvidia June 7, 2024 10-for-1\n\nData source: Company reports.\n\nAs you can see, both Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) are missing from the list.\n\nNot surprisingly, those two stocks will have the highest individual share prices within the Magnificent Seven after Nvidia's split, so they look like the two most likely to split their shares next.\n\nLet's take a look at the case for each one. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWill Microsoft do a stock split?\n\nMicrosoft is the most valuable company in the world, with a market cap north of $3 trillion, and it's been publicly traded since the 1980s, so it shouldn't come as a surprise that the stock has had several splits in its history. However, it hasn't done any in nearly a generation; those splits were during the dot-com era or in its early history. In fact, its last stock split was a 2-for-1 in February 2003.\n\nMicrosoft struggled for years after the dot-com bubble burst, but over the last decade, the company has thrived under CEO Satya Nadella. He ended the company's war with Apple and invested aggressively in cloud computing, which is now its biggest business segment, led by Microsoft Azure. More recently, Microsoft stayed on the cutting edge of the generative AI revolution thanks to its close partnership with OpenAI, in which it's invested an estimated $13 billion.\n\nThe stock has jumped by more than 10 times during Nadella's tenure and now exceeds $400 a share, making it the third highest-priced stock on the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMicrosoft hasn't commented on a potential stock split, but one seems likely if the shares continue to move higher. Splitting its stock would help the company stay within the general boundaries of the Dow, which as a price-weighted index tends to avoid holding stocks with share prices that are too high.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill Meta Platforms do a stock split?\n\nUnlike any of its Magnificent Seven peers, Meta Platforms has never done a stock split. It's the most recent of the seven stocks to go public, holding its IPO in 2012, with a starting price of $38 per share. Since then, the stock has appreciated considerably and trades at $477 as of Tuesday's close, meaning the shares are up by roughly 13 times since it went public.\n\nThat's an impressive track record for the social media leader, but it has yet to translate into a stock split, and executives haven't addressed it so far.\n\nThe Facebook parent did just pay a dividend for the first time, indicating that management might be willing to consider a stock split as well. While there isn't a direct connection between dividends and stock splits, implementing a dividend is a significant change in the company's approach to managing the stock and returning capital to shareholders.\n\nIts share price isn't quite at the point where a split seems expected, but it does have a higher share price than any of the other Magnificent Seven stocks. Like other companies have said about their stock splits, a split would probably help make the shares more attractive to retail investors, and it could also help Meta gain admission into the Dow because it would bring its price more in line with the average Dow stock.\n\nWhich will be the next to split its stock?\n\nOf these two companies, Meta seems to be more likely to be the next to do a stock split. Not only is its share price higher than Microsoft's, but its valuation is also cheaper at a price-to-earnings ratio of 27. It also has a lower market cap than Microsoft, meaning that it's easier for the share price to surge from its current level because it can do so by adding less market value than Microsoft.\n\nThere's no guarantee that Meta will split its stock, but it would make sense for the company to do so -- especially if the share price keeps going up.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Faceswap deepfakes are a growing problem online that’s costing creators millions—but social media services are doing little to stop it",
        "content": "Last year, Ashley Suarez learned that someone had reposted images of her showing off dresses and different hair styles on Instagram without permission, but replaced her face. This imposter, who went by the name Elizabeth Reid, used the images to build a big social media following—and to make money by accepting gifts from fans, and from pornography.\n\n“I was getting sent a lot of these videos, because people would recognize the background as being my own, because I made most of my TikTok's in my parents' home,” says Suarez, who earns a living from modeling and promoting products online thanks to her nearly 500,000 followers on both Instagram and TikTok. “They were like, 'This looks just like your video, but it's not your face.'\"\n\nIt was just one of many examples that Suarez knows of her content being stolen, altered, and then reposted online. The rising availability and sophistication of so-called “faceswap” deepfake technology has made it easier than ever for people to pull it off.\n\nWith the help of slight alterations, those responsible make stolen images difficult to detect using automation. Meanwhile, copyright laws give the practice some protection under an exception for works that are slightly altered from the original.\n\nMany social media companies appear to have been unprepared for the onslaught on faceswap images and have created major hurdles for image owners to get the images taken down. Only recently have they started being more aggressive in tackling the problem that is only expected to get worse.\n\nSuarez first fell victim to faceswaping three years ago when she saw content she shot of herself at her family home in Naples, Fla. repurposed on Instagram with a face that was not her own. At the time, she told her parents, called the police, and reported the content to Instagram. When none of her efforts worked, Suarez deleted her social media accounts and began seeing a therapist. A few weeks later, she came to a turning point: She hired Takesdowns.AI, which scans the internet for stolen images of its clients—or client images that have been tweaked using AI—and asks social platforms to remove the imposter’s content.\n\n“I realized I didn’t want to live in fear,” recalls Suarez, now 21.\n\nTakedowns.AI’s CEO Kunal Anand says that instances of faceswap deepfakes have increased 500% in recent months. Such images are found across TikTok, Instagram, Facebook, and sites like Patreon and Fanvue, where pornography is allowed.\n\nTakedowns.AI contacted Instagram, but was told in an email, “It’s not clear you are the rights owner or are otherwise authorized to submit this report on the rights owner’s behalf.” Instagram asked Suarez to submit a new report from her email address or respond with documentation showing she was authorized to do so. But after following the instructions, Takedowns.AI received the same message from Instagram.\n\nStory continues\n\nFrustrated, Takedowns.AI took matters into its own hands, and sent messages directly to Suarez’s imposter account that threatened legal action unless the account was deleted. A few days later, the “Elizabeth Reid” account was gone.\n\nThe services of Takedowns.AI don’t come cheap. Suarez and her family shelled out between $2,000 to $3,000 monthly for its services, putting them into debt before hiring the company on a two-year retainer in 2023 at a discounted rate.\n\nSuarez said the money spent is worth it because platforms like Instagram refuse to remove content based on creator complaints alone. She thinks the platform listens more to companies like Takedowns.AI, which sometimes uses attorneys to send complaints.\n\nThough generating faceswap images may seem complicated, AI tools like Stable Diffusion and open source forums like GitHub make it relatively easy for people to do it without much technical skill. One post on GitHub that people can tap for faceswap coding, the software for using AI to alter photos, has garnered nearly 50,000 likes.\n\nEarnings for faceswap scammers can easily justify the effort. One user who posted on an anonymous developer forum says that they made over $100,000 from it since starting in January.\n\nInitially, social media platforms like TikTok and Facebook-parent Meta generally refused to do anything in response to complaints from Takedowns.AI about faceswapping, Anand says. The reason, he says, is that they considered the images in question as “transformative works,” a legal exception that lets people use otherwise copyrighted work without permission in a different manner, or slightly altered, from the original. Many creators are “losing millions even though their own content is being used, without them even getting to monetize it,” Anand laments. Faceswap deepfaked profiles\n\nFaceswaps may not be legal\n\nKristin Grant, a managing partner at Grant Attorneys at Law who specializes in intellectual property, acknowledges the legal hurdle of transformative works when it comes to stolen images. But she says creators like Suarez could have a strong legal claim under a different law: rights of publicity, which protects against misappropriation of a person’s likeness, among other things.\n\nRights of publicity laws vary state-by-state, so the strength of a case involving faceswap fakes depends on where the creator lives. “Using someone else’s image without their authorization for commercial purposes—that is illegal,” Grant says.\n\nSocial platforms struggle to keep up with AI advances\n\nRecently, Anand says Facebook, Instagram, and TikTok have started doing a better job of removing faceswap images after Takedowns.AI’s reports, noting they still have room for improvement. In his experience, when Instagram reacts to a complaint these days, it generally only removes the offending post, and not the entire account.\n\nRecently, some social media services have started cracking down more broadly on AI-generated content.\n\nMeta says it will use automation and complaints by content creators to decide when to apply “made with AI” labels to AI-generated videos, images, and audio posted on its platforms so that users know they’re created by computers. The automation, however, is far from perfect, and Takedowns.AI’s Anand says it failed to detect faceswaps in many cases that his company ending up having to flag to Meta.\n\nUnder its policies, Meta doesn’t proactively ban content that infringes on others’ copyright or trademark rights and only takes down content after someone reports a violation—while sometimes preserving the account. It has no policy specific to faceswap images like those involving Suarez.\n\nMeta declined to comment for this article.\n\nMeanwhile, until early May, TikTok required creators to label their own AI-generated videos and had no policies to address faceswaps. The honor system did little to stop faceswappers and others from passing off AI-generated content as authentic to the platform’s 1 billion active users.\n\nIn May, TikTok changed its policies and said it would join rivals Meta and Google’s YouTube in automatically applying an “AI-generated” label to AI videos posted on its service. It is unclear how effective this tool is for TikTok.\n\nTikTok declined to comment for this article.\n\nHow porn sites fit in\n\nFaceswapping may not be a major concern for average social media users, but it can be a huge problem for creators, especially women who post sexually suggestive or explicit content. Loose verification requirements on many creator-focused adult sites and the lure of easy money for people who steal images make it an attractive business.\n\n“I think women who are sexualized at a young age are the biggest victims,” says Suarez. “I was very sexualized when I was very young…it really has been going on for years.”\n\nOnlyFans, known mostly for pornography, may be the strictest platform when it comes to policing AI-generated content. It bars creators who use AI from making money on its site and requires that creators verify their accounts by uploading photos of their driver licenses that correspond with their likenesses in the content. Still, pornography on OnlyFans continues to be stolen and then manipulated by faceswappers, who post it to other platforms, says Anand, who also founded ChatPersona, a company that lets OnlyFans creators use AI bots to for racy chats with customers.\n\nA representative for OnlyFans declined to comment on this article.\n\nFanvue also requires that creators upload their driver's licenses before letting them open accounts on the platform. But hackers said on a digital forum that the images on those licenses aren’t checked as to whether they match the creators’ likeness.\n\nFanvue did not respond to Fortune’s multiple requests for comment.\n\nTools for detecting faceswaps may be as controversial as the faceswaps themselves\n\nTakedowns.AI offers creators a system to prevent their likenesses from being used in faceswaps, but it creates privacy concerns. Users upload photos of their faces to Takedowns.AI and the technology, powered by third-party service PimEyes, crawls the internet to find identical and modified versions.\n\n“You can just scan your face, and whatever it finds, you can just take it down,” Anand said.\n\nIt’s similar to Google’s reverse image search, which allows Google search users to insert an image, rather than text, as a search query, and find matches. But unlike Google, Takedowns.AI has integrated social media profiles of individuals into the results. This feature is essential for creators to find and report faceswapped content. But some privacy advocates worry the tool can scoop up the images of people who don’t have social media profiles, but whose faces have been shared online by friends and family.\n\n\"Love excuses everything\"\n\nAnother creator Takedowns.AI says it represents is former high school weightlifter Carolina Samani, who posts sexy photos and videos on Instagram, making money through OnlyFans. Samani’s faceswap deepfaker goes by Julia Rossi, and despite Takedowns.AI’s multiple complaints over a number of months, Rossi’s Instagram account remained live until early June, when Instagram finally removed it.\n\nRossi, with the help of her faceswapped content originally from Samani, had attracted 210,000 Instagram followers, about half as many followers as Samani has lured after years of posting to the platform.\n\nIn response to one smitten fan on Instagram, Rossi, or whoever was controlling her account, provided a window into her worldview about right and wrong. “Is it worth committing an [sic] arson for you? 😘😍🤎,”the fan asked.\n\nRossi gave a cavalier and emoji-filled response: “Love excuses everything 🫢😂.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is the holding company for the notable search engine and cloud computing giant Google. The software firm rose to prominence at the beginning of the 21st century as a search engine but has moved into burgeoning new economy sectors, the most recent being generative artificial intelligence (AI). Google’s cloud computing arm is finally scaling in terms of profitability after years of investment. In particular, Google Cloud more than quadrupled its operating income to $900 million in the first quarter of 2024, allowing the cloud platform to emerge as a viable competitor to AWS and Microsoft Azure.\n\nFortunately for investors, plenty of successful technology companies are in the stock market. Some of these could very well eclipse Google over the coming years. These firms operate in similar spaces to the software giant and will see their market caps rise as they capture growth opportunities in their respective sectors. Add these to your stocks-to-buy list.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) An image of a laptop on a table with the screen showing the red and blue logo for Chinese Internet company \"Baidu\", with the background being blurred.\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is a Chinese internet giant and has also been a pioneer of research into artificial intelligence (AI) technologies. The software firm began its foray into AI research and development over a decade ago. Subsequently, Baidu moved to establish the Institute of Deep Learning (IDL) in Beijing and the Silicon Valley AI Lab (SVAIL) in California to focus on advancing AI technologies. While Silicon Valley tech giants get all the credit for how AI has advanced over the years, Chinese firms and their American counterparts began heavily investing in the space around the same time.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBaidu is relying upon its ERNIE chatbot, which it began developing in 2019, to build up its market position in China where ChatGPT is available. The software company also expects its AI Cloud business to grow over the coming years as AI companies within China demand more server power to develop their own large language models.\n\nBeing based in Beijing, Baidu has an immense market opportunity before it. The company is trading at 9.6x forward earnings, below all of its American internet and cloud counterparts. With that said, as China’s economy recovers, Baidu has the potential to eclipse Big Tech firms, including Google.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is a designer of CPUs and GPUs that power PCs, laptops and high-tech servers. The chipmaker has remained in the spotlight ever since the AI craze hit the market last year. Mostly, AMD’s chief competitor, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), has enjoyed fame and record growth for providing the world with advanced chips for building AI models. As a result, Nvidia’s market cap is floating around $2.8T and continues to rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs AMD scales up its launch into the AI chip world, the chipmaker’s valuation will definitely benefit. At Computex 2024, a tech conference based in Taipei, Taiwan, AMD unveiled the next generation of Ryzen laptop processors that will handle generative AI workloads: the Ryzen AI 300 Series. Moreover, AMD announced the MI325X chip that will launch later in the year. While this chip is beyond Nvidia’s Blackwell chips in terms of performance, AMD’s advancements in the space are always welcome.\n\nAMD’s market capitalization is only $268 billion. Nonetheless, as the chipmaker creates a space for itself in the AI chip market, investors can bet the valuation will increase.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), formally known as Facebook, is probably the closest entry on this list to eclipsing Google in terms of market valuation. The social media platform boasts a market cap of $1.2 trillion, while Google has a market cap of $2.1 trillion. Along with many Big Tech companies, Meta Platforms plans to build out AI tools and services to spur long-term revenue growth. Meta has earmarked $35 to $40 billion worth of capital expenditures for 2024 as the company looks to build up the infrastructure it needs to train and launch AI models. More investments into AI will probably have a higher return on investment for the software platform, especially when considering its virtual reality investments have yet to pay off. On an earnings call, CEO Mike Zuckerberg noted how monetizable the company’s AI services would be when launched at scale.\n\nQ1 results for fiscal year 2024 came in above Wall Street estimates, with quarterly revenue increasing 27% year-over-year to $36.4 billion, while net income for the quarter more than doubled to $12.4 billion.\n\nAs Meta finds more ways to incorporate artificial intelligence technologies into its social media platforms, the software firm could see its market value increase so much that it rises well past Google.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Alibaba Group Holding, the e-commerce giant that is investing heavily in generative artificial intelligence (AI), has updated its open-source AI models with claims of besting Meta Platforms' Llama 3 model in certain tasks.\n\nAlibaba Cloud on Friday launched Qwen2 - the second iteration of its open-source Tongyi Qianwen family of large language models (LLM), the technology behind chatbots such as OpenAI's ChatGPT - with a series of updates including multilingual pre-training and an expanded the context window. That means it now allows for much longer queries and answers, putting in it the league of the world's most powerful open source LLMs.\n\nQwen2 comes in five variations. The high-end Qwen2-72B model consistently offered better results than Meta's Llama 3-70B - the strongest open-source AI model from the Facebook owner - in various benchmark tests, according to Alibaba. Tests include maths, coding, natural and social sciences, engineering and the humanities, the company said in a post published to the model's official GitHub page.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nAlibaba, which owns the South China Morning Post, has launched Qwen2 just one month after unveiling Tongyi Qianwen 2.5, which is closed source. The company said at the time that model performs better in various Chinese capabilities than GPT-4, OpenAI's most advanced model, which is also closed source.\n\nThe five variations of Alibaba's Qwen2, from the more nimble Qwen2-0.5B to its most sophisticated Qwen2-72B, have between 490 million and 72.7 billion parameters. They are also trained on 27 languages, in addition to Chinese and English: nine from Europe, four from the Middle East, and 14 from Asia.\n\nThe rapid follow-up launch of a new AI model, with capabilities matching leading global models, reflects the confidence that the Chinese firm has in funnelling an increasing amount of resources into an AI race that has engulfed much of the tech industry.\n\nMany other Chinese companies, from the biggest tech giants to myriad start-ups, have been forging ahead in their own LLM development efforts, recently igniting a domestic price war.\n\nShenzhen-based social media and video gaming giant Tencent Holdings announced its own dedicated chatbot in late May called Yuanbao, backed by the company's latest Hunyuan LLM. Tencent said its home-grown model has gone through a series of enhancements since its launch last September.\n\nStory continues\n\nHunyuan has been baked into more than 600 business scenarios across Tencent's organisations, as it aims to use AI to help boost efficiency. Alibaba is also looking to leverage AI to help transform businesses.\n\nAlibaba.com, the e-commerce giant's business-to-business cross-border sourcing platform, has recently introduced its own AI-powered tools to help connect sellers and buyers to boost sales, Zhang Kuo, the platform's president, told the Post in a recent interview.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stands against the other quality stocks.\n\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\n\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\n\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\n\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\n\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying. Facebook, is FB a good stock to buy, NASDAQ:FB, Sunanda Jayaseelan, Internet.org, Bharti Airtel, Mark Zuckerberg, Cleartrip, NewsHunt, FlipKart, Net Neutrality, NDTV, Airtel Zero, India, Telecom Regulatory Authority of India, Times of India,\n\nMethodology\n\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n2. Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 246\n\nMeta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) owns Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. It's another highly rated big tech AI stock. The average of 52 one year Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) share price target is $512.99 and the average rating is Strong Buy. The firm has also beaten analyst EPS estimates in all four of its latest quarters. A Strong Buy doesn't scratch the itch? Well, consider a rather rare Sell rating on Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s shares by BNP Paribas in May 2024. The firm took aim at Meta's AI spending, sharing that while other big tech AI players like Alphabet have the revenue to fund it, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) might find it difficult to do so. AI spending has been a key concern for Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) investors, and they have often punished the shares because of it.\n\nAs of Q1 2024 end, 246 out of the 933 hedge funds covered by Insider Monkey's research were Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s stakeholders. Rajiv Jain's GQG Partners held the most valuable stake which was worth $5.5 billion.\n\nLike Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META)'s price to forward earnings ratio is 23.63 which is nearly in line with the S&P 500's 21. Additionally, while the revenue has grown by 57% over the past four years, the shares have appreciated by 123%, creating similar worries to Google's stock. However, Meta could benefit significantly from making its AI model Llama open source and capturing market share. While BNP Paribas is wary of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Harding Loevner took a different tone in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\nMeta’s AI-powered Advantage+ product is winning an increasing share of advertisers’ budgets, supporting the company’s continued dominance of the digital-advertising market. Meta’s content-recommendation engine also has improved engagement and monetization for the Reels video feature, as competition from TikTok abates. Netflix reported better-than-expected subscriber growth for the fourth quarter of 2023 and improving profitability, trends that management said would continue in 2024.\n\nOverall, META ranks 2nd among the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy now. You can visit 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy to see the other quality stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of META as an AI play, our conviction lies in the belief that there are other AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than META but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Technology connects billions of people and has changed how we communicate and obtain information.  It’s hard to think of a time when people had to trudge through the rain to get to their local library. Now, you can find information on any subject with a few clicks.\n\nMany corporations have capitalized on innovative technology and have delivered impressive returns for their investors. However, some tech stocks look like dinosaurs while others are continuing to soar. Let’s examine some of the top tech stocks that investors are considering.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) The META backed Threads app as a compelling alternative to Twitter. Social media application technology concept.\n\nSource: Cat Box / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) knows how to grab people’s attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe social media giant profits from people’s time as they consume content on Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp. It’s been a winning formula for several years, as the stock is up by 175% over the past five years. Also, Meta Platforms is up by 38% year-to-date (YTD) and comes with a 27.5 P/E ratio.\n\nRecently, the firm began to pay dividends which start at 50 cents per share. The current yield is 0.42%. While some corporations offer dividends to signal that growth is slowing, Meta Platforms has been delivering solid results. Q1 2024 revenue increased by 27% year-over-year (YOY) while net income soared by 117% YOY.\n\nFurther, META focuses on the bottom line ever since a miserable 2022. Shareholders have benefitted greatly from this shift. Wall Street analysts are excited about the stock and have rated it as a strong buy. The average price target suggests a 10% upside from current levels.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity firm Crowdstrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to deliver exceptional revenue growth. The company reported 33% YOY revenue growth in Q4 of 2024 and a shocking surge in net income. The firm reported a net profit of $53.7 million compared to a net loss of $47.5 million in the same period last year.\n\nAdditionally, Crowdstrike makes most of its revenue from recurring business, so it should continue to generate meaningful returns for several years. Annual recurring revenue reached $3.44 billion to wrap up fiscal 2024. This figure is 34% higher than the same period last year.\n\nThe stock has been booming for quite a while. Shares are up by 25% YTD, gaining 381% over the past five years. Currently, it trades at a 79 forward P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd, Wall Street analysts have high hopes for Crowdstrike. The cybersecurity stock is currently rated as a strong buy with the average price target suggesting a 30% gain from current levels.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been outpacing the stock market for several years as its AI chips continue to generate plenty of demand. The stock has more than doubled YTD while logging in gains above 3,000% over the past five years.\n\nThe company announced its latest AI chips to gain more ground on its competition. This quick turnaround indicates Nvidia is doing what it can to maintain its strong lead over competing firms.\n\nNvidia has been reporting solid financial results for several years, and that trend continued in Q1 of 2025. Revenue surged by 262% YOY while net income soared by 628% YOY. The company’s announcement of a 10-for-1 stock split has attracted more investors who have a chance of buying shares at a lower price.\n\nWall Street analysts advocated for the stock long before its stock split announcement. The AI chip leader is rated as a strong buy and has a projected 5% upside based on the average price target. Recent price targets offer a more optimistic picture, including a recent $1,500 price target. This highest forecast indicates that a 30% gain is possible.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another AI leader that continues to generate revenue and earnings growth due to its business verticals. The company has leading positions in cloud computing, business software, cybersecurity, artificial intelligence (AI) and advertising. Those components have resulted in a 12% YTD gain and a sterling 215% gain over the past five years.\n\nThird quarter of 2024 financials showed plenty of promise. Revenue increased by 17% YOY as demand for Microsoft Cloud remains strong. Meanwhile, net income came to $21.9 billion which was up by 20% YOY. Microsoft Cloud revenue grew by 23% YOY and represents more than half of Microsoft’s total revenue.\n\nAlso, MSFT saw double-digit growth rates for its “Productivity and Business Processes” segment as well as its “More Personal Computing” part of the business. The firm returned $8.4 billion to shareholders through buybacks and dividends. Microsoft’s yield currently stands at 0.73%. The company has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 10.60% over the past decade.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a semiconductor company that has been performing well after missing out on the initial AI rally. Shares are up by an impressive 47% YTD and have tripled over the past five years. Qualcomm stock trades at a 28 P/E ratio and offers a 1.65% yield. The company has raised its dividend for 21 consecutive years and has a dividend payout ratio slightly above 40%.\n\nThe firm’s Q2 of 2024 results indicate the company is taking steps in the right direction to reinvigorate growth. After several quarters of declining revenue and earnings, Qualcomm reported 1% YOY revenue growth. While some growth is better than no growth, the company did a phenomenal job with its net income, which was up by 37% YOY.\n\nFinally, the corporation returned $1.6 billion to shareholders through stock buybacks and dividends. Currently, the company’s quarterly dividend stands at $0.85 per share after a recent 6.3% hike.\n\nOracle (ORCL) A photo of an Oracle (ORCL stock) sign outside a building.\n\nSource: Jer123 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTop-tier software company Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) has delivered solid returns while holding onto a 31.5 P/E ratio and a 1.34% yield. It has “growth at a reasonable” price and has been rewarding for long-term investors. The stock is up by 15% YTD and has gained 124% over the past five years.\n\nAdditionally, the company reported 7% YOY revenue growth in Q3 of 2024 as cloud revenue pushed up results. And Q3 cloud revenue came to $5.1 billion which was up by 25% YOY. That represents almost 40% of the company’s total revenue. Also, Oracle expanded its net profit margins thanks to a 27% YOY improvement in net income.\n\nOracle only has a 41% dividend payout ratio and has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 14.31% over the past decade. The low payout ratio and solid financials suggest that Oracle can maintain a double-digit growth rate for its dividend.\n\nCurrently, the software company is rated as a moderate buy with a projected 17% upside. The highest price target of $160 per share implies a 34% gain.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Website of Adobe (ADBE) Firefly seen in an iPhone. In Mar 2023 Adobe announced the beta launch of its new generative AI model Firefly.\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlso, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) has a lot of supporters in Wall Street. It’s rated as a moderate buy with a projected 42% upside based on the average price target. The highest price target of $703 suggests that Adobe stock can gain an additional 60%. The lowest price target of $445 per share still suggests that the stock can achieve some upside based on current levels.\n\nThe creative software company is off to a bad start with a 24% YTD decline. Despite the recent struggles, Adobe is still up by 58% over the past five years. It’s present P/E ratio stands at 42 .\n\nRecently, Adobe reported 11% YOY revenue growth in Q1 of 2024. The company’s remaining performance obligations stand at $17.58 billion, which is more than three times its Q1 of 2024 revenue of $5.18 billion.\n\nStill, the corporation is making strides to reward shareholders despite recent events. Adobe repurchased roughly 3.1 million shares in the first quarter.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in CRWD, NVDA, and MSFT.

        "content": "The biggest antitrust regulators in the US are stepping up their scrutiny of the nation’s most powerful developers of artificial intelligence.\n\nThe Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission have launched and divided up investigations of Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT) and OpenAI, according to reporting from the New York Times and Wall Street Journal.\n\nThe DOJ will lead a probe of Nvidia’s (NVDA) dominance in the market for microprocessors that power AI, according to the Times. The FTC would lead antitrust investigations into Microsoft and OpenAI. Federal Trade Commission Chair Lina Khan, left, and assistant attorney general for antitrust Jonathan Kanter participate in a discussion on antitrust reforms last October in Washington, DC. (Photo by Drew Angerer/Getty Images) (Drew Angerer via Getty Images)\n\nThe new scrutiny is part of a wide-ranging effort by the Biden administration to rein in what it views as anticompetitive behavior across a number of industries, from healthcare to groceries to tech.\n\nThe administration has already alleged anticompetitive conduct against tech giants Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN), and claimed that Microsoft's acquisition of gaming giant Activision Blizzard would create a gaming market monopoly.\n\nIt also took to trial a case filed by the Trump administration over Alphabet's (GOOG, GOOGL) dominance in search. A judge is currently weighing the evidence in that case, with a decision expected this year.\n\nThe efforts have not always been successful. The FTC failed in its challenge against Microsoft’s acquisition of Activision Blizzard and fell short in a separate battle to prevent Meta (META) from being able to purchase VR company Within.\n\nThe FTC made it clear last year that it wanted to look a lot closer at the burgeoning field of AI.\n\nIt said last July that it had started a consumer protection-based investigation into OpenAI’s data collection practices, and potential harms caused by the output of its large language models (LLMs).\n\nThen in January, it began a broader inquiry into deals between Big Tech and AI developers, including Microsoft’s $13 billion investment in OpenAI, and Alphabet’s relationship with rival AI developer Anthropic.\n\nThe Wall Street Journal reported that the FTC’s probe of Microsoft will extend beyond an examination of the tech giant's conduct to include a deal it reached with AI developer Inflection AI.\n\nAccording to the Journal, the FTC wants to know why Microsoft chose to pay Inflection a $650 million licensing fee to resell Inflection's technology, rather than buy it. The regulator's interest was piqued, according to the report, because Microsoft also acquired most of Inflection’s staff as part of the accord.\n\nIn response to the report, Microsoft’s spokesperson said the agreements with Inflection gave it an opportunity to recruit Inflection AI staff and accelerate development of its AI chat interface Microsoft Copilot.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat structure, Microsoft said, enables Inflection to continue pursuing its independent business and ambition as an AI studio.\n\n\"We take our legal obligations to report transactions under the HSR Act seriously and are confident that we have complied with those obligations,\" the spokesperson said.\n\nBoth companies received subpoenas from the FTC asking for information tied to the deal, the Journal reported.\n\nNvidia declined to comment on the reports.\n\nMichael Carrier, an antitrust expert and co-director of Rutgers Institute for Information Policy and Law, said antitrust regulators looking to test the Microsoft agreement against antitrust laws will look to the substance and not the structure of the deal.\n\n\"The agency will try to determine whether Microsoft restructured this deal in a way that gave it control of InflectionAI while avoiding FTC review of the transaction,\" Carrier said.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. is adding new artificial intelligence features to its messaging app WhatsApp, including an AI assistant that can help businesses connect with customers, answer questions, and sell their goods and services via chat.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBehind ‘Suicide Squad,’ the Year’s Biggest Video-Game Flop Billionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day A Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions ‘Everything Is Not Going to Be OK’ in Private Equity, Apollo’s Co-President Says Vietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media\n\nWhatsApp will soon test the new AI-powered assistant with businesses in India and Singapore, followed by Brazil. WhatsApp already includes an AI-powered assistant for regular users, but these new products were built specifically for businesses that regularly handle customer service queries and interactions. The new features will support more than 200 million businesses that rely on WhatsApp to chat with their customers, the company said.\n\n“Any business should be able to quickly stand up an agent that can talk to your customers, provide support and facilitate commerce,” Meta Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg said Thursday when he announced the new assistant during an event in São Paulo.\n\nWhatsApp, which has more than 2 billion users worldwide, is particularly popular in places like Brazil, India, Indonesia and Mexico, where it’s common for people to chat with local businesses using the service. More than 120 million people use WhatsApp in Brazil each month, for example.\n\nThe company also plans to launch a version of its consumer-focused Meta AI assistant in Portuguese next month. Meta AI, which is powered by the company’s large language model known as Llama, can answer users’ questions across Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp.\n\nMeta, which acquired WhatsApp in 2014 for $19 billion, has been searching for more ways to monetize its popular messaging app. A Business version of the app is currently free, but offers some paid features. The company also makes money by charging businesses to send some messages to their customers, and by selling ads on Instagram and Facebook that link to a WhatsApp chat, called click-to-message ads.\n\nMarketers will soon be able to create those ads using AI, the company announced Thursday. Meta is currently testing that feature in English-speaking markets such as the US and Singapore, with plans to expand further. Zuckerberg has previously said that click-to-message ads could generate $10 billion annually for Meta.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Zuckerberg's Quiet Retail Takeover: Facebook Marketplace Has 4x Customers More Than Amazon\n\nFor some, it’s surprising; for others, not so much. Facebook Marketplace is now a genuine contender to eBay, Amazon, Craigslist, and other online marketplaces and e-commerce sites. It has been for quite some time.\n\nAccording to Fortune, Marketplace had more than 15 times more monthly active users (MAUs) than Craigslist in 2017 — 800 million versus 55 million. According to a report from Capital One Shopping, that rose to 1.2 billion today. On the other hand, the e-commerce giant Amazon had 310 million monthly users in 2023, and eBay had 132 million active buyers worldwide. Regarding active users, Zuckerberg’s Marketplace undoubtedly overshadows them as it has experienced rapid growth and now has tremendous reach.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nA startup that turns videos into games gets backing from Mark Cubanand opens a round for regular investors at $250. Executives and founders of Uber, Facebook and Apple are bullish on this wellness app that you can coinvest in at $1.15 per share.\n\nHistory\n\nLaunched in 2016, it has become a key player in the online marketplace industry, offering a user-friendly platform integrated into the widely-used Facebook app. This integration has provided convenience and accessibility since its inception, making it easier for users to buy and sell items within their social network. The Marketplace also benefited plenty from Facebook’s advanced algorithm and data analytics, which resulted in more targeted advertisements and personalized user experiences.\n\nHowever, perhaps the most important advantage is that it’s associated with a huge brand: Facebook. Although the name has been connected to many controversies over the years, it still conveys a trust factor in many people’s eyes.\n\nWhat started as a simple way for neighbors to sell their unwanted items has ballooned into an e-commerce giant in recent years. But is there any money in it for its parent company, Meta?\n\nTrending: A groundbreaking energy company plugs into the $400 billion EV industry and is seeking investors.\n\nRevenue?\n\nMeta generates revenue from Facebook Marketplace primarily through advertising and transaction fees. Since 2018, businesses and individual sellers have paid to promote their listings, which increases visibility and reach among potential buyers. These ads appear within the Marketplace interface, much like regular Facebook ads, and can be targeted using Facebook's sophisticated advertising algorithms.\n\nMeta also charges fees on certain types of transactions. For instance, when a sale is made through Marketplace’s shipping option, Meta collects a 10% or $0.80 per listing for items sold.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere’s yet to be an exact figure for how much revenue this generates for Meta. However, we know that Meta’s advertising revenue totaled $134.9 billion in 2023, with a net income of $39 billion. Even if the company isn’t exactly raking in billions of dollars from this side of the business, it is providing a lot of valuable data for targeted advertising and keeping users coming back to the Facebook website.\n\nScams\n\nScams on Facebook Marketplace are an unfortunate reality that buyers and sellers need to watch out for — from fake listings and payment scams to phishing and nondelivery scams.\n\nAs the BBB reported in 2022, some scams include nonexisting big-ticket items like electronics, iPhones, or even cars and RVs where the supposed seller asks the buyer to first wire the money or send funds via Zelle, CashApp, Venmo, or a similar service. The seller and the third-party service are a con, and the item doesn’t exist. The buyer sends the whole amount, part of it that serves as a deposit or inputs their bank details into a fake website.\n\nIf you have ever tried selling something on this platform, or any other, for that matter, you know precisely how rife they are with scammers of all kinds.\n\nDespite challenges like scams, Facebook Marketplace continues to thrive, providing Meta with significant revenue opportunities and valuable user data, solidifying its position as a major player in the e-commerce landscape.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare?

        "title": "AI’s regulatory troubles pile up as U.S. prepares antitrust probes and activists target Meta over privacy",
        "content": "Earlier this week I asked you all what you thought about foldable phones—a category that seems to be taking off—and I got some great answers that I’m publishing below. But first, the weather: Storm clouds are gathering on the regulatory front for the AI industry.\n\nIn the U.S., antitrust is the issue. According to the New York Times, the Federal Trade Commission and Justice Department have struck a deal to open investigations into the biggest AI players. The DOJ will probe how Nvidia has come to thoroughly own the AI chip market, while the FTC will look into OpenAI and its maybe-BFF Microsoft, which has invested $13 billion into OpenAI in exchange for a cut of its profits (at least, until OpenAI produces superhuman \"artificial general intelligence.\")\n\n“One of the things to think through is conflict of interest, a thumb on the scale, because [chipmakers] fear enabling a competitor or are helping to prop up a customer,” DOJ antitrust chief Jonathan Kanter told the Financial Times.\n\nIn Europe, privacy is the biggest thing today (though regulators are also examining antitrust issues in AI.) As I reported in April, Max Schrems, the Austrian activist-lawyer who has had huge success tackling Meta/Facebook over its assorted privacy violations, has turned his attention to AI. In that case, Schrems’s privacy nonprofit Noyb filed an official complaint against OpenAI, claiming ChatGPT’s hallucinations violate the EU General Data Protection Regulation by handing out incorrect information about people. Now he’s going after his usual target.\n\nMeta recently changed its European privacy policy to let the company use people’s public personal posts and media, and data from other online sources, for an unspecified “AI technology” that can share data with third parties. Noyb says this breaks the GDPR in multiple ways—people can only opt out from having this done, rather than being given the chance to give proper consent with an opt-in; and there’s no clear way for them to have the data deleted once it’s in the system; and it’s illegal to not clearly specify what will happen with the data.\n\nSchrems: “Meta is basically saying that it can use 'any data from any source for any purpose and make it available to anyone in the world', as long as it’s done via 'AI technology.' This is clearly the opposite of GDPR compliance.” Asked for comment, a Meta spokesperson referred me to the blog post the company published when it announced the change to its privacy policy; the post claims that Meta's AI expansion is done “in a responsible way that complies with privacy rules.”\n\nStory continues\n\nRemember, Schrems has already destroyed two U.S.-EU deals that let American firms process Europeans’ personal data, and recently put an end to Meta’s attempt to charge European users for the privilege of not being tracked online. Remember too that the GDPR’s fines run up to 4% of global annual revenue—a much bigger deal for Meta than for OpenAI.\n\nAnd now, phones.\n\nA bunch of you are very much interested in trying a foldable smartphone. “If a smaller folded phone would fit better in my pockets, especially in my running shorts, then I’d be very interested,” said TP, while LN is waiting for the next version of Google’s Pixel Fold: “I really like a lot of the features on Pixels, so if I could get all those features plus have a foldable, I'd be willing to spend a fair amount.”\n\nAG and his son both have Motorola Razr folding phones: “The cameras aren't the best, but the phones work great, and they fit in my pockets easily and don't bind if, say, I'm wearing jeans and take a high step up. Also, they have a non-slip coating on the outside making it easier to hold onto, so I don't need to get a case for it.”\n\nHowever, AS’s experiences with two Samsung Galaxy Flips mean he will not get another smartphone of this type: “The first one fell with a case, and the screen started delaminating from the fold outwards. Verizon replaced it with a new one. So far so good…The phone feels very sensitive to dropping i.e. if you drop it, you will most likely do irreparable damage to the screen. At least, that has been my experience, and this is now my fear. So, I ended up with a sturdy case. This makes the phone thick and heavy.”\n\n“To do anything, you have to unfold it, so what's the point of having it folded?” AS continued. “It's almost like the worst of both worlds: folded it is unpractically thick and functionally useless...and unfolded, it's just like any other phone.”\n\nThanks for the feedback!

        "title": "3 Hot Tech Stocks Poised to Quintuple by 2027",
        "content": "Tech stocks have continued to drive the bulk of the market’s gains over the past two decades, and I think the trend will remain in place over the coming decades. We have many catalysts, like AI, quantum computing, and other breakthrough technologies, that could reshape the world. That said, betting on these up-and-coming technologies involves a lot of risk. Plus, you’ll have to hold for a very long time to see meaningful gains if you invest in many of these companies right now.\n\nOn the other hand, there are many hot tech stocks with very popular underlying businesses that could supercharge your portfolio over the next three years. It’s a very short timeframe, but I have good conviction that these companies can repeat the multi-bagger gains they’ve provided investors over the past two years.\n\nHere are three hot tech stocks to consider right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal (PYPL) PayPal logo and front of headquarters\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) enables digital and mobile payments for consumers and merchants around the world. I believe PayPal is one of the most undervalued fintech stocks right now, is poised for a major rebound. While the entire fintech sector has struggled in recent years, PayPal’s Q1 results show resilience. The company reported 10% currency-neutral revenue growth on $404 billion in total payment volume. Transaction margins grew a solid 4% despite headwinds, driving a 27% surge in the company’s earnings per share.\n\nMost encouragingly, active accounts are growing sequentially again. With its strong cash flows, PayPal repurchased a hefty $5 billion in stock last year and wants to do the same this year. As interest rates eventually ease and consumer spending rebounds, I expect PayPal’s transaction volumes to re-accelerate significantly.\n\nThe company is retooling to drive profitable growth, and management now sees full-year earnings per share rising in the mid-to-high single digit range. The core financials here suggest that PayPal should’ve rebounded long ago. PYPL financials. Hot tech stocks.\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nTrading at just 15-times forward earnings, a 50% discount to its pre-pandemic average, PYPL stock looks like a coiled spring ready to explode higher.\n\nSnap Inc. (SNAP) An apple iPhone showing the snapchat application alongside other snapchat logos. SNAP stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnap Inc. (NYSE:SNAP) operates the popular social media app Snapchat. I believe Snap is a hot tech stock poised for explosive growth in the coming years. The company reported strong Q1 results, with revenue surging 21% year-over-year to $1.19 billion, handily beating estimates by $74 million.\n\nAdditionally, Snap’s earnings per share are projected to skyrocket from 25 cents currently to $1.60 by 2027 as its advertising platform gains momentum. I see a similar rebound story playing out here as with Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Snap’s stock has multiple upside drivers ahead, with the potential U.S. TikTok ban being the most immediate catalyst that could send shares soaring. Even without that catalyst, if the company meets estimates, we could see a huge spike ahead.\n\nStory continues SNAP TTM financials\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nSnapchat’s user base continues expanding rapidly, reaching 422 million daily active accounts in Q1, up 39 million or 10% year-over-year. However, Snap’s average revenue per user (ARPU) growth has remained muted in recent quarters. I believe there is tremendous potential to ramp up ARPU going forward as Snap further monetizes its highly-engaged audience. This is definitely one of the hot tech stocks to buy right now!\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S) provides autonomous cybersecurity solutions powered by artificial intelligence. I believe this innovative cybersecurity firm is a compelling buy after its recent pullback, as demand for its threat protection services should only accelerate in an AI-driven world.\n\nIn Q1, SentinelOne delivered an industry-leading 40% revenue growth to $186 million while expanding gross margins to a record 79%. Remarkably, the company achieved positive free cash flow far ahead of schedule, with an impressive 18% free cash flow margin. After 11 straight quarters of 25+ points of operating leverage, SentinelOne has now reached breakeven on an earnings per share basis. The company’s EBIT is expected to inflect soon, too. SentinelOne EBIT\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nOh, and despite earlier losses, the company’s balance sheet is solid. SentinelOne balance sheet\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nLooking ahead, I expect profits to inflect sharply higher as top-line growth remains robust and margin expansion continues. Consensus estimates project earnings per share will surge from 3 cents this year to 23 cents next year before exceeding $4 by fiscal 2034. Thus, I believe SentinelOne is poised to be a cybersecurity powerhouse for years to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.\n\nNvidia’s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, “Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.”\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the “Magnificent Seven” companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.83% at $1,214.17 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Despite the shared spotlight with advances in artificial intelligence, metaverse stocks to buy still attract big-time investment opportunities.\n\nThe metaverse continues to be a symbol of cutting-edge technology and an ideal market for investment. While tech giants work on building this digital world, it’s a great time to bet on metaverse stocks.\n\nConsidering that the development of this idea will take at least a decade, those who enter early could see a significant bump in the expansion of this concept, as it becomes more popular.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFurthermore, forecasts suggest a stellar growth rate of more than 30 percent per year up to 2033. This puts the metaverse among the most rapidly developing industries, which is why giants like HSBC (NYSE:HSBC) have launched a special fund to invest in this future landscape.\n\nTherefore, these three metaverse stocks are an excellent investment opportunity for anyone interested in investing in the next big thing.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) consistently emerges as a top choice when exploring metaverse stocks to buy. Ranked as the seventh-largest global company, Meta actively drives technological progress. This prominent position, along with its stock price soaring 82% over the past year, emphasizes Meta’s crucial role in determining the future of the metaverse.\n\nMeta has lost more than $45 billion in Reality Labs since the end of 2020. Yet, it remains a lucrative niche for investment under the leadership of Mark Zuckerberg, although at a slower pace now.\n\nAdditionally, the company plans to shift from the Workplace app to metaverse technology to create more innovations like the Oculus AR and VR goggles and Ray-Ban Meta Smart Glasses. This dedication could potentially result in further advancements.\n\nLastly, Meta is in a robust financial position. It generated a whopping $12.53 billion in free cash flow in the first quarter, which proves that it makes good money. Revenue skyrocketed by 27% year-over-year to $36.46 billion, and net income more than doubled in the same period. Thus, Meta has the financial muscle to fund the metaverse vision.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImmersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is changing how people experience virtual reality with its haptic solutions, providing feedback that improves user metaverse experiences.\n\nSubsequently, Immersion strengthened its market position by substantial license arrangements in 2024. A February agreement with Meta Platforms allowed the use of Immersion’s patents for a broad range of products, underlining the increasing importance of haptics in VR.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, in March, the company renewed its agreement with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), thus ensuring that its technology is relevant in the gaming industry.\n\nFurthermore, Immersion returned $15.7 million to shareholders in 2023. The company’s CEO, Eric Singer, credited this accomplishment to prudent financial allocation, renewable licensing and hard work in intellectual property protection.\n\nThese strategic measures led to an excellent Q1 for Immersion. Its revenues surged to $43.8 million, a 520% upswing YOY, beating analysts’ expectations by 18.91 million. Net income rose to $18.7 million, compared to $8.3 million a year ago. Additionally, Immersion’s debt-free status and solid cash reserves position it well to seize enticing growth opportunities.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to most social media platforms, Roblox (NYSE:RBLX) is eager to keep its young audience engaged, given that it has been in the metaverse business for quite some time now. To further this ambition, Roblox is opening up video ads on virtual billboards of such brands as e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF), Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Warner Bros. (NASDAQ:WBD). These ads would monetize Roblox’s user base and significantly pump revenue streams.\n\nWhile Roblox’s stock dropped after the Q2 guidance, the company reported strong Q1 numbers. Its revenues were up 22% YOY, totaling $801.3 million, and average daily active users increased by 17%, reaching an astonishing 77.7 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Roblox has big plans for its platform and developer support. This includes the Immersion Mode, superior haptic controls, enhanced avatars and an upgraded marketplace. These improvements are intended to escalate user engagement, thus positioning Roblox to capture additional market share as the metaverse expands.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "An ex-Meta engineer has sued the company for wrongful termination and claimed he was discriminated against for his Palestinian-American heritage and Muslim faith.\n\nIn a complaint filed Tuesday in California state court in Santa Clara, Ferras Hamad states he was employed as a software engineer for Meta. His duties included assessing the quality of Instagram integrity filters related to Gaza, Israel and Ukraine, according to the complaint. He would also investigate \"severe issues,\" internally called SEVs, which ranged from Facebook or Instagram going down to users complaining that their posts were curbed or censored.\n\nHamad claims that in December 2023, he joined an SEV chat called \"Palestine SEV,\" related to Palestinian Instagram creators and activists whose posts had been suppressed by Meta content moderators. The complaint states that he noticed several irregularities in how pro-Palestinian posts were flagged for content removal and alleges Meta fired him for being Palestinian and for raising concerns over how the company handled these posts.\n\nFORMER FACEBOOK AND NIKE DEI MANAGER SENTENCED TO 5 YEARS IN PRISON FOR FRAUD SCHEME The apps Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp can be seen on the display of a smartphone in front of the logo of the Meta internet company. The internet programs belong to Meta, the umbrella brand of the Facebook Group. A former Meta engineer is suing the company for wrongful termination and alleged discrimination against him for being Palestinian and Muslim.\n\n\"Specifically, Plaintiff was scrutinized, interrogated, and terminated because he was of Palestinian national origin and/or Muslim investigating a SEV related to one of the most famous Palestinian photojournalists during the conflict in Gaza,\" the lawsuit states.\n\n\"Plaintiff did not receive similar scrutiny, interrogation, or adverse employment actions when he responded to SEVs related to Ukraine or other world events,\" it added.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nA Meta spokesperson said, \"The employee was dismissed for violating Meta’s data access policies, which we make clear to employees will result in immediate termination.\"\n\nANTI-ISRAEL RALLYING CRY BEING REVIEWED BY FACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD IS TIED TO ‘VIOLENT CAMPAIGN,’ EXPERT SAYS Ferras Hamad was a software engineer tasked with reviewing issues related to how Instagram limited the reach of certain Palestinian content creators, according to a complaint.\n\nHamad investigated why Meta had limited the reach of a post from Palestinian photojournalist Motaz Azaiza and found content from this user had been incorrectly labeled \"pornographic,\" according to the complaint. After he documented his findings, the complaint states he began receiving messages from Meta supervisors who were not on his team who alleged he violated company policy.\n\nThe complaint alleges Hamad later received confirmation from a member of Meta's security team that he did not violate any company policy through his actions and that he handled the SEV issue properly.\n\nFACEBOOK OVERSIGHT BOARD TO CONSIDER WHETHER ANTI-ISRAEL RALLYING CRY IS ‘HATE SPEECH’\n\nStory continues Hamad alleges he was fired by Meta after he raised concerns over how pro-Palestinian posts on Instagram were censored.\n\nThen, on Dec. 25, Azaiza publicly posted a screenshot depicting how Instagram had incorrectly labeled his Gaza coverage as \"pornographic,\" the complaint states.\n\nMeta allegedly fired Hamad on Feb. 2 for \"a violation of its User Data Policy, according to the complaint. The company allegedly said that Hamad may have personally known Azaiza, a content creator with more than 17 million followers.\n\n\"Plaintiff was terminated despite confirmation from Plaintiff’s manager that he had acted correctly and from META’s own security operations personnel unequivocally stating the Plaintiff did not violate META’s User Data Access Policy,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nThe complaint asserts it is \"highly improbable\" that Hamad knows the photojournalist, noting that Hamad was born and raised in the U.S. and has never traveled to Gaza.\n\n\"In reality, Plaintiff is simply the latest victim of META’s callus [sic], chronic, and consistent anti-Palestinian bias,\" the complaint claims.\n\nOriginal article source:Ex-Meta employee sues for wrongful termination over handling of pro-Palestinian content\n\nView comments",

        "title": "1 Unstoppable Stock Set to Join Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, and Alphabet In the $2 Trillion Club Within 3 Years",
        "content": "The U.S. economy has a storied history of producing the world's most valuable companies. In 1901, United States Steel became the first company to reach a $1 billion valuation, and 117 years later, in 2018, Apple became the first to cross the $1 trillion threshold.\n\nThe iPhone maker also became the first company to surpass $2 trillion in market capitalization. It has since been joined by Nvidia, Microsoft, and Alphabet in that ultra-exclusive club.\n\nI think one more company could soon earn membership. Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) continues to deliver strong earnings growth, and it has an incredible opportunity in the artificial intelligence (AI) industry. Its stock is currently trading near an all-time high, valuing the company at $1.2 trillion.\n\nHere's how it could reach the $2 trillion milestone within three years, and if it does, investors who buy Meta stock today could capture a gain of 67%.\n\nAI is transforming the social media industry\n\nMeta is the parent company of social media platforms Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, which attract more than 3.2 billion users every day. Facebook and Instagram surged to prominence as social networks where users primarily interacted with their friends and family, but they have been transformed into something else entirely over the last few years.\n\nFor example, half of the content appearing in users' Instagram feeds isn't posted by anybody they know. Instead, Meta developed AI algorithms to learn what users like to see the most, in order to show them more of it to keep them engaged -- even if that content comes from a creator, brand, or another user they have never interacted with before.\n\nIn essence, Facebook and Instagram shifted from social networks to social entertainment platforms, especially through the Reels short-form video feature. It appears to be working well, because CEO Mark Zuckerberg told investors AI-curated content feeds were responsible for increased engagement on both Facebook and Instagram last year. The more time users spend on those platforms, the more revenue the company can generate from advertising.\n\nMeta's foray into AI is just heating up\n\nMeta's AI strategy extends beyond its content feeds. The company developed the world's most popular open-source large language models (LLMs) called Llama, which continue to improve with each iteration. Llama 3 was just released, and the next generation is now in training.\n\nMeta's progress will soon accelerate after the recent purchase of 350,000 H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) from Nvidia. These are among the most powerful chips for training AI models, and this deal cost Meta an estimated $9 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nLlama 3 is already powering Meta AI, which is a new chatbot users can access through Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. It can instantly generate text and images on command, answer complex questions, and even join group chats to offer suggestions on a range of topics.\n\nSoon, every brand will have its own AI representative on Meta's platforms, which will be available around the clock to handle incoming queries. It could save human social media managers an incredible amount of time, while potentially creating a new source of revenue once the company determines the best way to monetize the service. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nRevenue and earnings growth are accelerating\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 (ended March 31), Meta experienced a 20% year-over-year increase in ad impressions, helped by a steady increase in users and engagement. It drove Meta's revenue to $36.4 billion during the quarter, representing an increase of 27%, which was the fastest pace of growth in more than two years.\n\nMeta's bottom line also benefited from cost cuts throughout 2023, which included 21,000 layoffs and a commitment by Zuckerberg to spend more cautiously on initiatives like the metaverse. As a result, Meta's first-quarter net income soared 117% to $12.4 billion.\n\nMeta's (mathematical) path to the $2 trillion club in three years\n\nMeta intends to invest heavily in AI. Chief Financial Officer Susan Li recently told investors the company plans $35 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures (capex) in 2024, which was a noteworthy increase from her prior forecast of $30 billion to $37 billion. Considering how much Meta just spent on GPUs, the revision isn't surprising.\n\nIf AI-curated content feeds continue to get better at boosting engagement on Facebook and Instagram, the company will easily recoup its additional capex in advertising revenue alone. Plus, Meta has a stellar track record of monetizing new features, so Meta AI could become a substantial contributor.\n\nMeta stock is already cheap as things stand today. Wall Street estimates the company will generate $20.18 in earnings per share during 2024, which places Meta stock at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.4. In other words, the stock will have to rise 34% by the end of this year just to trade in line with the Nasdaq-100 technology index, which has a P/E of 31.4 as of this writing.\n\nSo if the Street's forecast holds up, the Nasdaq-100 maintains its current P/E, and Meta stock rises 34%, that alone will take the company's market cap to $1.6 trillion. Then, if the company delivers $23.08 in earnings in 2025, as Wall Street expects, that could warrant a further 14.4% increase in its stock price, taking its market cap to $1.84 trillion.\n\nFrom there, Meta will only require earnings growth of 8.7% in 2026 to enter the $2 trillion club -- again, assuming it trades in line with the current P/E of the Nasdaq-100 index.\n\nBut even if this doesn't happen within a three-year time frame, I think AI gives Meta a clear path to a $2 trillion valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia overtakes Apple as its market capitalisation surpasses $3tn (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nUS chip designer Nvidia became the third US company to reach a market valuation of more than $3tn (£2.4tn) on Wednesday, overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world’s second most valuable company.\n\nNvidia’s shares jumped 5.2%, propelling its market capitalisation to more than $3tn to become the world’s second-largest company behind Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNvidia’s chips are powering much of the rush into AI, which has seen it become a poster child of the AI boom, with demand for its processors from the likes of Google (GOOG), Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta (META) outstripping supply.\n\nNvidia’s shares – up nearly 150% so far this year – are also being boosted by an upcoming move to split its stock by 10-to-one on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets creep higher as ECB expected to cut interest rates\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said the stock split will “bring its share price down and make it more affordable to investors who cannot afford to splash out more than a grand per share, as well as benefit employees who use some of their monthly pay packets to invest in the company.”\n\nLululemon (LULU)\n\nLululemon beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates but issued weak second-quarter guidance as it contends with a slowdown in the Americas, its largest market.\n\nThe yoga pants maker also raised its share buyback authorisation by $1bn, the second time in six months that the company has increased its returns to shareholders. Shares of Lululemon jumped 10% in pre-market trading.\n\nThe company’s revenue grew by 10% year over year to $2.2bn in the quarter ended April 28, in line with projections. Top-line growth was driven by a 35% revenue increase from international markets — including a nearly 50% increase in China — while in the Americas sales rose by a mere 3%.\n\nCEO Calvin McDonald touted the “strong momentum” the company is seeing in its international markets and hinted that it needs to do more work in the Americas.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We are pleased by the progress we are making to optimise our US product assortment,” said McDonald. “Looking ahead, we continue to have a significant runway for growth and are confident in our team’s ability to powerfully deliver.”\n\nFever-Tree (FEVR.L)\n\nPremium drink mixer brand Fever-Tree has reported growth across its markets in 2024 as it looks to capitalise on the key summer selling season when more customers spend on cocktails like mojitos and margaritas.\n\nWhile no numbers or guidance was given in a relatively short trading update to accompany the company's annual general meeting, management said it remained \"comfortable\" with full-year expectations.\n\nThe tonic maker said it has “strengthened its category-leading position” in the UK, while it “continues to be the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category” in the US.\n\nIt said the brand has continued to “deliver topline growth in the year to date.”\n\nRead more: Darktrace and Vistry promoted to FTSE 100 as Ocado and St James Place crash out\n\nLast year, the company saw profits fall 23%, despite sales growing 6%, but said it was \"on track to double EBITDA\" in 2024.\n\nGold (GC=F)\n\nThe rally in the metal market continues with gold touching $2,381 amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the US economy continues to expand in its service sector, boosting the golden metal.\n\nHowever, investors were caught by surprise over the announcement that a review has been launched by the trade body, which sets the global benchmark for gold prices, after doubts were raised about the purity of some precious metals from a supplier.\n\nThe London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) said it is reviewing allegations involving Indonesian state miner Aneka Tambang (Antam) over the purity of its gold products.\n\nAneka Tambang last week denied reports that there were 109 tons of counterfeit ANTAM gold circulating in the community in the period 2010-2021.\n\nIndonesia’s Attorney General Office has named six former general managers at Antam’s Precious Metal Processing and Refining Business Unit as suspects for alleged misuse of Antam’s stamping service.\n\nThe country is a major player in the global mining industry but has faced criticism as more than half of all tropical deforestation directly attributable to industrial mining takes place in Indonesia, according to new research conducted at Clark University.\n\nLBMA, an industry body whose rules for gold refineries require that they source gold responsibly, said that an Incident Review Process (IRP) has been invoked to review the current circumstances.\n\nWatch: Nvidia passes Apple as second-most valuable firm</p><p>Shares in the chipmaker jumped over 5% Wednesday, taking its market value to a little over $3 trillion. </p><p>That put it just ahead of the iPhone maker.</p><p>Nvidia stock has been soaring on bets it’s going to be the big winner from the AI boom. </p><p>The firm’s chips power products like ChatGPT, and are in hot demand around the world. </p><p>It has raised sales forecasts over and over again.</p><p>That has seen the stock gain 147% so far this year. </p><p>Now some analysts say it looks likely Nvidia could overtake Microsoft as well, to become the world’s most valuable company. </p><p>One said the big difference is that the chip firm is already making big money from AI, while rivals are having to spend huge amounts on the technology. </p><p>As for Apple, it’s been struggling with weak demand for its phones, and mounting competition in China. </p><p>Investors have also criticized it for lagging rivals in offering AI services. </p><p>Its stock has barely risen this year. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zVZHxvVxbxrzq5_azhD0WA--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/cef9687c21616206781155e31d2edb79\",\"duration\":\"PT1M13S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-passes-apple-second-most-050332350.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Stocks Billionaires Are Buying Hand Over Fist, and 1 They've Sent to the Chopping Block",
        "content": "A little over three weeks ago, arguably the most important data release of the entire quarter occurred on Wall Street -- and I'm not talking about the April inflation report or anything to do with earnings season.\n\nWednesday, May 15, marked the filing deadline for institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management to file Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides investors with an under-the-hood look at what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful money managers bought, sold, and held in the latest quarter.\n\nEven though 13Fs are filed up to 45 days following the end to a quarter (and can therefore contain stale information), they're nevertheless helpful in identifying what stocks, industries, and innovative trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's greatest investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe latest round of 13Fs, which detail trading activity from the March-ended quarter, show that billionaire money managers were active buyers and sellers of some of Wall Street's fastest-growing companies.\n\nWhat follows are two hypergrowth stocks billionaires have been buying hand over first, as well as a widely held outperformer they've sent to the chopping block.\n\nHypergrowth stock No. 1 billionaire investors can't stop buying: Palantir Technologies\n\nThe first high-octane growth stock that Wall Street billionaires can't seem to get enough of is data-mining company Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR). Palantir, which is forecast by Wall Street to grow its earnings per share (EPS) by an annual average of 85.2% over the next five years, had five billionaire investors purchasing its stock hand over fist in the first quarter, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nJohn Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (3,216,525 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,368,832 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (769,965 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (481,634 shares)\n\nThe likely reason billionaires have been piling into Palantir stock has to do with its irreplaceability. The company's Gotham platform is driven by artificial intelligence (AI) and helps governments collect data and oversee mission planning. Meanwhile, its up-and-coming Foundry platform helps businesses streamline their operations by making sense of large amounts of data. The services that Palantir provides simply aren't available by any other company at scale.\n\nGotham has done a lot of the heavy lifting for Palantir. Since most government contracts are locked in for multiple years, Palantir has been able to count on predictable cash flow and steady double-digit growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Foundry is a considerably more compelling long-term growth story. Whereas Gotham's reach is limited (e.g., Palantir's management team won't allow certain governments to access its AI platform), there is no ceiling for Foundry. In just three years, its U.S. commercial customer count has grown 12-fold. Meanwhile, its global commercial customer count has risen 53% year-over-year, as of the March-ended quarter. To use a baseball analogy, Foundry isn't even out of the first inning yet.\n\nBillionaires are probably also impressed with Palantir's cash-rich balance sheet. It closed out March with nearly $3.87 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, with no debt, and has generated $654 million in operating cash flow over the trailing-12-month period. Palantir has plenty of financial flexibility, regardless of what's happening with the U.S. or global economy.\n\nHypergrowth stock No. 2 billionaire money managers can't stop buying: Broadcom\n\nThe second supercharged growth stock billionaire asset managers couldn't get enough of during the first quarter is semiconductor kingpin Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO). With 41% sales growth expected in the current fiscal year, six billionaire investors piled in, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nSteven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (470,365 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (416,460 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (275,053 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (251,571 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (38,940 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (10,556 shares)\n\nThe fuel lighting a fire under Broadcom's stock is the artificial intelligence revolution. While it might not be as direct of a beneficiary as graphics processing unit (GPU) developer Nvidia, Broadcom has found its niche in AI-accelerated data centers.\n\nLast year, Broadcom unveiled its Jericho3-AI chip, which can connect up to 32,000 high-compute GPUs. Processing expediency is paramount to training large language models, overseeing generative AI solutions, and making the split-second decisions required of AI-powered software and systems. Jericho3 handles this while minimizing tail latency.\n\nBroadcom is also a dominant player in the smartphone arena. It provides wireless chips and accessories used in next-generation smartphones. Wireless companies upgrading their networks to handle 5G speeds have encouraged a consistent device upgrade cycle that's powering Broadcom's cash flow higher.\n\nThese half-dozen billionaire money managers might also be anticipating a possible stock split in Broadcom's future. Shares of the company did close at nearly $1,331 on June 4, which can be a lot of money for retail investors who don't have access to fractional-share purchases with their online broker. Stock-split stocks have outperformed in recent years, with investors gravitating to these typically high-flying businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe hypergrowth stock billionaires gave the heave-ho: Meta Platforms\n\nHowever, not all hypergrowth stocks were necessarily on the buy radar for billionaires during the March-ended quarter. Following an astronomical move higher from its 2022 bear market low, social media colossus Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META), which is expected to grow its EPS by annual average of 30% over the next five years, found itself on the chopping block. Nine billionaires dumped shares of Meta in the first quarter, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nOle Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (2,259,650 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (1,313,528 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (1,164,151 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (779,637 shares) Stephen Mandel of Lone Pine Capital (735,911 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (727,500 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (175,614 shares) Terry Smith of Fundsmith (29,157 shares)\n\nOne of the more logical reasons to sell shares of Meta, which I alluded to above, is to lock in some profits. Shares of Meta have more than quintupled from their 2022 bear market low.\n\nThe unpredictability of Meta's capital expenditures (capex) is another potential catalyst for the selling we've witnessed from billionaires. Though Meta pared back its spending in 2023, which helped boost its operating cash flow and EPS, the company recently announced plans to increase spending on AI initiatives. Higher capex would be expected to adversely impact profits in the near term.\n\nIt's also possible billionaires are concerned about near-term growth prospects for the U.S. economy. Even though economic data has been strong, factors like the first meaningful decline in U.S. M2 money supply since the Great Depression loom large. Since Meta generates close to 98% of its sales from advertising, and advertisers are often quick to reduce their spending at the first hint of trouble, it could endure short-term pain if the U.S. economy does an about-face.\n\nWhile there are genuine reasons to be somewhat skeptical of Meta's operating performance over the next couple of quarters, its competitive advantages continue to suggest it'll head higher over the long run.\n\nMeta is sitting on a boatload of cash that allows the company to aggressively invest in high-growth initiatives, such as augmented/virtual reality devices, the metaverse, and AI. Even though these investments are unlikely to bear significant fruit anytime soon, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has a rich history of monetizing new platforms when they're good and ready. In other words, I expect these nine billionaires to eventually regret their decision to sell.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Meta Platforms was hit with 11 complaints on Thursday over proposed changes that would see it use personal data to train its artificial intelligence models without asking for consent, which may breach European Union privacy rules.\n\nAdvocacy group NOYB (none of your business) urged national privacy watchdogs to act immediately to halt such use, saying recent changes in Meta's privacy policy, which come into force on June 26, would allow it to use years of personal posts, private images or online tracking data for its AI technology.\n\nNOYB has already filed several complaints against Meta and other Big Tech companies over alleged breaches of the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) which threatens fines up to 4% of a company's total global turnover for violations.\n\nMeta has cited a legitimate interest for using users' data to train and develop its generative AI models and other AI tools, which can be shared with third parties.\n\nNOYB founder Max Schrems said in a statement that Europe's top court had already ruled on the issue in 2021.\n\n\"The European Court of Justice (CJEU) has already made it clear that Meta has no 'legitimate interest' to override users' right to data protection when it comes to advertising,\" he said.\n\n\"Yet the company is trying to use the same arguments for the training of undefined 'AI technology'. It seems that Meta is once again blatantly ignoring the judgements of the CJEU,\" Schrems said, adding that opting out was extremely complicated.\n\n\"Shifting the responsibility to the user is completely absurd. The law requires Meta to get opt-in consent, not to provide a hidden and misleading opt-out form,\" Schrems said, adding: \"If Meta wants to use your data, they have to ask for your permission. Instead, they made users beg to be excluded\".\n\nNOYB asked data protection authorities in Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland and Spain to launch an urgency procedure because of the imminent changes.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Alexander Smith)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Dell Stock (NYSE:DELL): Still Too Expensive Despite Recent Plunge",
        "content": "Hardware, storage, and peripherals manufacturer Dell (NYSE:DELL) has become one of the most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the market today. After the company reported its most recent earnings results at the end of May, the stock price crashed nearly 20% because of all the built-up hype and enthusiasm accumulated in Dell’s stock price. Even with the recent sell-off, I still tend to see Dell as a company trading at too expensive a valuation not to have its business entirely AI-driven, so I have a neutral stance on the company.\n\nIn this article, I’ll dive deeper into its latest quarterly results to see what’s happening at Dell.\n\nDell’s Fiscal Q1 2025 in Review\n\nThe Round Rock-based company delivered nearly everything investors wanted to hear in its most recent quarter. Sales increased annually by 6.2% to $22.2 billion for the period ending May 3, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $21.6 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was $1.27 per share, in line with the consensus.\n\nBefore delving into the details, it’s important to note that Dell operates in two distinct business segments: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which deals with servers, networking, and storage, and the personal computing Client Solutions Group (CSG). While the latter has faced challenges in recent years, the server business is thriving, primarily due to the significant investment in AI spending in this sector.\n\nThis was precisely the panorama reported in recent earnings for Fiscal Q1 2025. Dell reported Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) revenue of $9.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year, with record servers and networking revenue of $5.5 billion, up 42%, while Client Solutions Group (CSG) revenue was $12.0 billion, flat year-over-year, with commercial client revenue at $10.2 billion, up just 3%.\n\nOne of the main areas of market interest is AI, where Dell has significant growth potential. The company reported that its AI server backlog was $3.8 billion, increasing sequentially by approximately $900 million. In other words, demand for orders has been outpacing Dell’s ability to deliver, primarily due to the growth in the AI sector.\n\nHowever, the impacts of AI aren’t solely restricted to ISG. Another important point highlighted by Dell is the optimism surrounding CSG. Commercial PC demand is anticipated to experience a significant improvement as the year progresses into a new refresh cycle, driven not only by an upcoming Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows refresh cycle but also by an anticipated increase in PC demand as the industry makes major advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell’s Next Steps Toward AI\n\nDell’s management also emphasized the company’s plans to capitalize on AI in the short term. The company launched the Dell AI Factory, which should help accelerate its adoption of AI by combining workload-optimized solutions with an open ecosystem for partners such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn addition, Dell has enhanced its direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology with a GPU server that boosts power efficiency by 2.5 times. This innovation is crucial for hyperscaler companies, including leading Big Tech firms in the cloud industry like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which seek power-efficient solutions for their extensive server requirements and costly GPUs.\n\nBy offering more power-efficient solutions, it will be possible to lower costs and enhance industry performance. At the current level, Dell stands out as one of the main alternatives to provide this support and improve the efficiency and profitability of companies’ AI capabilities.\n\nThe Turning Point in Dell’s Quarter\n\nIn general, Dell’s reported results were fairly consistent, with several positive points to praise. But even when everything seemed to be going well in Round Rock, Texas, there was still a significant problem that the company was going to communicate to its shareholders: Dell’s guidance regarding its gross margin, which will be partly dragged lower by AI-optimized servers.\n\n“Given inflationary input costs, the competitive environment, and a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, we expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points,” Dell’s CFO said during the earnings call.\n\nAlthough Dell’s management team emphasized its commitment to a disciplined cost structure, expecting operating expenses to fall by low-single digits, around 3% annually by 2024, this was not enough to reassure investors. As a result, that was the inflection point for a major sell-off in Dell’s stock following the earnings call.\n\nOf course, the reasons for Wall Street’s disillusionment with Dell’s results didn’t stop there.\n\nThe adverse reaction emphasizes that Dell has been priced with very high expectations regarding its AI potential. Shares had appreciated by around 280% in the last 12 months until the earnings day. This took the company from a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 16x in May 2023 to a multiple that reached beyond 36x in late May 2024. It’s at ~28x today, reflecting its revaluation based on its AI capabilities.\n\nI still believe that Dell is an expensive company relative to its growth since it’s not an AI-only business. Dell’s AI segment accounts for less than 40% of its overall revenue. Given this fact and the little-to-no growth prospects for the rest of the business in the long term, I don’t think Dell deserves the premium valuation of about double that of its peers.\n\nIs DELL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe analyst consensus toward DELL is bullish, giving the stock a Strong Buy rating. The average Dell stock price target, based on projections from 12 Wall Street analysts over the last three months, stands at $157.15 for the next 12 months. This implies 14.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDell reported another consistent and promising quarter. However, it was overshadowed by its gross margin guidance, which fell below market expectations.\n\nWe’re still in the early days of the AI-server boom, and Dell is doing well to establish its presence in this market. However, the company’s shift from a hardware focus to an AI-centric business has led to a high valuation multiple, creating challenges in accurately assessing how much AI will contribute to Dell’s market value.\n\nConsidering that Dell seems overpriced for a hardware company—and hardware is still its main source of revenue—the current valuation carries a high risk of slippage from expectations of increased profitability growth in AI. That said, I prefer to adopt a cautious stance, remaining neutral on Dell stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares of Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) popped on Wednesday, gaining as much as 3.1%. As of 11:34 a.m. ET, the stock was still up 2.4%.\n\nThe catalyst that sent the social media and artificial intelligence (AI) specialist higher was a vote of confidence from a Wall Street analyst.\n\nGrowing AI opportunity\n\nRaymond James analyst Josh Beck maintained his strong buy rating on the stock while increasing his price target to $550, up from its previous level of $525. That suggests potential upside of roughly 15% compared to the stock's closing price on Tuesday.\n\nThe analyst is particularly bullish on Meta's moves in generative AI, calling the company a \"top pick\" thanks to the list of AI \"building blocks\" it's assembling. This includes its growing roster of employees with AI credentials and Meta's robust computing infrastructure. These underpin the impressive performance of LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI) 3, the large language model that powers Meta AI, \"one of the world's leading AI assistants,\" according to the company. The analyst is also impressed by Meta's ability to build multiple new AI models \"simultaneously\" without any risk to its core social media business.\n\nThe analyst is clearly on to something. In April, Meta unveiled two distinct versions of LLaMA 3 -- the 8 billion parameter model and the 70 billion parameter model. Parameters indicate the size of each model and the number of variables used to create it.\n\nMeta's social media platforms represent a treasure trove of information upon which to build its AI models, while also providing data for the targeted advertising that makes up the bulk of its revenue. The advent of generative AI represents a compelling opportunity for Meta to expand its revenue base, as the company charges the major cloud infrastructure services to make the LLaMA models available to their customers.\n\nJust the beginning\n\nMeta is still exploring other ways to leverage its AI expertise and profit from the AI revolution. At the same time, the company is poised to benefit from the ongoing recovery in the digital advertising market.\n\nFinally, at just 27 times earnings, Meta is a bargain, particularly when viewed in the context of its vast opportunity.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Withheld Key Details In Instagram And WhatsApp Acquisitions, FTC Claims\n\nMeta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META) is under fire for allegedly withholding information from federal regulators during the reviews of its acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, according to a recent court filing by the U.S. Federal Trade Commission (FTC).\n\nThe FTC is pushing to dismantle the social media conglomerate through an ongoing lawsuit, Bloomberg reported.\n\nMeta, previously known as Facebook, led by Mark Zuckerberg, acquired Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014. The FTC examined both deals at the time, Instagram through a thorough review and WhatsApp via a brief 30-day check.\n\nHowever, the agency has since been criticized for approving these transactions, leading to a 2020 lawsuit alleging that Meta monopolized the social networking market by buying emerging competitors.\n\nIn its latest filing, the FTC claims that Meta withheld crucial information during the original acquisition reviews. \"The FTC now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014,\" the filing states.\n\nThe FTC argues that the limited review requested by Meta at the time was insufficient.\n\nAlso Read: Meta Faces EU Investigation Over Child Safety Concerns: Report\n\nMeta, seeking to have the case dismissed before it goes to trial, contends that its substantial investments in Instagram and WhatsApp have greatly benefited consumers.\n\n\"The evidence instead shows that Meta faces fierce competition and that Meta's significant investment of time and resources in Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited consumers by making the apps into the services millions of users enjoy today for free,\" said Meta spokesperson Chris Sgro.\n\nInstagram has been pivotal to Meta's success, generating $16.5 billion in revenue in the first half of 2022, almost 30% of the company's total revenue.\n\nDespite this, the FTC alleges Meta has increased the ad load on Instagram and Facebook and neglected to innovate and improve Instagram's features.\n\nThis isn't the first time Meta has been accused of withholding information. In 2017, European antitrust regulators fined the company $122.1 million (110 million euros) for providing misleading details about the WhatsApp acquisition.\n\nMeta stock has gained more than 99% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via Vanguard Communication Services ETF (NYSE:VOX) and Communication Services Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLC).\n\nPrice Action: META shares are trading higher by 2.22% at $487.71 at the last check on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Meta Pulls Plug On Enterprise Communication Tool Workspace After 10 Years\n\nhoto by Frederic Legrand – COMEO on Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article Mark Zuckerberg's Meta Withheld Key Details In Instagram And WhatsApp Acquisitions, FTC Claims originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "FTC claims Facebook withheld information when buying Instagram and WhatsApp",
        "content": "Meta is having another one of those days where it finds itself in the headlines for all the wrong reasons.\n\nFirst up is the Federal Trade Commission’s allegation that Facebook, as the company was called at the time, withheld information from the agency when the FTC was reviewing its acquisitions of Instagram in 2012 and WhatsApp in 2014.\n\nAlthough it cleared the mergers, the FTC sued Meta in 2020 in an attempt to have them unwound. Meta is trying to have the suit thrown out, arguing that it’s invested billions in Instagram and WhatsApp and the antitrust agency hasn’t demonstrated how consumers are worse off. The FTC now claims that it had only undertaken a “limited review” of the deals when they happened “at Meta’s request,” and it “now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014.”\n\nIt's not clear from the FTC's filing what information Facebook allegedly withheld, though a spokesperson said that \"some items noted in this filing are still under seal.\"\n\nThese days, many regulators view their clearance of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions with embarrassment, as they allowed Facebook to snuff out potential competition in the social networking market, leading to a situation today where it’s tricky for many people to avoid using a Meta property. If you want to know why Big Tech mergers are these days more likely than not to be blocked in the U.S. and EU, here’s the textbook reason.\n\nThat said, unwinding these mergers would be seismic stuff. It wouldn’t be entirely unprecedented, as U.K. competition regulators forced Meta to unwind its 2020 purchase of Giphy a couple years ago, but the GIF repository is small-fry compared to Insta and WhatsApp, and a lot more time has passed since those deals went through. Indeed, even when the EU’s antitrust authorities fined Facebook $122 million in 2017 for giving them misleading information during the WhatsApp merger, that didn’t affect their approval of the deal as such.\n\nSo I’d be surprised if the FTC’s latest tactic manages to undo what was done a decade or more ago, no matter how naïve that approval may seem today. But it might at least stop the courts from throwing out the FTC’s suit before trial, which is what Meta is hoping will happen.\n\nMeanwhile, back in Europe, the Italian antitrust authority today fined Meta €35 million ($38 million) for “unfair commercial practices.” Chump change, yes, but also yet another sign of how the antitrust and privacy regulation worlds are blurring into one another these days. Meta’s sin here was not properly informing people signing up for Instagram via the web that their personal data would be used for commercial purposes. Meta says it disagrees with the fine and is assessing its options.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, stepping away from the world of antitrust, a former Meta engineer named Ferras Hamad has sued the company for discrimination and wrongful termination, relating to his February dismissal. According to Reuters, the Palestinian-American engineer says he was fired after “trying to help fix bugs” that suppressed Palestinian Instagram posts. Hamad also claims that employees using internal communications systems to mention the deaths of their relatives in Gaza found their messages deleted, and also that Meta investigated workers for using the Palestinian flag emoji, but not the emojis for the Israeli or Ukrainian flags.\n\nThis is by no means the first time that Meta faces allegations of censoring staffers when they try to speak out in support of Palestinians, in the context of the Israel-Gaza war. Last month, around 200 Meta employees wrote to CEO Mark Zuckerberg last month to decry the alleged practice, and human rights groups held coordinated online protests to back them up. Meta has not yet commented on Hamad’s suit.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Meta Platforms Inc. withheld information from federal regulators during their original reviews of the Instagram and WhatsApp acquisitions, the US Federal Trade Commission said in a court filing as part of a lawsuit seeking to break up the social networking giant.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority SEC Hedge Fund Fee Disclosure Rule Struck Down by US Court ‘Mag Seven’ Drive US Stocks Toward All-Time Highs: Markets Wrap Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India?\n\nThe company formerly known as Facebook bought photo-sharing app Instagram in 2012 and the messaging app WhatsApp in 2014. Both transactions were scrutinized by the FTC at the time before they closed – Instagram as part of an in-depth review and WhatsApp with a simple 30-day one.\n\nIn the years since, the agency has faced significant criticism for allowing the deals to move forward. In 2020, the antitrust agency sued Meta alleging that it monopolized the personal social networking market by buying up emerging rivals. Meta is seeking to have the case thrown out before a trial, arguing that it has invested billions in the apps and that the FTC shouldn’t be able to renege on its prior approval of the mergers.\n\nIn its filing Tuesday, however, the FTC said the case involves “information Meta had in its files and did not provide” during the original reviews.\n\n“At Meta’s request the FTC undertook only a limited review” of the deals, the agency said. “The FTC now has available vastly more evidence, including pre-acquisition documents Meta did not provide in 2012 and 2014.”\n\nMeta said that it met all of its legal obligations during the Instagram and WhatsApp merger reviews. The FTC has failed to provide evidence to support its claims, a spokesperson said.\n\n“The evidence instead shows that Meta faces fierce competition and that Meta’s significant investment of time and resources in Instagram and WhatsApp has benefited consumers by making the apps into the services millions of users enjoy today for free,” spokesperson Chris Sgro said in a statement. “The FTC has done nothing to build its case over the past four years, while Meta has invested billions to build quality products.”\n\nInstagram’s popularity has been key to Meta’s continued success. Instagram produced $16.5 billion in the first six months of 2022, bringing in almost 30% of the company’s overall revenue, according to court filings in the case. Meta doesn’t break out Instagram revenue during its quarterly earnings reports.\n\nStory continues\n\nTuesday’s court filing isn’t the first allegation that Meta failed to turn over information that might have impacted the initial merger reviews. In 2017, European antitrust regulators fined Meta 110 million euros ($122.1 million) for providing misleading information about the WhatsApp deal.\n\nMeta has also degraded its platform for users most reliant on their apps, significantly increasing the ad load on first Instagram and then its flagship product Facebook, the agency said in the filing. It also “chronically deprived Instagram of resources to innovate and improve features,” the FTC said.\n\nUS District Judge James Boasberg in Washington, who is overseeing the lawsuit, hasn’t indicated when he may rule on Meta’s request nor has he set a trial date for the case.\n\nThe case is US Federal Trade Commission v. Facebook Inc., 20-3590, US District Court for the District of Columbia.\n\n(Updates with additional Meta comment.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying These 3 Stocks Instead",
        "content": "Over the past two years, you couldn’t go wrong investing in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The stock that is today synonymous with the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution returned nearly 800% for shareholders since OpenAI‘s generative AI chatbot ChatGPT was introduced. Just $1,000 invested in the chipmaker at the time would now be worth $7,866.\n\nBut is Nvidia’s run over? Or more precisely, are there better investment opportunities out there? Some on Wall Street seem to think so. While many hedge fund operators continue to buy the AI chipmaker’s stock, others are cutting their stake. Some even sold off their entire position. The smart money is not holding cash but rather is putting the money to work elsewhere.\n\nBy following these billionaire stock picks, you might be able to stay ahead of where the smart money thinks the better opportunities lie. Here are three stocks hedge funds bought after selling down their Nvidia stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPayPal Holdings (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is a growing list of companies adding advertising platforms to generate additional revenue streams. Many of them are simply “me too” efforts to capture the buzz while others are a more natural integration of the business. PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) falls into the latter category.\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the payments leader will be starting an ad network by mining the data collected from its extensive platform. It could be a massive opportunity because it is able to show advertisers exactly what people are buying. Other platforms like Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) are good because they show marketers what consumers are thinking of purchasing. Others, like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), are only able to offer a scattershot approach to reaching potential customers. Few other than PayPal can offer agencies such granular detail on where shoppers are actually spending their money.\n\nThere are a lot of reasons PayPal stock is a buy at these prices, but the potential ad revenue it can generate seems like a major boost to its top and bottom line.\n\nA number of hedge fund operators like what they see. Paul Tudor Jones of Tudor Investment sold 78% of his Nvidia position and bought 888,000 shares of PayPal at an average buy-in price of $64, for about $57 million. Jim Simon’s Renaissance Technologies sold two-thirds of his stake in the chipmaker and bought over 2.1 million PayPal shares, also around $64. With PayPal stock going for $63 per share at the time of this writing, you can get an even better price than these billionaire investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nSwitching AI chipmakers is what Steven Cohen did at Point72 Asset Manager. He sold off more than half of his Nvidia holdings in favor of starting a massive stake in mobile chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). He bought over 470,000 shares at an average price of $1,221 per share, meaning he went from having nothing in Broadcom to a position worth over $632 million. The semiconductor stock is now Cohen’s second-largest position.\n\nAnd why not? Best known for its mobile handset chips, Broadcom recently shifted its focus to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and found them in high demand among hyper scalers and others.\n\nEarlier this year the chipmaker said it was “evolving a broad portfolio of technologies to extend its leadership in enabling next-generation AI infrastructure.” In particular, it focused on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards to drive the widest adoption of advanced generative AI clusters.\n\nAmong the innovations it was bringing to market include Ethernet switches with unprecedented bandwidth density and efficiency, laser technologies for optical interconnect solutions for AI and machine learning, and low-power, high-efficiency retimers that resend a fresh copy of a signal rather than merely boosting an existing one.\n\nWith Broadcom’s stock up to $1,330, it is more than what Cohen paid but still a bargain for this fast-growing chipmaker.\n\nZoomInfo Technologies (ZI) Illustrative Editorial of ZOOMINFO.COM website homepage. ZOOMINFO logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nFamed investment manager Stanley Druckenmiller sold off nearly three-quarters of his Nvidia stake to buy ZoomInfo Technologies (NASDAQ:ZI) instead. His Duquesne Family Office hedge fund bought 5 million shares of the customer acquisition and management software specialist at an average price of $17 a share. He now owns 5.9 million shares worth $94 million.\n\nHowever, the stock tumbled hard last month after ZoomInfo reported first-quarter results that beat analyst expectations on the top and bottom line. Its guidance, though, wasn’t as strong as the market wanted despite being within Wall Street’s estimates.\n\nWe’re seeing a lot of that with tech stocks lately. Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) had a similar market response after beating analyst estimates because its outlook also wasn’t a blow-the-doors-off number.\n\nZoomInfo saw net revenue retention (NRR) or the amount of money existing customers spend with the company, fall to 85% in the quarter. That is because in the current high-interest rate environment, many businesses, especially among the small- and medium-sized companies it specializes in, reined in spending. At the mid-market level, though, ZoomInfo was seeing NRR improvement.\n\nWith the stock now trading at just below $12, the business data specialist offers a 30% discount to Druckenmiller’s buy price. ZoomInfo Technologies says enterprise retention is stabilizing with renewal rates improving year over year for the first time since 2022. It suggests business will resume its upward trajectory shortly.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Meta Platforms Insiders Sold US$15m Of Shares Suggesting Hesitancy",
        "content": "Over the past year, many Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) insiders sold a significant stake in the company which may have piqued investors' interest. Knowing whether insiders are buying is usually more helpful when evaluating insider transactions, as insider selling can have various explanations. However, if numerous insiders are selling, shareholders should investigate more.\n\nWhile insider transactions are not the most important thing when it comes to long-term investing, we would consider it foolish to ignore insider transactions altogether.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nThe Last 12 Months Of Insider Transactions At Meta Platforms\n\nIn the last twelve months, the biggest single sale by an insider was when the Chief Technology Officer, Andrew Bosworth, sold US$3.8m worth of shares at a price of US$473 per share. So it's clear an insider wanted to take some cash off the table, even slightly below the current price of US$477. As a general rule we consider it to be discouraging when insiders are selling below the current price, because it suggests they were happy with a lower valuation. However, while insider selling is sometimes discouraging, it's only a weak signal. It is worth noting that this sale was only 9.3% of Andrew Bosworth's holding.\n\nIn the last year Meta Platforms insiders didn't buy any company stock. You can see the insider transactions (by companies and individuals) over the last year depicted in the chart below. By clicking on the graph below, you can see the precise details of each insider transaction! insider-trading-volume\n\nFor those who like to find hidden gems this freelist of small cap companies with recent insider purchasing, could be just the ticket.\n\nInsiders At Meta Platforms Have Sold Stock Recently\n\nThe last quarter saw substantial insider selling of Meta Platforms shares. Specifically, Chief Technology Officer Andrew Bosworth ditched US$2.4m worth of shares in that time, and we didn't record any purchases whatsoever. This may suggest that some insiders think that the shares are not cheap.\n\nDoes Meta Platforms Boast High Insider Ownership?\n\nFor a common shareholder, it is worth checking how many shares are held by company insiders. I reckon it's a good sign if insiders own a significant number of shares in the company. Meta Platforms insiders own about US$166b worth of shares (which is 14% of the company). This kind of significant ownership by insiders does generally increase the chance that the company is run in the interest of all shareholders.\n\nSo What Does This Data Suggest About Meta Platforms Insiders?\n\nAn insider sold stock recently, but they haven't been buying. And even if we look at the last year, we didn't see any purchases. On the plus side, Meta Platforms makes money, and is growing profits. It is good to see high insider ownership, but the insider selling leaves us cautious. While we like knowing what's going on with the insider's ownership and transactions, we make sure to also consider what risks are facing a stock before making any investment decision. Every company has risks, and we've spotted 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms you should know about.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut note: Meta Platforms may not be the best stock to buy. So take a peek at this freelist of interesting companies with high ROE and low debt.\n\nFor the purposes of this article, insiders are those individuals who report their transactions to the relevant regulatory body. We currently account for open market transactions and private dispositions of direct interests only, but not derivative transactions or indirect interests.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "Dividend Delicacies: 3 Stocks That Will Add Flavor to Your Quarterly Payouts",
        "content": "Dividends continue to be highly prized by investors. And for good reason. Regular and consistent dividend payments that are reinvested can help to grow a portfolio over time. Many investors count on dividends to provide them with a regular income, particularly people living on a fixed income in retirement. For these reasons, a lot of investors carefully consider dividend payouts and yields when making purchase decisions.\n\nCompanies seem to have realized the importance investors place on dividends. Since the start of the year, several companies have more than doubled their distributions to shareholders, while other companies such as Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have declared their first ever dividend payments. Asset manager the Janus Henderson Group (NYSE:JHG) reports that dividend payments from U.S. companies hit a record $164.3 billion in this year’s first quarter, with more growth expected.\n\nHere is dividend delicacies: three stocks that will add flavor to your quarterly payouts.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) General Electric (GE) sign on a GE factory in Fort Wayne, Indiana.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBelieve it or not, GE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) has raised its quarterly dividend payment to stockholders by an astounding 250%. The industrial giant that specializes in making aircraft engines now pays a quarterly dividend of 28 cents a share, up from 8 cents previously. The big dividend hike was announced after General Electric successfully broke itself into three separate publicly traded companies. GE Aerospace retains the traditional business of General Electric, including the company’s “GE” ticker symbol.\n\nNow that it has hived off its healthcare and energy businesses into separate companies, GE Aerospace has announced plans to return capital to shareholders. At an analyst event in March, the company outlined plans to return 75% of its free cash flow to shareholders in the form of dividends and stock repurchases. GE Aerospace expects to generate $5 billion in 2024 free cash flow, which implies more than $3.7 billion in shareholder distributions. In addition to the dividend increase, GE stock has gained 60% so far in 2024.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nLost in the news of its blowout first-quarter financial results and 10-for-1 stock split was the fact that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) raised its quarterly dividend payout to shareholders by 150%. Normally, a dividend increase of that magnitude would generate its own headlines. However, it was overshadowed by news that Nvidia’s Q1 profit grew more than 600% and its sales were up 268% from a year ago. Retail investors cheered news of the 10-for-1 stock split, which will significantly lower the company’s share price.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia announced that it is increasing its quarterly dividend from 4 cents per share to 10 cents per share on a pre-split basis. After the split, the dividend will be only one penny a share. But that’s still decent considering that NVDA stock will likely trade at just over $100 per share after the split. Given the company’s torrid pace of growth, it likely won’t be long before the microchip designer boosts its distribution to stockholders again. Nvidia stock has increased 190% in the last 12 months.\n\nFord Motor Co. (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn March of this year, the Ford Motor Co. (NYSE:F) issued a special dividend payment to stockholders. The Detroit automaker said that it will pay a special dividend of 18 cents per share in addition to its regular dividend payment of 15 cents a share. The special dividend was meant to reward shareholders and was announced alongside better-than-expected financial results by the company.\n\nIn terms of Ford’s regular dividend payment of 15 cents, it currently has a yield of 5%, among the highest in the S&P 500 index. The high yield and special dividend payout make F stock more attractive to investors who have had to be patient with the company and its share price. Last fall, Ford endured a weeks long strike by the United Auto Workers (UAW) union that hurt its production. So far this year, Ford stock is flat (up 0.58%).\n\nWhile it’s not a growth stock, Ford remains a stable blue-chip name and its dividend should appeal to value investors and those seeking to generate income from their holdings.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

They point to Meta's advantages in areas like compute infrastructure, distribution scale, and talent acquisition.\n\nAccording to Raymond James' calculations, Meta's AI models rank highly, showcasing their competitiveness. Meta's investments in PyTorch, a leading AI framework, and its recruitment of top AI researchers further demonstrate their commitment to the field.\n\nThe note also outlines a significant revenue opportunity for Meta in GenAI. Raymond James estimates a potential $40 billion annual run rate across five distinct monetization avenues.\n\nThese avenues include GenAI APIs, where businesses would pay access fees to utilize Meta's AI models. Meta could also offer cloud-based access to its vast AI computing power through Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS).\n\nRaymond James sees potential for AI-powered solutions tailored for small businesses and AI applications in Meta's wearable devices like smart glasses.\n\nRaymond James emphasizes that Meta can pursue these GenAI opportunities without compromising its core social media business.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMeta is a GenAI leader says Raymond James, raises stock target\n\nEarnings call: Waterdrop's Q1 2024 results reveal robust growth\n\nElliott rebuilds stake in SoftBank and pushes for $15 billion buyback, source says\n\nView comments",

        "content": "CANBERRA (Reuters) - Australia should force Meta Platforms to pay news companies for content that appears on Facebook and impose broader regulation on social media firms, a senior News Corp executive said.\n\nMeta said in March it would stop paying Australian news publishers for content. The government is now considering whether to apply a 2021 law that would force it to do so.\n\n\"Meta must be designated under the Media Bargaining Code and challenged to negotiate in good faith,\" News Corp Australia executive chairman Michael Miller said in a speech in Canberra, using the jargon of the 2021 legislation.\n\n\"We had a deal - and they walked away. I believe they have an obligation to renew the agreements, and honour our laws,\" he said.\n\n\"We can't let ourselves be bullied.\"\n\nPublishers argue that Facebook and other internet giants reap unfair advertising revenue when links to news articles appear on their platforms.\n\nMeta struck payment deals with Australian media firms in 2021, most of which lapse this year.\n\nIf the government does enforce the 2021 law, Meta could push back by blocking users from reposting news articles as it did briefly in Australia in 2021 and has done since 2023 in Canada, which has similar laws and where academics have noted an increased spread of misinformation as a result.\n\nMeta has been reducing its promotion of news and political content to drive traffic and has said it will discontinue a tab on Facebook promoting news in Australia.\n\nIn his speech, Miller also decried the impact of social media on mental health and its amplification of scams and social ills such as misogyny. He proposed a regulatory framework for tech firms that he said would protect Australians.\n\nThis would include making companies liable for all content on their platforms, competition laws for digital advertising, better handling of consumer complaints and donations to mental health programmes.\n\nCompanies that do not abide by these rules should be barred from the Australian market, he said.\n\n(Reporting by Peter Hobson: Editing by Neil Fullick)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "RDDT vs. TBLA: Are These Profitless Stocks Worth Buying?",
        "content": "In this piece, I evaluated two social and digital advertising stocks, Reddit (NYSE:RDDT) and Taboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA), using TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to see which is better. A closer look suggests bearish views for both.\n\nWhile both companies address the digital advertising market, they do so in different ways. Reddit has been hosting online communities since 2005, although its fame as a social platform was kicked up another notch with the first meme-stock frenzy in early 2021. On the other hand, Taboola.com focuses more directly on advertising, operating a platform powered by artificial intelligence that enables websites and mobile apps to reach targeted audiences with ads.\n\nShares of Reddit are up 21% since the firm’s initial public offering (IPO) in March 2024. Meanwhile, Taboola.com stock is off 7% year-to-date, although it has gained 36% over the last year.\n\nThis dramatic difference in the two companies’ recent share-price performances is at least partially due to the IPO-related glow that sometimes follows tech companies in the weeks or months after they go public.\n\nNeither company is profitable, so we’ll compare their price-to-sales (P/S) ratios to gauge their valuations against each other and their industry. For comparison, the media industry is trading at a P/S of 1.4x versus the three-year average of 1.2x.\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT)\n\nAt a P/S of 10x, Reddit is trading at an exorbitantly high valuation following an impressive earnings beat for its first report as a public company. To put this into perspective, the hugely profitable Facebook parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is trading at a P/S of around 9.2x. Thus, a bearish view seems appropriate for Reddit — at least until the post-IPO glow wears off.\n\nThere’s no denying that Reddit’s first earnings release was a whopper, but the company is still losing millions of dollars per quarter. The company posted adjusted losses of $8.19 per share on $243 million in revenue versus expectations of $8.75 per share in losses on $214 million in revenue.\n\nThe social media firm had 82.7 million daily active users during the first quarter—significantly more than the StreetAccount estimate of 76.6 million. Meanwhile, Reddit’s net losses for the quarter totaled $575.1 million. However, according to the company, the IPO accounted for most of the extra expenses that contributed to that loss, including $595.5 million in stock-based compensation and related taxes.\n\nIn fact, the March quarter was Reddit’s first quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA, which rose to $10 million from -$50.2 million a year ago. Still, the company is nearly 20 years old, and it’s not profitable yet and has no apparent expectations of being profitable soon — despite the 88.6% gross profit margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current quarter, Reddit projected $240 million to $255 million in revenue, also smashing the consensus estimate of $224 million. At the midpoint, the company’s revenue could rise 32% from $183 million in the year-earlier quarter.\n\nIf Reddit continues to put up such impressive growth, it will eventually earn the valuation it currently has. Nonetheless, investors may want to consider whether a company that has never been profitable in almost 20 years and is earning less than $300 million in revenue per quarter deserves a market capitalization of over $9 billion.\n\nOn a positive note, the company announced a content-licensing deal with Google in February and a partnership with OpenAI that gives the platform access to its data. Both are deals that could help push it toward profitability.\n\nBut that brings us to another potential concern for Reddit stock. The company allowed some of its top users to buy shares in its IPO alongside institutional investors. While that might sound like a positive, Reddit stock could face significant volatility if the company’s users turn against it (for example, if they don’t want their data looked at) — especially if most of those buying the shares at its current price are doing so because they like the platform and not because they think it’s a good investment.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for RDDT Stock?\n\nReddit has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on nine Buys, six Holds, and one Sell rating assigned over the last three months. At $58.93, the average Reddit stock price target implies upside potential of 8.1%.\n\nTaboola.com (NASDAQ:TBLA)\n\nAt a P/S of 0.9x, Taboola.com is trading at a deeply depressed valuation, and it’s easy to see why. The company had one barely profitable year in 2020 but has been in the red since going public. Despite Taboola’s depressed valuation and the potential for profits in the near future, a bearish view seems appropriate due to its consistent losses and uncertain profitability outlook. Any shift toward profitability this year would be crucial in reassessing this stance.\n\nLike with Reddit, it’s difficult to see a scenario where Taboola will ever become profitable, although the consensus is that 2024 could be the company’s first profitable year. Taboola is nearly as old as Reddit, having been founded in 2007, but it went public in June 2021.\n\nAt this point, though, Taboola remains a show-me story, given that it continued to lose money in the first quarter and is expected to lose more money in the second. In the most recent quarter, the company posted adjusted losses of eight cents per share, in line with estimates, on $414 million in revenue versus the consensus of $403.3 million.\n\nTaboola did grow its revenue on a year-over-year basis versus the $327.7 million it reported in the year-ago quarter. However, the company’s annual revenue growth has slowed to a crawl, up only 1.6% in 2022 and 2.8% in 2023.\n\nIn the second quarter, analysts expect Taboola to post adjusted losses of five cents per share. The company guided for revenue of $425 million and over $25 million in adjusted EBITDA. Taboola also called for accelerating growth in 2024, but it remains to be seen whether it can achieve that.\n\nAfter all, the company’s full-year net losses widened significantly from $12 million in 2022 to $82 million in 2023, so it just looks like this company can never be profitable on a full-year basis. If the company does report a profitable quarter or two this year, its stock price will likely soar, but as things stand now, that looks like a big “if.”\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for TBLA Stock?\n\nTaboola.com has a Strong Buy consensus rating based on five Buys, one Hold, and zero Sell ratings assigned over the last three months. At $5.90, the average Taboola.com stock price target implies upside potential of 57.75%.\n\nConclusion: Bearish on RDDT and TBLA\n\nUnfortunately, Reddit and Taboola face the same issue: profitability. Without some significant changes to their business models, it’s impossible to see profitable scenarios for either company.\n\nHowever, Reddit is still in the early stages of its publicly traded life, so it’s the winner of this pairing. Plus, the content-licensing deal with Google and the OpenAI partnership can help with its profitability issues.\n\nOn the other hand, even buying Reddit stock on a dip could be like catching a falling knife because if the company’s users turn on it for licensing their data, the backlash could be severe. Thus, while Reddit does beat Taboola in the likelihood of turning a profit in the near term, there’s just too much uncertainty with the company’s users potentially owning shares because they like the platform and not because it’s a good investment.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been the buzzword for the stock market. Corporations that can capitalize on this new technology can generate meaningful long-term returns for investors. People got to see those returns manifest in 2023 and in the first half of 2024. However, some AI stocks can keep charging higher.\n\nInvestors can make a living by outsmarting the stock market. These are some of the top AI stocks that have a chance at delivering impressive long-term returns.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Official Microsoft (MSFT) blog introducing Microsoft 365 Copilot is seen on its corporate website. Microsoft 365 Copilot provides AI tools aimed at boosting efficiency.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe tech giant is currently the world’s most valuable publicly traded corporation. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has a $3.1 trillion market cap that goes alongside a 36 P/E ratio and a 0.725 yield. Shares are up by 12% year-to-date (YTD) and have more than tripled over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe corporation closed out the third quarter of fiscal 2024 with a 35.5% net profit margin. Revenue increased by 17% year-over-year (YOY) in the quarter while net income was up by 20% YOY. Microsoft Cloud, a top beneficiary of AI, grew by 23% YOY and represented more than half of the firm’s total revenue.\n\nAdditionally, Microsoft operates in many business verticals, and Copilot offers an opportunity to cover more ground. Copilot is the company’s AI tool, and its recent Copilot for Security feature should help Microsoft gain market share in the cybersecurity industry.\n\nTherefore, analysts have been rushing to give the stock buy ratings. The average price target suggests an 18% upside from current levels.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) uses AI to display relevant ads to its users. The company has delivered robust returns with its advertising channels, and the first quarter was no exception. Revenue increased by 27% YOY while net income was up by 117% YOY. The social media giant grew its revenue while trimming its headcount by 10% YOY.\n\nWhile advertising is the company’s primary revenue driver, it’s investing in artificial reality through its Reality Labs segment. It’s going to take several years before artificial reality makes a meaningful impact on Meta Platforms’ revenue growth. However, the company’s financials are looking just fine, and future reinforcements can bring the stock higher in the long run.\n\nFurthermore, Meta Platforms stock is up by 35% YTD and has gained 170% over the past five years. The stock trades at a 27 P/E ratio and offers a 0.43% yield. Meta Platforms is currently rated as a strong buy with a projected 12% upside.\n\nStory continues\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is an American defense contractor that produces unmanned aerial vehicles. These drones rely on AI to carry out missions. The contractor has been seeing more demand for its business in recent quarters. Revenue for Q3 of 2024 revenue increased by 39% YOY while net income swung from a slight loss to $13.9 million in profits.\n\nAlso, AeroVironment Chief Environment Officer (CEO) Wahid Nawabi mentioned a strong backlog and growing pipeline in the press release. Based on those catalysts, the company raised its guidance for fiscal 2024 revenue. It now expects to generate between $700 and $710 million in fiscal 2024 sales. Additionally, AeroVironment anticipates a double-digit revenue growth rate in fiscal 2025.\n\nMoreover, the stock has hit its stride in recent years. It’s more than tripled over the past five years and is off to a strong start. AeroVironment has gained 64% YTD. The defense contractor recently became profitable, and rising margins should result in a more attractive valuation in the future.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in MSFT.

        "content": "Meta Platforms (META) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this social media company have returned +2.5%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +3.2% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Software industry, which Meta Platforms falls in, has lost 0.4%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nEarnings Estimate Revisions\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nMeta Platforms is expected to post earnings of $4.67 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +44.6%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.2%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $20.19 points to a change of +35.8% from the prior year. Over the last 30 days, this estimate has changed +0.4%.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $23.15 indicates a change of +14.6% from what Meta Platforms is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed -0.1%.\n\nHaving a strong externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, offers a more conclusive picture of a stock's price direction in the near term, since it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. Due to the size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, Meta Platforms is rated Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for META _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nProjected Revenue Growth\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Meta Platforms, the consensus sales estimate of $38.15 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +19.2%. The $158.97 billion and $179.82 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +17.8% and +13.1%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nMeta Platforms reported revenues of $36.46 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +27.3%. EPS of $4.71 for the same period compares with $2.64 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $36.28 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.48%. The EPS surprise was +9.03%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nComparing the current value of a company's valuation multiples, such as its price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S), and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), to its own historical values helps ascertain whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, whereas comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of how reasonable its stock price is.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nMeta Platforms is graded C on this front, indicating that it is trading at par with its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Meta Platforms. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. Here are the first five topics:\n\nThe rise of generative AI\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, specifically Generative AI, and its potential to alter the consumer and enterprise computing landscape has been a key debate for investors for the past 12 months or so, analysts at the influential investment bank said, in a note dated May 17.\n\n“In many ways, we see AI (its continued development and deployment across all aspects of the digital economy) as perhaps the most influential theme in decades and reminiscent of other prior major internet shifts (e.g. the shift from desktop [Web 1.0] to mobile [Web 2.0]),” said Goldman.\n\nStocks of publicly listed technology companies have tended to react promptly to perceived changes in strategic positioning resulting from the rise in Generative AI, Goldman added.\n\nSo far the debate around Generative AI has tended to center largely on the infrastructure layer - fulfillment of the Cloud Computing needs associated with this technology, involving largely Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - and the AI model/platform layer, where we view that only a select few (mainly Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)) have the scale of capital and technical resources to compete effectively.\n\nHowever, the bank increasingly sees an opportunity for AI implementation to begin to drive meaningful impacts, both positively and negatively, across various aspects of consumer internet in 2024 - the application layer.\n\nInvestor debates are likely to center around about how Generative AI might alter go to market strategies; input costs; and the competitive landscape for any specific end market that disrupts more traditional desktop/mobile behaviors.\n\n“Broadly, we expect Generative AI to produce a mix of product innovation and changed consumer behavior across many subsectors in our coverage,” Goldman added.\n\nBlurring lines between advertising and e-commerce models\n\n“We continue to see blurring lines between traditional advertising and e-commerce business models,” analysts at Goldman said, “with retail media capturing more budgets as traditional e-commerce platforms continue to build out their advertising offerings and digital advertising platforms continue to innovate around social commerce.”\n\nThat said, over the past few months, the bank has also observed a pivot in strategies by both e-commerce and digital advertising companies as it relates to this theme by embracing a partnership-type model versus trying to directly compete for traffic and transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank continues to see that social commerce remains a key long-term secular theme within digital advertising, but expects digital ad platforms to further pivot their strategies and prioritize building better user experiences around shopping/commerce over the medium-term.\n\nGoldman sees Google; Meta Platforms (in partnership with Amazon); and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) (also in partnership with Amazon) as well positioned against this theme.\n\nTurning to retail media, Goldman sees a long runway for Amazon to continue to grow its advertising business.\n\nElsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) disclosed that advertising revenues hit a $900 million annualized run-rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 and remains on track to exceed its prior target of $1bn+ by 2024, while Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is also focused on scaling its advertising business.\n\nRising competition in e-commerce landscape\n\nThe e-commerce landscape continues to reset towards a new normal of slowing demand, more moderate increases in online penetration rates, an ongoing shift of spending from goods to services, and a more discerning consumer.\n\nConsumers appear to be consolidating their online spending around fewer platforms and refocus on price/selection/convenience - supporting gains from two main types of players: large aggregators with scale, leading delivery speeds, and competitive pricing, and platforms focused on low-cost items, including new Asia-based cross-border competitors.\n\nThe bank continues “to see Amazon as best positioned to produce a mixture of strong revenue growth and margin expansion with lower risk to estimates relative to smaller peers against an increasingly volatile consumer backdrop.”\n\nImpact of AI on digital advertising\n\nArtificial intelligence and automation in the context of digital advertising (across various aspects of the value chain) has been a key theme in recent months, potentially allowing smaller advertisers to adopt more sophisticated digital ad strategies and driving better targeting/returns on customer acquisition spend, as well as helping individual creators.\n\nIn some ways, this democratizing effect and the broader integration of AI into digital advertising could be an positive for smaller platforms as AI implementation improves underlying ad tech, drives deeper user engagement and/or enables improved performance for other digital channels.\n\nThis could offer upside over the long-term for mid-cap digital ad platforms, including the likes of Pinterest, Snap, DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP).\n\nThat said, a potentially more likely outcome, is that the large-scaled, incumbent platforms (who are furthest along in terms of AI development&adoption - e.g. Google&Meta Platforms) disproportionately benefit from this theme, as these platforms have the scale of capital, engineering talent/resources and first-party data to remain AI leaders and that smaller platforms may have difficulty matching.\n\nShift of local commerce activity online\n\nLocal commerce continues to build in scale as consumers increasingly prioritize faster delivery speeds and as the industry invests to meet these expectations.\n\nTraditional e-commerce companies and on-demand delivery platforms are increasingly competing head-on, as on-demand platforms expand into more traditional retail categories, and as both sets of players are focusing more resources to digitize large categories that were historically underpenetrated by online.\n\nThese new verticals are accretive to the growth of restaurant delivery businesses, with the likes of Uber and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) seeing strong momentum.\n\n“Both UBER and DASH have commented on these new verticals being important investment areas that while a drag to margins today (not yet adjusted EBITDA profitable) are displaying improving unit economics and strong growth and support mgmt’s confidence that these businesses have attractive long-term return profiles,” said Goldman.\n\nWithin more traditional eCommerce platforms, Amazon continues to expand its online grocery business and is increasingly consolidating its various brands/platforms in a more integrated offering for consumers.\n\nAmazon sees room to drive further efficiencies from its logistics network which Goldman expects to remain an important tailwind to multi-year retail margins.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq dip in choppy trading after economic data\n\nRussia's two largest banks to open in annexed regions of Ukraine by July\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Trump Media Stock Is NOT a Buy Despite the Potential for a Short-Term Surge",
        "content": "The unprecedented conviction of former President Donald Trump on charges many across the political spectrum agree was a stretch of the law could ignite new interest in Trump Media & Technology Group (NASDAQ:DJT), but expect volatility from Trump Media stock. Trump may use Truth Social to amplify his views and appeal to the case.\n\nIf Trump becomes even more active on Truth Social, it could draw in many more users wanting to follow him and hear what he has to say.\n\nNot that his every pronouncement isn’t already amplified far and wide away from the social media site but it could make the platform much more relevant as the campaign season progresses.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile DJT stock is flat from where it began trading in late-March when Trump Media began trading, and it fell 5% last Friday after the conviction, the stock is up 115% from its April low.\n\nTrump Media & Technology is and will be a volatile stock. It will rise and fall based on the force of the President’s personality. It’s why you should avoid putting your money into DJT stock.\n\nAn Unprecedented Situation\n\nTrump was found guilty on all 34 charges of falsifying business records leveled against him. The odds of the conviction being overturned on appeal are high, according to pundits, although he may have to go all the way to the U.S. Supreme Court.\n\nAnalysts on both sides of the aisle say packaging individual misdemeanor charges into a felony as the district attorney did is a novel but dubious tactic.\n\nYet whether you support Trump or oppose him, as investors we need to put those emotions aside. We need to look at whether Trump Media & Technology is a good business for putting our money to work.\n\nThe early indications say no. Trump Media, and more specifically Truth Social, is a shell of a social media platform compared to X, Meta Platform‘s (NASDAQ:META) Facebook and Instagram or Snap‘s (NYSE:SNAP) Snapchat.\n\nTrump Media doesn’t give investors those numbers. It says because Truth Social is so new (it’s about two-and-a-half years old) focusing on traditional metrics such as monthly daily active users will distract management and the markets from what is being built.\n\nThat is a convenient excuse if your platform isn’t attracting very many users. It forces analysts to use alternative, arguably less viable sources, to make a determination about whether the site is growing or not.\n\nA Shrinking Pool Amid a Growing Market\n\nRecently CNBC reported Similarweb found daily visits to Truth Social fell 21% in May from April. They were down 35% from March when it had 1.5 million users.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta Platforms, on the other hand, reported daily active people jumped 7% in the first quarter to 3.24 billion users across its family of apps. Snap saw a 10% surge in DAU in its first quarter. There is a reason social media sites use and report these metrics.\n\nX, which is more akin to Truth Social, also enjoyed a big increase in monthly active users, according to CEO Elon Musk. In a tweet on the platform late last month, he said the social media site had 600 million monthly active users.\n\nTwo months prior he claimed it had over 500 million MAU. That’s a 20% increase in just 60 days.\n\nBecause X is a private company, though, there is nothing official about these figures. It is just its CEO declaring this to be true. Other sites say users have declined.\n\nThe Bottom Line on Trump Media Stock\n\nRegardless of the actual number of users Truth Social has, Trump Media & Technology stock will ricochet higher and lower. It is very much a meme stock in that shares won’t trade based on the business fundamentals.\n\nIt will be by dint of President Donald Trump’s public pronouncements and those made about him.\n\nIn the short term, that suggests DJT stock could soar. As he campaigns for office and the appeal of his conviction wends its way through the courts, Trump will become more vocal. That could build momentum in his social media site’s ability to attract users.\n\nStill, that is no way to invest and you should stay away from Trump Media & Technology, whether you plan to vote for him in November or not.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant and Piling Into This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred three weeks ago. During the heart of earnings season, and following the eagerly awaited April inflation report, institutions with $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn simple terms, a 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter. In this instance, it covered trading activity during the March-ended quarter. Even though these snapshots are backward looking, they can offer valuable insight into what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\n\nOne theme that's definitely stood out for more than a year has been Wall Street's love for almost anything involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Using software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to evolve over time without human intervention, provides AI with multitrillion-dollar utility in virtually all sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut what's interesting about this affinity for AI stocks is that the face of the AI revolution has been sent to the chopping block for two consecutive quarters by billionaire investors. At the same time, we've seen billionaires repeatedly pile into another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock with abundant long-term potential.\n\nOver a half-dozen billionaires are dumping Nvidia stock\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence might be the hottest innovation since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, it didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers from casting aside shares of the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement during the March-ended quarter. Eight billionaire investors -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- sent shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) packing, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia has taken advantage of its AI-driven opportunity. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred choice in high-compute data centers, and it's enjoying otherworldly pricing power on these chips as a result. Nvidia's gross margin came in at a scorching-hot 78.4% during its fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, there are four very clear reasons for billionaire investors to be skeptical of Nvidia moving forward.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is that history has been unkind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Without fail, investors have overestimated the uptake/adoption of every new innovation, and AI is unlikely to break this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, the company that most-directly benefited from its rise (Nvidia) would be the likeliest to deflate.\n\nThe second issue is that Nvidia's pricing power on its GPUs is likely to wane in the quarters to come. Competitors are rolling out GPUs designed to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 GPUs retain a compute edge over its competitors, the increased availability of new GPUs will lessen the scarcity that sent Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere. When this pricing power fades, so will Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nTight domestic regulation on AI solutions is another concern. In each of the last two years, U.S. regulators have restricted what AI chips Nvidia can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Nvidia even developed toned-down AI-GPUs (the A800 and H800) specifically for China following the first round of export restrictions in 2022, only to have these chips also banned for export to China last year. Sans China, Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly revenue.\n\nThe fourth and final puzzle piece that may have encouraged billionaires to ring the register is an increasing amount of internal competition. Nvidia's top four customers account for roughly 40% of its net sales. The problem is that they're all developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed chips are to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs or to replace them entirely, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from these industry-leading businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis Magnificent Seven stock has been the apple of billionaires' eyes\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have been widely credited with sending Wall Street's major stocks indexes to record-closing highs. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest (by market cap) and most-influential businesses in the country and are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven companies are industry leaders with well-defined long-term catalysts and clear competitive edges. In fact, the four top customers of Nvidia I alluded to earlier are Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nBut these are also stocks that billionaires have been avid sellers of in recent quarters... with one exception: e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the first quarter, nine billionaires piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia stock (Laffont, Griffin, and Englander) were buyers of Amazon shares.\n\nThough Amazon's online marketplace is considered the \"face\" of the company, it's not why billionaires have taken the plunge. Amazon's exceptional growth in cash flow has everything to do with its trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's cash flow or bottom line than the ongoing growth and success of cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on an analysis from Canalys, AWS accounted for a hearty 31% of global cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. As of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. With enterprise cloud spending still rapidly accelerating, the juicy margins associated with cloud services should allow Amazon to rapidly grow its operating cash flow.\n\nSubscription services (e.g., Prime) is another segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth potential. In exchange for Prime member perks like free two-day shipping on most online marketplace orders and access to Amazon's growing content library, Amazon enjoys strong subscription pricing power with Prime. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and has almost certainly added to this total.\n\nThe third higher-margin ancillary segment that does some heavy lifting for Amazon is advertising. When you're driving in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion monthly visitors to your site each month, as well as growing the number of Prime subscribers, it's easy to command higher prices from advertisers who want motivated shoppers to see their message(s).\n\nPut these three ancillary segments together and you get a company slated to more than double its cash-flow-per-share between 2023 and 2027. Relative to its future cash flow, Amazon remains historically cheap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Ivy League Inspiration: 3 Stocks That Harvard’s Endowment Managers Believe In",
        "content": "Today, we focus on the Harvard Management Company (“HMC”) and discuss three Harvard endowment stocks. HMC manages Harvard University’s substantial endowment fund, valued at well over $50 billion for fiscal year 2023. As a result, many on Wall Street pay attention to the investment decisions made by the fund.\n\nHMC’s latest SEC filings reveal a concentrated portfolio of twelve securities. The company’s leading holdings include Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Invesco QQQ Trust (NASDAQ:QQQ), Light & Wonder (NASDAQ:LNW), and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Notably, the top three stocks account for a significant 78% of its invested assets. With that information, here are three Harvard endowment stocks that deserve your attention in June.\n\nTop Harvard Endowment Stocks: Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of Harvard endowment stocks is Alphabet, the parent company of Google, YouTube, and Google Cloud. During the first quarter of 2024, Harvard Management Company increased its ownership of Alphabet, specifically the Class A shares (GOOGL) by 27.6% through two purchases, a decision likely supported by Alphabet’s strong financial performance.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giant exceeded analyst expectations in the first quarter, reporting a 15% surge in revenues to $80.5 billion. This growth was propelled in part by a 13% rise in Google’s ad revenue, totaling $61.7 billion. In addition, a 28% surge in cloud computing revenue, which hit $9.6 billion thanks to advancements in AI technology, was helpful. Alphabet announced its first-ever quarterly dividend of 20 cents per share and a $70 billion buyback program. Both moves were well-received by stakeholders.\n\nStrategic ventures, like a partnership with augmented reality startup Magic Leap and over 1,000 new cloud product offerings, underscore Alphabet’s innovation commitment. Meanwhile, Alphabet is heavily investing in generative AI, particularly through its Google Cloud and Search segments. The company has introduced generative AI features into Google Search, which allows it to serve more complex queries and improve user experience. Google has rolled out “AI overviews” in Search in the U.S. and U.K., focusing on complex queries where generative AI can add value.\n\nSo far this year, GOOGL stock has gained nearly 24%, and currently trades at around 23 times forward earnings and 7 times trailing sales. Analysts foresee further upside, setting a 12-month price target of $195, a 13% potential increase from current levels. In addition to growth prospects, the stock also comes with a modest 0.47% dividend yield.\n\nStory continues\n\nLight & Wonder (LNW) video game stocks: a person playing a video game with a handheld controller\n\nSource: korobskyph / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe continue our discussion on Harvard endowment stocks with games developer Light & Wonder (NASDAQ:LNW). The company designs, manufactures, and distributes physical gaming machines like slot machines and electronic table games for casinos and lotteries. LNW also owns a digital gaming segment, SciPlay, which publishes mobile and web games.\n\nOn 8 May, Light & Wonder reported solid first quarter 2024 earnings. Consolidated revenue increased by 13% YOY to $756 million. Diluted earnings per share (“EPS”) came in at 88 cents compared with 23 cents for the year-ago quarter.  Management also expressed confidence in its ability to deliver sustainable growth and achieve its target of $1.4 billion in revenue by 2025. Investors noted that the key growth drivers include the launch of new games, expansion into adjacent markets, and continued momentum in its digital businesses.\n\nWhile Light & Wonder presents a compelling investment opportunity with its consistent revenue growth, diverse revenue streams, and strong financial health, potential investors should also consider the industry volatility and dependence on consumer spending. Understandably, balancing these pros and cons can help long-term investors make an informed decision about including Light & Wonder in their investment portfolio.\n\nYear-to-date (YTD), LNW stock is up more than 16% while the shares are trading at 24.83 times forward earnings and 2.88 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for LNW stands at $113.0 suggesting an upside potential of over 18% from current levels.\n\nRocket Lab USA (RKLB) Person holding smartphone with logo of aerospace company Rocket Lab USA Inc. (RKLB) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final company among our Harvard endowment stocks is Rocket Lab USA (NASDAQ:RKLB). This pioneering space company specializes in launch services and space systems solutions for commercial, aerospace, and government clients. With a robust product lineup including the electron and photon platforms, and ambitious plans for the neutron rocket, RKLB stock offers investors exposure to the rapidly growing aerospace and defense (A&D) industry.\n\nRocket Lab reported total revenues of $92.77 million for the first quarter of 2024, representing a significant growth of 68.99% compared to the same quarter in the previous year. We should note that despite the strong revenue growth, Rocket Lab USA is currently operating at a loss.\n\nThe A&D industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, significant capital requirements, and long development cycles. Wall Street highlights that the industry is experiencing a renaissance, driven by advancements in technology, increased demand for satellite launches, and growing interest in space exploration. Meanwhile, Rocket Lab has secured a robust backlog of over $1 billion, providing significant visibility into future growth. The company has also formed strategic partnerships and secured government contracts, which not only provide stable revenue but also enhance its credibility and competitive position in the industry.

        "content": "3 Dividend-Paying Growth Stocks To Hold For Decades\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nAn effective approach to portfolio development involves investing in stocks that consistently increase their dividends over time. These dividend growth companies offer a track record of outperforming the S&P 500 and a rising income stream.\n\nHolding a robust dividend growth stock at a fair price for the long term can yield handsome returns. Even a $1,000 initial investment can grow annually by hundreds of dollars through compounding. Explore three promising investment prospects for your portfolio.\n\nVISA\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is the world’s premier payment network. Every time a credit or debit card with the Visa logo is swiped, Visa earns a small fee. Visa earns the fee for each transaction from the consumer’s bank or credit account to the merchant’s bank account.\n\nInstead, it partners with banks to offer Visa-branded cards. Retailers worldwide choose these cards because they are widely accepted. Visa’s business model is simple: it aims to grow its client base and increase payment volume.\n\nDespite handling $15 trillion in payments across 276 billion transactions last year, it still sees growth potential, especially in foreign markets. In the second quarter, cross-border transactions rose by 16% compared to the previous year, helping boost payment volume by 8%.\n\nVisa’s expansive network enables it to capitalize on rising payment volumes, thereby enhancing its operating margin. This growth led to an 8.5% rise in operating income in the year’s first half. It drove strong free cash flow growth and supported a growing dividend. This is part of its broader capital return strategy.\n\nVisa marked the 16th year of dividend increases in October by raising its payout by 16% to $0.52 per share. Visa has an all-encompassing capital return policy. Under it, investors can expect growing dividends. This is due to a $25 billion share repurchase authorization.\n\nT-Mobile\n\nT-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) has recently entered the dividend-paying scene, joining a sector long known for high-yield companies.\n\nFor over a decade, T-Mobile focused on expanding its customer base. It invested in network infrastructure, obtained cellular spectrum licenses, and promoted its products. After merging with Sprint, T-Mobile’s customer base now rivals its biggest competitors. This lets it leverage its fixed network costs and generate significant free cash flow.\n\nT-Mobile’s executives project to produce between $16.4 billion and $16.9 billion in free cash flow this year. The corporation uses this money toward the new dividend, which started last fall, and for share repurchases. T-Mobile has used $4.4 billion of its repurchase authorization thus far; $11.7 billion remains for the rest of the year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn 28 May, T-Mobile announced that it would acquire nearly all of UScellular's wireless operations, including its wireless customers and stores, for approximately $4.4 billion.\n\nT-Mobile leads in adding postpaid customers and now offers home internet. It serves over 30 million postpaid accounts out of 99 million customers and has over five million home internet connections.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently entered the dividend-paying market. In February, it startled investors by declaring a tiny dividend with its fourth-quarter earnings release.\n\nMeta operates Facebook, the largest social network globally. It boasts over three billion monthly active users on Facebook alone. Across its platforms like Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger, Meta reaches more than 4 billion unique users each month. This broad reach makes it highly attractive to advertisers.\n\nIn the first quarter, advertisers spent an impressive $35.6 billion on Meta’s apps, representing a 27% year-over-year increase. Meta is making significant investments in artificial intelligence (AI) to sustain this growth, with annual AI-related expenses reaching tens of billions of dollars.\n\nDespite these substantial investments, Meta continues to provide significant returns to shareholders. The newly added dividend is a meager fraction of its larger capital return program, which includes a $66 billion share repurchase authorization as of the end of the first quarter.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor instance, Basecamp Alpine Notes offers a target APY of 9% with a term of only three months, making it a powerful short-term cash management tool with incredible flexibility. EquityMultiple has issued 61 Alpine Notes Series and has met all payment and funding obligations with no missed or late interest payments. With a low minimum investment of just $1,000, Basecamp Alpine Notes makes it easier than ever to start building a high-yield portfolio.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

Quote\n\nAccording to a Pew Research 2023 study, Alphabet’s GOOGL YouTube was the most used social media among U.S. teenagers, trailed by TikTok, Snapchat and Instagram.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms’ commitment to social discovery, supported by cutting-edge AI and user-centric features, positions Facebook as a platform that resonates with young adults, opening their world in meaningful ways.\r\n\r\nThe company is heavily investing in AI to enhance user experience. It has upgraded its Reels and Feed ranking technologies, resulting in better content recommendations. A newly developed model architecture allows for efficient learning from large datasets, significantly improving the performance of Facebook Reels.\r\n\r\nOver the next few years, this advanced recommendation technology will be extended across Facebook’s video ecosystem, aiming to offer the world’s best recommendation technology by 2026.\r\n\r\nMeta Platforms has improved the video experience on Facebook, introducing a new full-screen video player and features that facilitate easy navigation through longer videos.

        "content": "The fight for AI supremacy between Advanced Micro Devices AMD and NVIDIA NVDA is escalating, with both launching new chips at Computex 2024.\r\n\r\nAMD is playing catch-up to NVIDIA’s dominance in the AI space, which has been riding on strong spending as the digital transformation (DX) of enterprises continues. Per IDC estimates, worldwide spending on DX is forecast to reach roughly $4 trillion in 2027, witnessing a CAGR of 16.2% between 2022 and 2027.\r\n\r\nGartner estimates spending on AI software to witness a CAGR of 19.1% between 2022 and 2027 to hit $297 billion in 2027. Generative AI (GenAI) software spending is expected to surge from 8% in 2023 to 35% by 2027. Deloitte expects enterprise spending on GenAI to increase 30% in 2024 from $16 billion in 2023.\r\n\r\nThis massive splurge by enterprises presents significant growth opportunities for both chipmakers.\n\nAMD & NVIDIA Focus on Frequent Launch of Chips\n\nBoth AMD and NVIDIA are now focusing on the faster launch of AI-enabled chips to stay ahead of the competition.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. Quote\n\nAt Computex 2024, AMD unveiled its Instinct accelerator roadmap that includes the new Instinct MI325X accelerator, which is planned to be available in fourth-quarter 2024. Instinct MI325X accelerator features 288GB of ultra-fast HBM3E memory that extends AMD’s GenAI performance footprint.\r\n\r\nThe next-generation CDNA 4 architecture, expected in 2025, will power the AMD Instinct MI350 Series. It is expected to drive up to 35X better AI inference performance compared to the AMD Instinct MI300 Series with AMD CDNA 3. The CDNA “Next” architecture will power MI400 series accelerators planned for 2026.\r\n\r\nAMD unveiled the fifth generation of EPYC server processors (Turin) that leverage the Zen 5 core. It further expanded its portfolio with the launch of the Ryzen AI 300 Series, the third generation of AMD AI-enabled mobile processors, and Ryzen 9000 Series processors for laptop and desktop PCs.\r\n\r\nAt Computex, Microsoft MSFT, HP, Lenovo and Asus unveiled new PCs powered by third-gen AMD Ryzen AI 300 Series processors and AMD Ryzen 9000 Series desktop processors.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA recently expanded its portfolio with the announcement of the next-generation AI chip architecture, Rubin, which will leverage HBM4. This follows the March announcement of Blackwell, which is currently in production and is expected to ship to customers later this year.\r\n\r\nThe most valuable chip company now plans to release new AI chip models annually instead of its previous two-year update timeline. NVIDIA also announced a plethora of new tools and software models at Computex 2024.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA’s yearly launch decision reflects the ongoing competitive frenzy in the AI chip market and its urgency to maintain its dominant position, which is not only threatened by AMD and Intel but also by initiatives taken by Microsoft, Alphabet GOOGL, and Meta Platforms.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Giants Spicing Up AI Race\n\nMicrosoft’s Maia 100 is designed for AI purposes. The Maia 100 AI accelerator is capable of running cloud AI workloads like large language model training and inference. It is powered by a 5-nanometer TSMC process and has 105 billion transistors.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google has introduced the Axion central processing unit (CPU) to support its AI work in data centers. Axion processors are its first tailored Arm-based CPUs designed to deliver robust performance and energy efficiency. These CPUs deliver instances with up to 30% better performance than the fastest general-purpose Arm-based instances.\r\n\r\nMeta followed Google to introduce the next generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), which is a family of customized chips designed for Meta’s AI workloads. MTIA will support new generative AI products and services, recommendation systems, and advanced AI research. The accelerator comes with an 8x8 grid of processing elements, which deliver increased dense compute performance (3.5x over MTIA v1) and a sparse compute performance.\n\nConclusion\n\nNVIDIA has returned a whopping 121.4% year to date, outperforming AMD, Microsoft and Alphabet’s growth of 13.2%, 10.4% and 23.5%, respectively.\r\n\r\nNVDA is enjoying dominance in the AI-space thanks to its next-generation chips with high computing power that have been the top choice for enterprises. However, AMD, with its latest products, seems well-equipped to challenge NVDA not only in the data center market but also in the growing AI-enabled consumer PC market over the long haul.\r\n\r\nNVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) with a Growth Score of A, a combination that offers a good investment opportunity, per the Zacks proprietary methodology. A Momentum Score of B makes NVDA an attractive pick for investors. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nHowever, investors should wait for a better entry point for AMD, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. Moreover, AMD is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 40.11X compared with the Zacks Electronics - Semiconductors industry’s 32.92X and NVIDIA’s 38.12X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "A former diversity and inclusion manager at Facebook and Nike has been sentenced to five years and three months in prison for stealing more than $5 million from the tech giant to “fund a luxury lifestyle”.\n\nBarbara Furlow-Smiles, who pleaded guilty to wire fraud in the case in December, stole more than $4.9 million that had been earmarked for DEI initiatives from Facebook after apparently getting \"caught up\" in the company's \"move fast and break things\" culture.\n\nThe 38-year-old served as lead strategist and global head of employee resource groups and diversity engagement at the social media giant from 2017 to 2021, before being fired.\n\nIt’s unclear whether Furlow-Smiles was let go from Facebook because of this fraud, but she then joined Nike, where she continued to “brazenly” swindle a six-figure sum from the sportswear giant’s diversity program until 2023.\n\n\"Furlow-Smiles shamelessly violated her position of trust as a DEI executive at Facebook to steal millions from the company utilizing a scheme involving fraudulent vendors, fake invoices, and cash kickbacks,\" U.S. Attorney Ryan K. Buchanan said in a statement.\n\nFurlow-Smiles, who lives in Marietta, Ga. was sentenced in Atlanta federal court in May and ordered to hand back the cash, including over $121,000 to Nike.\n\n“She not only threw away a lucrative career, but will serve time behind bars for her excessive greed,” Keri Farley, Special Agent in Charge of FBI Atlanta concluded.\n\nHow did she do it?\n\nFurlow-Smiles was able to steal from Facebook, now Meta, because she was a senior member of staff with access to company credit cards and the authority to sign off invoices—or, in this case, fake invoices from vendors who were her family and friends.\n\n“But these individuals did not provide goods or services to the company,”  the attorney's office noted.\n\nOnce Facebook paid the vendors—who included her former interns, a hairstylist, baby-sitters, nannies and even her university tutor—she directed they send her a portion of the money they received.\n\nOften kickbacks were paid in cash, sometimes delivered wrapped in T-shirts, or through transfers to accounts held in her husband’s and others’ names.\n\nNot only did Furlow-Smiles cover her tracks by submitting fake expense reports, she also directed associates to pay one another, or others who she owed money.\n\nBut, according to the attorney's office, “most” of her associates “did not know that the payments came from Facebook.”\n\nFurlow-Smiles also misled Facebook into paying pay third parties for personal goods or services that did not provide kickbacks, including nearly $10,000 to an artist for specialty portraits and more than $18,000 to an unnamed preschool for tuition.\n\nStory continues\n\nShe got caught up in Facebook’s ‘move fast and break things’\n\n“I blew it big time,” Furlow-Smiles admitted in a letter to the judge in her case, adding that her actions “added fuel to the fire of disengagement and attack of DEI efforts.”\n\nBut the disgraced DEI officer failed to show any regret in Nike’s eyes.\n\nThe company told prosecutors that she was “entrusted as a leader for [the] company, that she would embody the value of ‘Doing the Right Thing’ which is one of NIKE’s key maxims,” adding that her “complete lack of accountability or remorse was incredibly disappointing.”\n\nYet, Furlow-Smiles’ attorney placed the blame on her actions partly on her previous employer.\n\nIn a sentencing memorandum, Phillip Hamilton argued that his client got caught up in Facebook’s “move fast and break things” culture and that others were also exploiting the company’s expenses for their own benefits.\n\n“Barbara ... quickly learned that coworkers were friends with vendors and relied on these vendors to do certain things, which included providing kickbacks for referring Facebook business to them. It was the norm,” Hamilton alleged in the memorandum.\n\nNeither Meta nor Nike have responded to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Tech companies bet on carbon removal startups as AI tests climate goals",
        "content": "Carbon removal technologies are becoming increasingly important for companies, particularly for tech giants locked in a fierce battle to become the leader in artificial intelligence.\n\nOnce considered a diversion for the critical work of cutting emissions, carbon removal projects that extract and sequester carbon dioxide emissions from the atmosphere — such as direct air capture facilities or reforestation efforts — are now seen as a necessary step to hit key climate change targets.\n\n“There are some portions of company emissions that you will just never abate,” Karan Mistry, managing director and partner for Boston Consulting Group, told Yahoo Finance. “[Companies are] recognizing that they have a net-zero target and they want to actually get to zero and honor their very public commitments, they have to invest in some sort of removal technology.”\n\nFrontier Fund, a consortium of investors that includes Alphabet (GOOG), JPMorgan (JPM), and Meta (META), has purchased contracts to remove more than 510,203 tons of carbon to date.\n\nThe fund made one of its biggest commitments last year when it committed to paying $57.1 million to enhanced rock weathering startup Lithos Carbon to remove 154,000 tons of carbon from the atmosphere.\n\n\"All of these frontrunners in the carbon market, they’re not just interested in what they can buy today,\" Henry Liu, head of engineering at Lithos Carbon, told Yahoo Finance. \"They’re investing in the future of the carbon dioxide removal market. [With] the scale of the market, they recognize that investment is needed. So they’re looking to support pathways.” A bank of fans draws air through specialized filters at Climeworks' Mammoth carbon removal plant on May 24, 2024, in Reykjavik, Iceland. (John Moore/Getty Images) (John Moore via Getty Images)\n\nTech buys into carbon removal\n\nAlthough the number of companies making net-zero commitments has continued to grow, so have overall global emissions. And emerging technologies are making achieving those commitments more difficult.\n\nThe scale and speed of data processing needed for AI technology require so much energy that the International Energy Agency recently warned that consumption from data centers, AI, and the cryptocurrency sector could double by 2026.\n\nThat realization has led to a surge in investments in carbon removal startups. Direct air capture firms and those utilizing nature-based carbon removal methods raised more than $1 billion combined in 2023, according to PitchBook data. The number of carbon removal credits sold jumped more than 650% from the previous year, according to CDR.fyi.\n\nThe energy, manufacturing, and transportation sectors are leading those investments, but some of the biggest tech companies in the world are also investing in carbon removal to tackle emissions.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT), a key player in the AI race, is one of the largest buyers, with more than 7.6 million purchases of carbon credits since 2020.\n\nThe company has already seen its carbon emissions jump 30% from 2020, according to its sustainability report. Four years ago, the company set out to become carbon-negative by the end of the decade, calling it the company’s moonshot. Microsoft CEO Brad Smith speaks at the Mobile World Congress (MWC) on Feb. 26, 2024, in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain. (Kike Rincon/Europa Press via Getty Images) (Europa Press News via Getty Images)\n\nIn a recent interview with Bloomberg, Microsoft president Brad Smith admitted the goal would be harder to reach with the company’s AI ambitions.\n\n“In many ways, the moon is five times as far away as it was in 2020, if you think of our own forecast for the expansion of AI and its electrical needs,” he said.\n\nChallenges in the fledgling market\n\nWhile carbon credits have largely been limited to voluntary markets, companies are planning for the increasing possibility of regulation mandating purchases to reach net-zero goals. The problem is that demand is expected to outstrip supply, even with hundreds of startups working to remove carbon on behalf of emitting companies.\n\nBCG analysis estimates an annual demand for durable carbon dioxide removal (CDR) to reach 40 million to 200 million tons of CO2 by the end of this decade. Supply is projected to be 15 million-32 million tons.\n\nCompanies are looking to get ahead of that crunch by investing in nascent technologies with clear processes for monitoring, reporting, and verifying the quality of carbon removed.\n\nHowever, impact is still hard to quantify, depending on the removal process. Companies that offer what is considered some of the highest-integrity offsets remain among the most expensive, largely because the technology has not scaled.\n\n“If you want someone to buy a CDR offset or a carbon offset, you want them to feel good that they actually bought what they said they did,” Mistry said. Saplings grown at the nursery of the nonprofit environmental group Rioterra, await planting to restore areas of a nearby rainforest in Itapua do Oeste, Brazil, Feb. 18, 2020. (REUTERS/Alexandre Meneghini) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nDirect air capture (DAC) has the simplest measuring system, according to Mistry, whose firm has invested in a handful of DAC companies, including Climeworks. But it requires building large factories that can suck carbon dioxide out of the air, and it costs $600 to $1000 to capture a ton of carbon.\n\nMethods that rely on agricultural waste are considered cheaper, but they require a lot of land. Planting trees may be among the most economical, but Mistry argues that carbon storage isn’t as permanent.\n\n“You can estimate how much carbon is in the tree, but there are questions like, what happens if it gets cut down? What happens if there’s a forest fire?” Mistry said.\n\nThese questions over credibility have hampered the market recently, with studies showing that many carbon offsets haven't led to the kind of carbon removal they promised.\n\nHowever, the carbon market did receive a vote of support from the Biden administration last Tuesday when it unveiled a framework for using voluntary carbon offsets, an admission that the country will not achieve its net-zero goal by 2050 through emissions reductions alone.\n\n“​​We need to use all the tools at our disposal — creatively, thoughtfully, and at scale,” said Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, praising the role of carbon removal technology in helping companies achieve their climate goals. Still, she stressed, “Corporate buyers should prioritize reducing their own emissions, particularly through transition planning.”\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market.\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaire Ray Dalio Just Bought These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Tracking what billionaire hedge fund managers are doing is a great way to get ideas for your portfolio. Most of the time, they have a proven track record, but you need to make sure they're buying stocks for reasons similar to yours. Otherwise, you may get stuck holding a stock with strong short-term movements but a poor long-term outlook.\n\nBridgewater Associates, run by Ray Dalio, is a massive hedge fund with nearly $175 billion in assets under management. In Q1, it bought many stocks, but among its biggest buys were companies related to artificial intelligence (AI). With AI being such a broad field, looking at what billionaires are buying is a great way to double-check yourself, and you might even find a new idea.\n\nMaking a massive bet on AI proliferation\n\nIn Q1, Bridgewater Associates increased its positions in the following stocks:\n\nCompany Current Percentage of Portfolio Previous Percentage of Portfolio Alphabet 4.1% 1.6% Nvidia 3.2% 0.7% Meta Platforms 2.4% 1.3% Microsoft 1.2% 0.4% Amazon 1% 0%\n\nData source: WhaleWisdom.\n\nThat's a sizable increase in many of the biggest AI players, pointing to Ray Dalio's belief that AI will be a massive growth catalyst for these stocks. So far, he's been right, as these stocks have had a phenomenal performance in 2024.\n\nHowever, information about which stocks these billionaires have been buying isn't available to the public until 45 days after Q1 ended, so we're dealing with two-month-old information right now. So, are these five still worth buying at today's prices?\n\nThese AI stocks are great picks for all investors\n\nStarting with the biggest of these positions, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Bridgewater has made it the third-largest investment overall in his portfolio. This is a turnaround in sentiment, as many believed Alphabet was losing the AI arms race until a few months ago. While it stumbled out of the gate, its latest AI releases have been positively received, and its generative AI model, Gemini, is emerging as a top pick in the space.\n\nThis has ignited a run-up in the stock, with Alphabet rising nearly 20% since Q1 ended. Despite its rise, Alphabet remains attractively priced at 23 times forward earnings, making it a strong buy now.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the king of AI hardware, is a much harder stock to assess. It recently reported earnings for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended April 28) and saw revenue rise a jaw-dropping 262%. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis rise was fueled by the massive demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) used in data centers to train AI models. Nvidia has been one of the index's best performers for two years straight, but this massive growth makes the stock hard to assess.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, Nvidia trades at 42 times forward earnings, making it quite expensive. However, this premium may be worth it if the AI demand persists for many years. Nvidia is a very tough stock to assess, and I wouldn't fault investors for passing it over right now.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is similar to Alphabet because most of its revenue comes from advertising. With dominant properties like Facebook and Instagram under its roof, it generates a lot of money from advertising. However, Meta has also been making substantial AI investments in developing its own generative AI models that are suitable for its uses.\n\nIt has integrated its AI model into these platforms and can help create content or understand something about a post. While these technologies have monetizable uses, their primary use right now is to solidify Meta's place as a company with top-tier social media platforms. At 24 times forward earnings, it's a great stock to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-powered products into its primary offerings. Its Copilot is already integrated into the Microsoft Office suite of products (if you pay the subscription fee) and provides impressive productivity increases. Microsoft also has a strong cloud computing business in Azure, and this division is seeing incredible growth as companies scramble to increase their computing power to create their own in-house AI models. While Microsoft is seeing great success as a business, it's a very expensive stock. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 36 times forward earnings, it's not far off from Nvidia's valuation despite much slower growth levels. Due to Microsoft's price, I'll take a pass on the stock for now.\n\nLastly, there is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a company that many may not see as an AI investment. While most of Amazon's revenue comes from its commerce-related business, 62% of its operating income comes from its cloud computing division, which is benefiting from the same trends as Microsoft Azure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the largest chunk of the cloud computing market share and is growing revenue at a healthy 17% year-over-year pace.\n\nOverall, Amazon is thriving right now, with sales climbing 13% and earnings per share dramatically rising from $0.31 last year to $0.98. Amazon is another tricky company to value, as it's still working on maximizing its profitability. Although it trades around 40 times forward earnings, I think it's a fair price to pay because Amazon is still enacting many margin-boosting measures.\n\nOverall, Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates' investments in Q1 are great picks. Although investors shouldn't blindly follow them into these buys, I think these stocks are a great starting point when searching for top-notch investment ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average jumped on Friday, marking its best session of the year, as investors closed a strong month after the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation measure met expectations.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow rose 574.84 points, or 1.51%, to 38,686.32, driven by gains in Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and UnitedHealth (NYSE:UNH), which advanced 7.5% and 2.8%, respectively. The S&P 500 added 0.80% to 5,277.51, while the Nasdaq Composite edged lower by 0.01% to 16,735.02, impacted by declines in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and other mega-cap technology stocks.\n\nThe S&P 500 and Nasdaq ended five-week win streaks with drops of 0.51% and 1.1%, respectively. The Dow slipped 0.98%, marking its second consecutive week of losses.\n\nDespite the challenging week, May was a positive month for equities, with all major benchmarks recording gains for the sixth time in seven months. The Dow increased by 2.3% in May, while the S&P 500 rose 4.8%. The Nasdaq saw a 6.88% gain marking its best month since November.\n\nLooking ahead to this week, the biggest economic event will be the Friday release of the May jobs data. JPMorgan economists said they expect a small step down from last month, and estimate that nonfarm payrolls increased by 150,000 last month, with the unemployment rate steady at 3.9%.\n\n“If realized, this pace of growth, although solid on its own, will indicate a gradual cooling in the establishment survey,” economists wrote.\n\n“The April JOLTS release should also point to modest further cooling in labor demand,” they added.\n\nOther key macro events this week is also the ISM manufacturing PMI, set to be released on Monday.\n\nInvestors await Lululemon, Ciena earnings reports\n\nThe bulk of the Q1 earnings season is over, with only a few companies left to report their financial performance for this period.\n\nThis week, several earnings reports will be in the limelight, most notably those by Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) and Ciena Corp (NYSE:CIEN). Analysts expect Lululemon to report earnings of $2.38 per share, reflecting a 4.4% year-over-year increase, with revenue projected at $2.2 billion, up 10% YoY.\n\nFor Ciena's fiscal Q2 results, which are due after Thursday's close, industry analysts anticipate earnings of 15 cents per share, a decline of 79.7% year-over-year, on revenue of $894.9 million, down 20.8% YoY.\n\nOther noteworthy earnings reports that will come out in the coming days include Bath&Body Works (NYSE:BBWI), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR), and Nio (NYSE:NIO), among others.\n\nWhat analysts are saying about US stocks\n\nBank of America: “Bad news has been good news for equities over the past two months (-78% correlation between the S&P 500 and USD), but if growth deteriorates too much, bad news can turn into bad news. We believe the goldilocks range for NFP is +125-175K, which would maintain the unemployment rate largely unchanged assuming labor supply growth remains at or above today’s level. Sub-125K gains in NFP could increase the risk of triggering the Sahm Rule*, reviving recession fears in the market. As long as inflation remains in check, stronger growth should also be positive for stocks.”\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs: “Currently the Magnificent 7 account for 13% of hedge fund long portfolio and 19% of the average large-cap core mutual fund portfolio, both shares roughly flat vs. last quarter (Exhibit 2). For reference, the seven stocks composed 25% of the market cap of the Russell 3000 index at the end of 1Q. At the stock level, hedge funds added to AAPL but trimmed positions on net in GOOGL, AMZN, NVDA, MSFT, and META (NASDAQ:META) in 1Q. Furthermore, all of these stocks except TSLA remain at the top of our Hedge Fund VIP list. Mutual funds reduced positions in each of the Magnificent 7 in 1Q, led by MSFT, with 25% of funds in our sample cutting their exposure to the stock.”\n\nJefferies: “US market remains expensive on both PE and PE/G basis. Broadly, the market is pricing a goldilocks environment, expecting Fed to cut rates while the economy continues to thrive, thus supporting the corporate earnings. Amid the stretched valuations, focus on sustainable earnings becomes even more important.”\n\nRBC Capital Markets: “Valuations are already favorable for the broader market ex the top 10 S&P 500 names, so the driver will need to be something else. Our work suggests that the 10-year yield needs to stop rising, the market needs more clarity and certainty around the path of monetary policy and the timing of cuts, earnings trends need improve for the broader market such that they look better than the biggest growth names, and economic excitement needs to return. The trigger for a renewal of the rotation trade may also come from positioning. CFTC data suggests that the large-cap growth trade is no longer frothy. But it also doesn’t look washed out suggesting overbought conditions could return rather quickly to this corner of the market.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFew AI deepfakes identified in EU elections, Microsoft president says\n\nGameStop soars as 'Roaring Kitty' reveals $116 million bet in Reddit post\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in June",
        "content": "Most people who are faced with making a big decision want to know their options first. But when there are many options, the decision-making process can still be overwhelming.\n\nI suspect some investors could have this feeling in choosing which artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy. While there are lots of good alternatives, I think a few rise to the top. Here are three magnificent AI stocks to buy in June.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe adjective \"magnificent\" definitely applies to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker have skyrocketed roughly 180% over the last 12 months and have delivered a jaw-dropping gain of more than 24x over the last 10 years. Nvidia is the fastest-rising member by far of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nHowever, what Nvidia has done in the past isn't as important as what it could do in the future. The company's amazing growth story isn't going to end anytime soon. Tech companies continue to buy Nvidia's AI chips as fast as they can get their hands on them.\n\nNvidia plans to launch its new Blackwell GPU platform later this year. Blackwell will be the most powerful AI architecture ever. Unsurprisingly, the demand for Blackwell already outstrips the anticipated supply.\n\nYes, Nvidia trades at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 65. I've been leery of the stock's valuation at times, but growth puts high earnings multiples into a different context. And Nvidia is poised to continue delivering stunningly strong growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another Magnificent Seven stock that's been a big winner, thanks in part to its AI initiatives. Its shares have soared around 45% over the last 12 months, and Amazon has also been an 11-bagger over the last decade.\n\nI expect Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI explosion. It's already the biggest cloud services provider. In my view, AWS' approach of making multiple large language models (LLMs) and AI tools available to its customers is a smart strategy. While AWS is a major customer for Nvidia (and will be among the first to get Blackwell), the cloud unit also offers its own custom, cost-effective AI chips for training and inference.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's opportunities to use AI internally. The company is laser-focused on boosting profitability, as evidenced by its earnings jumping 225% year over year in the first quarter. CFO Brian Olsavsky said in Amazon's April earnings call that it's investing in technologies, including automation and robotics, to reduce costs further.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI isn't the only reason to buy Amazon stock, though. Amazon has multiple growth drivers, including advertising, expansion into healthcare, and its forthcoming Kuiper satellite internet service.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the smallest company of these three (and the next-to-smallest among the Magnificent Seven) with a market cap of \"only\" around $1.17 trillion. However, Meta has been a monster stock over the last 12 months, with a gain of over 75%.\n\nI like Meta largely because of its valuation. The stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.08, lower than all the other Magnificent Seven members. But can Meta deliver on the growth projections baked into that metric? I think so.\n\nThe company has great opportunities to use AI to increase the monetization of its video and messaging features, including Reels and WhatsApp. It's also working hard to engage users to enhance the value of its platform to advertisers.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg believes it's \"quite possible that smart glasses that have AI assistants built in will be the killer app.\" He thinks AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of Meta's business. Zuckerberg is also committed to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meta doesn't have to succeed on all fronts, though, to deliver exceptional long-term returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "This Undervalued Stock Could Join Nvidia in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "The past 18 months have been quite a ride for many of the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. And no Mag Seven stock has garnered as many eyeballs as AI chipmaker Nvidia, which has surged over 900% since Oct. 1, 2022, to reach a market cap of $2.7 trillion.\n\nBut right now, this other Magnificent Seven stock seems like the best value of the bunch. Moreover, its unheralded AI prospects could catapult it into the $2 trillion club, nearly doubling its current value of $1.1 trillion.\n\nMeta's big investments draw ire but could pay off big\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) saw its stock sell off after its first-quarter earnings report. But the sell-off may have been due more to outsized expectations than anything else. After all, the stock had surged 40% for the year, even before the Q1 release.\n\nWhile revenue and earnings per share beat expectations, investors were apparently unnerved by a big increase in the company's outlook for capital expenditures. Management now expects $35 billion to $40 billion in capital expenditures this year, up from the previous guidance of $30 billion to $37 billion. Not only that, management also stated in the press release that \"we expect capital expenditures will continue to increase next year as we invest aggressively to support our ambitious AI research and product development efforts.\"\n\nWhile near-term-oriented investors might have cringed at Meta going on another spending binge, long-term investors should be cheering. After all, Meta has historically gone through investment cycles, and those investments have usually paid off eventually.\n\nMeta's AI ambitions benefit its core platforms now and going forward\n\nIt should be noted that Meta has already benefited handsomely from artificial intelligence (AI). Its graphics processing unit (GPU) investments since 2022 helped increase engagement, maintaining mid- to high-single-digit user growth -- no small feat, given Meta's massive 3.24 billion global user base.\n\nFurthermore, its AI offerings have increased engagement for new products, like Reels, which has fended off formidable competitor TikTok. AI has also enabled advertising customers to not only create and test ads without having to go through a studio but also more precisely target those ads. Solid 7% user growth and better monetization resulted in an impressive 27% revenue growth last quarter.\n\nLast week, Meta even announced it's seeing younger people flock back to the Facebook platform. In recent years, younger people have flocked to Meta's Instagram or competitor TikTok, as the Facebook platform came to be seen as a platform for an older generation.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, on Friday, Meta stated that the core Facebook platform had seen five quarters of healthy growth in its 18-29 age cohort and that over 40 million 18-29-year-olds now use Facebook in the U.S. and Canada, the highest total in three years. The U.S. and Canada are Meta's highest-revenue geographies, so to see the younger generation flocking back to the core Facebook app is a big positive and proof point that Facebook's AI-fueled engagement investments are working. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut Meta's AI ambitions go beyond its platforms\n\nMeta is one of the few tech companies that can afford to invest in building generative AI models, and Meta management is seizing the opportunity with its Llama line of models. Unlike competitors, Llama is differentiated by being open-source, meaning outside developers can contribute to it, perhaps giving Llama a leg up on the competition. Furthermore, Meta can obviously use its troves of user data to support its models, honing Llama in ways competitors might be unable to match.\n\nOn a recent conference call with analysts, CEO Mark Zuckerberg noted that Llama's 8-billion and 70-billion parameter models had achieved \"best-in-class\" performance for their scale. A newer 400-billion parameter model is on the way, which should go toe-to-toe with OpenAI's ChatGPT and other major large language models (LLMs).\n\nZuckerberg also explained how the Llama model and Meta AI services could be monetized in the future, citing business messaging (essentially replacing customer service reps), introducing ads into AI interactions (right up Meta's alley), or charging directly for access to Meta's most advanced Llama models and computing power.\n\nWhile Meta isn't making much at all from Llama today, Zuckerberg urged investors to think long-term:\n\nWe've historically seen a lot of volatility in our stock during this phase of our product playbook ‐‐ where we're investing in scaling a new product but aren't yet monetizing it. We saw this with Reels, Stories, as News Feed transitioned to mobile and more. And I also expect to see a multi‐year investment cycle before we've fully scaled Meta AI, business AIs, and more into the profitable services I expect as well. Historically, investing to build these new scaled experiences in our apps has been a very good long term investment for us and for investors who have stuck with us.\n\nAnd don't forget Reality Labs\n\nOf course, Meta doesn't just have one large profitless investment happening today. It has two. While the AI conversation has sucked a lot of oxygen out of the room, Meta is also still aggressively investing in the Metaverse offerings it began several years ago.\n\nZuckerberg still believes that Meta's first-mover status in the Metaverse will reap benefits, though perhaps not until the end of this decade as the technology improves. But today, the company makes very little revenue from the Reality Labs Metaverse segment while losing billions every quarter. Last quarter, Reality Labs lost a whopping $3.85 billion.\n\nHow Meta could rocket to $2 trillion\n\nWhen valuing Meta, I try to look at its current core platform alone, stripping out Metaverse losses. Over the past four quarters, the core Family of Apps generated a whopping $69.3 billion in operating income. Slap on a 20% tax rate, and the core business is currently running at a net earnings run rate of around $55 billion.\n\nAnd keep in mind, the core business is no slouch when it comes to growth, as earnings before interest and taxes (EBIT) were up a whopping 57% over the past year. While the prior year was a \"down\" year amid a tough economy, it's not a stretch to think Meta can grow Family of Apps earnings at a 10%-20% rate over the medium term.\n\nA $2 trillion valuation would be only 36 times the current run rate of the core business. That's not cheap, but certainly not a crazy valuation for a wide-moat business with those types of growth prospects. In fact, that's the valuation of Mag Seven peer Microsoft, which grew revenue by 17% last quarter and currently trades at 36 times earnings.\n\nSo, really, the current core business could theoretically be valued at $2 trillion by itself. And if one assumes Reality Labs has some future business that gives it a breakeven net present value, which is conservative and would essentially amount to a failure, that leaves the Meta AI services that aren't monetized yet.\n\nGiven the tremendous potential for AI services and the promising development of Llama, it's pretty easy to see how future Meta AI services could become a huge business valued in the hundreds of billions. That alone could catapult Meta's valuation well beyond $2 trillion, making Meta look like the best bet of the Mag Seven today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Buyback Titans That Could Help Set You Up for Life",
        "content": "There's a simple motto that sums up how to invest: Buy low, sell high. It sounds easy, but it's more difficult in practice.\n\nHowever, there are ways for investors to maximize their chances of buying low and selling high. One is to hold onto investments for a long time, thus giving the power of compounding more time to work its magic.\n\nAnother way is to identify and invest in companies that repurchase a lot of their own shares. Here I'll cover three such companies, and explain why those share buybacks are so useful for investors. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nFirstup is MetaPlatforms (NASDAQ: META). Thanks to the company's enormous share of the fast-growing digital advertising market, Meta has quickly become a cash-printing machine.\n\nIn its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), Meta generated $12.5 billion in free cash flow. This river of cash enabled the company to return value to shareholders through share buybacks (totaling $14.6 billion in the quarter) and, for the first time ever, a quarterly dividend payment of $0.50/share. Granted, the payouts (share buybacks and dividends) exceeded the company's free cash flow, but the company's massive cash reserves of $58 billion easily covered the deficit.\n\nIn any event, Meta reduced its overall shares outstanding by 11% over the last five years. That's great news for investors, because as the number of outstanding shares decreases, the value of each remaining share increases. And that's the beauty of stock buybacks: They can provide a boost to share prices.\n\nMeta has one of Wall Street's biggest share buyback programs, and its 11% reduction in outstanding shares is impressive, but it's not the largest reduction on this list. That honor goes to a travel website operator.\n\nBooking Holdings\n\nIt might come as a surprise, but when it comes to stock buybacks, BookingHoldings(NASDAQ: BKNG) is a giant.\n\nGranted, the overall amount of its buybacks is less than that of much larger companies like Apple, Meta Platforms, or ExxonMobil. However, on a percentage basis, the company tops the list. BKNG Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nOver the last five years, Booking Holdings reduced its overall shares outstanding by almost 21%. The company repurchased about $26 billion worth of its shares, which is astonishing for a company with a market cap of only $128 billion.\n\nThe result has been fantastic for investors. Shares are up 120% over the last five years, even after accounting for the lackluster pandemic-influenced years between 2020 and 2022.\n\nAlphabet\n\nFinally, there's Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG). Similar to fellow digital advertising giant Meta Platforms, Alphabet generates a ton of cash thanks to its lucrative suite of Google advertising businesses (Google Search, YouTube, and Google Network).\n\nStory continues\n\nIndeed, in its most recent quarter (the three months ending on March 31, 2024), the company's Google advertising segment generated $61.7 billion in revenue. Overall, the company's quarterly revenue increased 15% year-over-year to $80.5 billion. Net income increased to $23.7 billion.\n\nIn turn, the company announced its first-ever dividend payment of $0.20 per share; it also enlarged its share repurchase program to $70 billion.\n\nAll in all, Alphabet has reduced its total shares outstanding by more than 1.5 billion shares, or 11%, over the last five years. GOOG Shares Outstanding Chart\n\nInvestors should remember that companies that prioritize a long-term strategy of stock buybacks are often smart investments, as the reduction in outstanding shares drives higher prices as the overall supply of shares shrinks. In turn, that can help investors buy low and sell high, which is the ultimate goal on Wall Street.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

According to Piper Sandler’s latest Taking Stock with Teens survey, just 32% of teens use Facebook each month compared to 80% who use Instagram and 72% who access TikTok.\n\nBut according to Alison, Facebook is a match for users in their late teens and 20s who are navigating various life changes.\n\n“As we were doing a lot of research we saw, for example, when somebody's moving to their first apartment, they're already going to [Facebook] Marketplace. And then they're … often joining a group in their new college to meet new people,” Alison said.\n\n“And we realized, well, a lot of this kind of stuff is already happening on Facebook. We just need to do a really good job bringing it together.” (Photo illustration by Jonathan Raa/NurPhoto via Getty Images) (NurPhoto via Getty Images)\n\nPart of that process has included enticing creators to join the platform by improving both its video efforts via its short-form video platform Reels and its search function.\n\nThe strategy seems to be working so far. According to Alison, Facebook has been growing in the US for several quarters and year-over-year with young adults. What’s more, people spend 60% of their time on Facebook watching videos.\n\nFacebook took a rare hit after user numbers declined in Q2 2022 from 2.936 billion monthly active users to 2.934 billion, eliciting predictions that the platform was on a downward trajectory. Since then, however, the social network has grown each quarter from Q3 2022 through Q4 2023. The company didn't report monthly active Facebook users in its latest quarterly report.\n\nAlison says his team was initially concerned that the updates to the platform could alienate the older users the social network has become associated with.\n\nThe group, however, has largely taken to the feature improvements, as have the Millennials who first joined the social network when it launched in 2014.\n\n“I do think Facebook has had a unique staying power, because we've always been willing to change,” Alison said.\n\nStory continues Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Meta Platforms' (NASDAQ:META) investors will be pleased with their impressive 170% return over the last five years",
        "content": "The worst result, after buying shares in a company (assuming no leverage), would be if you lose all the money you put in. But on the bright side, you can make far more than 100% on a really good stock. For instance, the price of Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META) stock is up an impressive 169% over the last five years. The last week saw the share price soften some 2.4%.\n\nNow it's worth having a look at the company's fundamentals too, because that will help us determine if the long term shareholder return has matched the performance of the underlying business.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Meta Platforms\n\nIn his essay The Superinvestors of Graham-and-Doddsville Warren Buffett described how share prices do not always rationally reflect the value of a business. By comparing earnings per share (EPS) and share price changes over time, we can get a feel for how investor attitudes to a company have morphed over time.\n\nDuring five years of share price growth, Meta Platforms achieved compound earnings per share (EPS) growth of 22% per year. That makes the EPS growth particularly close to the yearly share price growth of 22%. This indicates that investor sentiment towards the company has not changed a great deal. In fact, the share price seems to largely reflect the EPS growth.\n\nYou can see below how EPS has changed over time (discover the exact values by clicking on the image). earnings-per-share-growth\n\nWe know that Meta Platforms has improved its bottom line lately, but is it going to grow revenue? Check if analysts think Meta Platforms will grow revenue in the future.\n\nA Different Perspective\n\nIt's good to see that Meta Platforms has rewarded shareholders with a total shareholder return of 71% in the last twelve months. That's including the dividend. That gain is better than the annual TSR over five years, which is 22%. Therefore it seems like sentiment around the company has been positive lately. Someone with an optimistic perspective could view the recent improvement in TSR as indicating that the business itself is getting better with time. It's always interesting to track share price performance over the longer term. But to understand Meta Platforms better, we need to consider many other factors. For example, we've discovered 1 warning sign for Meta Platforms that you should be aware of before investing here.\n\nOf course, you might find a fantastic investment by looking elsewhere. So take a peek at this freelist of companies we expect will grow earnings.\n\nPlease note, the market returns quoted in this article reflect the market weighted average returns of stocks that currently trade on American exchanges.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "3 Sorry Tech Stocks to Sell While You Still Can",
        "content": "In reality, many tech companies don’t have deep pockets. And in a higher interest rate situation, this becomes even more important. Although it seems the Fed will be forced to cut rates, latest FOMC minutes make future rate cuts less likely.\n\nTo make sure the inflation doesn’t take off again, the Federal Reserve remains in the restrictive monetary zone. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) forecasts that rate cuts may be off the table until December. In turn, the economic pressure will not be lessened at a time when 43% of small businesses couldn’t fully pay their rent in April, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis market dynamic doesn’t bode well for tech stocks that have yet to reach profitability. With that scenario on the horizon, investors might consider selling these tech stocks to mitigate risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap Inc. (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nDespite owning the popular app Snapchat, Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP) has yet to deliver a positive net income period. The single quarterly exception was at the end of 2021 at only $23 million. This failure to sustainably monetize is similar to other social tech companies like Reddit (NYSE:RDDT). And, it positions them among tech stocks to sell due to uncertain profitability.\n\nThe bulk of Snap’s revenue comes from advertising owing to free Snapchat, which had 422 million daily active users in Q1 of 2024. However, both the user and revenue growth are not direct roads to Snap’s profitability. The company reported 21% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q1 of 2024 at $1.19 billion. However, it suffered a net loss of $305 million.\n\nAlthough that is lower than the $329 million net loss a year ago, Snap’s free cash flow took a dive to $38 million from $103 million in Q1 of 2023. On the upside, the company has zero debt maturing during 2024. This is helpful, given the elevated interest rate climate. But direct competition from Meta’s Instagram makes it less likely for a profitability liftoff.\n\nIn addition to profitability issues, Snapchat’s user growth seems to be plateauing from the high early growth in the 2010s, a similar trend to Twitter. SNAP stock is down 10% year-to-date (YTD) at $15 per share, down from its 52-week high of $17.90. And, it’s far below its all-time high of $83.11 in September 2021.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo acquire a large piece of the retail trading pie, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) had to employ many shortcuts. Although having popularized zero commission trading, other fintech companies adopted the model. Robinhood’s core revenue generator, payment for order flow (PFOF), made this model viable despite causing controversy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt relies heavily on subscription services and interest on cash. So, in a hard landing scenario, HOOD would feel the brunt along with the U.S. stock market. Moreover, Robinhood’s profitable quarters are far in between. The latest Q1 of 2024 earnings showed one of the rare exceptions, with $157 million net income compared to a $511 million net loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\nFurther, HOOD performance of 65% YTD at $20.45 per share would position the stock for a solid exit point. The present price is close to its 52-week high of $21.21 while far above its 52-week low of $7.91 per share.\n\nSnowflake Inc. (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being a high growth (by revenue) cloud computing stock, Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been racking one quarterly net loss after another. The company’s total addressable market for storage and scaled computing is large. In fact, it’s estimated to grow at a CAGR of 17.8% by 2032.\n\nIn a regular market environment, this would make Snowflake Inc. an outstanding proposition. However, when the interest rate dynamic is combined with heavy weight competition coming from Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, the prospect is less appealing.\n\nIn fact, SNOW as a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, relies on these Big Tech companies to provide the physical datacenter infrastructure. Presently, Snowflake Inc. also relies on future growth expectations in which investors fund ongoing quarterly losses.\n\nFor fiscal Q1 of 2025, the company reported 33% YOY revenue growth to $828.7 million. Yet, the company’s net loss increased to $316.9 million from $225.6 net loss in a year-ago quarter. Ultimately, investor’s exposure to cloud stock is safer in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or cloud-adjacent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nYear-to-date, SNOW is down 17% at $156.16 per share. This is sandwiched between the 52-week high of $237.72 and the 52-week low of $138.40, making for another solid exit point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy ASAP Before the TikTok Ban Sends Them Soaring",
        "content": "The U.S. is considering a ban on TikTok, and has given Bytedance, parent of the popular China-based app. time to either sell it to U.S.-based companies or risk being banned in the U.S. in the coming months. While TikTok is taking a legal approach to fighting that decision, I believe foreign policy issues will likely triumph over any First Amendment concerns by TikTok.\n\nThis ban could lead to a huge change in the social media space. There are many companies trying to compete with TikTok, but most have failed to steal much market share away from the company as its algorithm is by far the most efficient right now. The company has said it won’t sell, mainly due to its desire to keep the algorithm a secret. Accordingly, a ban on TikTok could lead to many of its competitors booming in the coming years.\n\nHere are three stocks to buy if you think a TikTok ban is more likely than not.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap (SNAP) An apple iPhone showing the snapchat application alongside other snapchat logos. SNAP stock.\n\nSource: Ink Drop / Shutterstock.com\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP) operates the popular social media app Snapchat. I believe Snap is a compelling buy right now, trading at a bargain valuation, despite showing strong signs of a turnaround. In Q1, Snap’s revenue surged 21% year-over-year to $1.19 billion, a major acceleration from the prior quarter. Even without the ban, the company’s trailing twelve month EBIT is expected to surge going forward. Snapchat TTM EBIT\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRegardless, Snapchat’s massive Gen Z user base of over 422 million could explode higher if rival TikTok gets banned in the U.S. With 75% market penetration among 13-34 year olds in over 25 countries, Snap would be a prime beneficiary of TikTok refugees flocking to other social media platforms.\n\nThe company’s management team is making smart moves to improve profitability, with a new ad platform driving over 75% growth in purchase-related conversions. Progress with small business advertisers is also encouraging.\n\nWhile Snap still faces challenges, the stock is too cheap to ignore here. I think the upside is tremendous if Snap can continue executing well and if TikTok’s potential demise funnels more users and ad dollars Snap’s way. This beaten-down social media play could be ready to surge.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) operates a family of social media and communication apps. I believe Meta stock has significant upside potential if TikTok gets fully banned in the US. While Facebook’s younger user base has declined, the app’s overall user base has resumed growth, and Facebook remains the company’s cash cow. However, Instagram would likely be the biggest winner from a TikTok ban.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn Q1, Meta reported that over 3.2 billion people use at least one of its apps daily, with “healthy growth” in the U.S. WhatsApp’s U.S. momentum is also gaining steam. Meta’s “Family of Apps” already generates billions in profits, allowing the company to initiate a dividend that seems poised to increase alongside steady cash flow growth.\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nMeanwhile, Meta is making notable AI strides. Its latest model, Llama 3, powers an enhanced version of its Meta AI assistant. CEO Mark Zuckerberg said tens of millions have tried the new Meta AI, with very positive feedback. As these AI investments bear fruit, Meta’s growth and profitability should benefit. The stock looks attractively-valued based on its sturdy cash flow profile.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) An image showing the front of the Google Headquarters in California.\n\nSource: turtix / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) owns Google, the world’s dominant search engine, and YouTube, the top global video platform. The company posted 15.4% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1. CEO Sundar Pichai emphasized Google’s rapid progress in AI, a key driver of this impressive performance. Alphabet has been consolidating its leading AI teams under Google DeepMind. With the company’s unrivaled computing infrastructure and the rollout of powerful new AI models like Gemini 1.5 Pro, I believe concerns about Google losing its search crown are overblown.\n\nHowever, the biggest near-term potential catalyst is the looming TikTok ban. YouTube is already hugely popular, and YouTube Shorts would be the natural alternative for TikTok refugees seeking their short-video fix. Pichai noted that YouTube+Cloud is on track to hit a $100 billion annual run rate. Strategic moves like banning ad-blockers will further boost ad revenue and Premium subscriptions.\n\nIf a TikTok ban materializes, I expect an explosion in YouTube revenue and profits. With search stable and YouTube poised to surge, Alphabet stock looks very attractive here for both growth and safety.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 S&amp;P 500 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying Now",
        "content": "The S&P 500 recently notched a new all-time high, which may give investors some hesitancy to enter the market. This is understandable, as nobody wants to buy at a high. However, investors also must realize that the only way the market gets to new heights is to continuously set new closing records. While I understand wanting to buy cheaper, missing out on massive bull runs waiting for a pullback can harm returns.\n\nPart of the reason for new all-time highs is investor excitement in artificial intelligence (AI). The big tech firms all have many irons in the AI fire and are a big reason for the index's new record high. Despite the S&P 500 being at a high, these three AI stocks I've pinpointed have the potential to increase even more.\n\n1. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) is the parent company of Google, YouTube, and many other brands. While the company's primary business is advertising, it also offers other businesses like cloud computing and a growing AI toolkit.\n\nAlthough it stumbled out of the gate when companies like OpenAI released ChatGPT to the public in late 2022, it's doing much better now. Recently, Alphabet rolled out a generative AI feature to its Google search engine that summarizes the topics you search for. While this isn't necessarily a new moneymaker for Alphabet, it solidifies itself as a top option against other search engines that have integrated generative AI.\n\nAlphabet is also succeeding as a business, with revenue growing 156% year over year in the first quarter and earnings per share (EPS) rising from $1.17 to $1.89. Alphabet also initiated a small dividend to pay investors with its excess cash flow while adding an additional $70 billion in stock repurchase authorization.\n\nAlphabet remains a top buy in the S&P 500 due to its strong growth and shareholder-friendly capital return programs. With the stock only trading at 23.4 times forward earnings compared to the S&P 500's 21.5, it only trades at a slight premium to the broader index, which indicates the stock isn't overpriced at its current levels.\n\n2. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) and Alphabet are similar businesses that rely mostly on advertising revenue to keep the lights on. They're also similarly priced compared to the market, with Meta trading at 24 times forward earnings.\n\nMeta's advertising revenue comes from its social media platforms: Facebook, Instagram, Threads, Messenger, and WhatsApp. These sites have been cash cows for Meta, and their strength shined in Q1. In Q1, Meta's revenue rose 27% year over year, with EPS more than doubling to $4.71. Those strong results solidify Meta's social media platforms as a place the consumer wants to be. As a result, advertisers also go there due to the large number of people who use them.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough its Reality Labs division, the segment that makes virtual reality headsets and other exploratory technologies, doesn't make any profits, it does have exciting products like the smart glasses it collaborated with Ray-Ban to make. This is one of the first products to put generative AI in the hands of consumers in a practical way outside of an internet browser and could be a product that leads to something far more mainstream.\n\nMeta is succeeding in its primary business, but with other AI products in the works, it has a ton of upside.\n\n3. Taiwan Semiconductor\n\nLast is Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM), a company that makes all things AI possible. Taiwan Semiconductor is a contract chip manufacturer that makes the semiconductors that go into hardware used to make AI models.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor's customer base ranges from Nvidia to Qualcomm to Apple, and it has earned that business by consistently having best-in-class technology. Right now, that's 3nm (nanometer) chips, but management stated on its Q1 conference call that its 2nm design (available in 2025) is already seeing far more demand from its customer base.\n\nManagement also believes its AI chips will be a significant source of growth in the coming years. It expects its AI-related business to grow at a 50% compound annual growth rate for five years, reaching 20% of its total revenue by 2028. This performance will help fuel management's broader 15% to 20% overall compound annual revenue growth projection -- a strong projection from a sizable company.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor is the most expensive stock of the trio at 25 times earnings, but its importance in the rollout of high technology cannot be understated, which is why it has performed so well this year. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nWithout Taiwan Semiconductor, none of the AI technologies we experience today would be possible. As a result, it's a fantastic stock to buy and hold on to for years to come.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "4 Unforgettable Growth Stocks You'll Regret Not Buying in the New Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "For the first four years of this decade, Wall Street was nothing short of a seesaw. In successive years, all three major stock indexes oscillated between bear and bull markets, with the growth-powered Nasdaq Composite(NASDAQINDEX: ^IXIC) taking the brunt of this volatility.\n\nBut after losing 33% of its value during the 2022 bear market, the Nasdaq Composite has been off to the races over the last 17 months. Since the green flag waved in 2023, the Nasdaq Composite has gained 60% and rocketed to fresh record-closing highs. There's absolutely no question that Wall Street's growth-focused index is in a relatively young bull market. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhile some investors might be hesitant to put their money to work with the Nasdaq breaking to new highs, time has shown that it's an undefeated ally. Though we'll never know ahead of time when stock market corrections will begin, how long they'll last, or where the bottom will be, we do know that every downturn is eventually (key word!) wiped out by a bull market rally. Buying great companies to position for these lengthy bull market rallies can make patient investors significantly richer.\n\nEven with the Nasdaq Composite a stone's throw from a record high, as of this writing, growth stock bargains can still be found by the opportunistic investors willing to seek them out.\n\nWhat follows are four unforgettable growth stocks you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market.\n\nBlock\n\nThe first remarkable growth stock that's begging to be bought with the new Nasdaq bull market stretching its legs is financial technology (\"fintech\") up-and-comer Block(NYSE: SQ). Though competition in the digital payment space is ramping up, Block's foundational operating segment and its push into digital payments are finding their respective marks.\n\nThis \"foundational operating segment\" is the company's Square ecosystem, which provides everything from point-of-sale solutions and data analytics to loans for businesses. During the March-ended quarter, the Square ecosystem saw $50.5 billion in gross purchase volume (GPV) traverse its network, or $202 billion on an annual run-rate basis. For context, Square generated less than $7 billion in full-year GPV in 2012.\n\nWhat makes the Square ecosystem such a promising cash-flow driver is that its solutions are resonating with an increasingly larger merchant base. Whereas 35% of GPV originated from businesses with at least $500,000 in annualized GPV in the first quarter of 2022, 39% of GPV in the latest quarter was traced back to these larger merchants. Since this is a transaction-driven platform, bigger businesses are Block's ticket to higher gross profit.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe other key platform for Block is Cash App. This peer-to-peer digital payments platform closed out March with 57 million transacting active users and a monetization rate -- i.e., Cash App gross profit less buy now, pay later (BNPL) contribution, divided by Cash App inflows -- that expanded by 7 basis points to 1.48% from the prior-year period.\n\nBlock has consistently generated superior gross margin per active Cash App user than the cost to acquire new Cash App users. Leaning on its BNPL offerings and investing aggressively in Cash App solutions (e.g., Cash App Card) are ways it can meaningfully boost its profitability and cash flow by the second half of the decade.\n\nStarbucks\n\nA second unforgettable stock you'll regret not adding to your portfolio with the Nasdaq lifting off in a new bull market is coffee chain Starbucks(NASDAQ: SBUX). Despite recently reporting what could arguably be regarded as its worst quarter in years, Starbucks enjoys undeniable competitive advantages that can benefit patient investors.\n\nTo start with the obvious, Starbucks sports exceptionally strong pricing power. No matter how much labor- or product-based inflation the company has contended with, it's rarely had any trouble passing along price increases to its loyal and growing base of global customers.\n\nPerhaps the top selling point for Starbucks is its 32.8 million active U.S. rewards members, as of the end of the fiscal second quarter (March 31). In exchange for a free drink and/or food item from time to time, rewards members usually have larger tickets, will save their payment information on their smartphone, and use mobile ordering to their advantage. In other words, rewards members are expediting lines and shortening wait times.\n\nDon't overlook the innovation Starbucks has consistently demonstrated over multiple decades. Although some of its newer drinks may not be hitting home with consumers, its drive-thru ordering board revamp during the pandemic, coupled with its evolving food offerings, have helped the company sustain and/or lift its operating margin.\n\nStarbucks is also cheaper than it's been in a very long time, based on its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Its forward P/E of 19 sits about 31% below its average forward earnings multiple over the last five years. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nOkta\n\nA third distinctive growth stock you'll regret not scooping up with the relatively new Nasdaq bull market finding its footing is cybersecurity company Okta(NASDAQ: OKTA). While there's been some concern about Okta's valuation following the admission of a security breach in October 2023, the company's operating performance has put those worries to bed.\n\nOne of the best aspects of cybersecurity is that it's no longer an optional service. Businesses of all sizes with an online and/or cloud-based presence need to protect their sensitive information from robots and hackers who don't care if the U.S. economy is thriving or struggling. As more data moves online and into the cloud, cybersecurity companies like Okta have enjoyed a steady uptick in aggregate customers and subscription revenue.\n\nOkta's success in identity verification is based on its cloud-native, artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-driven cybersecurity platform. Though this service isn't perfect, as the breach in October confirmed, an AI- and ML-powered platform should be nimbler and considerably more efficient at identifying and responding to threats than on-premises solutions over time.\n\nIn the company's April-ended quarter, it recognized a subscription backlog of approximately $3.36 billion (up 19% from the prior-year period) and was sitting on $2.32 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. Since Okta is cash-flow-positive, management has no concerns about aggressively investing in new identity solutions. Meanwhile, its hearty backlog should yield predictable operating cash flow no matter what happens with the U.S. economy over the next year.\n\nLastly, the 2022 acquisition of Auth0 can really open new doors in overseas markets for Okta, as well as expand its reach in the $30 billion consumer identity market.\n\nMeta Platforms\n\nThe fourth unforgettable growth stock you'll regret not buying in the new Nasdaq bull market is none other than social media maven Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Even though Wall Street was less than thrilled with Meta raising its spending forecast, this is an industry leader with an extensive history of successful monetization efforts.\n\nThe foundation for Meta continues to be its social media assets. It's the parent company of Facebook, the most-visited social site globally, as well as WhatsApp, Instagram, Threads, and Facebook Messenger. These extremely popular apps, along with Meta's other social media assets, collectively attracted 3.24 billion daily active users during the first quarter. There's not a social media platform that comes close to providing access to as many daily active users as Meta -- and this is often reflected in its ad pricing power.\n\nThis is a good time to mention that Meta benefits from disproportionately long periods of economic growth. While recessions are an unavoidable part of the economic cycle, they resolve rather quickly. By comparison, a company like Meta, which generates almost 98% of its sales from advertising, reaps the rewards of economic expansions lasting for years.\n\nAnother reason to trust in CEO Mark Zuckerberg's company is its deep pockets. Meta Platforms ended March with north of $58 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, and has generated over $76 billion in operating cash flow over the prior four quarters. With a treasure chest of cash at its disposal, Meta can comfortably invest in AI and its metaverse ambitions, even with the understanding that these innovations are likely years away from being major revenue drivers.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is Meta's cheap valuation. Despite quintupling since its bear market low of 2022, Meta still trades at less than 13 times estimated cash flow for 2025. This represents a 14% discount to its average forward multiple to cash flow over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Block right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Block, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Block wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Mark Zuckerberg is quietly sitting on a shopping empire with 4 times the customers of Amazon, as Facebook Marketplace skyrockets",
        "content": "Ethan Gaskill, a 29-year-old content creator, begins everyday the same way: “When I wake up in the morning—most people get on their phone and start checking Instagram—I check Facebook Marketplace.”\n\nWith his Los Angeles home furnished almost exclusively with second-hand items and a TikTok with over 220,000 followers interested in his thrifty hauls, Gaskill trusts the shopping platform to be a reliable source for hidden gems: a thousand-dollar Herman Miller light and pendant he nabbed for $400; a $5,000 bed from the same designer he bought for 20% of the original price; and, a Founders mid-century dresser worth $4,000 that Gaskill got for $800.\n\nhttps://www.tiktok.com/@ethancgaskill/video/7373705691070090539\n\n“It gives an opportunity for people to possibly bring in really rare items or just one-of-a-kind items into their home that otherwise they wouldn't have had if they couldn't make it out to a flea market or estate sale,” Gaskill told Fortune.\n\nFacebook Marketplace has not only become a trusted source for LA’s second-hand scene. It’s made itself a real contender to go toe-to-toe with well-established e-commerce sites. Facebook has grown to 3.07 billion monthly active users (MAUs) as of the end of 2023, a 3% year-over-year increase. Of those, up to 40%, or 1.2 billion, are active users shopping on Marketplace, according to a March report from Capital One Shopping.\n\nMeta’s online second-hand market is already challenging the sector’s goliaths. Marketplace eclipsed Craigslist’s MAUs years ago, with Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg saying in 2018 that there were 800 million Marketplace MAUs, compared to the 55 million visitors on Craigslist in 2017. In contrast, Amazon had 310 million monthly users in 2023, per Tech Report, about one-fourth of Marketplace’s MAUs. Marketplace is the second most popular site for second-hand purchases behind Ebay, according to a 2022 Statista report.\n\n“This is a growth area,” Charles Lindsey, associate professor of marketing at University at Buffalo School of Management, told Fortune. “It wouldn't surprise me if in three years, five years, it actually overtakes Ebay.”\n\nAmazon and Ebay did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment.\n\nFrom online garage sale to e-commerce giant\n\nMarketplace’s astronomical growth is in large part because the platform is simply easy to use and already linked to a site where so many people are pre-existing members, Lindsey argued.\n\n“There's a trust factor because it's associated with Facebook,” he said. “It has an easy-to-use interface. It's integrated with Facebook Messenger, so it's easy to kind of go back and forth.”\n\nStory continues\n\nLaunched in 2016, Marketplace was originally a way to facilitate sales among neighbors, with most users offering up a used item for sale at a reasonable price, and buyers picking up the item and coordinating with the seller over Facebook Messenger about collection and payment. But Marketplace grew into a formidable e-commerce platform, with one-in-three U.S. Facebook users on the platform by 2018. Through the pandemic, Marketplace exploded thanks to increased reliance on e-commerce and supply chain and shipping delays that inconvenienced traditional shopping.\n\n“We’re seeing everyone from artisans hand making goods, to wood workers to car sellers thrive,” Deb Liu, founder and then-Marketplace vice president, told Modern Retail in 2021.\n\nBy then, Marketplace had become a boon not only for thrifty shoppers, but small businesses looking for unique sales avenues. Springfield, Missouri-based Beautiful Fight Woodworking generated $168,000 of its $266,000 revenue in 2020 exclusively through Marketplace sales.\n\nTo be sure, the platform isn’t without significant problems, particularly as scammers and bot accounts have proliferated the site, giving well-intentioned buyers a tough time. One South Carolina user claimed in February he was scammed out of $18,000 after putting his 2016 Audi up for sale on Marketplace. A 2022 thinkmonkey survey of 1,000 Brits found that one in six had been scammed on the platform.\n\n“What happens offline often makes its way into online environments, and that unfortunately includes scams,\" Ryan Daniels, a Meta spokesperson, told Wired. Meta said it works “aggressively to quickly identify, disable, and ban scams and accounts associated with them.”\n\nGen Z’s new favorite social media\n\nThrough its ascension, Marketplace has won over a generation of young people who had largely turned away from Facebook.\n\n“I look at it like it's like a social media app,” Dre Vez, a 25-year-old content creator, told Fortune.\n\nVez spends about six to 12 hours a day on Marketplace, where he makes a living “trolling” sellers by asking them over voice memos to test the product, before uploading the interactions to TikTok for his 755,000 followers.\n\nHe finds Marketplace not just fodder for entertaining videos but also as a real social media tool for Gen Z and millennials because it's fast-paced and highly stimulating.\n\n“It's the ability to have several interactions in a short duration of time, where I could go on Facebook marketplace, and I could search up for a bike, and I could reach out to seven to 10 different people and have all these conversations going on at the same time,” he said.\n\nEven on days when he can’t find a good deal, Vez finds some laughs on the site. Sellers have gotten away with listing used toe nail clippers, toilet brushes, plungers—even a Dorito in the shape of a face going for $10,000, he recalled.\n\nMeta has taken notice of its enthusiastic young users. While Facebook’s popularity among teens has dwindled in the wake of TikTok’s rise, Facebook now has over 40 million daily young adult users aged 18 to 29 in the U.S. and Canada, a three-year high, with one in four using Marketplace, Meta told Fortune.\n\nTo second-hand connoisseur Gaskill, who checks Marketplace five to 10 times a day, the platform is compelling to young people because it appeals to their desire for independence, to save money, and protect the environment against the strains of mass production and freight.\n\n“Just given the circumstances with the economy, but also just the mindset of like Gen Z, they love uniqueness, and they love self expression,” he said. “But they also really like finding things for a good price.”\n\nFinding room to grow\n\nBut just because Meta boasts a growing fandom for its Marketplace platform doesn’t mean its a lucrative arm of the company. Meta did not respond to Fortune’s request for comment on how it makes money through Marketplace, but marketing professor Lindsey suggests the company benefits from seller transaction fees, as well as more eyes on the website’s advertisements.\n\n“Just overall, the more likely someone uses Facebook Marketplace, probably the more likely they also log into Facebook so many times per month,” he said. “Then Facebook capitalizes on that by being able to have companies pay for advertising that then hits my feed, hits your feed.”\n\nThe EU’s European Commission alleged in December 2022 that Facebook and Marketplace tie together and use data in a way that infringe on the EU’s competition rules, according to a December 2023 SEC filing.\n\nMarketplace is, in part, an important facet of Facebook’s financial puzzle because its locally based exchanges are low-expense, according to Sucharita Kodali, retail industry analyst for market research firm Forrester—especially, compared to Ebay, which requires a massive international infrastructure.\n\n“It's an enormous transaction volume,” she told Fortune. “With that transaction volume comes a kind of a necessary investment in a lot of automation, customer service, seller management, seller tools, etc.”\n\nWhile Facebook Marketplace doesn’t need an elaborate system to manage local transactions, it also means it’s likely not making as much money as its e-commerce competition. In fact, Kodali went so far as to call Marketplace an “anti-commerce” platform because it has so many “buy nothing” groups and peer-to-peer exchanges. She took a similar stance as Lindsey, arguing the financial merit of the platform is to help better target ads for active users.\n\n“It's not really about, like, ‘Let's make money off of the volume of posts that we see on the marketplace section,’” she said.\n\nMarketplace’s virtual garage sale vibes and community feel of the platform may not be raking in billions of dollars for Meta, but they’re exactly what keeps users coming back to the site.\n\n“You never know when that next amazing thing is gonna pop up,” Gaskill said. “That's the fun of it. That's kind of what keeps it addicting.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Meet the Supercharged Growth Stock That's a Shoo-In to Join Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet in the $2 Trillion Club",
        "content": "One of the biggest secular tailwinds to emerge over the past couple of years is artificial intelligence (AI). While AI has existed in some form for decades, more recent advances have turned the tech world on its head.\n\nEvidence abounds. Indeed, the top four companies in the world -- when measured by market cap -- all share a common thread: They are all embracing the groundswell surrounding generative AI and are racing to profit from these cutting-edge algorithms. Topping that list is Microsoft, the only company that boasts a market cap of more than $3 trillion. Following closely behind are Apple, Nvidia, and Alphabet, with market caps of between $2.9 trillion and $2.1 trillion.\n\nOne company that seems destined to join the ranks of the $2 trillion club is Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). The social media titan has a treasure trove of data on its users and is parlaying its data cache into profits.\n\nLet's look at Meta's place in the overall AI ecosystem and the drivers that could propel its stock to rarified heights, making it part of this prestigious group. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nData is the new oil\n\nIn 2006, British mathematician Clive Humby famously said \"data is the new oil.\" Put another way, data in its raw form needs to be refined in order for it to achieve its greatest potential. Recent advances in the field of generative AI have given new meaning to this often-quoted phrase.\n\nAI models are trained on reams of data, which allows them to make more accurate predictions and improve their decision-making process. Therefore, companies with the most data can create the most effective AI systems.\n\nThat's what gives Meta Platforms an edge in the AI revolution. The company has a roster of social media platforms, including three of the four largest social media platforms on the planet (measured by monthly users), including Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp, among others. In the first quarter, more than 3.2 billion people logged into one of the company's family of apps. This gives the company access to a virtual treasure trove of data about its users, which is prime fuel for training AI models.\n\nThe fruit of those efforts is LLaMA (Large Language Model Meta AI), which underpins the company's flagship Meta AI. Just last month, the company unveiled LLaMA 3, making Meta AI \"one of the world's leading AI assistants.\" This AI is free to users (resulting in more data), though Meta charges large cloud infrastructure providers a fee to include it in their offerings.\n\nThe generative AI opportunity\n\nAs the world's largest social media provider, it might seem counterintuitive that Meta Platforms would be interested in AI, yet it seems like too good an opportunity to pass up. By simply repurposing data it already has, Meta can generate an entirely new revenue stream, enriching shareholders along the way.\n\nStory continues\n\nEstimates regarding the size of the AI opportunity are all over the map, so there's no definitive figure. However, one of the more conservative estimates suggests generative AI will be a $1.3 trillion market by 2032, according to data compiled by Bloomberg Intelligence. With an opportunity of that magnitude, it's easy to see why Meta has embarked along this path.\n\nA track record of robust growth\n\nOver the past decade, Meta's revenue has grown by 3,120% (as of this writing), while its net income has surged by 4,000%. While this hasn't been in a straight line, the company's performance has been consistent, driving dramatic growth in its stock price, which has surged 1,140%. These results have been fueled by Meta's digital advertising, which generates the lion's share of its revenue.\n\nIn the first quarter, Meta's growth was impressive. Revenue of $36.5 billion jumped 27% year over year, while its diluted earnings per share of $4.71 soared 114%. Visitors to its platforms grew by 7%, helping fuel its ad impressions, which grew by 20%, while the average price per ad increased by 6%. Driving the robust bottom line growth was slower increases in costs and expenses, which grew just 6%.\n\nMeta has developed a host of generative AI features to help its advertisers better reach their target market. For example, users can create multiple backgrounds, adjust the size of the main image, and create variations on the original text, all of which can save advertisers time and money. That, combined with the ongoing recovery in the ad market, spells good news for Meta.\n\nWhile there's a great deal of focus on AI, there are other potential growth drivers that could push Meta higher. Meta's Reality Labs, which includes the company's Quest virtual reality (VR) headsets and its metaverse ambitions, has thus far been a drag on Meta's results. However, CEO Mark Zuckerberg believes ongoing investments in Reality Labs will ultimately increase Meta's operating income, though that remains to be seen.\n\nThe path to $2 trillion\n\nMeta currently boasts a market cap of roughly $1.22 trillion, which means it will only take stock price gains of roughly 65% to drive its value to $2 trillion. According to Wall Street, Meta is expected to generate revenue of $146.2 billion in 2024, giving it a forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of roughly 8. Assuming its P/S remains constant, Meta would have to grow its revenue to roughly $241 billion annually to support a $2 trillion market cap.\n\nWall Street is currently forecasting revenue growth of 28% annually for Meta over the coming five years. If the company achieves that benchmark, it could achieve a $2 trillion market cap as soon as 2027. It's worth noting that Meta has a history of outperforming analysts' expectations. If that's the case, it could cross that line sooner.\n\nIt's worth noting that the economy remains a wild card, and sentiment is still being driven by inflation and the potential for interest rate cuts. If macroeconomic conditions remain subdued or even turn south, advertising revenue could take a hit, and Meta could suffer.\n\nThat said, 27 times earnings is on par with the price-to-earnings ratio of the S&P 500 and a relative bargain considering Meta's track record of growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Prepping for Its Next Decade of Growth with AWS",
        "content": "E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised for the next decade of growth after delivering a return of around 1,000% over the last decade. Thanks to its recent earnings beat, the stock price recently hit a new all-time high. Despite these gains, Amazon’s reaccelerated AWS growth, bolstered by AI, strong retail momentum, and margin and cash-flow expansion from optimization initiatives, make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll buy the stock at current levels.\n\nAmazon Posts Yet Another Quarterly Beat Driven by AWS\n\nOn April 30, Amazon reported impressive Q1 results for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all segments, including cloud, advertising, and e-commerce. Adjusted earnings of $0.98 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $0.84 per share. Also, earnings more than trebled (+216%) year-over-year compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, net sales soared 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, and sales for Amazon’s cloud business segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion, beating expectations. Segment growth was aided by renewed demand and investments in generative AI, which boosted AWS’s performance, alongside a near cessation of the cost optimizations that customers had resorted to last year.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is that AWS’s operating income jumped 84.3% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Further, there was a significant operating margin expansion in the segment from 24% in the prior-year quarter to 37.6% currently.\n\nRegion-wise, North America sales grew 12% year-over-year, with International segment revenue growth at 11% (in constant currency). Moreover, operating income for all the company’s segments combined jumped by 219% year-over-year to $15.3 billion.\n\nBased on its robust Q1 performance, Amazon provided an optimistic Q2 outlook, above expectations. Q2 net sales are projected to grow between 7-11% to be in the range of $144-149 billion. Notably, operating income guidance of $10-14 billion ($12 billion at the midpoint) is also much higher compared to the $7.7 billion generated in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAWS Sees Record Growth and Margins in Q1 Due to AI Impact\n\nAWS, Amazon’s cloud business, has long been the market leader and the profit engine for the company for years. However, after years of impressive growth, the segment saw a slowdown, with growth decelerating to 13% in 2023 compared to 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021.\n\nThat downtrend is now history. In Q1, AWS’s sales grew 17%, helping AWS reach the much-anticipated $100 billion run rate milestone in revenues. Additionally, operating income for the segment saw a remarkable growth of 84%.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the catalyst behind this stupendous growth witnessed at AWS during the quarter. As a matter of fact, the tech titans of the world like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been investing heavily in AI technology.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft’s Azure has gained market share in the cloud space, now holding a 25% share versus 19% in 2021. The addition of AI tools has been a contributing factor toward Azure’s rapid growth over the years. Like its peers, Amazon is making meaningful investments in AI and developing its own large language models as well as investing billions in AI products like Anthropic (which competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT).\n\nAmazon’s investments in AI are now reaping benefits and showing up in the financial figures. The company stated that the majority of its FY2024 CapEx (capital expenditures) will be toward bolstering AWS infrastructure and AI efforts. As the cloud leader, AWS can significantly monetize the growing demand for AI with its wide variety of cloud offerings.\n\nIt’s not just the margin expansion that impressed investors in Q1. It was a huge jump in cash flows despite substantial capital investments in AI and cloud infrastructure. This reassured investors that Amazon’s fundamentals remain intact. Q1 free cash flows grew to $50.1 billion (Q4: $36.8 billion) compared to cash outflows of $3.3 billion a year ago. Margin expansion, coupled with robust free cash flows, implies strong returns for investors in the years to come.\n\nEarlier this week, there was news that AWS is looking to invest billions in Italy to strengthen its cloud infrastructure and data center operations in the country. Similarly, AWS will invest billions in Spain (€15.7 billion) and Germany (€7.8 billion) with the aim of expanding its cloud business across European countries.\n\nAmazon has been undertaking key initiatives to streamline the company’s operations as well as bring down costs. These steps include transforming the U.S. fulfillment model from a nationwide one to a regional one and synchronizing inventory with the regional consumers, among others.\n\nOn a separate note, Amazon recently announced the departure of its AWS head, Adam Selipsky. He will be replaced by Matt Garman, an AWS veteran, to become the CEO of AWS. This leadership change may further enhance Amazon’s AI growth initiatives.\n\nAmazon’s Valuation Isn’t Expensive\n\nAs Amazon houses multiple businesses under its radar, I believe the EV/EBITDA ratio is the best metric to evaluate the stock’s valuation. Being an industry leader, the company has historically traded at high multiples. At present, however, Amazon stock is trading at around 14.3x EV/EBITDA (on a forward basis) compared to its own five-year historical average of 20.6x. This implies a huge 31% discount.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, let’s also look at its P/S ratio. Amazon is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.0x. In contrast, cloud computing and tech giant Microsoft trades at a P/S of 13.1x, while social networking company Meta Platforms  (NASDAQ:META) trades at a P/S of 7.7x.\n\nTherefore, I believe the stock is trading at an attractive valuation and presents a great buying opportunity, given the strong growth potential across various business verticals.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Amazon stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the impressive earnings beat. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 unanimous Buys. Amazon stock’s average price target of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider AMZN Stock for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nAmazon may have been a little late to the AI growth story, but it’s important to remember that AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure. Its substantial investments and recent leadership changes should yield significant benefits. The foundation has been laid, and I believe there’s no turning back for Amazon.\n\nWith multiple growth drivers, including AWS’s growth trajectory fueled by generative AI initiatives, a well-diversified business portfolio, strong retail performance, and impressive margin and cash-flow expansion, Amazon appears well-positioned for its next phase of growth. Therefore, I am confident in buying the stock at its current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

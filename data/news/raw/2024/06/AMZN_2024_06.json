        "content": "This article will list world's best company according to the media.\n\nTransforming the Media Landscape: Challenges, Growth, and the Influence of Major Corporations\n\nMany people ask what a media company is and why their opinions matter. Media companies produce and distribute content through traditional and digital channels, influencing public opinion and shaping narratives via their broad reach and credibility. Knowing that the media sector encompasses a wide array of activities including advertising, broadcasting, networking, and news, we cannot ignore their impact on the market. Such firms operate across diverse fields, catering to end customers ranging from individuals to large enterprises. This list highlights major media corporations, providing insights into their operations and offerings.\n\nWhile digital media is faring considerably well, the same cannot be said about traditional media. In fact, the year 2022 saw losses from traditional media companies amounting to $5 billion on streaming services-except for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Paramount, are all some big entertainment conglomerates that are a part of the traditional media downfall in one way or another. Factors such as a weak advertising market, rising production costs, and declining revenues in traditional media have all been responsible for their demise.\n\nAn Accenture survey of 6,000 consumers highlights additional challenges by revealing their media consumption behaviors. The survey reveals 55.9% of those surveyed expressing frustration over paying at multiple platforms to access content, 65.5% finding it inconvenient to enter personal information repeatedly, and more than half complaining that recommendations provided did not match their interests. Moreover, as many as 30% of consumers now spend over 10 minutes searching for new content, a  figure that has since doubled from the past. As a result of many of these problems, linear TV viewership has dropped by 26% since last year, while Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) has surged by 57%. Additionally, consumers have significantly increased their usage of social media (52%), social video (52%), and video games (50%)—areas where traditional media companies have minimal presence.\n\nThe media industry has experienced a profound transformation with the successful expansion of the subscription model, presenting new growth opportunities amid substantial declines in advertising revenues. Leading this shift, Amazon and Netflix have both achieved remarkable increases in revenue and audience numbers. Moreover, companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing in diversified revenue streams such as gaming, streaming, and even live sports. These revenue streams give them a “safety net”, something that pure play companies lack.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, media firms have considerable influence over buyers, and their earnings place them at the top of the list.  The companies on the Forbes 2023 list of the top 100 companies collectively represent 61 different countries, $51.7 trillion in sales, $4.5 trillion in income, $238 trillion in assets, and $88 trillion in market value. As such, the ranking of the world's largest publicly traded firms currently leans heavily towards the United States, marking a shift since the 2008 financial crisis. Bagging the top spot in Forbes top companies is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a market capitalization of $580 billion as of June 2024. This American multinational finance company is one of the most valuable companies in the world. The number two spot is taken by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) , an American multinational conglomerate holding company. Companies such as chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also gaining considerable traction owing to AI, having moved up more than a 100 spots on Forbes’ list. However, when talking about the best companies according to the media, the results may not tally with Forbes lists. world's best company according to the media\n\nImage by Igor Karimov from Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nThe compilation of the best firms by media began with lists published by media companies. In this regard, Forbes conducted extensive research, compiling multiple major rankings of the most valuable corporations, largest companies, top employers, and leading technology firms. Their methodology ranks the world's largest firms based on four metrics: sales, profitability, assets, and market value. To identify the top employers, they surveyed over 170,000 employees from international corporations and organizations across more than 50 countries. We also referred to Fast Company's list of the most innovative companies, top 100 tech companies, and Visual Capitalist's list of the most valuable brands. We compared these lists with previous years' rankings to determine which firms consistently appeared. It's important to note that these lists encompass both media companies and companies associated with media brands, too. This is how our compilation of the world's 30 best companies according to the media, as recognized by the media, was formulated.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nBased on our study, this is the world's best company according to the media.\n\n1. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6\n\nLiving under a rock would be the only way to remain unaware of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its profound influence across various sectors and industries. Originally established as a software company, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) has evolved into a tech powerhouse, offering a diverse array of products and services including operating systems, cloud services, game consoles, and AI technologies. Since its inception in 1975, Microsoft has made an indelible impact on the global stage, culminating in record-breaking revenue exceeding $62 billion USD in the second financial quarter of 2024. As of 2024, Microsoft's market capitalization stands impressively at $3.12 trillion USD, which is why is Microsoft on the top of the list of world's 30 best companies according to the media.\n\nCheck out our complete list of World’s 30 Best Companies According to the Media.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most hated brands to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "June jobs report ushers in new quarter during holiday-shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "content": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients.

BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 in 2024",
        "content": "Stocks have been on the rise this year, with the S&P 500 up 15% year to date. The index is on track to outperform last year's growth, as the S&P 500 rose 13% over the same period (January to June) in 2023.\n\nWall Street has grown particularly bullish about tech stocks thanks to advances in fields like artificial intelligence (AI). The same was true this time last year. However, the key difference is there have now been several quarters of tangible results that prove AI is truly boosting earnings for several companies and is a worthy venture.\n\nHowever, tech is a lot more than AI. The industry covers countless sectors that will likely keep it expanding for decades. As a result, it could be a good idea to make a considerable investment in companies with exposure to AI and other areas of tech. Innovative organizations that lead critical parts of the industry could deliver major gains over the long term as the tech market expands.\n\nSo, are you looking to invest $50,000 in the stock market? Here are two of the best stocks that money can buy in 2024 (and are even worth buying with a smaller investment).\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) business has exploded over the last year as it has become a leader in AI. Its chips have become the gold standard in the industry, coveted by developers worldwide. As a result, the company's stock is up 196% year over year, driven primarily by excitement over AI. However, as a leading chipmaker, Nvidia has positions in multiple markets outside of AI that could further boost its business for years.\n\nBefore the recent boom in AI, Nvidia was best known for its prominent role in gaming. The company was one of the first to sell graphics processing units (GPUs) for the consumer market, which gamers use to custom-build high-powered gaming PCs. Nvidia's success in the industry gave it the financial resources to branch out to other tech sectors like data centers, game consoles, consumer products, self-driving cars, and AI.\n\nIncreased interest in AI kicked off at the start of last year. However, Nvidia was a promising growth stock long before that, with its share price rising 338% in the five years leading up to 2023. AI has only strengthened Nvidia's outlook and worth as a long-term investment.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2025 (ending April 2024), Nvidia's revenue climbed 262% year over year, fueled mainly by a 427% increase in its data center segment (representing a rise in AI GPU sales). However, the company also saw encouraging growth in gaming and automotive, where revenue rose 18% and 11%.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe automotive segment includes income from chips supplied to companies leading the way in self-driving technology. The market is still in its infancy but could be a major growth catalyst as chip demand rises alongside the expanding industry.\n\nIn addition to massive growth potential across tech, Nvidia's price/earnings-to-growth ratio (PEG) is less than 1, indicating its stock remains a value play despite recent growth. At its current position, an investment of $25,000 would secure roughly 201 shares in Nvidia -- significantly more than a few months ago, thanks to a recent stock split.\n\nAt this price, the company is screaming buy this year for long-term-minded investors.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has significantly expanded its reach in tech. Since its founding in 1994, Amazon has ventured into and eventually dominated multiple industries, including e-commerce, video streaming, and cloud computing.\n\nIt's as if the company can do no wrong, with solid leadership and vast financial resources that allow it to expand and overcome unexpected hurdles. As a result, its stock is a compelling option as it continues to see gains in retail and develops its roles in AI and digital ads.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's revenue popped 13% year over year. The company profited from massive gains in operating income, more than tripling since last year to $15 billion thanks to growth in its retail segments and highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nMoreover, the quarter signaled a budding business for the company, with revenue from advertising services jumping 24% after the introduction of ads on its Prime Video streaming service. Amazon has a competitive edge in the industry with a leading market share in streaming. This could allow it to dominate the developing streaming advertising market in the coming years, further diversifying Amazon's business.\n\nA $25,000 investment would buy roughly 130 shares in Amazon at its current price. The company's stock has climbed more than 100% over the last five years but could outperform that figure as it continues to expand in AI and other areas of tech. Like Nvidia, Amazon's PEG is also less than 1, making its stock just too good to pass up in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Buy, Sell, Hold: Amazon, Costco, and Walmart Stock Edition",
        "content": "U.S. retail is a multitrillion-dollar industry and a pillar of America's economy. Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart(NYSE: WMT), and Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) are industry titans and world-class stocks that have all outperformed the broader stock market over the years.\n\nThese companies generate an astonishing $1.5 trillion in annual revenue. Their size gives them cost advantages that dominate smaller competitors, and they are poised to continue growing over the coming decades.\n\nHowever, their shares aren't all created equal. While all three are blue chip stocks, their varying price tags give investors much to consider. One of these stocks is a buy, one is a hold, and the other is a sell. Scroll down to see which one is which.\n\nBuy: An e-commerce giant firing on all cylinders\n\nAmazon has become the dominant e-commerce retailer in the United States. The company has amassed a whopping 37.6% market share, miles ahead of second-place Walmart. No company has the supply-chain capabilities to deliver such a breadth of products to consumers quickly, creating an unmatched consumer experience. Its subscription service, Amazon Prime, only reinforces the value proposition with streaming and other perks.\n\nHowever, Amazon's appeal spans beyond e-commerce; the company's cloud platform is also the world leader. Amazon Web Services is a pillar of the digital economy and a cash cow that generates massive profits. Management invests those profits throughout the business to create future growth opportunities. Arguably, no company is as aggressively expanding in new and existing markets as Amazon, which means the sky is the limit for its long-term investment potential.\n\nDespite its track record as a millionaire maker, Amazon's stock is still somehow cheap today. Amazon's hefty investments in growth mask the fact that the stock is at its lowest valuation in a decade if you compare its operating cash flow to its share price. Meanwhile, analysts believe earnings will grow by nearly 30% annually for the next several years. Don't hesitate to snatch up shares and hold them long-term.\n\nHold: America's largest retailer could shine in a recession\n\nWalmart is America's largest retailer; roughly 90% of the country's population lives within a short drive of a store. The company is famous for its low prices and also known for leveraging its massive size and bargaining power to do it. Walmart's store network and ability to reach shoppers have helped it grow. The company has expanded to other retail categories, including big-box, via Sam's Club and e-commerce.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnfortunately, Walmart's stock isn't as outstanding a value as its products can be. Today, shares trade at a forward P/E of 28. That's a premium to the broader stock market, likely due to Walmart's sterling reputation on Wall Street. The company has paid and raised a dividend for 51 consecutive years, and a fortress-like balance sheet backs that. Plus, Walmart is likely to thrive in a recession when consumers leave competitors for Walmart to save money.\n\nAnalysts expect Walmart to continue growing for years, but estimates call for long-term earnings growth averaging just over 7%. It's hard to justify buying a stock at that valuation when you only get single-digit earnings growth. It might not be a bad idea to hold onto shares for Walmart's stellar fundamentals, but it's probably best to avoid buying for now.\n\nSell: This popular big-box retailer is woefully expensive\n\nWriting this next section is almost painful, but one can't ignore the facts. Look, Costco Wholesale is a genuinely excellent business. Its massive size helps it offer products at cheap prices, and its famous loss-leading products, such as its $1.50 hot dog meal, have created a cult-like following and loyalty among those who shop there. The membership fee that consumers pay to shop at Costco is genius and is its primary source of profits.\n\nHowever, despite its fantastic business, Costco stock has become so expensive that it's worth considering selling some shares. The stock trades at a whopping forward P/E of over 52, yet analysts believe earnings will grow by just 9.5% annually over the long term. That seems doable based on Costco's still-expanding store footprint and ability to raise membership dues.\n\nNearly 10% growth is nothing to sneeze at, except when paying over 50 times its earnings. There isn't any margin of safety in the stock price, which is a dangerous position to be in if a recession hits and shoppers start pulling back their wallets. Rather than roll the dice, consider selling and getting back in when the price makes more sense.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock is now in treacherous waters: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.\n\nIn life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.\n\nSure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.\n\nTrust me, it's not — and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.\n\nThis same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nI know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.\n\nOver the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.\n\nFor perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.\n\nSome folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my \"Opening Bid\" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.\n\nAll of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.\n\nBut if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.\n\nNvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.  Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. \"In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,\" Krinsky said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nSimilar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to \"in-line\" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.\n\nAnd I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.\n\n\"When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that’s a bad sign — a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\nOthers don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!\n\n\"But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,\" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.\n\nSpeaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however.

        "title": "Amazon faces uphill battle against Temu and Shein as it woos Chinese merchants, analysts say",
        "content": "Amazon.com's plan to launch a discount shopping section would appeal to mainland Chinese suppliers with pricing flexibility, but competing with Temu and Shein in selling low-priced merchandise will not be easy, according to analysts.\n\nThe US e-commerce giant told Chinese merchants in an invite-only meeting on Wednesday that this new online budget marketplace will feature non-branded fashion items, household goods and daily necessities, which will ship directly to consumers from warehouses on the mainland in nine to 11 days.\n\nThat plan, first reported by online tech publication The Information, has already made a splash within China's cross-border e-commerce community, where heated discussions centred around joining this marketplace and related Amazon policies. This programme, however, is only open to select sellers.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\n\"The initial feedback from Chinese merchants has been quite positive even though Amazon has yet to officially launch the new programme,\" said Wang Xin, executive chairwoman of the Shenzhen Cross-Border E-Commerce Association.\n\nSelect mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace. Photo: Reuters alt=Select mainland Chinese merchants have been invited by Amazon.com to joint its new discount-shopping marketplace. Photo: Reuters>\n\nAmazon's new discount marketplace resembles the budget e-commerce model of platforms like Temu, which work closely with Chinese suppliers in marketing and shipping dirt-cheap goods directly to global consumers.\n\nMerchants under Amazon's new programme can set product prices by themselves, which deviates from the Temu model, according to Wang. She said this is likely to appeal to mainland cross-border merchants and exporters - especially those who have worked with Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop - with the manufacturing capabilities, cash flow, talent and supply chain to make a difference for Amazon.\n\nThe US company's planned foray into the discount-shopping market segment shows a renewed effort to broaden its \"Made in China, sold on Amazon\" community, as many mainland suppliers struggle to boost their profits amid fierce competition between discount-shopping platforms.\n\n\"By leaving pricing in the hands of sellers, Amazon has offered a crucial way for them to maintain profitability,\" Wang said.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com's discount-shopping initiative is expected to attract suppliers who have worked with rival platforms Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. Photo: Shutterstock alt=Amazon.com's discount-shopping initiative is expected to attract suppliers who have worked with rival platforms Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\nAmazon also aims to protect its home market against the likes of Temu, Shein and TikTok Shop, whose aggressive promotions and low-cost offerings have won the hearts, minds and dollars of many US consumers.\n\n\"We are always exploring new ways to work with our selling partners to delight our customers with more selection, lower prices and greater convenience,\" Amazon said in a statement in response to an inquiry about the new initiative.\n\nTemu topped the shopping app download charts across 125 markets in 2023 including the US, where Shein ranked second, according to a report by Data.ai.\n\nGuangzhou-based garments supplier Kenny Li, who works with Shein and Temu, said he has been closely following the news about Amazon's plan and is keen to join when he has the chance.\n\nThe new online budget marketplace planned by Amazon.com will feature non-branded fashion items, household goods and daily necessities shipped directly to consumers overseas from the warehouses of suppliers in mainland China. Photo: Shutterstock alt=The new online budget marketplace planned by Amazon.com will feature non-branded fashion items, household goods and daily necessities shipped directly to consumers overseas from the warehouses of suppliers in mainland China. Photo: Shutterstock>\n\n\"It would be a good opportunity for us to expand our sales channel and lower the risks,\" said Li, whose factory makes T-shirts and jeans that only sell for a few dollars.\n\nLi disclosed that he has been cutting back supplies to Temu after being penalised for goods returned by consumers. \"It's hurting our profit, so I'd rather produce less than to bear the costs of the returns,\" he said.\n\nWhile Chinese sellers are eager to jump on this new Amazon bandwagon, it will not be an easy task for the US firm to win consumers over from Temu and Shein in the discount-shopping segment, said Zhang Yi, founder and chief analyst at market consultancy iiMedia.\n\n\"Amazon has set its sights on China as an enormous and highly efficient manufacturing hub to provide a variety of cheap goods, but it remains to be seen whether the company can make a smooth shift from its existing model to a low-cost one,\" Zhang said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Street calls of the week: Stifel initiates on Tesla; downgrade for Alphabet",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here is your Pro Recap of the top takeaways from Wall Street analysts for the past week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving rating changes.\n\nAffirm Holdings\n\nWhat happened? On Monday, Goldman Sachs launched coverage with a new analyst on Affirm Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:AFRM) at Buy with a $42 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Goldman regards AFRM as a frontrunner in the provision of contemporary credit solutions for consumers, boasting a varied array of products tailored for point-of-sale financing and daily expenditures. The analysts are particularly taken with the sophistication of AFRM’s underwriting processes compared to its fintech counterparts, as well as the company’s consistent delivery of well-managed credit results, even amidst rapid growth that outpaces its peers. This success is attributed to AFRM’s approach to short-duration receivables and transaction-level underwriting, which enables the company to individually assess and underwrite various types of consumer spending. These include everyday purchases (“Pay now” via Debit), cash flow management or short-term financing (such as Pay-in-4), and more extended installment financing options (spanning 6-12 months or more), all facilitated through a single card-based product, the Affirm Debit+ card.\n\nIn contrast to traditional card issuers who have historically provided a single revolving credit line to cover these needs, AFRM’s method incurs significantly lower costs for the consumer and reduces credit risk for the lender by avoiding large open-to-buy balances. Goldman believes that AFRM’s precise underwriting grants it a competitive edge, enabling the firm to delve deeper into the credit spectrum and make inroads into the subprime/near-prime market segment—a challenging area for many established players to engage in sustainably. The analysts anticipate that this precision in underwriting will bolster AFRM’s position in the market and facilitate its continued growth and success.\n\nBuy at Goldman means “Analysts recommend stocks as Buys or Sells for inclusion on various regional Investment Lists. Being assigned a Buy or Sell on an Investment List is determined by a stock’s total return potential relative to its coverage universe.\"\n\nHow did the stock react? Affirm Holdings opened the regular session at $31.02 and closed at $33.70, a gain of 12.82% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nPenn Entertainment\n\nWhat happened? On Tuesday, Raymond James downgraded PENN Entertainment Inc (NASDAQ:PENN) to Market Perform and removed their $20 price target.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s the full story? The recommendation change follows a 21% increase in the company’s share price since May 20, which was influenced by activist pressure and merger and acquisition rumors. Initially, when coverage began, Raymond James posited that the stock’s potential was limited to approximately $20/share. This ceiling was attributed to ongoing discounts related to the interactive segment and the “penalty box” status, which were expected to continue until a clearer route to profitability in the interactive space was established or a significant strategic shift occurred.\n\nHowever, the path to profitability in the digital realm for PENN remains ambiguous, and no substantial changes in strategy, such as a complete sale of the company, appear imminent. Consequently, Raymond James advises investors to capitalize on the recent gains and seek more favorable risk-adjusted investment opportunities within the sector. The brokerage highlights Caesars (NASDAQ:CZR) as its preferred choice, suggesting that it offers a more attractive investment profile compared to PENN under the current market conditions.\n\nRaymond James’ assessment reflects a cautious stance on PENN’s short-term prospects, emphasizing the need for clarity in its digital strategy and profitability outlook.\n\nMarket Perform at Raymond James means “The security is expected to perform generally in line with the S&P 500 over the next 12 months and could potentially be used as a source of funds for more highly rated securities.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Penn Entertainment opened the regular session at $18.85 and closed at $18.26, a gain of 5.58% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nTesla\n\nWhat happened? On Wednesday, (well Tuesday after hours) Stifel initiated coverage on Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) at Buy with a $265 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Stifel believes that TSLA is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2025-27+. In the near term, the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of its next-generation vehicle (Model 2) production, which will likely garner very strong demand. The Stifel analysts also believe TSLA’s AI-based Full Self-Driving initiative has the potential to generate significant value through sales of FSD, possible licensing agreements, and as a critical driver of longer-term RoboTaxi initiatives.\n\nNoteworthy near-term risks include delivery levels following lackluster 1Q24 results, as well as near-term EV adoption headwinds and the U.S. election. Stifel is initiating coverage with a Buy and a $265 target price.\n\nBuy at Stifel means “We expect a total return of greater than 10% over the next 12 months with total return equal to the percentage price change plus dividend yield.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Tesla opened the regular session at $186.69 and closed at $196.37, a gain of 4.81% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nQiagen\n\nWhat happened? On Thursday, Wolfe Research upgraded Qiagen (NYSE:QGEN) to Outperform with a $50 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Wolfe Research has expressed increased confidence in QGEN’s prospects following the company’s compelling Corporate Management Day (CMD) presentation on June 17th. The brokerage is optimistic about QGEN’s ability to surpass its competitors in the upcoming year, as management has presented a credible strategy to achieve over 7% organic growth and an Operating Margin exceeding 31% between 2024 and 2028.\n\nThe current portfolio is particularly appealing due to its high percentage of recurring revenue, approximately 85%, alongside several medium-term growth catalysts and strong market positions. Additionally, Wolfe Research anticipates that QGEN’s latent-TB segment will remain unchallenged by new competitors in the near term, and they trust in the company’s disciplined execution, as demonstrated by initiatives like NeuMoDx.\n\nDespite these positive indicators, QGEN’s stock is currently trading at less than 20x the next twelve months’ P/E ratio, which is more than a 5x discount compared to its peers. This valuation leads Wolfe Research to believe that the shares are undervalued, presenting an attractive investment opportunity with limited downside risk. In light of this assessment, the brokerage has decided to revise its estimates for 2025 and beyond, reflecting a stronger belief in QGEN’s trajectory towards enhanced growth and profitability.\n\nWolfe Research’s analysis suggests that QGEN is well-positioned for future success, and its current stock price offers a favorable entry point for investors.\n\nOutperform at Wolfe means “The security is projected to outperform analyst's industry coverage universe over the next 12 months.”\n\nHow did the stock react? Qiagen opened the regular session at $41.02 and closed at $41.10, a gain of 1.02% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nAlphabet\n\nWhat happened? On Friday, Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) to Neutral with a $181 price target.\n\nWhat’s the full story? Rosenblatt downgraded Alphabet's to Neutral citing several areas of transitional risk that warrant cautionary observation. Key concerns include the potential impact of AI on search functionality, particularly the introduction of AI Overviews, which may temporarily disrupt search ad revenues. Additionally, there are indications of emerging competition from Bing, potentially leading to a loss of search market share. Moreover, the shift of search ad revenue towards retail media networks, influenced by Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and others entering this space, is expected to accelerate, posing further uncertainties.\n\nAnother significant factor is Amazon's aggressive foray into video advertising, including the integration of ads on Prime Video and a robust upfront sales strategy, which could alter the dynamics of ad sales, particularly affecting Alphabet's YouTube platform. The research team also highlights the possibility of heightened capital expenditure (capex) for AI, driven by competitive pressures within the industry.\n\nIn light of these transitional risks, Rosenblatt suggests a cautious stance on Alphabet until clearer outcomes emerge from these developments. Monitoring how Alphabet navigates these challenges will be crucial in reassessing its investment outlook going forward.\n\nNeutral at Rosenblatt means “We believe that this stock’s performance will be in line with the average return of others in its industry over the following 12 months.“\n\nHow did the stock react? Alphabet opened the regular session at $184.17 and closed at $182.15, a decline of 1.76% from the prior day’s regular close.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nStreet calls of the week: Stifel initiates on Tesla; downgrade for Alphabet\n\nRising trade policy uncertainty poses a downside risk to growth: Goldman Sachs\n\nExclusive-US prosecutors meeting with Boeing, crash victims as criminal charging decision looms, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other cloud computing stocks. You can also check out the 10 Best Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy Under $10 here.\n\nCloud computing has changed the way we access and manage computing resources. The industry is poised for significant growth in the coming years. Market estimates suggest a jump from a size of $0.68 trillion in 2024 to a projected $1.44 trillion by 2029, reflecting a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 16.4%. This upward trend is expected to continue, with the market reaching a value of almost $2.5 trillion by 2032. These figures point towards a rising adoption and utilization of cloud solutions across various industries.\n\nThe growth in the industry is likely to be driven by a number of factors. One key factor is the growing recognition among large enterprises of the impact that cloud computing can have on their operations. In fact, an impressive 94% of companies across the globe have already adopted cloud computing solutions. This high rate of adoption is expected to have a remarkable economic impact, with forecasts showing that it could generate approximately $3 trillion in revenue by the year 2030.\n\nCurrently, North America and Europe are leading the way in cloud computing adoption, with Asia Pacific not far behind. North America holds the largest share of the global market at 41%. The region's early adoption of technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) has played a key role in driving its cloud market growth.\n\nEven with stricter regulations around data privacy and security, the European markets are also displaying consistent growth in cloud adoption. Countries like Sweden, Finland, the Netherlands, and Denmark are leading the way in cloud adoption within specific industries. This suggests that European businesses are increasingly recognizing the value of cloud solutions while navigating a regulatory landscape that prioritizes data protection.\n\nThe Asia Pacific region is also currently experiencing a rise in cloud computing adoption. The market size rose to an estimated $32.5 billion in 2022 and is projected to be a significant contributor to the global cloud computing market in the coming years. This growth can be attributed to a large-scale shift towards digital business models across various industries in the region. The need for cost-effective solutions has fueled cloud adoption among small and medium businesses (SMBs). Approximately 78% of SMBs are currently using cloud services, with 39% of these businesses spending up to $600,000 per year on public cloud services.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the best cloud computing stocks to buy now, we relied on Insider Monkey’s extensive database of 920 hedge funds as of Q1 2024.

(NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), known for its e-commerce dominance, has expanded far beyond online retail. This multinational technology company has a diverse portfolio that includes cloud computing, online advertising, artificial intelligence, and streaming services.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a stellar first quarter in 2024, exceeding analyst expectations. Net sales rose 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, highlighting strong overall growth. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing arm, remained a key driver of this success.\n\nAWS revenue grew an impressive 17% year-over-year, reaching $25 billion. Operating income for AWS also jumped significantly, reaching $9.4 billion compared to $5.1 billion in Q1 2023. Profitability across the entire company improved markedly as well. Operating income grew to $15.3 billion from $4.8 billion in Q1 2023. This strong performance translated to a doubling of net income, reaching $10.4 billion ($0.98 per diluted share) compared to $3.2 billion ($0.31 per diluted share) in Q1 2023.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), assigning an average \"Strong Buy\" rating to the stock. The average 12-month price target for Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) sits at $221.55, suggesting a potential upside of over 11% from the current price levels.\n\nHere’s what Mar Vista Investment Partners, LLC said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon’s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.”\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 1st on our list of the best cloud computing stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Best Cloud Computing Stocks to Buy Now to see the other cloud computing stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "I Shopped on Temu: 3 Reasons I'm Not Convinced Temu Is a Big Threat to Amazon",
        "content": "If there's one thing that can attract shoppers, it's the lure of low prices. Combine that with the endless scrolling and the \"influencers\" promoting items that you have on social media, and you end up with online shopping platform Temu. And there's always some sort of promotion on an item on Temu.com, which can give consumers an incentive to spend just a little bit more money once they're on the platform.\n\nSome Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) investors are worried about Temu's growing popularity. While Amazon remains the dominant force in e-commerce, Temu's owner, PDD Holdings(NASDAQ: PDD), also operates online retailer Pinduoduo and has deep pockets, which could potentially make Temu a big thorn in Amazon's growth prospects.\n\nIt sounds concerning, but after using Temu several times, here are three reasons why I'm not convinced it's a big problem for Amazon.\n\n1. Shipping speed is becoming more important, not less\n\nThe big reason Amazon makes sense for many consumers comes down to shipping speed. Over the years, it has accelerated from two-day delivery to next-day and same-day delivery for consumers in some markets. But with Temu, you have to give up that speed for the sake of lower prices.\n\nAnd depending on what you order, it can take anywhere from a week to more than a month for your purchase to arrive. Most of the items I purchased took at least 10 days. There are, of course, third-party sellers from Amazon which can have longer shipping times as well, but users are normally able to filter those options out easily. The standard shipping from Temu reportedly can take between 6 and 22 days, and even if you use express shipping, it's still possible to wait up to 11 days for your shipment to arrive.\n\nAs long as Temu's focus is primarily on low prices and offering free shipping, its shipping speeds are likely to remain far slower than what Amazon can offer, and that can be a deal-breaker for many consumers.\n\n2. Poor quality on Temu only exacerbates things\n\nIf you just need to wait a little longer for your purchase to save money on Temu, it could be justifiable to use it rather than Amazon. But if the product quality is poor or not consistent, then it's not such a good deal.\n\nOn Temu, many merchants sell nearly identical products, and I found it more difficult to discern between them than on Amazon. That creates a problem, because a shopper may end up with a different-quality product than they expect. And this is on a platform already full of low-quality products.\n\nOne item I purchased from Temu, which took the longest to ship (six weeks), was one which I had to return right away. Something as simple as the dimensions were way off compared to what was on the site. I ended up buying a similar product from Amazon and got it delivered the next day, with no issues. While it was a bit more expensive, the process was a whole lot simpler.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere have been more than 20,000 Temu reviews on rating site Trustpilot, and nearly 40% of them give it a one-star rating. Many of those poor reviews center around Temu's slow shipping speed and/or product quality. It's a similar situation on the Better Business Bureau's website, where Temu has a mediocre rating of 2.46, with many consumers complaining about the same types of issues.\n\nThere are quality issues on Amazon products as well, and many merchants may indeed be the same ones on Temu. But when you factor in the sheer number of similar products and throw in the slower shipping speeds into the mix, it can result in a more complex and drawn-out shopping experience, especially if you have to return a product.\n\n3. Amazon Prime's value proposition is simply too attractive\n\nWhat makes it difficult for competing platforms to succeed is the Amazon Prime membership. Since it's packed with many features, including free delivery, video streaming, food delivery, and deals on grocery and healthcare, it's not hard to see why an estimated 230 million subscribers can justify the $139-per-year price tag.\n\nAnd that subscription gives consumers an incentive to shop on Amazon.com rather than using competing sites such as Temu. On average, Amazon Prime subscribers reportedly spend 12% more than non-Prime shoppers on Amazon.\n\nIs Amazon stock a buy?\n\nSo far this year, Amazon's stock is nearly 30% as the e-commerce giant continues to perform well, generating net income of nearly $38 billion in just the past 12 months. The company is no stranger to competition, and yet time and time again consumers appear to go back to its platform as the go-to option for online purchases. Whether it's Alibaba, Wish (which ContextLogic owns), or Temu, Amazon has been able to succeed despite several low-priced competitors trying to wrestle away market share from its site.\n\nAmazon's business is broader than that, of course, as it has gotten into chatbots and artificial intelligence, and it has a hugely successful cloud business in Amazon Web Services. Its strong position in many industries is what makes Amazon stock a good buy for long-term investors. The stock isn't cheap, trading at more than 50 times earnings. But with a lot of growth potential, this is the type of investment you can buy and hold for decades.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in PDD Holdings right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in PDD Holdings, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and PDD Holdings wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Is Brad Gerstner Bullish on Amazon.com Inc (AMZN) Right Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Best Tech Stocks to Buy According to Brad Gerstner. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other tech stocks.\n\nGerstner is Bullish on Tech in 2024\n\nOn December 1, 2023, Brad Gerstner, the CEO of Altimeter Capital, appeared in an interview on CNBC where he explained that tech stocks are expected to outperform non-tech stocks in 2024. Over the past 10 years, tech earnings have compounded at almost 16% and non-tech earnings have compounded at 6%. 2023 was a rebound year for the tech industry after a downturn in 2022 due to rising interest rates. Big Tech companies and their operational efficiencies have poised them for strong growth. While inflation and interest rates will determine what goes down, companies that have invested in augmented intelligence will experience secular growth. Gerstner thinks that the spread between 16% and 6% will be a recurring trend in 2024.\n\nGerstner Thinks Now is the Right Time to  Invest in Tech\n\nOn June 11, Brad Gerstner made another appearance on CNBC and addressed the speculation surrounding the software industry. Gerstner suggested that despite headwinds, the software industry is still valuable as companies and startups are still making deals. Gerstner believes there are three main reasons for the downward trajectory of the software industry. He thinks that CEOs and CTOs are cautious when it comes to making investments in software. Executives want a clearer picture of the AI boom before making risky investments. Moreover, interest rates are higher than expectations, due to delayed rate cuts and compressing multiples. Lastly, general uncertainty about the future has been detrimental to the growth of the software industry. Gerstner pointed out that since the software industry is trading at 20% below its ten-year average, this may be the best time to allocate stakes in software companies. You can also take a look at the best Robinhood stocks under $20.\n\nGerstner thinks data and databases are extremely vital to AI applications. He thinks that companies using data to power AI are far ahead of companies simply automating services. Big Tech companies have data at the forefront of all their artificial intelligence applications. You can also read our piece on the stocks hedge funds are crazy about right now.\n\nBrad Gerstner is bullish on tech, and particularly software and AI. In Q1 2024, he initiated 6 new positions and also raised his stakes in 2 stocks, ending the quarter with a portfolio of $6.5 billion in 13F securities. With that, let's discuss his top tech stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Altimeter Capital's Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund’s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we’ve also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 28.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAltimeter Capital's Stake Value: $271,887,676\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks seventh on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner. Gerstner increased his position in the stock by 21% in the first quarter of 2021. Amazon Web Services (AWS) revenue expanded by 17.2% in Q1 2024, up from 13.2% in Q4 2023. Amazon claims the growth in generative AI has fueled demand for AWS, as customers are excited to try out new features to enhance their experience. Over the next 2 decades, the company anticipates developing Generative AI products from scratch and on the cloud. Overall, capital expenditures by the company amounted to $48.4 billion in 2023 and $14 billion in Q1 2024. For 2024, the company plans to invest $10 billion to establish two data centers in Mississippi. This is the single largest investment made in the state and will create over 1,000 jobs. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also intends to invest over $5.3 billion in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia and more than $5 billion in Mexico over the next few years. The investment is all0cated to launch new infrastructure regions and provide better choices for end users.\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the most popular stocks among investors, with 302 hedge fund holders at the close of Q1 2024, up from 293 positions in Q4 2023. Total stakes amounted to $60.37 billion. Based on median price targets from 65 analysts, the stock has an upside of 11%, from its current price of $197.85. Analysts hold a consensus Buy opinion on AMZN and the stock has surged 32% year-to-date.\n\nGerstner likes Amazon because of the company’s inclination to efficiency and meaningful expenditure on software. On February 2, Brad Gerstner appeared in an interview on CNBC, where he shed light on his bullish stance on AMZN. He emphasized the role of Amazon Web Services (AWS) in uplifting the stock. He believes that Amazon’s dominant position in retail will benefit from AI as the company would be able to focus on targeted ads. Here are some comments from the interview:\n\n\"I give a tremendous amount of credit to Andy Jassy and the team there they're the market leader in cloud. We talk about them as coming from behind. They have a dominant retail business which is going to benefit from AI, from better targeting, better targeting of ads, and merchandise, and I think Jassy will drive efficiency in that business. Aws is the market leader I was concerned and some others were whether or not Microsoft's early lead and their relationship with OpenAI would force them to leave Amazon and go to Azure to take advantage of the benefits of Openai we didn't see that we saw almost no customer churn.\"\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 7th on our list of the best tech stocks to buy according to Brad Gerstner.

        "title": "3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Now and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology, and many businesses are rushing to capture a piece of this rapidly expanding market. Research outfit Statista forecasts that the AI industry will grow from $136 billion in 2023 to $827 billion by 2030.\n\nAt this early stage of the AI revolution, it can be challenging to identify which companies will be able to successfully capitalize on the opportunities in it over the long run. But among the plethora of businesses battling for dominance in the space, three stand out as compelling AI stocks to buy and hold for years as that market grows: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG), and Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR).\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon may be best known for its e-commerce business, but its use of AI is key to its ongoing success. For instance, the e-commerce giant created an AI tool to make it easy for third-party sellers to list their products on Amazon. They simply enter the URL of the appropriate page on their website into the tool, and AI automatically extracts the products to repost on Amazon's site.\n\nHelping third-party sellers is important since Amazon generates a substantial portion of its revenue from them. In Q1, the various fees Amazon collected from these sellers amounted to $34.6 billion of its $143.3 billion in revenue.\n\nThe firm is also leaning on AI as it develops new technologies. For example, Amazon used AI to develop a system that can accurately identify people based on the vein structures of their palms, so customers can now get their hands scanned and then use their palms to pay when shopping at its Amazon Fresh and Whole Foods stores. Another example is its Alexa virtual assistant, which relies on AI to understand human speech and execute tasks.\n\nThe company's cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services (AWS), provides other businesses with the technology to build and run AI models. Customers are increasingly making use of these AI capabilities, which helped AWS achieve 17% year-over-year sales growth to $25 billion in the first quarter.\n\nAmazon's successes in harnessing AI have already allowed it to achieve a multibillion-dollar revenue run rate from AI, which suggests that these technologies could propel its business forward for years to come.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet has aggressively pursued AI for years. Indeed, as CEO Sundar Pichai has said, \"We reoriented the company around AI.\"\n\nArtificial intelligence is part of the company's strategy to fend off competition and maintain its dominance in areas such as digital advertising, where it holds about 40% of the market compared to Amazon's 7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Amazon, Alphabet is using AI to improve its products and assist other businesses with creating AI models. For instance, AI has been injected into Google Search, Google Docs, and Google Cloud to improve these products and provide new capabilities, such as helping people to write emails.\n\nBut what truly makes Alphabet an attractive AI investment are the company's efforts to create amazing new technologies to solve society's greatest challenges. One example is its use of AI in its efforts to build the technology needed to harness nuclear fusion. Solving this problem would provide humanity with a nearly limitless clean energy source.\n\nAlphabet is capable of funding this type of research because it generates tremendous amounts of revenue and free cash flow. In Q1, its sales rose 15% year over year to $80.5 billion, and it produced $16.8 billion in free cash flow.\n\nThanks to its massive free cash flow, Alphabet can easily afford a dividend, and it finally rewarded investors with its first one ever in Q1 -- a $0.20 per share distribution. Dividends add to the return on your investments, and can provide passive income sources as well.\n\n3. Palantir Technologies\n\nAs a company focused on data analytics, Palantir is in a strong position to make the most of AI. That's because AI requires lots of data to successfully make decisions.\n\nBut harnessing AI isn't just about having a massive trove of data. AI requires that data to be organized and accurate. How can an organization do that?\n\nPalantir's solution is its Foundry Ontology system, which organizes and structures a customer's data by mapping properties and relationships across the data.\n\nAs CEO Alex Karp explained Palantir's approach and competitive advantage: \"We are differentiated because in order to actually make AI work, you need an ontology.\"\n\nPalantir's early efforts were focused on helping the U.S. government in its counterterrorism investigations. From that foundation, it has expanded into commercial markets, and last year, it launched the Palantir Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP).\n\nAIP has been a success, as illustrated by the U.S. Army choosing Palantir to assist in building its first AI-powered military vehicle.\n\nAIP helped drive the company's revenue up by 17% in 2023 to $2.2 billion. And in Q1 2024, sales rose 21% year over year to $634.3 million.\n\nPalantir's Q1 performance suggests its revenue growth rate is accelerating. As a result, management raised its full-year guidance and forecast that Q2 revenue would reach at least $649 million, up from the prior year's $533 million.\n\nWith cutting-edge tech in their possession and track records of success, Palantir, Amazon, and Alphabet look like good stocks to buy and hold for investors who want to benefit from the AI industry's coming years of growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Palantir Technologies right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Palantir Technologies, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Palantir Technologies wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Chinese Retail Stocks That Remain a Bright Spot as China Struggles",
        "content": "The Chinese consumer is finally returning to spending, albeit at a slower-than-expected rate. Eventually, once economic confidence is restored, consumers will increase their spending. Green shoots are emerging, making it an opportune time to buy Chinese retail stocks.\n\nThere are two primary reasons for upside. First, China has one of the highest e-commerce penetration worldwide, with an online shopping penetration rate of 83.8%. Due to the high penetration rate, Chinese retail stocks are some of the largest online retailers globally. Furthermore, these retailers are leveraging China’s manufacturing strength to participate in cross-border trade.\n\nSecondly, Chinese retail stocks are trading at significant discounts to their developed market peers. While Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a forward price-to-earnings multiple of 42, these Chinese players are at single-digit and low-teens forward P/E multiples.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEventually, this valuation gap against developed market peers will narrow or close. If these Chinese retail stocks re-rate to similar P/E multiples as their developed world peers, they will easily double from current levels.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccasionally, the market offers undervalued gems with downside protection and substantial upside. As of this writing, Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) presents such an opportunity. The largest e-commerce retailer by sales is dirt cheap at nine times forward earnings.\n\nIndeed, Alibaba is one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy for upside. First, it dominates its home market, China, and key markets across Southeast Asia. Its e-commerce platforms, such as Taobao and Tmall, feature an extremely wide breadth of products. As a result, they enjoy substantial network effects that drive traffic growth.\n\nAt today’s valuation, investors are pricing Alibaba for no growth. However, the company will benefit from growing e-commerce penetration. Furthermore, the retailer is investing to drive more growth. For instance, it’s integrating AI tools on its platform to improve the recommendation engine and personalize the shopping experience.\n\nAnother fundamental driver for Alibaba stock is the attractive shareholder returns. As free cash flow improves, Alibaba has returned a substantial portion to shareholders. On February 8, it announced a $25 billion buyback. Consequently, it repurchased shares worth $4.8 billion in the quarter ended March 31. The buyback activity proves that management is focused on shareholder returns going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nJD.com (JD) JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JD\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com (NASDAQ:JD) is one of the top Chinese retail stocks. Unlike Alibaba, the retailer focuses more on sales of valuable goods such as electronics. By focusing on this niche, JD.com has created a lucrative segment where it’s the leader. Indeed, the company is renowned for its high-quality goods since it sells products from established suppliers and manufacturers.\n\nAlthough sales slumped in 2022 and 2023, recent financials suggest a recovery is imminent, which could boost the stock. In Q1 2024, revenues increased by 7% year-over-year (YOY), driven by robust growth in active users. JD.com’s focus on offering the best selection, speed, quality and price combination continues to attract more customers.\n\nDespite the rebound in growth, JD.com is at a rock bottom valuation. According to Seeking Alpha, it trades at a forward non-GAAP P/E multiple of 8 compared to a 5-year average of 32. The steep discount means it’s one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy.\n\nMoreover, management recognizes the bargain share price and has been aggressively buying back shares. From January 1 to May 15, the company bought back 98.3 million Class A ordinary shares worth $1.3 billion, about 3.1% of ordinary shares outstanding. These buybacks are accretive at these low valuations, making JD stock a buy.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nLastly, one of the best Chinese retail stocks to buy today is Temu’s parent, PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD). This e-commerce retailer has the fastest growth rate due to its market share gains in China and internationally. As it continues to successfully challenge incumbents, the stock will soar.\n\nIn Q1 2024, PDD Holdings again showed impressive execution and profited from an improving macro to achieve a 131% revenue growth. This increase was driven by online marketing and transaction services, which grew 56% and 327%, respectively.\n\nLooking forward, the retailer is investing heavily to support high-quality consumption. To this end, it’s broadening its high-quality supply and working with top brands across the globe. Furthermore, it’s investing in technology tools to reduce seller costs and attract more merchants to its platform.\n\nPDD Holdings also sees a significant opportunity in its international business. So far, since launching its cross-border e-commerce platform in September 2022, it has enjoyed tremendous success. A key highlight has been the strong consumer adoption of Temu in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nDue to its best-in-class growth, PDD Holdings is one of the Chinese retail stocks that deserves a premium multiple. At 11 times forward earnings, PDD stock is a no-brainer buy. Even better, a PEG non-GAAP multiple of 0.50 reinforces that this is an undervalued growth stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Whole Foods is cutting prices and ditching its ‘Whole Paycheck’ aura to appeal to inflation-weary shoppers",
        "content": "Oysters for $1. A $2 discount on rotisserie chickens on Tuesdays. Price reductions on 25% of its assortment. Breaking with its \"Whole Paycheck\" reputation for priciness, upscale grocer Whole Foods has been cutting prices on many of its food items this year in a concession to the punishing toll high grocery inflation has taken on shoppers—even those in the middle and upper-middle class who frequent its emporia.\n\nIn that sense, Whole Foods is pulling a page from the playbook of less-bougie rivals like Walmart, Aldi and Kroger, which are offering shoppers deals too. Food inflation has spared few Americans: With grocery prices up 22% since 2021, spending on food-at-home takes up a bigger chunk of Americans' discretionary spending than it has in 30 years.\n\n\"It seems that customers are gravitating toward where they feel the best deal is right now,\" says Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel, who joined the company in 2014 and became chief executive in 2022.\n\nWhole Foods shoppers are even trading down to less expensive items or choosing Whole Foods' \"365\" store-brand items, he says. Such trends have persisted even as inflation cools. As a result, Whole Foods, with more than 500 U.S. stores and plans to open 30 new ones annually, cannot afford to alienate any customers.\n\nLowering prices is harder than it seems\n\nLowering prices is not easy for the grocer, Buechel says. For instance, Whole Foods' quality standards and animal welfare rules (such as only selling cage-free eggs) give it fewer suppliers to choose from.\n\nAmazon, which bought Whole Foods in 2017, does not break out Whole Foods' revenue in its results. But the grocer makes up the bulk of the tech giant's \"physical retail\" segment, where revenue grew 6% last quarter, outperforming rivals like Kroger. Whole Foods' annual revenue is about $20 billion.\n\nWhole Foods' prices remain out-of-reach for some families, Buechel says, but its new deals are helping \"democratize\" healthy grocery shopping in the U.S. for those willing to shop around the retailer's scheduled promotions. Whole Foods' long-time focus on health foods distinguishes it from some of its competitors, though Buechel laments that healthy food is not more accessible in the U.S. and that many products sold in the U.S. are of a lower quality than those in Canada or Europe.\n\nCombating climate change\n\nBuechel says Whole Foods is also focused on food and agricultural practices that are healthier for the planet. Short-term weather patterns that disrupt food production and transportation have forced Whole Foods to draft backup plans and diversify its suppliers, as it did last year with leafy greens and berries. In the long term, climate change will affect not just how the grocer sources its food but which food it can source. \"The issue that we're going to run into is that the products that we know and love today may not be available,\" Buechel says.\n\nStory continues\n\nBuechel says growing up in rural Wisconsin to parents who were raised on dairy farms has given him special affinity and understanding of the agricultural world. Prior to Whole Foods, he had worked on tech for retailers at Accenture for 12 years.\n\n\"If we don't do something different, [climate change] is going to significantly impact yields of what we're growing and the quality of the products we are putting into the marketplace,\" Buechel says. One change Whole Foods has implemented is working with some suppliers on \"regenerative agriculture,\" which aims to restore soils degraded by overuse. Currently, Whole Foods sells some 350 items that result from regenerative agriculture.\n\nGo woke, go broke?\n\nAs a company that promotes sustainability and healthful eating, Whole Foods could get drawn into the culture wars. But Buechel says the key is to focus messaging on issues related to the company's business, without pontificating. \"Our focus is to serve our higher purpose so we get involved in issues that are tied directly to nourishing people on this planet. So things like animal welfare standards are a key differentiator for our business and an area where we will lean in,\" he says. \"We're in a world right now where it's easy—no matter what stance you take—[to] create division, and what we want is to bring folks together to celebrate food.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Costco: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Costco(NASDAQ: COST) has grown into an impressive retail stock, delivering growth of 221% over the last five years. That kind of growth is usually reserved for tech stocks and outperforms competitors Walmart and Target. Costco's wholesale business and annual membership have seen revenue soar 59% in the same period. Meanwhile, the company has massive growth potential as it continues to expand abroad.\n\nHowever, just because a company's business is flourishing doesn't necessarily mean now is the right time to buy its stock. While recent growth has benefited current Costco investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones and tanked the value of its stock. COST PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart uses two key valuation metrics to show that two fellow retailers, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), offer significantly more value to investors than Costco. Amazon and Apple's metrics don't exactly make their stocks bargains, but they provide more bang for your buck than Costco, making them worth considering over the warehouse retailer.\n\nSo, forget Costco and consider buying one of these unstoppable stocks instead.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has grown into a behemoth in retail, responsible for 38% of the e-commerce market. For reference, Walmart holds the second-largest share of the market at just 6%. Amazon's reach is so vast that it dominates markets it never intended to. For instance, the online retailer is responsible for 44% of all video game purchases in the U.S., even surpassing GameStop and Apple's App Store.\n\nAmazon's success over the years has given it the financial resources to diversify its business. In addition to e-commerce, the company has become a major factor in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), video streaming, and digital advertising. These markets are expanding quickly, allowing Amazon to lean less on product sales and more on digital ventures that offer higher profit margins.\n\nThe company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has quickly become its most profitable division and grants it a promising role in AI. Businesses are increasingly turning to cloud services to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, AWS is the world's biggest cloud platform.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS reported revenue growth of 17% year over year, while operating income nearly doubled to surpass $9 billion (or 60% of Amazon's total operating income).\n\nOver the last year, Amazon's business has exploded, leading its free cash flow to soar more than 1,000%. The company is on a growth trajectory that is too good to pass up, with its stock a better buy than Costco this month.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Costco and Amazon, Apple has built up immense brand loyalty with consumers over the years. The company leads the consumer tech market with the popularity of its products. Its dominance in the industry is most prevalent by its third-largest market share in the e-commerce industry, which it has achieved despite offering a significantly smaller product range than the industry's leaders (Amazon and Walmart).\n\nApple has faced headwinds over the last year as declines in product sales have concerned investors and seen its price trickle up just 12% in the last 12 months. The figure is less than half the S&P 500's 26% rise in the same period, though the tech giant has a reputation for often outperforming the index.\n\nHowever, a loyal user base and vast financial resources suggest that Apple will come back strong over the long term. The company hit $102 billion in free cash flow last year, more than rivals like Microsoft, Alphabet, or even Amazon. The figure indicates Apple has the funds to keep investing in its business and overcome current headwinds.\n\nIn 2024, the tech giant has expanded into two burgeoning sectors: AI and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). These markets are projected to expand at compound annual growth rates of 37% and 27% through 2030, illustrating Apple's massive potential.\n\nAt the start of this year, the company launched its first VR/AR headset with the Vision Pro and is reportedly working on a cheaper version that will be more accessible to the average consumer. Meanwhile, the company is investing in AI, announcing Apple Intelligence earlier this month. The AI platform will bring generative features across its product lineup and could boost sales as consumers update devices to access Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple is a no-brainer for anyone looking for an alternative to Costco's stock and could deliver significant gains as it expands its product lineup in the coming years. And that's before considering promising positions in digital services and fintech, which could further drive earnings growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

Representatives for both companies declined to disclose financial terms, and Amazon declined to say how many Adept workers the company hired.\n\nAdept raised $350 million at a valuation of at least $1 billion in March of last year from investors including General Catalyst and Spark Capital, Forbes previously reported. In a blog post Friday announcing the deal, Adept said its plan to focus on building both foundational AI models and a tool for businesses “would’ve required spending significant attention on fundraising for our foundation models, rather than bringing to life our agent vision.”\n\nWith the staff that remains, Adept will continue to operate separately with a more product-focused mission, according to Prasad’s memo to Amazon staff.\n\n“David and his team’s expertise in training state-of-the-art multimodal foundational models and building real-world digital agents aligns with our vision to delight consumer and enterprise customers with practical AI solutions.” wrote Prasad in the note to staff. Luan will report to Prasad as the leader of the AGI autonomy team and the automations team, according to the memo.\n\nAmazon’s range of efforts in AI include a shopping chatbot and other tools for its retail sites; AI-models-for-rent sold through its cloud-computing arm; and Prasad’s group, which built the algorithms behind the Alexa voice assistant and was restyled as Amazon’s artificial general intelligence unit in a reorganization last year.\n\nUnlike some of its big tech peers like Microsoft Corp. and Google, Seattle-based Amazon hasn’t focused as much on developing a broader, more ambitious artificial general intelligence, or AGI, that can perform most intellectual tasks as well or better than humans.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Adept agreement also comes at a time that technology companies have stepped up hiring from well-funded AI startups that are building costly foundational models. In March, Microsoft hired a large portion of the staff of Inflection AI and arranged a deal to license its technology for $650 million. That accord has since come under antitrust scrutiny by regulators at the FTC, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nZach Brock, Adept’s head of engineering, will take over as CEO. About 20 employees will remain on Adept’s staff, according to Amazon. Those staying on Adept’s team will continue to work on “solutions that enable agentic AI,” the startup said in its blog post.\n\n--With assistance from Matt Day.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nJapan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back The FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for ‘You’ Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon is reviewing claims that the artificial intelligence startup Perplexity AI is scraping content — including from prominent news sites — without approval.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Samantha Mayowa confirmed Friday that the tech giant was assessing information it received from the news outlet WIRED, which published an investigation earlier this month that said Perplexity appeared to scrape content from websites that had prohibited access from such practices. Perplexity uses servers by Amazon Web Services, otherwise known as AWS.\n\nAmazon’s “terms of service prohibit abusive and illegal activities and our customers are responsible for complying with those terms,” Mayowa said in a prepared statement. “We routinely receive reports of alleged abuse from a variety of sources and engage our customers to understand those reports.”\n\nThe San Francisco-based AI search startup has been a darling of prominent tech investors, including heavy hitters such as Amazon founder Jeff Bezos. But in the past few weeks, the company has found itself in hot water amid accusations of plagiarism.\n\nPerplexity CEO Aravind Srinivas has offered a robust defense of the startup after it published a summarized news story with information and similar wording to a Forbes investigative story. It did so without citing the media outlet or asking for its permission. Forbes later said it found similar “knock-off” stories lifted from other publications.\n\nSeparately, The Associated Press found another Perplexity product invented fake quotes from real people.\n\nSrinivas said in an AP interview earlier this month that his company “never ripped off content from anybody. Our engine is not training on anyone else’s content,” in part because the company is simply aggregating what other companies’ AI systems generate.\n\nBut, he added, “It was accurately pointed out by Forbes that they preferred a more prominent highlighting of the source.” He said sources are now highlighted more prominently.\n\nA spokesperson for Perplexity did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the AWS probe.\n\n________\n\nAP reporters Matt O'Brien and Sarah Parvini contributed to this report.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Stock Like There's No Tomorrow",
        "content": "Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has become a stock to watch, pulling off an impressive turnaround after the tech sector downturn that affected a raft of growth stocks in 2022. The company's share price plunged 50% during that challenging year, but has more than recovered with a 123% gain since Jan. 1, 2023. From the start of 2022 to today, it's now up by about 17%.\n\nThe retail giant has benefited from a series of cost-cutting measures and easing inflation. Amazon's growing cash reserves have allowed it to invest heavily in expanding industries like artificial intelligence (AI) and digital advertising.\n\nThe company is on a promising growth path that makes its stock too good to pass up right now. Meanwhile, its price-to-sales ratio of about 3 indicates it remains a bargain compared to some of its competitors.\n\nHere are three reasons to buy Amazon stock like there's no tomorrow.\n\n1. Stellar retail growth\n\nRises in the cost of living forced millions of consumers to cut back on their discretionary spending in 2022, and the interest rate hikes that the Federal Reserve enacted to fight that inflation set off declines across the stock market. That year, Amazon's e-commerce profits plummeted. However, its retail growth over the last year has shown that Amazon was able to successfully navigate the economic headwinds, and reflects the reliability of its business over the long term.\n\nDespite its expansions into other industries, Amazon's retail-focused segments make up more than 80% of its net sales. As a result, recent growth in its North America and international divisions has significantly boosted its overall earnings.\n\nIn the first quarter, Amazon's revenue increased by 13% year over year to $143 billion, beating Wall Street's consensus estimate by $750 million. The company's North America and international segments posted revenue growth of 12% and 10%, respectively, during the quarter.\n\nHowever, the most impressive result was on the operating income metric. In Q1, Amazon's North America and international segments delivered a combined $6 billion in operating income, a significant improvement from their $349 million in total losses in the prior-year period.\n\n2. A budding digital advertising business\n\nThis year, Amazon ventured into the streaming advertising market when it introduced ads on its Prime Video platform. And only six months later, the move is driving revenue.\n\nIn Q1, revenue from the advertising services segment spiked 25% year over year. This budding business could boost the company's top line for years.\n\nStory continues\n\nA forecast from market research firm Statista projects that the digital advertising market will hit $740 billion this year, and it's continuing to grow. Meanwhile, the massive audience on Prime Video allows Amazon to price ads on the platform competitively. Amazon is charging between $30 and $35 per 1,000 impressions. For reference, Netflix was charging up to $45 per 1,000 impressions on its ad-supported tier, but recently lowered its prices to align with Amazon's. Smaller streaming platforms could have difficulty offering advertisers similar rates.\n\nIn Q1, Prime Video had a leading 22% market share in video streaming, ahead of Netflix (21%) and No. 3 player Warner Bros. Discovery's Max (14%). As a result, the company could have a lucrative future in advertising, further diversifying its business model.\n\n3. Amazon has the cash to flourish in AI AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAmazon's operating income and free cash flow have skyrocketed over the last year thanks to significant gains both in its e-commerce segments and its cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). In Q1, AWS' operating income nearly doubled year over year to $9 billion. That amounted to more than 60% of the company's total operating income, even though AWS brings in the lowest portion of its revenue.\n\nWith its renewed profits, Amazon has gone all in on AI. Cloud platforms are a crucial growth area in AI as companies increasingly turn to cloud services in hopes of boosting their productivity with AI technology. And AWS has a competitive edge with a leading 31% market share in cloud infrastructure.\n\nAmazon has added a range of AI tools to AWS this year, invested billions into building data centers worldwide, and ventured into chip design to create its own AI processors as it seeks to expand its position in that high-growth market.\n\nAmazon's stock has risen by 95% over the last five years. However, given its growth catalysts in multiple markets, it could do even better over the next half-decade, particularly in light of its current low price-to-sales ratio. As such, Amazon is a stock to buy like there's no tomorrow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is continuously making strong efforts to bolster its presence in India. This is evident from its latest fresh capital infusion of Rs 600 crore (about $72 million) into Amazon Pay India.\r\n\r\nWith this investment, the e-commerce giant strives to strengthen its digital payment app business in India. The digital payment market is booming due to the ongoing digitization and increasing adoption of cashless transactions.\r\n\r\nAccording to a report from Statista, the Indian digital payment market is anticipated to generate a total transaction value worth $254.6 billion in 2024. The figure is expected to reach $394.4 billion by 2028, seeing a CAGR of 11.6% between 2024 and 2028.\r\n\r\nAmazon remains well-poised to capitalize on the aforementioned growth prospects on the heels of its increasing investment in its digital payment app.\r\n\r\nThe latest move brings its total investment in Amazon Pay to Rs 950 crore so far this year in India. The company made an investment of Rs 350 crore in February in its payments platform.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Amazon Pay is gaining popularity in the country on the back of the services that it provides, which include bill payments, unified payments interface (UPI) payments, wealth management, ticket booking and insurance premium payments.\r\n\r\nMoreover, Amazon Pay’s tie-ups with platforms like Bookmyshow, Makemytrip, Redbus, IRCTC, and Kuvera are positives.\r\n\r\nAs of May 31, Amazon Pay India had 67.5 million prepaid wallets and processed 623 million transactions worth over Rs 211 crore during the month.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nStrong Investments Aid Competitive Edge\n\nThe Indian digital payment space is highly competitive in nature, given the rapidly increasing number of UPI transactions, which is giving a significant boost to it.\r\n\r\nWith growing Amazon Pay investments, the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company ups its game against peers like Paytm, Alphabet’s GOOGL Google Pay, Walmart WMT owned Flipkart’s PhonePe and Meta Platform’s META WhatsApp Pay.\n\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nAlphabet and Walmart are making concerted efforts to strengthen their presence in the booming digital payment market of India.\r\n\r\nRecently, Alphabet’s Google signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the National Payments Corporation of India to expand the use of Google Pay to other countries. This will allow Indian travelers to make payments in other countries via Google Pay.\r\n\r\nPhonePe is enjoying solid customer momentum on the heels of its digital wallet service, which allows users to make instant money transfers with UPI. In addition to PhonePe, Walmart’s Flipkart unveiled a UPI app called Super.Money, which offers up to 5% real cashback on transactions, pre-approved credit and fixed deposit accounts. Super.Money is currently in the beta stage.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Meta is gaining steam with WhatsApp Pay, which is powered by BHIM UPI and processed by payment partners in India. The app allows users to make payments on the app using UPI apps, debit cards, credit cards and net banking.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon is well-poised to benefit from its expansion spree in India in the near term, as well as in the long haul. Its strengthening competitive position in the digital payment space of the country is a tailwind.\r\n\r\nIn addition, the company’s growing investments to bolster its e-commerce business in India are major positives. Last year, it announced a $15-billion investment in the country over the next seven years. Amazon strives to strengthen its infrastructure in the country with this. Moreover, its pledge to build digital centers in 100 cities and villages in India to help more than 10 million small and medium businesses come online remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAmazon’s growing prospects in the booming India market are expected to aid its overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nFor 2024, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, reflecting growth of 11% from that reported in 2023. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, which has been unchanged over the past 30 days. The EPS estimate suggests year-over-year growth of 57.9%.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "5 Leveraged ETFs That Have Gained in Double Digits in June",
        "content": "Wall Street has been on a solid rally in June, buoyed by the continued artificial intelligence (AI) boom. In the month, the Nasdaq and S&P 500 have risen nearly 6.7% and 4.7%, respectively, while the Dow has gained 2.8%.\r\n\r\nHere, we highlight a bunch of the best-performing leveraged equity ETFs that have gained in double digits in June. These include T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX, T-REX 2X Long Apple Daily Target ETF AAPX, Direxion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2X Shares QQQU, GraniteShares 1.75x Long TSLA Daily ETF TSLR, and GraniteShares 2x Long AMZN Daily ETF AMZZ. These funds will continue to be investors’ darlings, at least in the near term, provided the sentiments remain bullish.\r\n\r\nLeveraged ETFs provide multiple exposures (2X or 3X) to the daily performance of the underlying index. These funds employ various investment strategies, such as the use of swaps, futures contracts and other derivative instruments to accomplish their objectives.\r\n\r\nThe S&P 500 topped the 5,500 level for the first time last week after hitting the 5,400 threshold earlier this month and 5,300 last month, underscoring strong confidence. Technology remained the best-performing sector in June (read: 5 Technology Stocks Powering S&P 500 ETF This Year).\r\n\r\nIn a historic milestone, NVIDIA (NVDA) rallied to become the world's most valuable company, surpassing Microsoft (MSFT) early this month, but was unable to sustain its #1 position. Now, the three stocks — NVIDIA, Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft — are in a race to become the world’s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities. E-commerce giant Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN) also topped $2 trillion in market cap for the first time in the latest trading session (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\r\n\r\nIn the last FOMC meeting early in the month, U.S. policymakers penciled in just one rate cut for this year and indicated four cuts in 2025. Low rates are generally favorable for stocks as they reduce the cost of borrowing, often needed to finance the expansion of companies. Lower rates typically reduce the attractiveness of fixed-income investments like bonds, leading investors to seek higher returns in the equity markets.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF (NVDX) – Up 30.7%\r\n\r\nT-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF seeks to magnify (200%) the daily performance of the NVIDIA. It has AUM of $ 703.3 million and an expense ratio of 1.05%. T-REX 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF trades in an average daily volume of 926,000 shares.\r\n\r\nT-REX 2X Long Apple Daily Target ETF (AAPX) – Up 24.8%\r\n\r\nT-REX 2X Long Apple Daily Target ETF seeks to magnify (200%) the daily performance of the publicly traded common stock of Apple. It has been able to manage assets worth $8.5 million and has an expense ratio of 1.05%. AAPX trades in an average daily volume of 34,000 shares.\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2X Shares (QQQU) – Up 19.7%\r\n\r\nDirexion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2X Shares offers two times the performance of the Indxx Front of the Q Index, which tracks the performance of the seven largest NASDAQ listed companies. It has amassed $9.3 million in its asset base and charges 1.07% in annual fees. Direxion Daily Concentrated Qs Bull 2X Shares trades in an average daily volume of 9,000 shares.\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.75x Long TSLA Daily ETF (TSLR) – Up 18.7%\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 1.75x Long TSLA Daily ETF offers 1.75 times (170%) the daily percentage change of the common stock of Tesla (TSLA), charging 1.50% in annual fees. It has amassed $29.9 million in its asset base and trades in an average daily volume of 448,000 shares.\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long AMZN Daily ETF (AMZZ) – Up 18.7%\r\n\r\nGraniteShares 2x Long AMZN Daily ETF offers two times (200%) the daily percentage change of the common stock of Amazon. It has gathered $15.4 million in its asset base and charges 1.15% in fees per year from investors (read: ETFs in Focus as Amazon Joins $2T Club for the First Time).\n\nStory continues\n\nBottom Line\n\nAs a caveat, investors should note that these products are extremely volatile and suitable only for short-term traders. Additionally, the daily rebalancing — when combined with leverage — may make these products deviate significantly from the expected long-term performance figures (see: all the Leveraged Equity ETFs here).\r\n\r\nStill, for ETF investors bullish on the stock market for the near term, either of the above products can be an interesting choice. Clearly, a near-term long could be intriguing for those with high-risk tolerance and a belief that the trend is the friend in this corner of the investing world.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world’s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades “well into” overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.  QQQ tracks  the Nasdaq-100 Index and it’s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\n\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?\n\nPixabay/ Public Domain\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top holdings of QQQ, which BTIG believes has entered the overbought territory in terms of RSI value. Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has an RSI value of 62 as of June 23. The stock is seen as one of the biggest AI plays in the market due to its AWS business.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon’s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) , our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "The Struggling Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Taking A New Direction",
        "content": "The Struggling Walgreens Boots Alliance Is Taking A New Direction\n\nOn Thursday, Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) reported its fiscal third quarter results and they were not good. Besides coming short of Wall Street estimates, the pharmacy chain revealed it will be closing a significant number of unprofitable stores along with pulling back on its push into primary care. Upon the release of the report, shares tanked as much as 25%.\n\nFiscal third quarter highlights\n\nThe third quarter results reflected the extend of Walgreens’ troubles as it faces worse-than-expected consumer spending, on top of many other challenges.\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 31s, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) pharmacy rival reported revenue grew 2.6% to $36.4 billion, surpassing LSEG’s revenue estimate of $35.94 billion due to strong performance in healthcare. The U.S. health-care unit alone reported sales grew 7.6% YoY to $2.13 billion. The U.S. retail pharmacy segment also grew 2.3% as it brought in $28.5 billion. Pharmacy sales grew 4.4% but retail sales contracted by 4% amid a challenging environment. The international business grew 2.8% YoY to $5.73 billion, with the UK Boots reporting growth of 1.6%.\n\nNet income nearly tripled to $344 million, or $0.40 per share, reflecting better operating income. Adjusted earnings of 63 cents per share came short of LSEG’s estimate of 68 cents.\n\nOnce Again, A Lowered Full Year Guidance\n\nThe full year earnings guidance being cut for the second time. While previously forecasting a range from $3.20 to $3.35, Walgreens now expects them between $2.80 and $2.95 per share.\n\nStepping Away From Primary Care\n\nWalgreens will no longer be VillageMD’s primary care provider as it plans to reduce its stake in the primary care provider. So much for the identity of a major provider in healthcare that the previous CEO, Rosalind Brewer, focused on creating.\n\nHowever, it is not planning to give up on its overseas pharmacy chain Boots or specialty pharmacy firm, Shields Health Solutions.\n\nWalgreens Is At A Turning Point\n\nThe 123-year-old company has been struggling for years with financial pressures burdening its core pharmacy business. Prescription drugs used to be a major sales driver but their revenue growth is shrinking. Pharmacies are also bleeding shoppers to online pharmacies like the one from Amazon.com and struggling with labor agitation from pharmacists. The mighty Amazon is trying to revamp its healthcare offering as it just renamed its Amazon Clinic telehealth service. But Amazon continues its quest to improve the medical care experience.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince last October, Walgreens got a new leader, Tim Wentworth, who made a new team of top executives and is now expected to lay out the details of the strategic pivot he is planning to navigate Walmart through. What Wentworth did state is that retail pharmacy is central to the future of Walgreens, while admitting it must undergo a significant transformation.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "content": "The best robotics stocks to buy are those that will continue to attract investors who are trying to future-proof their portfolios. That’s because the market could to grow 15.91% from $45.85 billion in 2024 to $95.93 billion in 2029.\n\nMoreover, the U.S. robotics industry could reach a valuation of $7.85 billion in 2024, the most internationally. Even better for robotics stocks, institutional investors feel safer about the industry due to President Biden’s 2024 AI Executive Order., which aims to advance AI technology, ensuring its safety, security, and fairness\n\nIn industry developments, the collaboration between NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), and Teradyne (NASDAQ:TER) robotics is improving robot technology. This breakthrough uses NVIDIA’s Isaac robotics platform, which creates self-driving, cooperative robots with AI and modeling abilities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdditionally, humanoid robots improve healthcare and the workplace. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and BMW (OTCMKTS:BMWYY) use these robots for dangerous or repetitive tasks to increase safety and efficiency. Plus, industrial exoskeletons are expected to grow sevenfold by 2030, helping workers avoid damage and exhaustion when moving heavy things or repeating activities.​\n\nWith so much industry activity and a potential $65.59 billion market opportunity on offer by 2028, the time is ripe for investors to consider robotics stocks to buy with strong ratings, upside potential, and robust financial performance.\n\nTeradyne (TER) Teradyne Silicon Valley office\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeradyne is a premier company for testing robots and industrial automation. Each of the last 12 quarters it made more money than forecast, and it’s still growing its share of the industrial robots market.\n\nTeradyne’s first-quarter 2024 earnings were strong. Analysts anticipated $566.31 million, but it made $599.82 million. Additionally, its 51-cent earnings-per-share (EPS) exceeded the 33-cent projections. This came as a result of memory test revenue increases countering mobility sector weakness despite a modest year-over-year reduction.​\n\nTeradyne has also shipped 8,000 J750-powered test devices, a milestone that shows the company’s semiconductor testing expertise and autonomous test capabilities. Teradyne raised its quarterly cash payout from 11 cents to 12 cents.\n\nMeanwhile, Teradyne Robotics goods are getting AI through a relationship with NVIDIA. The agreement uses NVIDIA’s Jetson AGX Orin module for advanced AI applications to make Universal Robots and the MiR1200 Pallet Jack. When combined, this feature makes route planning and self-navigation easier in tough conditions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, Chief AI Officer James Davidson, who started in May, is another change at the top. His knowledge of AI and robotics could give the company’s joint and separate mobile robot sections new ideas.\n\nSymbotic (SYM) stocks to buy: warehouse interior with shelves, pallets and boxes D\n\nSource: Don Pablo / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) provides warehouse automation. The company’s AI-enabled supply line robot technology has grown revenue and added clients, resulting in three profit surprises ranging from 801% to 901% in the previous four quarters.\n\nRecent Symbotic second-quarter fiscal 2024 results showed $424.3 million in sales, above expert predictions of $412.9 million. However, it missed the projected five cents, its net loss per share was seven cents. Quarterly Symbotic adjusted EBITDA was $22 million.\n\nYet, Q2 earnings still surpassed analysts’ Symbotic predictions and ratings for the most part. The company’s strong performance and future possibilities led KeyBanc Capital Markets analysts to raise its fiscal 2024 profits prediction from two cents to 40 cents. Then, due to revenue and gross margin growth, Needham analysts awarded it a buy rating.\n\nSymbotic is constantly improving and expanding its products, including the GreenBox joint effort and BreakPack solution, to sustain profits momentum. These fresh concepts boost the supply chain and help the organization reach more clients.\n\nFor its technology and growth, Fast Company named Symbotic one of 2024’s World’s Most Innovative Companies. It highlights how essential the organization is in modernizing supply chain management using robots and AI.\n\nPTC (PTC) The PTC (PTC) website is displayed on an open laptop.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nPTC (NASDAQ:PTC), a leader in computer-aided design, makes software for realistic 3D, VR, and AR experiences; it boasts eight years of profitability, making it a good choice among robotics stocks to buy. In the second quarter of 2024, it beat the average estimate of 87 cents with an EPS of $1.10. Sales for the quarter were $603.07 million, exceeding expectations of $575.53 million.\n\nIts ranking in the top 32% of 2,279 companies shows that it has a competitive edge and is stable in an extremely competitive field, confirming its status among robotics stocks to buy; PTC has a consensus strong buy rating and a 12-month price target of about $191, which is 8% higher than its current price of $178.\n\nPTC is a star in many areas of technology, and this is well known. The IIoT SPARK Matrix from Quadrant Knowledge Solutions says it has won first place five years in a row. In their CAD Competitive Matrix Assessment, ABI Research also named it an innovator.\n\nMeanwhile, its tools, like Windchill and Codebeamer, are used by large companies like Volkswagen Group (OTCMKTS:VWAGY) to improve their engineering and product lifecycle management.\n\nBut timing is key: PTC is on a robust rise, and first-quarter fiscal 2024 earnings have made the company more expensive than 70% of the industry, so buyers must wait for a decent opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "1 Cathie Wood and Warren Buffett Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock to Buy Before It Surges 28%, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is dominating the technology sector right now, and one company that stands to benefit greatly is e-commerce and cloud computing leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). Roughly halfway into 2024, shares of Amazon have soared by 23% -- handily topping the 15% year-to-date gain of the S&P 500 and the 19% rise of the Nasdaq Composite.\n\nYet even in the wake of this strong performance, Doug Anmuth of JP Morgan Chase thinks Amazon stock could rocket by another 28% over the next 12 months.\n\nAmazon's cash-flow empire\n\nTwo of the most closely followed institutional investors are Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett and Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood.\n\nAdmittedly, Wood and Buffett don't have a lot in common when it comes to their investment styles. Buffett's portfolio is dominated by blue chip businesses with consistent cash flows. By contrast, Wood often takes positions in companies that operate in emerging technologies such as genomics, space exploration, and different aspects of the tech realm.\n\nOne stock that they both own, though, is Amazon. While those positions are relatively small compared to their other holdings, I'm intrigued that these two have any overlap across their respective portfolios.\n\nOne of the reasons that I think both Buffett and Wood own Amazon has to do with its cash flow. Many growth companies (especially in technology) burn cash for long periods in pursuit of accelerated revenue growth.\n\nAmazon, however, now generates a staggering level of profit. For the 12-month period that ended March 31, the company increased its operating cash flow by 82% year over year to $99 billion. Moreover, Amazon's free cash flow over that duration was a whopping $50 billion.\n\nWhile it's the company's robust free cash flow that likely attracts an investor like Buffett, it's how management is investing these excess profits that I think piques the interest of Wood. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThese AI investments should not be overlooked\n\nLike many of its big tech peers, Amazon has been aggressively pursuing all things AI over the last year or so.\n\nThe first major move the company made on that front was a $4 billion investment in Anthropic, a competitor to OpenAI. In addition, Amazon is an investor in machine-learning start-up Hugging Face. Moreover, back in April, the company announced an $11 billion infrastructure project to build out data centers in Indiana.\n\nI see all of these moves as pieces of a larger puzzle. Namely, all of these assets should play important roles as the company begins rolling out additional AI features across its ecosystem. The Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing platform stands to benefit greatly from these AI investments, as do its legacy e-commerce business and fast-growing advertising operation.\n\nStory continues\n\nShould you invest in Amazon stock right now?\n\nWhile Anmuth's price target of $240 might tempt you to buy Amazon stock, I wouldn't get too hung up on particulars.\n\nInstead, investing in Amazon should be rooted more in a strong conviction that AI represents a new frontier for the technology sector at large. Moreover, allocating a position of your portfolio to Amazon would suggest that you're optimistic the company can emerge as a leader in the AI landscape.\n\nAs I've expressed in previous articles, given Amazon's diverse set of businesses and its ability to leverage AI across its ecosystem, I think the company is going to dominate for years to come. AMZN Price to Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nIf you look at the chart above, you'll notice something interesting about Amazon's price-to-free-cash-flow (P/FCF) multiple. Namely, the metric surged to excessive levels and then disappeared during 2022 and part of 2023. That is because Amazon was burning cash during this period, thereby rendering P/FCF meaningless.\n\nHowever, as the company currently generates consistent cash flow, the multiple has started to normalize. What I find most intriguing about the trend above is that the company's P/FCF multiple of 43 is about half its 10-year average.\n\nThis is hard to believe. Amazon is a much different, larger, and more sophisticated business today than it was a decade ago. However, the valuation trends above would imply that Amazon stock is more reasonably valued today at its current price.\n\nConsidering the long-term tailwinds AI represents, as well as the company's numerous investments in the space and the impacts these could have on its future prospects, I think buying Amazon stock right now is a no-brainer.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent S&amp;P 500 Dividend Stocks Down 20% or More to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "The S&P 500 is near its all-time high, but not all stocks are doing so well. That's especially the case in the real estate sector, where some of the highest-quality real estate investment trusts, or REITs, are trading for 20% or more below their all-time highs.\n\nWith that in mind, here are three excellent REITs, all of which are S&P 500 components, that are worth a closer look while they're on sale.\n\nBuilt for steady income no matter what\n\nRealty Income(NYSE: O) is one of the largest and most popular REITs in the market, with a massive portfolio of properties and reliable monthly dividend income. In fact, Realty Income has a trademark on the phrase \"The Monthly Dividend Company.\" And now, this top-notch stock is down by 35% from its peak.\n\nRealty Income has over 15,400 properties in the U.S. and Europe, and about 80% of the portfolio is retail in nature. But the company acquires properties occupied by tenants that are in recession-resistant and e-commerce-resistant forms of retail. Think dollar stores, drug stores, warehouse clubs, and other properties that tend to hold up well in tough economies. Tenants sign long-term (10-plus-year) leases with annual rent increases built in. All Realty Income has to do is get a quality tenant in place and enjoy year after year of reliably growing income.\n\nTo be clear, the decline in Realty Income is mainly due to the current interest rate climate, as opposed to anything wrong with Realty Income's business. The company's income stream continues to grow predictably, and the dividend has now been raised for 107 consecutive quarters with a 5.9% current yield.\n\nThe world's largest REIT is on sale\n\nPrologis(NYSE: PLD) isn't just the largest industrial REIT in the market, it is the largest real estate investment trust of any kind. And now you can buy shares for more than 35% below its 2022 all-time high.\n\nThe company owns logistics real estate, such as distribution centers and warehouses. If you've ever seen one of those massive Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) distribution centers, there's a decent chance it's a Prologis-owned property. In all, Prologis owns 1.2 billion square feet of rentable space on four continents.\n\nPrologis has fallen recently, and one big reason is oversupply fears in the industrial space, but this should be a temporary headwind if anything. While industrial demand is strong, new inventory is expected to drop considerably in 2024 and 2025, and this should help balance the market.\n\nIn the meantime, Prologis has been a massive beneficiary of embedded rent growth. In a nutshell, industrial property rental rates soared during the pandemic, but because tenants are on long-term leases, the company only benefits as its leases renew. We're still seeing the effects of this -- in the most recent quarter, Prologis' leasing spread on both new and renewal leases was a staggering 69.5% (so, if a tenant was paying $10,000 per month, he or she would be paying $16,950 on average after renewing). This is likely to be a long-tailed trend, and Prologis' income growth could be surprisingly strong for the next several years.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn industry leader with tons of potential\n\nVici Properties(NYSE: VICI) is by far the youngest REIT of the three, and it has held up better than the other two in the rising-rate environment, with its stock down by just 21% from the highs.\n\nIf you aren't familiar, think of Vici as the leading owner of gaming real estate. It owns the real estate of some of the most valuable Las Vegas Strip properties, including The Venetian, Caesars Palace, MGM Grand, Mandalay Bay, and more. It also owns many regional properties, including top-tier properties like The Borgata in Atlantic City and MGM National Harbor in DC.\n\nNot only is Vici likely to benefit from the tailwinds provided by the legalized gaming trend in the United States, which should create acquisition opportunities over the coming years, but the company is just starting to branch out into non-gaming real estate. It recently acquired a portfolio of Bowlero entertainment centers, and aims to continue to look for compelling opportunities in the massive experiential real estate market. With a 5.9% dividend yield that is well supported by its funds from operations, Vici could provide a nice combination of growth and income for years to come.\n\nA great entry point for long-term investors\n\nTo be perfectly clear, I'm not saying that these stocks are going to rebound to their all-time highs quickly. I have absolutely no idea what they'll do over the next few weeks or months, and if the interest rate environment stays elevated, I'd expect them to underperform in the short term. However, these are three reliable income generators with top-notch leadership, and if you measure your investment returns in decades, buying top-quality S&P 500 components like these when they are 20% or more off the highs is an excellent long-term investment strategy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Realty Income right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Realty Income, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Realty Income wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $774,526!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Amazon’s market cap hits $2 trillion as its CFO keeps an eye on AI—and cutting costs",
        "content": "Good morning. Amazon's market cap exceeded $2 trillion for the first time on Wednesday, as its CFO is betting big on AI use—both for potential clients and internally.\n\nAmazon shares this year are up nearly 30%—and over the previous 12 months up almost 50%. Earlier in 2024, Alphabet's market cap hit $2 trillion, but both firms still trail Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia, all of which are worth more than $3 trillion. (Bank of America just raised its price target for Amazon shares to $220 from $210.)\n\n“We believe Amazon is starting to join the AI party, and the Street is taking notice with $2 trillion now cleared and the road to $3 trillion underway,” Dan Ives, managing partner at Wedbush Securities, told me on Thursday. “Amazon is just getting onto the dance floor.”\n\nHowever, on Thursday, Amazon CFO Brian Olsavsky didn’t post on LinkedIn about joining the $2 trillion market cap club—instead he commented on the annual meeting of the company's Finance and Global Business Services (FGBS) unit. FGBS consists of several corporate teams such as accounting, corporate FP&A, and finance operations.\n\n“We heard about fraud prevention, generative AI tools that are improving controllership, forecasting, and more,” Olsavsky writes. “Presenters demonstrated how they work relentlessly to deliver results, invent and simplify, and create better, innovative experiences for our customers.”\n\nAmazon (no. 2 in the Fortune 500) under CEO Andy Jassy has finally hit an inflection point where it can both invest heavily in long-term bets like generative AI while at the same time produce significant profits, Fortune’s Jason Del Rey recently reported. In April, Amazon reported Q1 2024 earnings with revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% year over year and $10 billion in profit.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) revenue in Q1 was $25 billion, an increase of 17% year over year. AWS is now a $100 billion annualized revenue run rate business, Olsavsky said on the April earnings call.\n\nIn the first quarter, “we saw growth in both generative AI and non-generative AI workloads across a diverse group of customers—and across industries—as companies are shifting their focus toward driving innovation and bringing new workloads to the cloud,” he said. Amazon is continuing to see strong demand for AWS, and launched Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered assistant.\n\nOlsavsky, CFO since 2015 and a 22-year Amazon veteran, said during the April earnings call the company remains focused on driving efficiencies across the business to invest in AWS momentum, including generative AI. He added that it's still “relatively early days in generative AI and more broadly, the cloud space, and we see sizable opportunities for growth.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon has been cutting costs and restructuring its business to invest in AI in the long term. From November 2022 to March 2023, Amazon conducted multiple rounds of layoffs, cutting a total of 27,000 employees. In May, the company laid off more than 100 customer service managers working in Level 5 and Level 6 middle management positions both at call centers and virtually, Del Rey reported. Amazon divisions such as AWS, Prime Video, and Twitch have all cut hundreds of employees this year.\n\nHave a good weekend.\n\nSheryl Estrada\r\nsheryl.estrada@fortune.com\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 28, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN and UnitedHealth Group Inc. UNH.\n\nHere are highlights from Thursday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Research Reports for NVIDIA, Amazon and UnitedHealth\n\nThe Zacks Research Daily presents the best research output of our analyst team. Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corp., Amazon.com, Inc. and UnitedHealth Group Inc. These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have truly emerged as the poster child for the market's AI enthusiasm. It is the chipmaker's AI leverage that has made the stock of the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world recently. The stock has lost some altitude lately, on creeping worries about the sustainability of the AI momentum and broader Tech spending trends.\n\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+28.7% vs. +19.8%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nStrong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Robust advertising business is also contributing well. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain a plus.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares have gained +2.1% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of +3.2%. The company’s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nIn June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend. However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corp. and ResMed Inc.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy Before the Coming Boom: June Edition",
        "content": "Despite some headwind macro signals, such as decreased GDP growth and downward jobs data revisions, expectations are still high for the stock market by the end of 2024, making it an ideal time to identify the best stocks to buy. At 41.6%, the allocation of U.S. households in the stock market is at an all-time high.\n\nThat is not surprising as inflation forced people’s hands in search of an inflation hedge.\n\nAs demonstrated by Nasdaq-100 (NDX) outperforming S&P 500 (SPX) at 19% vs. 15% year-to-date (YTD), respectively, investors are prioritizing growth stocks over blue chip stocks. The same trend is likely to continue as AI from Big Tech spills over into the energy sector demand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNotwithstanding geopolitical black swans, much is expected of the Federal Reserve to further loosen financial conditions. Presently, fed fund futures are pricing three rate cuts by the end of the year. In turn, this makes household sentiment more bullish, having increased at the longer-term horizon.\n\nLet’s now look at the top three stocks to buy for the coming boom, each catering to different investor preferences and market opportunities.\n\nUranium Energy (UEC) periodic table concept with black cubes. uranium element is glowing. Uranium stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAfter outperforming the wider market at 68% in a one-year period, Uranium Energy (NYSE:UEC) is down 16% in the last three months. Such a price correction is good news for investors who have missed the initial uranium boat.\n\nAs new energy alternatives are tried, it becomes increasingly clear that nuclear plants will power the future, courtesy of exceedingly cost-effective uranium properties.\n\nOperating in Texas and Wyoming, UEC has several advantages to benefit from bullish uranium winds. First, the company uses an environmentally friendly In-Situ Recovery (ISR) process to extract uranium by circulating groundwater solution through ore rocks.\n\nSecond, UEC has been expanding its portfolio of uranium assets, making it a broader exposure. One such (majority) stake is in Uranium Royalty (NASDAQ:UROY), as a pure-play exposure to uranium prices, making it easier for investors to benefit from fluctuating uranium prices. Furthermore, UEC has a pipeline of resource-stage uranium projects, including in Canada’s Athabasca Basin, following the acquisition of UEX Corp.\n\nIn short, UEC is the largest and most diversified North America-centered uranium exposure for investors looking for stocks to buy. Presently priced at under $6, UEC stock is heading for an average price target of $10.25 per share.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat happens when you plug in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)and PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) models into Latin America? MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI). The e-commerce and fintech company is well-diversified by generating revenue from marketplace fees on its platform, in addition to ads, product sales and classified ads from automotive and real estate listings.\n\nAs a double whammy, MercadoLibre gets commissions on payments volume through the Mercado Pago digital payments platform, which includes interest on loans via Mercado Credito. Combined with the Argentinian shift away from socialist policies, significant growth potential is there.\n\nIn Q1 2024 earnings, MercadoLibre gained 16% year-over-year (YoY) more unique active buyers and 37.6% more fintech monthly active users. The company sold 25% YoY more items, having increased net revenue by 36% to $4.3 billion, and grew its credit portfolio to $4.4 billion, a 46% YoY improvement.\n\nAt the present price of $1,678 per share, MELI stock is above its 52-week average of $1465.50. Tipranks’ aggregation points to $1,920 as the average MELI price target 12 months ahead, making MELI one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco Stock May Be the Market’s Top Recession Pick\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAs retail chains take losses due to sky-high retail theft, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is steadily chugging along in the background. Membership essentials model and benefits make for a strong deterrent and incentive mechanism.\n\nCostco’s wholesale warehouse model at low prices is especially pertinent in the scenario of a hard landing. If a recession occurs, it will be one of the most resilient business models, interest rate cuts or not.\n\nIn June, Costco continued to show strong fundamentals, with net sales having increased by 6.9% for the first 39 weeks to $186.07 billion. Alongside retaining customer loyalty, Costco also ensures shareholder loyalty with a reauthorized stock buyback program worth $4 billion that expires in January 2027.\n\nYear-to-date, COST stock is up 30%. Shareholders can also look forward to occasional special dividend payments, often 10x above the regular payouts. At the present rate, the COST dividend yield is 0.54% at an annual payout of $4.64 per share.\n\nAt the present price of $856.84, COST shares are closing in on an all-time high of $873.96 per share. Tipranks’ average COST price target is $860.58, with the upper ceiling at $975 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "While the economy may have bounced back on paper from the COVID-19 disaster, it’s increasingly looking like we’re headed toward a K-shaped recovery. Per Investopedia, this phenomenon refers to a recovery following a recession (or in this case an acute emergency) where “only certain sectors, industries, or areas of the economy recover.” However, this dynamic may open opportunities in terms of consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nYes, rising inflation and elevated borrowing costs theoretically should crimp consumer demand – and they do. However, not all segments have experienced a prolonged downturn. Further, certain demographics (especially those in higher income brackets) have consistently opened their wallets. That should bode very well for specific consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nIn addition, the other, more negative component of the K-shaped recovery can also boost sentiment for retail enterprises. Yes, people are hurting but that also may translate to increased demand for discount specialists. With this mind, below are relevant consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrankly, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is one of the most boring ideas you can consider among consumer cyclical stocks to buy. In many ways, it’s a “safe” investment. People don’t just go there to shop for discretionary wants. Instead, because they offer bulk food products and other necessities, there’s a fundamental reason to go through its doors. However, Costco runs tend to be adult playgrounds, which makes it an enticing opportunity.\n\nThat’s because you can’t deny the consistency. No, Costco doesn’t generate speculator earnings performances. However, between its fiscal third quarter of 2023 and Q2 2024, the company generated an average earnings per share of roughly $4.04. This print translated to an average earnings surprise – or the magnitude by which actual EPS exceeded the consensus view – of 4.18%.\n\nDuring the trailing 12 months (TTM), Costco posted net income of $7.17 billion or earnings of $16.14 per share. Revenue reached $253.7 billion during the period. For fiscal 2024, analysts on average believe that EPS could rise to $16.64, an improvement of 17.48% from the prior year. Further, the top line could expand by 7.29% to $259.94 billion.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEssentially a pioneer of the e-commerce phenomenon, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has over the years evolved into a disruptive technology juggernaut. Still, its core business involves facilitating the sales of goods through its online marketplace – and business is good. Indeed, Amazon is a beneficiary of the K-shaped recovery. Yes, many households are struggling but there are those who are thriving.\n\nStory continues\n\nIncreasingly, the more privileged members of society are turning to Amazon for their shopping needs. Government data shows that e-commerce as a percentage of total retail transactions has been on a tear since Q2 2022. The trend might not slow down. By how fast we’re moving, we could soon surpass levels seen during Q2 2020. That was when the world had to shop online.\n\nAmazon is a financial powerhouse, which makes it one of the consumer cyclical stocks to buy. In the TTM period, net income reached $37.68 billion or earnings of $3.58 per share. Revenue landed at $590.74 billion in the cycle. For fiscal 2024, experts anticipate that EPS could rise to $4.63. If so, that would be up almost 60%.\n\nOn the top line, sales might see a 13.26% lift to just over $651 billion. It’s difficult to bet against AMZN so I wouldn’t do it.\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy mobile app open screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA clear reflection of the K-shaped recovery among consumer cyclical stocks to buy comes from Chewy (NYSE:CHWY). Sort of an Amazon for pets, Chewy is an online retailer of pet food and other pet-related products. Now, Americans love their four-legged friends, I get that. However, it’s not just a sentiment but rather an economic reality.\n\nDespite the ravages of inflation and high borrowing costs, the U.S. pet industry continues to thrive. The latest data from the American Pet Products Association shows that total industry expenditures hit $147 billion last year. So it was always odd to me that CHWY stock was such a poor performer up until recently. Fortunately, the company released some strong earnings results in Q1 and CHWY rebounded.\n\nSince the start of the year, shares have gained over 30%. To be sure, analysts see risks in the near term. Still, because American pet owners have consistently stood by their animals, I think we could see a strong result this year.\n\nOn paper, experts are looking for fiscal 2024 EPS to hit 25 cents. If so, that would be a massive 175.33% leap from last year. Also, revenue could hit $11.99 billion, a projected increase of 7.59%.\n\nelf Beauty (ELF) a collection of various cosmetic products on a black table\n\nSource: Africa Studio/Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother possible beneficiary of the K-shaped recovery is beauty care specialist elf Beauty (NYSE:ELF). Technically speaking, elf is a cosmetics brand so it might not seem like a perfect idea among consumer cyclical stocks to buy. However, the company’s public profile – provided by Google Finance – states that over half of its revenue stems from its website.\n\nThe juxtaposition of ELF stock is intriguing. On one hand, a cosmetics firm shouldn’t do well in a period of rising prices and elevated borrowing costs. People are legitimately struggling. On the other hand, the favorable component of the K-shape is performing quite well. They’re socially mobile and they’re going on vacations and having a grand ole time. These folks may be boosting elf’s business.\n\nIndeed, ELF stock gained over 46% since the beginning of the year. Still, there could be even more room to grow over the long run. During the TTM period, the company posted net income of $127.66 million or $2.21 per share. Revenue in the cycle reached $1.02 billion.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts seek EPS of $3.43, an increase of 55.09%. Further, sales may rise 26.77% to reach $1.3 billion.\n\nTJX Companies (TJX) An outside shot of a T.J. Maxx (TJX) store in Romeoville, Illinois.\n\nSource: Joe Hendrickson / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the well-known brands within the broad consumer cyclical space, TJX Companies (NYSE:TJX) primarily focuses on apparel retail. Together with its subsidiaries, TJX operates as an off-price apparel and home fashions retailer in the U.S., Canada, Europe and Australia. Fundamentally, it enjoys several relevant avenues.\n\nFirst, the home-buying surge during the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic should benefit the company’s home goods unit. Presumably, a great many first-time homebuyers won’t have too many funds available to spend. So, a discount retailer represents an ideal choice. Second, the apparel line could see increased demand as society normalizes.\n\nFor instance, if return-to-office mandates accelerate, that could translate to increased demand for business casual attire. Again, that may benefit TJX. Encouragingly, the company’s average earnings surprise has come out to a very decent 7.55%.\n\nFor the current fiscal year, experts see a 7% rise in EPS to $4.13. On the top line, sales could rise 3.3% to $56.02 billion. The company also offers a forward yield of 1.36%, making it a conservative and simultaneously relevant idea among consumer cyclical stocks to buy.\n\nDarden Restaurants (DRI) an empty restaurant dining room\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nWhen investors think about consumer cyclical stocks to buy, they’re generally thinking about discretionary retailers. While that’s a big part of the narrative, it doesn’t always have to involve buying stuff. Consumer cyclical also includes the restaurant industry, which brings up Darden Restaurants (NYSE:DRI). Mainly, I’d say that Darden is known for its Olive Garden label.\n\nHowever, what makes the company intriguing is that last year, it completed its acquisition of Ruth’s Hospitality Group. Under the deal, Darden now controls Ruth’s Chris Steak House, a premium restaurant. Therefore, Darden may be one of the most balanced ideas for consumer cyclical stocks to buy. For those who are benefitting from the K-shaped recovery, you have Ruth’s Chris.\n\nOn the other hand, those on the downward sloping segment of the K-shape will likely go to Olive Garden. I’m not casting aspersions – just calling the situation how it is. Whatever the case, Darden has been performing well, with an average earnings surprise of 2.55% in the past four quarters.\n\nDuring the TTM period, Darden posted net income of $1.03 billion or $8.53 per share. Revenue hit $11.39 billion. For the current fiscal year, analysts see EPS rising 7.3% to $9.53. Revenue may bump up 3.9% to hit $11.83 billion.\n\nFive Below (FIVE) storefront of a five below, FIVE Stock\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf there’s one name on this list of consumer cyclical stocks to buy that’s catered to the negative side of the K-shaped recovery, it’s Five Below (NASDAQ:FIVE). Before getting into the granularity, on a broader level, Five offers a compelling business model. It’s a discount retailer but unlike the pure-play dollar stores, FIVE features products that go up to $5, hence the name.\n\nAlso, the company provides a selection of items that range between $6 to $25. So, it’s not just the down-on-their-luck folks that shop at Five; many others – especially those looking for a bargain – do as well. Unfortunately for investors, relevance alone hasn’t been enough. Since the start of the year, FIVE stock dropped more than 49% of equity value.\n\nAgainst bottom-line targets, the company missed analysts’ expectations in the last two quarters. In the TTM period, net income came out to $295.1 million or $5.31 per share. Revenue reached $3.64 billion. For the year, experts are now seeing a 3.5% erosion in EPS to $5.22.\n\nThe saving grace may come from the top line. Analysts believe sales may rise 8.1% to $3.85 billion. It’s a falling knife yet I got to believe the company will make a turnaround.\n\nOn the date of publication, Josh Enomoto did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This article looks at the most expensive place to live in the US. To see the full free list, you can head over to the 26 Most Expensive Places To Live in the US.\n\nAmerican consumers are facing the burgeoning impact of rising prices like never before. The cost of living in the United States has increased significantly since the pandemic, with goods and services that cost $100 before the coronavirus now worth around $120, according to a report in Bloomberg in November 2023. Prices over the last 3-4 years in the country have risen nearly as much as in the decade before the pandemic.\n\nA 2023 survey by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) revealed that more than two-thirds (67%) of the employees felt that inflation was rising at a quicker pace than their income, which reemphasized the stressful impact of the cost of living crisis on American citizens. The figure was up from 58% in Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s last survey held in 2022. To tackle inflation and ensure the financial wellness of its employees, the company last year announced to raise its minimum wage from $22 to $23 and has plans to increase it further to $25 by 2025, which would ensure that all Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) employees make at least $48,000 per year.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) too has been actively making cost of living adjustments to wages of its employees amid increasing cost of living. Last September, it raised the hourly wage of its delivery and warehouse workers to $20.5 per hour from $19. The company has been striving to enhance the financial well-being of its employees for quite some time now, beginning first in 2018, when Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) declared a minimum wage of $15, which was then twice the amount of the federal minimum wage in the United States. While announcing the raise, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)’s executives also stated that they would engage policymakers nationwide to increase the minimum wage within their jurisdictions, at both the federal and state level.\n\nHaving said that, while some companies can increase wages, most others are not able to due to the financial challenges ahead of them. One example of that is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), which after doubling the merit increases for certain employees in 2022, held back on raising the salaries of full-time employees in 2023 citing business priorities and corporate challenges. The freeze in raises has continued for well over a year now at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nLayoffs have also been on the rise in the Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) over the last couple of years, following growing pressure from investors after recording its slowest revenue growth (2%) in six years during the last quarter of 2022. Since then, the company’s stock price has increased 87% from $236.6 per share on January 3, 2023, to its current level of $442.47. Its diluted earnings per share (EPS) also marginally increased from $9.65 in 2022 to $9.65 in 2023. Workforce reductions and a freeze on merit increases have likely contributed to an improvement in the company’s financial performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) last year decided to slash the salaries of its employees between 5-25% depending on their position, due to a lower forecasted sale and loss of market share. Wages of hourly workers remained unaffected. Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s CEO Pat Gelsinger was among those whose salaries got cut.\n\nMethodology\n\nWe have considered consensus methodology to rank the 26 most expensive places to live in the US by averaging city cost of living index scores on two sources: Numbeo and Best Places.

(see more details here). The Most Expensive Place to Live in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nThe most expensive place to live in the US is San Francisco!\n\n1. San Francisco, California\n\nAverage Cost of Living Index: 118\n\nSan Francisco is the most expensive place to live in the US, with the median house prices hovering around $1.3 million within the city. According to Payscale, the overall cost of living in the city is 79% more than the national average, with housing being a staggering 207% more expensive. Therefore, it comes as no surprise to see people moving out of the city or looking for accommodation in San Francisco’s outskirts due to the high cost of living.\n\nTo learn about other places with a high cost of living, check out our detailed report 26 Most Expensive Places To Live in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the cost of living to other business aspects in the industry; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

They handcuffed three men as the operation continued.\n\nThe Thursday morning raid is the latest effort by police to crack down on a wave of cargo truck thefts that have ticked up sharply this year, inflicting huge losses on the retail, logistics and insurance industries.\n\nThieves typically steal truckloads of merchandise worth anywhere from a few hundred thousand dollars to millions of dollars depending on what’s inside. There were 925 reported incidents of cargo theft in the first three months of the year, up 46% from the same period in 2023, according to CargoNet, which compiles theft data used by law enforcement and insurance companies to recover assets. The value of merchandise stolen in the first quarter was $73 million, more than triple the losses from a year ago.\n\nCargo theft is less visible than shoplifting, which is often captured on store surveillance cameras and smartphone videos showing people brazenly leaving stores with carts piled high with merchandise. California, Texas and Illinois are hot spots for cargo theft, according to CargoNet.\n\nThe Santa Ana raid was an attempt to take down a so-called fence, where cargo thieves sell the stolen goods in bulk to other criminals, who in turn sell it to consumers online or in stores, according to the person familiar with the investigation. Shutting down a fence can cool cargo theft by eliminating a place for thieves to cash in their cargo, the person said. Amazon warns customers about the possibility of stolen goods appearing on its website and has posted instructions on how to report suspicious activity.\n\nInside the warehouse, pallets of inventory were stacked floor-to-ceiling. Crates of pet food, nutritional supplements, vacuum cleaners, air fryers and spray-on tan cluttered the building. Police looked for tell-tale signs of cargo theft, including entire pallets of brand new inventory in boxes in good condition. A legitimate retail liquidator would have more of a jumbled mix of products in damaged boxes.\n\nStory continues\n\nPolice estimate they found about four cargo containers of inventory but did not yet have an estimate on its value. The cargo theft unit raided the same property in 2022 and recovered more than $9 million in stolen goods, the person said. Information about arrests and suspects resulting from Thursday’s raid was not immediately available.\n\n“Organized retail crime, such as cargo theft, is an industrywide problem many retailers face, including Amazon,” a company spokesperson said in a statement. Amazon has a sophisticated detection and prevention operation that lets it quickly spot a range of organized retail crime, and helps partners trace items throughout the supply chain, he said. Amazon has helped identify “bad actors,” referrals that have led to arrests and the dismantling of organized crime networks around the world, the spokesperson said.\n\nCargo theft is tricky to solve because unless thieves are caught in the act, it’s difficult to prove the merchandise was stolen, said Keith Lewis, vice president of operations at CargoNet. Organized crime rings have become increasingly sophisticated, graduating from the armed truck robberies depicted in Mafia movies.\n\nToday, tech-savvy criminals monitor logistics industry “load boards,” online auctions matching trucking companies with cargo that needs to be hauled. Thieves can use stolen identities to impersonate legitimate trucking companies, pick up loads of merchandise from warehouses and then vanish, Lewis said. It could be days before anyone realizes the inventory was stolen, giving the thieves plenty of time to cover their tracks, he said.\n\n“In five years, we’re going to look back and think of this as the good old days because this problem is only getting worse,” Lewis said. “The thieves are hooked on the money, and, as we develop better ways to fight them, it seems they’re always two or three steps ahead.”\n\n(Updated with raid details, starting in seventh paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for ‘You’ Perfume Into a Lasting Business Musk’s Population Obsession Comes With a Dark History\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Right now, growth investors are focused primarily on opportunities in the semiconductors and artificial intelligence stocks space. That’s understandable, given how fast technology is advancing in those areas right now.\n\nBut investors shouldn’t lose sight of other technological developments as well. For example, robotics stocks should enjoy considerable growth in the years to come. Particularly since the pandemic, labor costs have spiraled higher which has motivated companies to invest more heavily in labor-saving automation and robotics systems.\n\nA recent research report found that the U.S. robotics market is already a $7 billion a year field, and this is expected to grow to more than $10 billion annually over the next decade. As the overall market continues to expand, these three robotics stocks stand to benefit.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nColumbus McKinnon (CMCO) An image of warehouse automation\n\nColumbus McKinnon (NASDAQ:CMCO) is one of the best ways to access the automation and robotics stocks space today.\n\nThat’s because the company is a one-stop shop offering a wide array of equipment and solutions needed to automate factories and warehouses. There is a massive capital cycle in the industry now. That’s thanks to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which invested heavily in warehouse robotics. Those investments gave Amazon a huge lead in e-commerce fulfillment, and now everyone else is trying to catch up.\n\nThis macroeconomic framework puts Columbus McKinnon in a strong position. It sells the physical gear necessary for building 21st century warehouses, factories and logistics — the conveyor belts, hoists, rigging tools and motion control systems needed to make the automation magic happen.\n\nGiven the surge in labor costs since the pandemic, companies are willing to spend heavily on labor-saving solutions. It’s not just warehouses, either. With the reshoring phenomenon and renewed interest in North American manufacturing, a new wave of smart factories will utilize Columbus McKinnon’s automation solutions for industrial purposes as well.\n\nCMCO stock has pulled back 20% over the past month as traders price in a potential recession on the horizon. These jitters have caused CMCO stock to fall to an attractive entry point at less than 12 times forward earnings.\n\nCognex (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nCognex (NASDAQ:CGNX) is an industrial company which offers investors multiple opportunities to profit from the rise of automation and robotics.\n\nIt is heavily involved in the smart factories and warehouses space. Cognex is also the leader in fixed-mount barcode readers which help shoppers to buy items at a brick-and-mortar store without needing a cashier to ring the purchases up.\n\nStory continues\n\nCognex delivers both organic growth and an ambitious mergers and acquisitions strategy. Last year, it bought Japanese machine vision optics firm Moritex for about $275 million. The largest deal in Cognex’s history, it built on top of the firm’s prior purchase of Sirius Advanced Cybernetics.\n\nCognex earns a large chunk of its revenues from the smart vision for vehicles market, and as such, the company’s revenues declined in 2023 as auto sales dropped. But Cognex is set to return to robust top- and bottom-line growth in 2024. And the company’s pioneering AI-embedded 3D Industrial Vision system should unlock further upside in the months to come.\n\nProcept BioRobotics (PRCT) An image of two medical professionals performing a procedure on a patient\n\nSource: Roman Zaiets / Shutterstock.com\n\nRobotics and automation tools have arguably made the biggest mark on the industrial sector. But it’s hardly the only attractive opportunity — healthcare is another great market for the robotics space.\n\nTo give one example, Procept BioRobotics (NASDAQ:PRCT) is a health care equipment company focused on robotic surgical systems. Computer-aided surgical tools should help improve efficiency and precision for certain types of procedures while also facilitating remote medicine in situations where an on-site surgeon isn’t available.\n\nFor Procept specifically, it manufactures and services the AquaBeam Robotic System. The AquaBeam is an image-guided, surgical robotic system for use in minimally invasive urologic surgery that primarily treats benign prostatic hyperplasia.\n\nProcept gained Food and Drug Administration clearance to launch the AquaBeam in 2017. Business has scaled up quickly, with revenues soaring from $6 million in 2019 to $136 million last year. Analysts expect that to jump to $214 million this year, which would add up to a sizzling 57% year-over-year growth rate.\n\nThe company isn’t profitable yet. But given its huge growth and massive runway, it should be only a matter of time until the company starts generating large cash flows or it is acquired by a larger medical devices company at a sizable premium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in CMCO stock.

        "title": "The 3 Hottest Stock Upgrades From Last Week",
        "content": "The S&P 500 continues to enjoy a solid run as the improving macro environment, coupled with the AI optimism and recent stock upgrades, provides solid support for risk assets.\n\nLast week, Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) increased its year-end forecast for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600, up from the previous target of 5,200.\n\nThis revision by one of the most important financial institutions is attributed to robust earnings growth from five major U.S. technology companies and a higher projected fair value price-to-earnings ratio multiple.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe tech giants Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) have seen a combined surge of 45%, now representing 25% of the S&P 500’s equity capitalization.\n\nGoldman points to upward adjustments in the 2024 earnings estimates for these tech companies and valuation increases driven by growing investor excitement around artificial intelligence. The broker anticipates that stable real yields by the end of the year and strong earnings performance will justify a 15x P/E ratio for the equal-weight S&P 500 Index.\n\nHowever, the upcoming U.S. presidential election in November poses a significant risk to the S&P 500’s levels, as historically, index volatility has increased leading up to the election. Post-election, the trend typically reverses, with the index recovering to higher levels.\n\nThe news that Goldman lifted its target came as Evercore ISI also revised its year-end target for the S&P 500 on Sunday, setting it to Street-high 6,000, up from 4,750. The firm expects an 8% earnings growth in 2023, bolstered by the potential of the AI “revolution.”\n\nAs valuation models are refreshed to account for higher multiples, we look at 3 hottest stock upgrades from last week.\n\nNike (NKE) The swoosh logo for Nike Inc (NKE) is displayed on a wall made of wood panels.\n\nSource: pixfly / Shutterstock.com\n\nNike (NYSE:NKE) is a global leader in athletic footwear, apparel and equipment. Known for its innovative products and strong brand, Nike consistently delivers strong financial performance and growth potential, making it a solid investment choice.\n\nOppenheimer (NYSE:OPY) upgraded its rating for Nike, shifting from a neutral “Perform” stance to a more bullish “Outperform.” Alongside the stock upgrades, the firm also increased its price target for the sportswear giant’s shares from $110.00 to $120.00.\n\nThe stock upgrades come after a period when Nike faced a series of challenges that impacted its sales growth and profit margins. According to Oppenheimer, these difficulties included a mix of external and internal factors that have now been largely accounted for in the company’s current stock price and financial projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm’s analysis suggests that the current market valuation of Nike’s shares and the short-term financial expectations have become “derisked.” This term indicates that the risks previously associated with Nike’s performance are now reflected in its stock price, setting a stage for potential recovery.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nBest Buy (NYSE:BBY) is a leading retailer of electronics, appliances and tech services. With a broad product range and strong market presence, it attracts investors seeking exposure to consumer electronics and retail sectors.\n\nRecently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) upgraded shares of Best Buy, moving the rating from “Neutral” to “Buy.” Accompanying the stock upgrades, the firm also increased the price target for the retailer’s stock to $106 from the previous $85. The stock upgrades come with a positive outlook from UBS on Best Buy’s potential performance over the next 18 months.\n\nUBS identified several factors that could drive the company’s sales upward. These include an anticipated improvement in housing trends, which typically correlate with appliance sales, and a pending electronics replacement cycle that occurs every four to seven years.\n\nMoreover, the firm expects product innovation, particularly involving artificial intelligence, to boost sales by an average of approximately 200 basis points.\n\nFurthermore, UBS highlighted Best Buy’s expansion into new product categories, such as e-bikes and furniture, as a potential growth avenue. The firm predicts that these elements combined could lead to a robust recovery in Best Buy’s sales in the latter half of 2024 and into 2025.\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is a major producer of aluminum, known for its mining, refining and smelting operations. Its position in the industrial metals sector and focus on sustainability make it an appealing investment for those interested in materials and infrastructure growth.\n\nMorgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) revisited its recommendations on mining companies, lifting ratings on Alcoa and Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE:FCX). Analysts upgraded Alcoa from “Equal Weight” to “Overweight,” setting a new price target of $50.00, up from the previous $36.50.\n\nThe stock upgrades come against the backdrop of disruptions in the global alumina supply, which are expected to keep prices elevated. The broker pointed out that approximately 5.9 million tonnes of alumina capacity disruptions have occurred, accounting for about 10% of the global supply outside of China.\n\nThese disruptions, coupled with China’s increased need to import alumina, are anticipated to tighten the global supply and sustain higher alumina prices than historical averages, potentially reaching $500 in the second half of 2024 and $385 in 2025.\n\nThe situation is also expected to constrain China’s aluminum production, despite the country’s plans to restart some operations. Morgan Stanley’s projections suggest aluminum prices could be supported at $1.22 in the latter half of 2024 and $1.12 in 2025. This outlook appears to be a driving factor behind the positive sentiment on Alcoa’s stock.\n\nAdditionally, Freeport-McMoRan received an upgrade from “Equal Weight” to “Overweight,” with the price target being lifted to $62.00 from the former $49.50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nShane Neagle is fascinated by the ways in which technology is poised to disrupt investing.

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including NVIDIA Corporation (NVDA), Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) and UnitedHealth Group Incorporated (UNH). These research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nNVIDIA shares have truly emerged as the poster child to for the market's AI enthusiasm. It is the chipmaker's AI leverage that has made the stock of of the most valuable publicly-traded company in the world in recently. The stock has lost some altitude lately, on creeping worries about the sustainability of the AI momentum and broader Tech spending trends.\n\nThe data center end-market business is benefiting from the growing demand for generative AI and large language models using graphic processing units (GPUs) based on NVIDIA Hopper and Ampere architectures. A surge in hyperscale demand and higher sell-ins to partners across the Gaming and ProViz end markets following the normalization of channel inventory are acting as tailwinds.\r\n\r\nCollaborations with Mercedes-Benz and Audi are likely to advance its presence in the autonomous vehicles and other automotive electronics space. However, its near-term prospects are likely to be hurt by softening IT spending amid macroeconomic headwinds.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on NVIDIA here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Amazon.com have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry over the year-to-date period (+28.7% vs. +19.8%). The company is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and strong content portfolio. Strengthening relationship with third-party sellers is a positive.\r\n\r\nStrong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home products offerings are tailwinds. Robust advertising business is also contributing well. The company’s strong global presence and solid momentum among the small and medium businesses remain a plus.\r\n\r\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. However, macroeconomic challenges remain headwinds. Rising transportation and fulfillment center costs are concerns.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Amazon.com here >>>)\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth shares have gained +2.1% over the past year against the Zacks Medical - HMOs industry’s gain of +3.2%. The company’s top line remains poised for growth on the back of a strong market position, new deals, renewed agreements and expansion of service offerings.\r\n\r\nUnitedHealth’s solid health services segment provides diversification benefits. The Government business remains well-poised for growth in the future. Adjusted net earnings per share are anticipated to be in the $27.5-$28.00 band in 2024, higher than the 2023 reported figure of $25.12. A sturdy balance sheet enables business investments and prudent deployment of capital via share repurchases and dividend payments.\r\n\r\nIn June 2024, management approved a 11.7% hike in the quarterly dividend. However, membership in its global business continues to be a concern. High operating costs due to rising medical expenses are hurting margins. As such, the stock warrants a cautious stance.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on UnitedHealth here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include FedEx Corporation (FDX), DuPont de Nemours, Inc.

FDX's cost-cut initiatives support the bottom line. However, shipping volume-related weakness is a major concern.\n\nProductivity Actions, New Products Aid DuPont (DD)\r\nPer the Zacks analyst, DuPont's cost and productivity improvement actions will support its margins.

        "title": "L'Oreal adjusts global beauty forecast amid China's market volatility",
        "content": "Investing.com - Analysts at Evercore highlighted L’Oreal's (EPA:OREP) decision to revise its global beauty market growth forecast from 5.0% to a range of 4.5-5.0%. This adjustment comes in response to market volatility in China and a \"slightly negative\" 6.18 shopping festival.\n\nL'Oreal's stock has experienced a dip following the announcement by CEO Nicolas Hieronimus. This development aligns with Evercore's anticipation of a pullback in China's beauty sales for June due to timing and consumer sentiment issues.\n\nDespite the downtick in net sales during China's 6.18 shopping festival, gross sales for L'Oreal have reportedly increased, indicating an uptick in promotional activities.\n\nIn the US, L'Oreal's growth is slowing due to a decline in mass makeup sales. However, prestige fragrances continue to perform strongly. According to Circana data, which includes Ulta Beauty (NASDAQ:ULTA) for mass products, L'Oreal-USA's growth is pegged at 2%, slightly lower than in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nReported sales, however, grew by 11% due to the timing of shipments and stronger sales for the Luxury and Professional divisions.\n\nL'Oreal continues to outperform in the US prestige segment, particularly in fragrances and makeup. This is in part due to L'Oreal launching Lancôme and other prestige brands on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Premium, which is now the largest beauty retailer in the US.\n\nAnalysts predict a 5.8% like-for-like sales increase in the second quarter, driven by a 9.7% rebound in Luxury after two quarters of +2-3%, reflecting Hainan destocking.\n\nDespite some anticipated deceleration, Evercore maintains a more conservative forecast of 4.9%.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nL'Oreal adjusts global beauty forecast amid China's market volatility\n\nStocks mixed, bond yields dip after US economic data\n\nNokia considering potential acquisition of Infinera, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Hardware Stocks to Buy for the Artificial Intelligence Era",
        "content": "It’s no secret that the hardware industry stands to gain a lot from the boom in artificial intelligence. After all, it is the continued growth of the tech hardware industry that makes developments, such as AI, more available to the public.\n\nThe global computer hardware market is expected to grow to $914.55 billion by 2028 at a 6.5% CAGR. While this growth comes from a myriad of factors, one of the more notable ones include the expansion of data centers.\n\nAll of the cloud service industry leaders, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), have announced expansions of data centers for the “storage and processing needs” in hosting AI applications. Here are three hardware stocks for AI that I have identified as excellent picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSeagate (STX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSeagate (NASDAQ:STX) is a data storage company that broadly covers the data storage industry. The company’s focuses include cloud storage systems and services, hard drives and solid state drives. Yahoo! Finance has 27 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on STX to be between $55.00 and $119.00, with a mean of $99.60.\n\nSTX did not show strong revenue, but profitability for the company has greatly improved. While revenue suffered a year-on-year loss, net profit margin has increased 106.49% YOY. Evidently, the company’s improvement in profitability is characterized in its 941.13% YOY growth in free cash flow. STX even shows signs of being undervalued with a -11.45 price to book ratio, well below the sector median.\n\nSTX is a great buy beyond the financials. Seagate has partnered itself with Ebay to expand its Hard Drive Singularity Program. By selling refurbished and recertified hard drives on Ebay, this program improves Seagate revenue while also promoting sustainability. Seagate has also launched a new hard drive platform: the Mozaic 3+. The 30 terabyte Mosaic 3+ Exos hard drive has the same carbon footprint as a standard 16 terabyte hard drive, maximizing efficiency and furthering sustainability efforts. STX is one of the hardware stocks for AI that investors have to add to their portfolios.\n\nArista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nArista Networks (NYSE:ANET) is a computer networking company that develops and manufactures components for large data centers and high-performance computing. Yahoo! Finance reports 25 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on ANET between $220.00 and $389.00, with a mean of $323.77.\n\nANET has shown very strong financials for Q1 2024. The company’s profitability has shown great improvement, as earnings per share is up 39.16% YOY. Revenue has shown excellent growth, as seen through a 46.1% YOY net income increase. Management has done an excellent job at increasing revenue while maintaining profitability, with revenue growth being more than double operating expenses growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nArista has partnered with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) to develop an AI data center with lowered job completion times. Specifically, this network will streamline the use of generative AI applications for clients, saving clients’ time and growing ANET’s revenue by being the first choice in AI data centers. Arista has also introduced Universal Network Observability (UNO) on its operational tasks platform CloudVision. UNO improves troubleshooting abilities for clients through AI-driven analysis and recommendations for network issues. ANET is one of the hardware stocks for AI for me because of its advancements and new services that emphasize improving client experiences.\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) The Pure Storage logo at the entrance to its office in Mountain View, California. PSTG stock.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock\n\nPure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) is a data storage platform that aims to simplify IT and offer data security to its clients. The company has approximately 60% of the Fortune 500 as clients. Yahoo! Finance reports 19 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on ANET between $44.00 and $80.00, with a mean of $70.51.\n\nPSTG boasts strong financials for Q1 2024. The company beat revenue and earnings expectations for Q1 2024, having demonstrated impressive jumps in both revenue and profitability. Revenue grew 17.68% YOY and EPS grew a whopping 300% YOY. This profitability growth is even more impressive when seeing the balance sheet, as management has made sure that asset growth has more than doubled liability growth YOY.\n\nPure Storage has made an investment in Landing AI, a visual AI solutions company innovating in the space of Large Visual Models. Additionally, Landing AI develops AI tools that analyze visual data. This aligns closely with PSTG’s goal as a data storage platform, and the companies will share common interests. Pure Storage has enhanced its cybersecurity offerings with improved ransomware recover and AI-based anomaly detection. These innovations specifically boost data security. For instance, the anomaly detection analyzing historical data of client’s anomaly patterns to identify threats faster. PSTG is one of the hardware stocks for AI for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon is about to take on Temu and Shein by copying them",
        "content": "If you can’t beat them, join them.\n\nFacing surging competition from Chinese cheap-stuff marketplaces Temu and Shein, Amazon is preparing to launch a new section of its site for Chinese sellers that want to ship their fast-fashion and lifestyle wares directly to U.S. customers. It could go live later this year.\n\nAccording to multiple reports—The Information got there first—Amazon held a meeting yesterday with the biggest Chinese sellers, detailing the plan. The presentation described a section that’s accessible from the Amazon homepage and targeted at people who will put up with a nine to 10-day delivery time if it means paying bottom dollar. (We’re talking lightweight items that retail for under $20.)\n\nAmazon’s new tactic would closely follow the Temu and Shein playbook by having sellers send their products to a warehouse in China, from which they would be sent directly to U.S. buyers. Currently, Chinese sellers send their products to Amazon warehouses in the U.S.\n\nThe distinction is important because the U.S. has a relatively high “de minimis” threshold of $800 on the value of imported goods—if the value is below the threshold, the item is not subject to import duties. Temu and Shein have both denied that this provision is central to their ability to sell things at ultra-low cost in the U.S., but U.S. lawmakers disagree. A House select committee found that just Temu and Shein’s shipments from their Chinese warehouses accounted for almost of a third of the billion packages that entered the U.S. in 2023 using the de minimis loophole.\n\nIn April, the Biden administration ordered closer scrutiny of de minimis shipments from China, partly to check whether they’re violating the U.S.’s ban on goods produced with forced labor (a common accusation against Shein and Temu, and one that they have strenuously denied). There are also two bills lingering in Congress that would exclude China from the de minimis channel.\n\nThis may be one reason why Beijing just issued draft rules to make it easier for Shein, Temu, and AliExpress—at this point the shining beacons of Chinese e-commerce prowess—to finance the construction of new warehouses outside the country. But if America’s Amazon is also about to get into the game of helping Chinese sellers access U.S. buyers through the de minimis channel, those legislative efforts in Congress could find it a little harder to drum up the support they need to pass. (It's currently unclear whether Amazon’s shipments will use the de minimis channel; I did ask, but an Amazon spokesperson did not answer my question.)\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the other hand, the competition presented by Amazon’s move could further tarnish Shein’s planned IPO, which CNBC said on Monday was set to take place in London, due to lawmakers’ opposition in the U.S. The date for the flotation is not yet clear, but the British human rights group Stop Uyghur Genocide yesterday launched a legal campaign to stop it going ahead at all, due to those aforementioned concerns about forced labor.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "On Jun 26, Amazon.com, Inc.’s AMZN shares advanced 3.9% and breached the $2 trillion mark for the first time in its history. This development makes Amazon the first company in the Zacks Internet – Commerce sub-industry and the fifth company overall to cross the landmark valuation.\n\nOf these companies, Microsoft Corporation MSFT and NVIDIA Corporation NVDA, both of which are valued at more than $3 trillion, are contesting to become the largest company in the world, with NVIDIA briefly surpassing Microsoft in recent sessions. Apple, too, is a $3 trillion company, while Google parent Alphabet is currently the only other company alongside Amazon in the $2-$3 trillion range.\n\nSeattle-based Jeff Bezos-led Amazon has had a fantastic year so far. As of Jun 26, its share price increased 27.4%. It currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) but is expected to be upgraded in the coming months. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nIn May, the e-commerce giant reported first-quarter 2024 earnings of 98 cents per share, surpassing the Zacks Consensus Estimate of 82 cents and the year-ago earnings of 31 cents. Revenues grew 13% year over year to a record high of $143.3 billion and edged past the consensus estimate of $142.5 billion. New generative AI features in its cloud and e-commerce businesses drove its robust growth. In fact, AI optimism has been the single biggest factor that has been driving the revival in mega-cap tech stocks since the onset of 2023.\n\nAmazon expects revenues in the range of $144-$149 billion for second-quarter 2024, suggesting year-over-year growth of 7-11%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate is currently pegged at $150.3 billion. Its expected earnings growth rate for the current year is 57.9%. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for its current-year earnings has improved 11.7% over the past 60 days. The company has a VGM Score of A.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is currently the largest cloud services provider in the world, and Amazon has also invested in AI startups, looking to leverage the AI boom. In 2023, Amazon unveiled new custom-designed chips used in data centers. The generative AI boom is likely to increase demand for AWS as well as the company’s AI-platform building tool\n\nWhile being undeniably pricey, Amazon presently trades at a 40.67 forward P/E ratio. The industry’s forward earnings multiple, on the other hand, is 25.20. This entails that investors believe that the stock can generate more profits in the future.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "ETFs in Focus as Amazon Joins $2T Club for the First Time",
        "content": "Amazon achieved a key milestone on Jun 26, 2024, having topped the $2 trillion market capitalization. This put the tech giant among a select group globally valued at this level, including Microsoft MSFT, Apple AAPL, NVIDIA NVDA and Alphabet GOOGL. Amazon's stock gained 3.9% on Jun 26 to touch a record split-adjusted price of $193.61. The uptick was aided by an AI-led broader tech rally.\n\nAmazon’s achievement puts the spotlight on ETFs like ProShares Online Retail ETF ONLN (24.3% weight invested in AMZN), Consumer Discretionary Select Sector SPDR Fund XLY (22.75% weight), Fidelity MSCI Consumer Discretionary Index ETF FDIS (22.50% weight) and Vanguard Consumer Discretionary ETF VCR (21.89% weight).\n\nBehind Amazon’s Operations and Financials\n\nAmazon reported its most profitable first quarter ever, with a net income of $10.4 billion, marking a considerable improvement from the previous years. The company's stock has benefited from increased investor interest in AI, particularly through its Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS revenues (18% of sales) rose 17% year over year in Q1 to $25.04 billion, which surpassed the consensus mark of $24.3 billion.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding the company’s cloud dominance. AWS is gaining momentum with customers including Boeing, Geisinger, British Telecom, Jefferies, Meta, Roche, adidas, NXP Semiconductors, National Hockey League, ViacomCBS, Boom Supersonic, MercadoLibre, Western Union, Klarna, Old Mutual, Adobe, and Spotify, to name a few. Improving Alexa skills, along with a strong offering of smart home products, are acting as a tailwind.\n\nThe company is gaining considerable momentum with its Prime services, thanks to ultrafast delivery options and a robust content portfolio. Amazon witnessed 11% growth in its subscription services sales, which were $10.72 billion in Q1. The figure beat the consensus mark of $10.68 billion. A robust advertising business is also contributing well.\n\nGrowing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, fintech, healthcare and autonomous driving are some other positives. Apart from being one of the largest e-commerce companies in the world, Amazon’s expanding footprint in offline operations deserves a special mention. AMZN experienced year-over-year growth of 6% in its physical store sales, which were $5.2 billion in Q1. The figure topped the consensus mark of $5.1 billion.\n\nCash-Rich Amazon Invests in AI: Dividends in Cards?\n\nAmazon’s free cash flow has surged to $50 billion on a trailing 12-month basis, while operating cash flow has skyrocketed 82% over the same time period to $99.1 billion. Amazon currently has a price/free cash flow ratio of 41.2.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince it is a high-growth stock, Amazon has been investing huge cash into AI-driven initiatives and fintech. The investment emphasis has mainly been on AI models and a chatbot named Q, which Amazon provides to companies using its AWS cloud computing services.\n\nAmazon has already invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based AI company Anthropic. Plus, Amazon makes and designs its own AI chips to ensure seamless supplies of semiconductors. However, with many of its “Magnificent Seven” peers rolling out dividends lately, Amazon may also kickstart on that move.\n\nCan AMZN Stock Rise Further?\n\nAmazon stock has an upbeat VGM Score of “A.” The stock hails from the Zacks Internet – Commerce industry, which currently ranks in the top 30% out of approximately 250 industries. Because it is ranked in the top half of all Zacks Ranked Industries, we expect this group to outperform over the next 3 to 6 months.\n\nThe Amazon stock is currently trading at about 42.3 times its forward earnings, higher than the industry average of 24.9X. However, its valuation does not seem overstretched, as earnings are growing faster than its share price.\n\nPrice Target\n\nBank of America analysts raised their price target for Amazon from $210 to $220, suggesting further upside potential of 12%, as quoted on Forbes. Before hitting the milestone, the average price target for Amazon was $221.16, as of Jun 25, 2024 (based on short-term price targets offered by 44 analysts). The forecasts ranged from a low of $140.00 to a high of $246.00. The average price target represented an increase of 18.69% from the closing price of $186.34 recorded on the same day.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Target, Walmart and Amazon.com",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 27, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Target Corp. TGT, Walmart Inc. WMT, Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Wednesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nWhere Will You Shop This July: Target, Walmart or Amazon?\n\nAs we approach the midpoint of the year, the retail battleground is heating up with three major players, Target Corp., Walmart Inc. and Amazon.com Inc., all rolling out substantial sales events this July. Each of these retail giants is employing unique strategies to capture consumer attention and drive sales during this crucial shopping period. Let’s dive into the specifics of what each has to offer and analyze their potential impact on consumer spending and market share.\n\nTarget Circle Week\n\nTarget is poised to capture significant consumer interest with the return of its biggest sales event of the season, Target Circle Week. Running from Jul 7-13, this event offers savings of up to 50% on a wide range of items, strategically timed to align with summer and back-to-school shopping needs.\n\nThis annual event is a pivotal moment for Target Circle members, the company’s free-to-join loyalty program. During this week, members will benefit from substantial discounts, personalized bonuses and early access to essential items.\n\nTarget Circle members can now enjoy more convenience with the new Target Circle 360 subscription, offering unlimited access to same-day delivery via Shipt without delivery fees on orders more than $35. This subscription, available at an introductory price of $49 for the first year (regularly $99), is designed to increase convenience for customers and drive repeat business, potentially boosting Target’s revenue streams.\n\nOne of the standout features of Target Circle Week is the Deal of the Day, which includes exclusive daily deals for Target Circle members. For families preparing for the upcoming school year, Target Circle Week offers considerable savings on back-to-school items.\n\nTarget’s industry-leading fulfillment services, including Drive Up, Order Pickup and same-day delivery with Shipt, further enhance the shopping experience. These services not only add convenience but also solidify Target’s competitive edge in the retail sector.\n\nWalmart Deals\n\nWalmart is not to be outdone, with its own massive savings event, \"Walmart Deals,\" running from Jul 8-11. This event promises thousands of deals on popular items, including electronics, home goods, toys and travel essentials, with a special focus on back-to-school products.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart+ members will have early access to shop the hottest deals starting at noon ET on Jul 8, five hours before the general public. The event covers a broad spectrum of categories, ensuring there is something for everyone. This extensive range is likely to attract a diverse shopper base.\n\nCustomers can shop online via Walmart.com and the Walmart app, making it convenient to take advantage of the deals. Walmart’s strategy leverages its vast product assortment and strong online presence, aiming to offer a seamless shopping experience that caters to both early birds and general shoppers.\n\nWalmart’s expansive deal range and early access for members could drive significant sales volumes. The success of this event may further bolster Walmart’s e-commerce growth, an important metric, given the increasing shift toward online shopping.\n\nAmazon Prime Day\n\nAmazon’s Prime Day, now in its 10th year, remains a highly anticipated event, running from Jul 16-17. Prime members will have exclusive access to millions of deals across more than 35 categories, with new deals dropping as often as every five minutes during select periods. Only Prime members can access these deals, driving membership growth and retention. Deals span across electronics, kitchen, beauty, apparel and more, appealing to a wide audience.\n\nAmazon’s approach combines exclusivity with a dynamic and engaging shopping experience, leveraging its Prime membership base to boost sales and customer loyalty. Frequent deal updates encourage shoppers to return multiple times, increasing the likelihood of impulse purchases and higher sales volumes.\n\nPrime members can request access to exclusive deals expected to sell out quickly. Highlighted offers include up to 40% off Sony Wireless Headphones and up to 30% off Peloton products, adding a layer of exclusivity and urgency to the shopping experience.\n\nPrime Day’s exclusivity and engaging deal structure could lead to substantial sales spikes and Prime membership growth. Amazon’s ability to sustain customer engagement and drive repeat purchases will be key indicators of its performance.\n\nWrapping Up\n\nJuly’s retail landscape promises to be highly competitive, with Target, Walmart and Amazon each deploying strategic initiatives to capture consumer dollars. For investors, the success of these sales events will provide critical insights into each company's market positioning and growth trajectory.\n\nShares of Walmart, a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) company, have advanced 30.9% in the past year compared with the S&P 500’s rise of 24.7%. In the same period, shares of Target and Amazon, each carrying a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company, have risen 10.8% and 44.2%, respectively.

Every firm offers different prospects for development and profitability, from digital disruptors reshaping data analytics and financial services to telemedicine pioneers using AI to improve patient care. Stocks that show persistence and flexibility in changing market conditions and the prospect of big profits are drawing increasing attention from the street.\n\nThese businesses, prime examples of this trend, offer state-of-the-art communication solutions and the ability to satisfy the growing need for networking infrastructure and AI. Additionally, they are adept at handling the nation’s financial system. Understanding these companies’ core strengths—such as profitability, revenue growth, technical innovation, and market expansion—provides valuable insight into their potential to create long-term value over the next decade. This makes them ideal investment choices through 2031.\n\nTeladoc Health (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) leads in telemedicine and virtual healthcare solutions. In Q1 2024, cross-selling to Teladoc Health’s current clientele accounted for two-thirds of reservations. The other third came from new customers, suggesting that the company’s broad product line has been used in a successful “land and expand” approach. Further, client interest in the Chronic Care + Bundle options is rising. Introducing new offerings to current customers, like the weight control and diabetes programs, offers substantial cross-selling opportunities and the opportunity to increase income.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMoreover, AI models have been incorporated into almost every facet of Teladoc Health’s operations, including member engagement and provider matching. This integration’s assistance in enhancing member retention and enrollment optimization directly impacts revenue and profitability goals. Significant increases in member engagement have been observed when generative AI is used to produce hyper-personalized content. This indicates a promising new direction for service uptake and retention.\n\nOverall, Teladoc Health’s inclusion on the long-term growth stocks list stems from innovative AI integration and expanding product offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRingCentral (RNG) cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRingCentral (NYSE:RNG) provides cloud-based communication and collaboration solutions.

With that, RingEX aims to improve the employee experience. In the meantime, RingCX provides a feature-rich contact center solution driven by AI that is available globally and includes over 1K functions.\n\nFurther, RingCentral has a wide network of partners, including more than 15K channel partners and strategic partnerships with major international service providers, including Vodafone (NYSE:VOD), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, and AT&T (NYSE:T). This expands the company’s market reach and scalability. Their worldwide service provider network is further expanded through partnerships. Such as the one they have with Optus, the second-largest telecom operator in Australia.\n\nTo sum up, RingCentral is recommended for the long-term growth stocks list due to its AI-driven platforms and extensive partner network, including major telecom providers.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square, Inc. changes name to Block (SQ).

The company’s Q1 2024 total revenue of $43.8 million was a massive rise from Q1 2023 revenues of $7.1 million, indicating an exceptional annual growth rate of more than 5X. This remarkable increase in sales suggests a strong market need for Immersion’s haptic technology. This might lead to the company’s offerings earning a larger market share.\n\nAdditionally, with a growth rate of 108.4%, net income grew to $19.8 million from $9.5 million in Q1 2023. Immersion can efficiently convert sales into bottom-line earnings and effectively control operating expenses. These notable gains in profitability reflect this.

        "content": "Meridian Funds, managed by ArrowMark Partners, released its “Meridian Hedged Equity Fund” first quarter 2024 investor letter. A copy of the same can be downloaded here. Risk assets continued to rise while market volatility remained low in the first quarter, perhaps indicating that investors are becoming somewhat complacent.  In the quarter, the fund appreciated 5.46% (net), trailing its benchmark, the S&P 500 Index, which returned 10.56%. Also, the Fund slightly lagged behind its secondary benchmark, the CBOE S&P 500 Buy/Write Index’s 6.02% return. In addition, you can check the top 5 holdings of the fund to know its best picks in 2024.\n\nMeridian Hedged Equity Fund highlighted stocks like Amazon.com, Inc.

Its focus on streamlining its fulfillment network through regionalization efforts has yielded significant cost savings and efficiency gains. These improvements, coupled with strategic investments in automation and robotics, are expected to further enhance margins and profitability in the coming quarters. We believe the set-up for margin expansion over the coming years is compelling. Driven both by efficiency gains and growth in more profitable businesses like advertising, Amazon continues to invest strategically in innovation and expansion initiatives.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe major indexes may have only chalked small gains Wednesday, but while the generals were sleeping, the soldiers were on the march.\n\nAt the vanguard, moderate losses in large-cap energy and financials were offset by outsized gains in the consumer discretionary sector — thanks principally to Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThis seesaw theme has become a subtle but important market narrative. On days when AI isn't leading the charge, select pockets of strength keep the S&P 500 from more pronounced sell-offs — which itself is holding index volatility near multiyear lows.\n\nThe recent \"plunge\" in Nvidia is instructive.\n\nOnly Monday, the AI poster child closed down 13% from its record high. Surveying social media, you would think Wall Street was burning.\n\nBut during that harrowing three-day slump, a funny thing happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — up only 3% this year versus 14% for the S&P 500 — staged a comeback. Energy perked up, and biotech jumped as forgotten pockets of the market showed signs of life.\n\nThis seesaw-offsetting behavior is everywhere right now in lieu of correlations between even stocks in similar sectors. Stocks simply do not want to move in the same direction.\n\n\"This is a generationally weird US stock market,\" wrote Luke Kawa, a former director of investment solutions at UBS Asset Management Americas now at Sherwood Media.\n\nKawa was specifically referencing Tuesday's price action, in which the S&P 500 managed a 0.4% gain despite 384 of its components closing in the red — a new feat for a data set that goes back to 1996.\n\nSimilar \"firsts\" have been dotting the market statistics recently.\n\nBut none of this detracts from the argument — supported by ample research and history — that it's perfectly normal in a bull market to have gains concentrated in a few stocks.\n\nWinning stocks that enjoy a secular-themed rally get bigger and bigger until the move runs its course.\n\nIn a bull market, when leading stocks falter, other parts of the market that may not be generating hype-filled headlines can rise to the occasion. Sector rotation keeps volatility at the index level low as new winners offset losers. And then, at some point, the music stops and all sectors start selling off in unison, kicking off a new bear market.\n\nKawa tied this to the current market, writing that \"different major groups within the US stock market have been marching to the beat of their own drummers recently, and this dynamic has helped keep the stock market from lurching violently to the downside.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWe're not only currently seeing disparate returns among sectors and industries, but also inside them — even in the megacap tech stocks. In the past six months, if some of them, say Microsoft and Alphabet, are up, Nvidia and Apple might be down. The correlation between directional moves between pairs in this cohort is a scant 43%, Kawa noted.\n\nAll of this zigging and zagging keeps index-level volatility at bay, but Kawa lays out the major risk in this environment: a \"correlated shock\" that is distributed \"among these companies that control so much of US as well as global equity indices.\"\n\nThough the \"big drop\" remains the focal risk, divergences can persist longer than arbitrage investors can remain solvent (to turn an old Wall Street trope).\n\nIn fact, research by the data analytics team at BofA suggests that the current regime of low inter- and intra-sector correlation can persist for years. Stock correlations within the S&P 500 are at historic lows.\n\n\"Multiple years of decorrelation in the 90s as the internet bubble developed suggests that persistence of today's regime remains a risk,\" wrote BofA.\n\nAccordingly, the outsized bifurcation in returns between the chosen AI few and the rest of the market needn't end with a bang.\n\n\"Just because we’re in uncharted waters doesn’t mean we’re heading for a waterfall. It could end up being a lazy river,\" wrote Kawa. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Cloud computing is one of the industries gaining much traction in 2024. Much of this attention stems from more businesses moving away from traditional data centers and servers to cloud services to store data. There is certainly much upside to doing so, such as fewer security vulnerabilities like data breaches and hacks, cost-effectiveness and ease of scale.\n\nThe demand for cloud services will only grow as more businesses shift away from physical infrastructure and toward digital infrastructure. Therefore, these cloud computing stocks to buy are a great opportunity to generate massive profits. There have already been some top performers this year, and with more than six months left, there is still time to get in on the action.\n\nIf you are interested in cloud computing stocks to buy these three are your best bet.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTwilio (TWLO) Person holding cellphone with logo of American communications platform company Twilio Inc.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwilio (NYSE:TWLO) is an American cloud-computing infrastructure company that provides API services that enable developers to integrate communication services, such as messaging, voice and video functionality, into their custom applications.\n\nIts market cap is $9.4 billion, and although that might not be impressive compared to other companies in the cloud computing space, the company has shown immense potential lately.\n\nA great example of Twilio’s potential is its CustomerAI feature, which allows businesses to combine real-time data with AI to understand their customers better. The feature is gaining traction and could become an instant hit shortly.\n\nFurthermore, on the financial front, Twilio is performing exceptionally well. According to its latest quarterly report, its total revenue is up 5% to 10% year-over-year on a reported and organic basis. Non-GAAP income from operations has also risen from $585 million to $635 million, and free cash flow is expected to align with full-year non-GAAP income from operations.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background..

It has a string of other well-known software products, such as the Microsoft 365 suite of productivity applications, the Edge web browser and the Azure cloud computing platform.\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud platform is a giant in the cloud-computing space, with impressive mindshare among users. This has allowed the company to dominate the space, and it is showing no signs of slowing down anytime soon.\n\nA major reason for Microsoft’s increasing mindshare in the cloud computing space is its productivity offering. All its products are interoperable, allowing users to switch between them easily and work more efficiently.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft’s recent quarterly report indicates that the company will not be slowing down anytime soon. According to its earnings release for quarter three of the fiscal year, Microsoft’s revenue has increased by 17%, while its operating income has increased by 23%. Furthermore, its net income has increased by 20%, and its diluted earnings per share has increased by 20% as well.\n\nWhen it comes to cloud-computing stocks, Microsoft is simply a must-buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

Its AWS cloud platform is the largest cloud services provider in the world, giving it a first-mover advantage, which has greatly benefited the company.\n\nWith the demand for cloud services bound to increase over the next few years, Amazon is a no-brainer investment for any investor looking to profit from cloud computing stocks. AWS plays a significant role in the company’s revenue generation and will continue to do so, barring any major upsets in the cloud space.\n\nMoreover, Amazon continues to show progress on the financial front. In its latest quarterly report, the company announced that its net sales increased by 13% to $143.3 billion in the first quarter. Its operating income also increased to $15.3 billion, and its net income increased to $10.4 billion in the same period.

        "title": "3 Beautiful Blue-Chip Stocks You Can Buy for Less Than $100",
        "content": "Are stocks set to rip higher in the second half of 2024? Or will investors be in for a nasty October surprise? Market timing is tricky at any time, but particularly at a time when a single data point can swiftly swing investor sentiment from positive to negative or vice versa. That may be of interest to traders. However, buy-and-hold investors tend to follow a different plan. And that plan frequently includes finding blue chip stocks under $100.\n\nBlue-chip stocks can have their moment, but they’re generally viewed as tried-and-true (read: boring) stocks. They have large market caps, they tend to underperform the markets in bull markets. However, they can also limit losses in bear markets. And they pay a consistent, and often growing, dividend.\n\nAs valuations continue to rise, it’s becoming harder to find blue-chip stocks under $100, but not impossible. Here are three companies that investors should consider no matter what happens during the rest of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlcoa (AA) alcola stock\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlcoa (NYSE:AA) is one of the oldest American companies that continues to be an industry leader in manufacturing bauxite, alumina and aluminum products. How you feel about AA stock will depend largely on how you feel about aluminum demand. Through the first quarter of 2024, consumers suggested that demand was still cautious.\n\nHowever, the long-term outlook for aluminum looks bullish. It’s one of the key materials needed in automotive and renewable energy applications. Both sectors are being dragged down as consumers grapple with a higher cost of living. You can see that in the AA stock price which has been in free fall since March 2022.\n\nBut time has a way of leveling the playing field. That would make investors take a closer look at Alcoa which is expected to return to profitability in the next 12 months as aluminum demand recovers. Analysts are neutral on AA stock, but that could change when the company reports earnings in mid-July.\n\nWalmart (WMT) The blue, white, and yellow Walmart (WMT) logo is being displayed on a small rectangle sign in the grass.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) only makes this list of blue-chip stocks under $100 because of the 3-for-1 stock split in undertook in early 2024. Although stock splits don’t change a company’s valuation, it can impact investor sentiment. That seems to be the case with WMT stock which is up 28% in 2024 as the first half of the year comes to an end.\n\nBut the bigger story here is that Walmart has become a place where more affluent consumers are shopping as they manage through persistent inflation on everyday items. While many analysts may see this as a temporary situation that will reverse with a better economic outlook, I’m not so sure.\n\nStory continues\n\nWalmart has been preparing to better compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) for years. Now that consumers are giving it a try, they may stick with the company for at least some items when the economy improves. And for sure, the company will see a resurgence with its core consumer.\n\nAnd with Walmart, you’re buying a dividend king that has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years with no end to that streak in sight.\n\nPfizer (PFE) Here's How Pfizer Stock (and Pharma) Stand to Benefit From Mylan Deal. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Manuel Esteban / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter a disastrous 2023, Pfizer (NYSE:PFE) stock is starting to stabilize in 2024. The problem for investors is that by stabilizing it means not doing much of anything. That’s because the company doesn’t have much to excite investors, yet.\n\nBy now, most investors know the story. Revenue from the company’s Covid-19 products is down sharply. And it will take some time before the company can get its other pipeline candidates approved.\n\nWhen that will happen is anybody’s guess. But the company’s pipeline includes some of the company’s advancements in mRNA technology and personalized medicine. These are two of the trends that will dominate the biotechnology industry for years to come. And Pfizer is likely to be a formidable competitor.\n\nSo while investors wait for the stock price growth, Pfizer pays a growing dividend with a 6% yield and trades at 11.9x forward earnings. It’s an easy pick among the blue-chip stocks under $100.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

In February, Amazon invested ₹350 crore ($41.9 million) into the platform.\n\nThe retail giant has also invested nearly ₹2,500 crore ($299 million) in Amazon Seller Services, which operates its e-commerce marketplace in India.\n\nSee Also: Labour Ministry Asks Tamil Nadu For Explanation On Why Indian iPhone Maker Isn't Hiring Married Women\n\nAccording to data from the National Payments Corporation of India (NPCI), Amazon Pay is the fifth largest UPI player in India by transaction volume in May, much behind Walmart-backed PhonePe, Google Pay, Paytm, and Cred, holding less than a 1% market share.\n\nWhy It Matters: India’s digital payments market is witnessing a rapid surge, driven by the government’s push for a digital economy and the increasing penetration of smartphones and internet connectivity. Amazon’s investment in its payments business is a strategic move to tap into this growing market and strengthen its foothold.\n\nThe investment also underscores Amazon’s continued commitment to its Indian operations.

        "title": "3 Valuable Stocks That Are Worth the Expensive Price Tag",
        "content": "The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are steadily growing as tech companies lift the market. The past few months have been excellent for investors, with several stocks hitting new 52-week highs. As we end the second quarter, it is time to rebalance your portfolio and put your money into stocks that show strong upside potential for the second half. Cheap stocks do not always make a good bet, and expensive stocks do not always mean high risk. It could be worthwhile to consider expensive stocks worth buying right now.\n\nYes, there is always a risk when you invest in the stock market, but several stocks can be worth the risk. I’ve identified three companies that are making solid progress and are on a rally since the beginning of 2024. There’s no doubt these stocks are expensive, and you’ll be paying a premium for them, but they could keep roaring higher, and even better, there could be a stock split in the future. These stocks are worth the expensive price tag and will help your money grow. Let’s take a look at them.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA leading fintech company, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI), capitalizes on the growing e-commerce market in Latin America. Up 7% year-to-date, MELI stock is on a tear and is exchanging hands for $1,642. It has soared 42% in the past 12 months and over 150% in the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThis fintech company is a Wall Street favorite, and demand for its services will never run out. The company has been able to address the growing need for digital payments, and it generates revenue from the fees and commissions on the payments. This allows it to keep operating costs low while ensuring steady income.\n\nA large population in Latin America does not have access to a bank account, and this is where MercadoLibre is set to benefit. It is making the most of this situation and has delivered impressive growth. Its e-commerce business is similar to Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) in Latin America; despite past challenges, it managed to report impressive revenue numbers.\n\nIn its first-quarter results, the company saw revenue double to $4.3 billion, and active buyers jumped 16% year over year to 53.5 million. The company has opened a new revenue stream through a loyalty program that will offer free shipping in addition to several other benefits. The stock might feel expensive right now, but it has a lot of momentum on its side.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nTrading at $904, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) stock is up 52% YTD and almost 100% in the past 12 months. It has gone from $452 in June 2023 to close to $900 today. With the ongoing rally, it could hit $1,000 very soon. The biotech stock is at a 52-week high but will keep moving upwards.\n\nStory continues\n\nEli Lilly has enjoyed tremendous success from its weight loss and diabetic products, Zepbound and Mounjaro. It reported a 26% YOY jump in revenue to $8.8 billion in the first quarter, driven by these products. Additionally, its Alzheimer’s drug, Donanemab, recently got FDA approval, boosting the stock. These three drugs are blockbusters for the company and generate a significant part of the revenue. Eli Lilly has a massive market for weight loss and Alzheimer’s drugs.\n\nManagement has raised the revenue outlook 2024 from $42.4 billion to $43.6 billion. It currently has a portfolio that caters to diseases that impact a large part of the population globally. Promising products can generate strong growth for the business, and if you are a long-term investor, you could make bigger gains.\n\nThe company has announced a partnership with OpenAI to develop new treatments to combat drug-resistant diseases. The market is very optimistic about the biotech company’s future, and it could report another strong quarter of revenue growth.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nA top retail stock, Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is a great long-term investment. The company sells a range of products at low prices and has a subscription model that has worked in favor of the business. Up 31% YTD, the stock is exchanging hands for $855 and has a long way to go. It is up 63% in the past 12 months and over 220% in the past five years.\n\nThe business has a membership-based model, where consumers pay $60 annually to shop at Costco locations. Management hasn’t raised its fees in a while and isn’t ready to. It generated $2 billion in operating income, with the most coming from membership fees.\n\nIf the company decides to hike the membership fees, it could benefit the business significantly, even if the hike is by $5. Its renewable rate is an impressive 90.5%, which means cancellations or any negative impact could be minimal. At the end of the first quarter, Costco had 73.4 million paid memberships, up 7.8% year over year. As a long-term investor, consider Costco a membership-driven business, not just merchandise sales.\n\nThere is so much more to Costco. It enjoys stellar financials, consumer loyalty, impressive free cash flow and massive expansion plans, which make COST stock a solid bet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Machine Learning Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "The machine learning market is experiencing significant growth, offering promising investment opportunities that could benefit future generations. As of 2024, the market is projected to reach a size of $79.29 billion, with expectations to continue its rapid expansion due to technological advancements and increasing implementation across various industries​. This then forms the backdrop of my list of three stocks that I believe could make one’s grandchildren rich by holding them for the long haul.\n\nNorth America is leading this surge, driven by substantial investments in AI and cloud-based machine learning technologies, making it a hotbed for innovation in sectors like healthcare, automotive, and financial services​.\n\nInvestors looking for machine learning stocks should consider those companies at the forefront of these developments. Firms that are integrating AI into their operations, developing new machine learning models and expanding their cloud-based services are likely to be key players as the market evolves.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo here are three of the best machine learning stocks for investors to buy.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) reported strong Q1 results with revenues of $67.6 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of $66.1 billion. Net income stood at $1.89 per share, higher than the forecasted $1.53 per share. A significant milestone was the declaration of its inaugural dividend at 20 cents per share and plans to repurchase $70 billion in stock\n\nThe company is focused on expanding its artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities and enhancing its cloud services. Key areas of development include AI-driven products, autonomous driving technology through Waymo, and health-related innovations via Verily. Both of these are standout examples of machine learning technology delivering real value to users and investors.\n\nAnalysts anticipate that Alphabet’s earnings will grow significantly in the coming year, with expectations for EPS to increase by 34%. This makes it one of the fastest-growing tech and machine learning stocks in the FAANG acronym, which can of course at least partially be attributed to the explosive growth of AI.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) is a leading software company specializing in big data analytics. It offers platforms such as Palantir Gotham, Palantir Foundry, and Palantir Apollo.\n\nLast quarter, PLTR achieved GAAP net income of $106 million with a 17% margin, marking its sixth consecutive quarter of profitability. GAAP income from operations reached $81 million, reflecting a 13% margin and continuing a streak of operational profitability. Revenue surged by 21% year-over-year and 4% quarter-over-quarter to $634 million,\n\nStory continues\n\nPalantir continues to maintain a strong strategic position in the data analytics industry by leveraging its advanced software platforms and expanding its client base. The company is focused on enhancing its AI capabilities and integrating them into its existing products.\n\nPalantir secured multiple high-profile government contracts, including a deal with the Department of Defense to provide data analytics solutions for military operations. The company has also expanded its footprint in the healthcare sector by partnering with major pharmaceutical companies to enhance data integration and analysis for drug development and clinical trials.\n\nSnowflake (SNOW) Snowflake symbol and logo at the company corporate headquarters in Silicon Valley. SNOW stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nSnowflake (NYSE:SNOW) is a leading cloud data platform provider that enables organizations to consolidate data into a single source for more efficient analysis and data-driven decision-making.\n\nSNOW reported revenue of $828.71 million for Q1 2024, marking a 32.9% increase year-over-year, which exceeded the analyst consensus estimate by 5.31%. However, its EPS of 14 cents fell short of analyst expectations, reflecting a -17.65% surprise against the consensus estimate of 17 cents.\n\nSnowflake deepened its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS to enhance integration and provide advanced analytics capabilities, including machine learning and real-time data processing. The company also acquired DataRobot, a leading provider of automated machine learning tools, to enhance its AI capabilities and offer more advanced predictive analytics solutions to its customers.\n\nThe firm has also been recognized for its innovative approach to data management and analytics. Snowflake was named a leader in the cloud data warehouse market by Gartner (NYSE:IT). These developments lead me to believe that SNOW could lead to long-term generational wealth for investors.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Amazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time. (Nathan Stirk via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time, making it the fifth US company to hit that mark. The bullish sentiment reflects optimism around artificial intelligence and the potential for imminent interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock rose 3.9% on Wednesday to $193.61, putting it in the same club as technology heavyweights Microsoft Corp, Apple, Nvidia and Alphabet.\n\nUS stock indexes have recorded robust gains this year on relentless enthusiasm around AI, optimism around resilience in the US economy and potential easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve.\n\nWall Street was trading near record levels, largely powered by megacap stocks, such as Nvidia and Amazon, whose future cash flows stand to benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple saw its stock coast in premarket on Thursday, after having gained 2% in yesterday's session as it rides out a competition probe under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrussels has accused the computing giant of stifling competition with practices in its App Store, marking the first enforcement actions under the new digital rules. The European Commission said earlier this week it was concerned about how Apple's controls on developers limits their ability to “freely steer their customers” to options outside of the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, as the tech giant pushes into new tech, Rosenblatt has upgraded Apple to 'buy' from 'neutral' and increased its price target to $260 per share, citing the company's privacy-focused AI initiatives.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed after yen hits 38-year low against dollar\n\nMicron (MU)\n\nChipmaker Micron was hit by AI jitters on Thursday, with its stock 6.8% lower in premarket. The company beat Q3 estimates for revenue but stumbled when it came to forecasts — disappointing investors.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $7.6bn, plus or minus $200m, for the current quarter, compared with an estimate of $7.6bn, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's results usually act as a weather vane for earnings in the chip sector, as it acts as an indicator of demand for various types of chips and end-markets.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla stock was down in premarket trade on Thursday, after gaining 4.8% in Wednesday's session. The electric vehicle maker gained this week, despite news that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall — 11,688 trucks — which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nThe moves also comes after Musk clinched a reported $210bn valuation for SpaceX. Bloomberg reported the valuation earlier today, following an insight into the value of insider shares being sold in a tender offer.\n\nWatch: Amazon's $2tn market cap, consumer spending: Asking for a trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the major market trends of the trading day.</p>\\n<p>As inflation has put consumers under pressure, Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva provides insight into <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/top-trends-among-americans-dine-212125686.html\\\">Americans' dining preferences</a>.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the number one company in terms of market valuation and it can now become “number on-er,” Truist Securities analysts said in a Wednesday note.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia’s market cap climbed to $3.34 trillion, overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world’s most valuable public company. However, the chipmaker’s shares then fell in several consecutive sessions, losing the top position.\n\n“We considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA's #1 market cap position,” Truist analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, the firm said its comprehensive analysis of the data indicates “that becoming the largest company by market cap does not appear to systematically challenge future investment returns.”\n\nTruist evaluated the investment returns and valuations of stocks that have achieved the largest market capitalization over the past 26 years. These stocks include Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe analysis revealed that most of these stocks underperformed relative to the S&P 500 index over short-term periods of one week, one month, and three months following their initial ascent to the top market cap position. However, in the longer term, the stocks generally outperformed the S&P 500 over one-year, three-year, and five-year periods, the investment bank noted.\n\nOverall, analysts continue to view NVDA as the top choice for investing in the AI theme. Citing recent feedback from industry contacts, including component buyers and sellers, they note that there is ongoing and broadening demand for Nvidia's GPU systems. While Blackwell systems are particularly favored, Hopper systems are also being well received.\n\nWithin this, the investment bank raised its price target on NVDA shares from $128 to $140.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTruist raises Nvidia stock target: 'Number one can become number one-er'\n\nRivian investors to seek details on path to profits at investor day\n\nHedge funds 'aggressively' sold tech stocks in June - Goldman Sachs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway have turned the conglomerate into one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap topping $880 billion (as of June 23). It hasn't happened overnight; it's been the result of decades of strategic investments and patience.\n\nConsidering Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's investing success, it's not a surprise that their stock portfolio has become a go-to for investors looking for stock inspiration.\n\nKeeping in mind that your portfolio should reflect your financial situation and not necessarily that of a billionaire and nine-figure company, there are still stocks worth considering from their portfolios. The following three companies are great buys right now for long-term investors.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett was admittedly hesitant to sign off on at first, but it's always better late than never -- especially considering how rewarding it has been to investors.\n\nAmazon has already cemented itself as the leader of e-commerce, but its true growth will likely come from its cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud platform and Amazon's biggest profit generator, responsible for over 61% of its operating income in the first quarter ($9.4 billion). AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe first-mover advantage of AWS helped it capture a large market share, but competitors like Microsoft Azure have been gaining ground. However, AI advancements could help it with another growth spark. That's not because of AI innovations per se but because of what they enable other companies to do.\n\nAmazon is using AWS to help companies build and deploy machine learning models (SageMaker) and build and scale AI applications (Bedrock). This allows it to capitalize on its top-of-the-line infrastructure without depending too much on internal AI developments.\n\nIt's taking a similar approach with Supply Chain by Amazon, a full-set shipping and logistics service that allows businesses to streamline their operations and efficiently run their own e-commerce businesses.\n\nAmazon has spent years and billions building out its tech and supply chain infrastructure, and now it's leveraging these investments to benefit without relying so much on constant innovation (although that remains a priority). As this approach plays out, Amazon's revenue streams should grow and continue to solidify as one of the top cash cow businesses in the world.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding, making up close to 43% of its stock portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch fuss was made about Apple lagging behind in the AI race, but it's much better to be delayed and thorough than rushed and faulty. Apple has consistently taken this approach when it comes to releasing new products and features.\n\nDuring Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, it announced its own AI: Apple Intelligence. It's not Apple's in-house development; instead, it will integrate features powered by ChatGPT into its operating systems beginning in the fall.\n\nApple's new Apple Intelligence will only be available on its newest model iPhones, iPads, and Macs, giving consumers an incentive to upgrade their current products. This move, and the excitement around it, should help give Apple's revenue a much-needed boost after it has lagged in recent years due to slowing iPhone sales. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAn anticipated rebound in hardware sales will be a great complement to the company's growing services segment, which grew 14% year over year in the first quarter and accounted for more than 26% of Apple's revenue.\n\nApple has already done great at incentivizing customers to remain in its product ecosystem. Add in its growth services like financial and health, and it's bound to be one of the world's top companies for quite some time.\n\n3. Visa\n\nBuffett is a major fan of companies with huge competitive moats, and Visa(NYSE: V) fits that description. Its competitive moat is its vast reach, with more than 130 million merchant locations and 4.4 billion cards in circulation.\n\nAs the world's leading payment processor, Visa stands to gain a lot from the network effect. Potential cardholders go with Visa because it's the most widely accepted card in the world, and merchants are likely to accept Visa cards because they're the most used.\n\nThis network effect has put Visa in a position to expand organically and operate with industry-leading profit margins. V Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe world is becoming more digitally connected by the day, but many countries still operate on a cash economy. As they transition to digital payments, Visa is positioned to capture a significant amount of the growing market.\n\nVisa has shown that it's willing to make the necessary investments to innovate, expand, and remain the industry's top player. You want that from a company whose stock you plan to hold onto long-term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks With the Best Earnings Per Share in 2024",
        "content": "According to Nasdaq Chief Economist Phil Mackintosh, earnings growth drives stock prices over the long term. This assertion is evident as growth stocks with the best earnings per share (EPS) have led the market since it bottomed out in October 2022.\n\nTypically, you find best-in-class EPS growth in innovative companies riding the coattails of a secular trend. That’s true for the growth stock picks on this list. These companies have invested heavily in their growth initiatives. Now, those efforts are bearing fruit and driving remarkable earnings growth.\n\nGiven the artificial intelligence (AI) buzz and growing capital expenditures by the hyperscalers, one major growth area has been data center AI chips. Another growth industry continues to be e-commerce. The shift from physical brick-and-mortar stores continues, driving e-commerce penetration worldwide.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stocks with best EPS are profiting from the aforementioned trends. According to Finviz, they will grow their EPS by over 70% this year. Furthermore, analysts forecast over 25% earnings growth next year. These stocks aren’t done yet, so expect more upside.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has capitalized on a once-in-a-generation innovation: the emergence of artificial intelligence. Over the years, the semiconductor chip company invested in designing powerful chips that could support accelerated computing. Now, it’s reaping the rewards.\n\nNotably, the company has emerged as the undisputed leader in AI chips. Its AI chips are critical in training large language models as well as inference. Due to its technological advantage and lower total cost of ownership, its chips are in high demand. It counts hyperscalers such as Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) as key customers.\n\nCapitalizing on demand, Nvidia revenues have soared over the past year. For instance, revenues for the fiscal year ending January 2024 grew 125%. As a result, GAAP diluted earnings per share surged an astounding 586%.\n\nAnalysts expect this trend to continue in fiscal year 2025 after Q1 earnings highlighted the continued strength in demand. GAAP diluted EPS for the quarter rose 629% year-over-year (YOY), driven by Nvidia’s pricing power and operating leverage.\n\nAs long as Nvidia continues to beat expectations, it will remain one of the growth stocks with best EPS. Wall Street consensus estimates call for over 109% growth in EPS for fiscal year 2025. Demand isn’t slowing and Nvidia will continue marching higher.\n\nStory continues\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) has been a real disruptor in the e-commerce market, taking share from incumbents. In China, it has been grabbing market share from Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) and JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) by offering steep discounts and targeting lower-income consumers.\n\nSimilarly, it’s following the same playbook in developed markets. One good example is its approach in the U.S. It launched its shopping app Temu, which offers heavily discounted items. Then, it followed up with an aggressive marketing campaign with ads at the Super Bowl and across various social media sites.\n\nSince launching Temu, PDD has been in growth mode, blowing past analyst estimates. After growing revenues by 123% YOY in Q4 2023, growth accelerated to 131% YOY in Q1 2024. Even better, net income soared by 246%. These results reinforce why PDD stock is among the growth stocks with best EPS to buy today.\n\nWall Street analysts are also bullish and Goldman upgraded the stock to “buy,” raising the price target from $145 to $184. Analysts Ronald Keung and David Ma increased their 2024 to 2026 profit estimates by 25% to 43% as they see sustained revenue momentum. Even looking at valuations, PDD is one of the top growth stocks with best EPS to buy today. Finviz estimates 77% EPS growth this year, yet PDD stock trades at 12 times forward EPS.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) mercado libre box\n\nSource: tiagogarciafoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) of Latin America is another stock riding the e-commerce wave to tremendous growth. Over the past five years, MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) has grown revenues at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 57%. More growth lies ahead given the potential for increased penetration of e-commerce in Latin American markets.\n\nMELI is among the growth stocks with best EPS based on its growth profile. Over the past three years, EBIT has grown at a 109% CAGR. The forward outlook is even more attractive. According to Finviz, the e-commerce giant has grown trailing twelve-month EPS by 82% YOY. What’s more, analysts expect EPS to increase by 77% this year and 35% in 2025.\n\nFundamentally, MercadoLibre is firing on all cylinders and can surpass these estimates. Q1 2024 was another strong quarter as total revenues increased from $3.18 billion to $4.33 billion, a 36% YOY growth rate. Key markets experienced strong growth, with Brazil and Mexico reporting 44% and 55%, respectively, after excluding reporting updates.\n\nLooking ahead, management sees secular opportunities for its e-commerce and fintech business. As more buyers shift online and customers seek simpler financial services, Latin America’s e-commerce leader will soar.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures fell in evening deals on Wednesday, with major chipmaking stocks retreated after memory chip major Micron offered a somewhat middling outlook on earnings.\n\nWhile Wall Street closed higher on Wednesday, trade was choppy as anticipation of key U.S. inflation data and the upcoming Presidential Debate kept investors to the sidelines.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.3% to 5,526.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures fell 0.5% to 19,920.0 points by 19:15 ET (23:15 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.2% to 39,456.0 points.s\n\nMicron slides, other chipmakers follow after mixed earnings\n\nMicron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) fell nearly 8% in aftermarket trade, after the memory chip maker’s outlook for the current quarter somewhat underwhelmed. The chipmaker forecast current quarter revenue of $7.6 billion, in line with estimates.\n\nMicron’s quarterly earnings also blew past market expectations, on strong demand from AI, while the chipmaker forecast a strong profit for the current quarter.\n\nBut the in-line revenue guidance disappointed investors who were expecting more, especially given that Micron more than doubled in value over the past year on hype over AI. The stock also had a strong run-up to its earnings.\n\nOther chipmaking stocks retreated tracking Micron, with market darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) down nearly 2%. Chip designers Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) lost 1% each.\n\nWall Street sees choppy session ahead of more economic cues\n\nWall Street indexes ended marginally higher on Wednesday, buoyed by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) after it announced a major foray into generative AI. The firm also crossed the $2 trillion valuation mark.\n\nBut overall trade was choppy as the summer holidays made for lower trading volumes.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.2% to 5,477.90 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.5% to 17,802.66 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, rising slightly to 39,127.80 points.\n\nInvestors stuck to the sidelines before more economic cues this week, chiefly from PCE price index data, which is the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge. The reading is due on Friday and is likely to factor into the outlook for interest rates.\n\nMarkets were also on edge before the first Presidential debate of the year, between Democrat and Republican front-runners Joe Biden and Donald Trump. The debate is set to take place on Thursday.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures fall, chipmakers sink as Micron underwhelms\n\nBrazilâ€™s Suzano no longer pursuing bid for International Paper- Bloomberg\n\nWall Street ends slightly up, trade choppy ahead of inflation data\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Amazon Stock Popped on Wednesday",
        "content": "Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) climbed higher on Tuesday, adding as much as 4.5%. As of 2:10 p.m. ET, the stock was up 4.1%.\n\nThere were a couple of catalysts that sent the e-commerce titan higher. One was a bullish take from a Wall Street analyst; the other was the unexpected gain on one of its investments.\n\nTop pick\n\nAnalysts at Bank of America said that Amazon remains their top pick among large-cap and FAANG stocks in 2024, according to online investment publication The Fly. The analysts maintained their buy rating on the stock while raising their price target to $220, up from $210. This suggests potential gains for investors of 18%, compared to Tuesday's closing price.\n\nThe analysts noted that Amazon has significant potential for efficiency improvements this year. Despite progress made in 2023, Amazon remains below 2018 levels when measured using a number of logistics-utilization metrics the investment bank tracks. While a rebound in digital retail has been the primary driver so far this year, margin expansion could provide the next leg higher.\n\nThe other catalyst driving Amazon higher today was the company's investment in Rivian Automotive(NASDAQ: RIVN). Amazon owns more than 162 million shares of Rivian stock, amounting to a 16.4% stake. The electric-vehicle (EV) maker has been weighed down by results that weren't as good as Wall Street predicted and a general slowing in the EV market. As a result, Rivian stock was recently down as much as 69% from its all-time high reached late last year.\n\nHowever, Rivian announced it would form a new joint venture with Volkswagen AG, including an investment of up to $5 billion. Rivian stock vaulted more than 20% higher on the news (as of this writing), which boosted the value of Amazon's stake in the company by roughly $415 million.\n\nTime to buy?\n\nAmazon stock has been on fire, up more than 50% over the past year. Investors have been bullish on the rebound in online retail, the company's foray into artificial intelligence (AI), and a resurgence in its cloud growth.\n\nAt less than 3x forward sales, Amazon is attractively priced, particularly when viewed in the light of its multiple growth drivers.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon.com Inc. surpassed $2 trillion in market value for the first time in afternoon trading on Wednesday.\n\nThe push higher for Amazon’s stock market valuation comes a little more than a week after Nvidia hit $3 trillion and briefly became the most valuable company on Wall Street. Nvidia's chips are used to power many AI application and its valuation has soared as a result.\n\nAmazon has also been making big investments in AI as global interest has grown in the technology. Most of the company’s focus has been on business-focused products, including AI models and a chatbot called Q, which Amazon makes available to businesses that use its cloud computing unit AWS.\n\nIn April, Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said that AI capabilities have reaccelerated AWS’ growth and that it was on pace for $100 billion in annual revenue. The unit had slowed down in growth last year as companies cut down on costs amid high inflation.\n\nThe tech giant has also invested $4 billion in the San Francisco-based AI company Anthropic to develop so-called foundation models that underpin the generative AI systems. Amazon also makes and designs its own AI chips.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "You’ve Been Warned! 7 Tech Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "Technology stocks continue to outperform. Despite predictions that a great rotation into value and small-cap stocks is coming, the reality is that large-cap tech stocks continue to drive the market higher. As the first half of the year draws to a close, the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite index is up 20% compared to a 15% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index and a 4% increase in the blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nMoving into the year’s second half, there are a number of technology stocks that look set up for success. While many are already up on the year, they have momentum behind them and catalysts likely to drive their earnings and share prices higher in the coming months. For investors, adding technology growth stocks can be a great way to boost a portfolio and outperform the broader market.\n\nYou’ve been warned! Here are seven tech stocks to buy now or regret forever.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) the amazon logo displayed on a sign outdoors\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has announced it will hold its latest “Prime Day” sales event on July 16 and 17. It will be the 10th Prime Day event held by Amazon and will see millions of products offered at discounted prices. The sales event, which takes place simultaneously in 23 countries, typically gives Amazon’s financial results and its stock a lift during the slow summer months.\n\nInvestors may want to load up on AMZN stock ahead of the upcoming Prime Day and before the shares really takeoff. Amazon stock currently has a Strong Buy rating, with all 42 Wall Street analysts that cover the company rating the shares a Buy. Also, the median price target on Amazon stock is nearly 20% higher than where the shares are currently trading. The consensus view is that this is a tech stock that has room to run.\n\nSo far in 2024, Amazon stock has risen 23%.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Broadcom’s (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock took off after the company announced strong financial results and announced a 10-for-1 stock split that’s taking place on July 12. Now, there are media reports that Broadcom is teaming up with China’s ByteDance, the privately held company behind the social media app TikTok, to develop an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) microchip.\n\nMedia reports say that ByteDance and Broadcom are working on a five-nanometre application-specific integrated chip (ASIC) that will comply with U.S. export restrictions. ByteDance and Broadcom have been business partners since 2022. The Chinese company previously purchased Broadcom’s Tomahawk five-nanometer high-performance microchip.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe ByteDance microchip partnership is just one more reason to consider AVGO stock. There looks to be a buy-the-dip opportunity with Broadcom right now as its share price pulled back 14% at the end of June as the broader semiconductor sector endures some turbulence. Broadcom stock remains up 45% on the year.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) The Coinbase (COIN stock) logo on a smartphone screen with a BTC token. Crypto winter is setting in.\n\nSource: Primakov / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who want supercharged returns and exposure to cryptocurrencies should consider taking a position in Coinbase Global (NASDAQ:COIN). The cryptocurrency exchange reported financial results for this year’s first quarter that showed a surge in profits as trading in Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and other digital assets accelerates. The company reported EPS of $4.40, 303% higher than the $1.09 expected by analysts.\n\nSales in Q1 totaled $1.64 billion versus the $1.34 billion expected on Wall Street. Coinbase, the biggest crypto exchange in the U.S., said the results were due to a steady rise in crypto trading as the price of Bitcoin reached record highs in March of this year. A year earlier, Coinbase reported a loss of $78.9 million, or 34 cents per share. COIN stock has risen 263% over the last 12 months, beating the gains in nearly all other stocks, including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) Image of the Hewlett Packard Enterprise's building\n\nSource: zakiahza / Shutterstock.com\n\nA fuse has been lit under the stock of Hewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE) after that company also reported better-than-expected financial results. HPE stock vaulted 15% higher after the information technology company posted EPS of 42 cents, which beat the consensus expectation among analysts of 39 cents. Revenue for what was the company’s fiscal second quarter came in at $7.20 billion, topping forecasts of $6.80 billion.\n\nBest of all, management attributed the strong results to rising demand for its AI servers, which is what investors wanted to hear. Company executives said they are benefiting from a loosening in the supply of Nvidia’s H100 microchips used in its servers. As a result, AI systems revenue at HP Enterprise more than doubled sequentially to $900 million in the most recent quarter, with more growth forecast.\n\nHPE stock is now up 25% on the year and looks likely to move even higher in the coming months.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother way to play the boom in microchips and semiconductors is with Applied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT). The company makes microchip components used by companies such as Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The company has been a going concern since 1967 and its early products are housed in the Smithsonian Museum.\n\nAMAT stock is up 46% this year and a top performer, thanks, in large part, to rising demand for its products fueling earnings growth. Applied Materials most recently reported EPS of $2.09, ahead of analysts’ consensus estimates that called for a profit of $1.99 per share. Revenue in the quarter totaled $6.65 billion, topping consensus forecasts of $6.54 billion.\n\nThrough five years, AMAT stock has gained 402%, making it a tech stock to buy.\n\nT-Mobile (TMUS) Merger Speeds Up the Comeback of T-Mobile US Inc (TMUS)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nTelecommunications giant T-Mobile (NASDAQ:TMUS) looks like a buy as it moves to acquire the majority of rival U.S. Cellular (NYSE:USM) for $4.40 billion. The purchase includes U.S. Cellular’s mobile phone customers, its network of retail stores and some of its wireless spectrum. T-Mobile said it will use U.S. Cellular’s wireless spectrum to improve internet coverage in rural areas.\n\nT-Mobile is also allowing U.S. Cellular customers to keep their current wireless plans or switch to a new plan. The acquisition is working its way through regulatory approvals and a closing date for the transaction has not been announced. But once complete, the addition of U.S. Cellular should bolster T-Mobile’s telecommunications offerings and earnings. TMUS stock has increased 33% over the last 12 months, including an 11% gain this year.\n\nAirbnb (ABNB) Airbnb (ABNB) logo on phone screen stock image.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe summer travel season is in full swing, which bodes well for Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB). The homestay and short-term rental company sees a noticeable boost in booking and revenue during the third quarter of the calendar year, which includes the summer months. Already this year, Airbnb has seen its financial results power higher as travel hits new all-time highs following the ravages of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nFor this year’s first quarter, Airbnb posted EPS of 41 cents, which crushed consensus analyst estimates of 24 cents. The profit was up 126% from a year ago and the company’s best first quarter ever. Revenue in the period totaled $2.14 billion, which was also ahead of Wall Street forecasts of $2.06 billion. Additionally, gross bookings came in at $22.90 billion, up 12% year over year, and the company’s free cash flow at the end of the quarter stood at $1.90 billion.\n\nThe strong performance has driven ABNB stock up 12% on the year. More gains can be expected if the company’s financial performance continues to impress.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and AMAT.

Both firms still trail Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia, all of which are worth north of $3 trillion.\n\nTech firms, especially Nvidia, have carried the S&P 500 for much of 2024, with one analyst telling Fortune's Niamh Rowe that the chipmaker's recent dominance was \"unheard of,\" comparing it to when IBM began producing PCs nearly four decades ago.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investors can benefit from looking deeper into the holdings of top-performing indices and ETFs. While the Nasdaq Composite has plenty of exciting companies available, investors may want to narrow their focus toward the Nasdaq 100. This index has outperformed the Nasdaq Composite, the S&P 500 and many others. However, it wouldn’t make sense to buy all 100 companies. You could just consider the top Nasdaq stocks to buy instead.\n\nThe three Nasdaq stocks to buy on this list have rising revenue and plenty of long-term growth opportunities. Two of these picks offer steady dividend payments with impressive growth rates. The third stock doesn’t offer dividends but has generated meaningful returns for long-term investors.\n\nMarriott International (MAR) The front of a Marriott (MAR) building featuring the company name and logo.\n\nSource: Tricky_Shark / Shutterstock.com\n\nMarriott International (NASDAQ:MAR) offers growth at a reasonable price. The stock trades at a 25 P/E ratio and offers a 1.03% yield. Shares are up by 10% year-to-date and have gained 78% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarriott delivered 4.2% year-over-year comparable sales growth in the first quarter, which international markets heavily contributed to. Net income was $564 million in the quarter, while revenue reached $1.54 billion. Marriott regularly delivers high profit margins, and this quarter was no different. The hotel chain ended up with a 36.5% net profit margin.\n\nThe company also has an impressive dividend growth rate. A high dividend growth rate allows investors to enjoy stock price growth and have enough cash flow by retirement. Marriott International raised its dividend 21% earlier this year. Shareholders will receive a quarterly dividend of $0.63 per share instead of $0.52 per share.\n\nCintas (CTAS) Image of the Cintas (CTAS) logo on the side of a white van.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) offers business supplies and safety equipment for more than one million companies. Its vast customer base and essential resources make it a compelling pick for long-term investors. The stock has an enticing record, with a 20% year-to-date gain and a 205% increase over the past five years. Cintas has a $72 billion market cap, a 49 P/E ratio and a 0.76% yield.\n\nJust like Marriott, Cintas also has an impressive dividend growth rate. The company hiked its quarterly dividend by 17.4% last year. Cintas has raised its dividend for 40 consecutive years. The firm can support the elevated dividend with its net income growth rate. Q3 FY24 results revealed a 9.9% year-over-year growth rate for revenue and a 22.0% increase in net income.\n\nStory continues\n\nCintas is currently rated as a Moderate Buy. The highest price target of $790 per share indicates that the stock can gain an additional 11%.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is only one of two Magnificent Seven stocks that don’t offer dividends. While investors can speculate about whether Amazon may give out dividends by the end of the year, you don’t have to do much speculating to discover that the stock has a 26% year-to-date return. Shares have almost doubled over the past five years as Amazon continues to capitalize on multiple verticals.\n\nAmazon’s online marketplace is the company’s claim to fame and is still the largest business segment. Online marketplace sales were key to the company’s 13% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter. Amazon Web Services grew by 17% year-over-year to reach $25.0 billion. That growth rate is an acceleration compared to the previous quarter, indicating demand is heating up. Artificial intelligence tailwinds should further boost Amazon Web Services in the quarters ahead.\n\nThe tech giant also makes money from groceries, advertising, streaming and other segments. Amazon’s Advertising services segment was a notable performer, with 24% year-over-year revenue growth in Q1 2024.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Investing.com - Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (BofA) has reiterated its \"Buy\" rating for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) in a research note on Wednesday, highlighting that there's still room for improvement in Amazon's logistics efficiency.\n\nAmazon has successfully positioned themselves as a logistics powerhouse, with BofA projecting over 9 billion package deliveries globally this year. This puts Amazon ahead of UPS, making it potentially the largest US shipper. Delivery speed has also seen significant improvements, with about 25% of units now delivered on the same or next day.\n\nHowever, even with substantial efficiency improvements in 2023, all five of the logistics utilization metrics tracked by BofA, including units per square foot, remain below 2018 levels. This suggests there's still potential for further efficiency gains.\n\nBofA identifies six key drivers for future efficiency improvements. These include the introduction of Inbound Cross Docks and new Consolidation Centers, initiatives to enhance inventory network distribution, a higher share of units from new Same-Day sites, expanded robotics integration in fulfillment centers, decelerating square footage growth, and traction for third-party shipping services and Supply Chain by Amazon.\n\nDespite notable margin leverage in the first quarter of 2024, BofA argues that the Street's retail margin projections remain conservative. BofA believes Amazon can drive upside, given another year of limited fulfilment expansion in 2024.\n\nHowever, risks include a slowdown in AWS or Ads revenue that could offset logistics leverage or a new investment cycle.\n\nBofA raised its price objective for Amazon to $220 (up from $210) based on higher retail multiples in its sum-of-the-parts valuation. Amazon remains BofA's top pick for large-cap/FANG in 2024.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon logistics shows potential for greater efficiency - BofA\n\nBoeing resuming widebody airplane deliveries to China, source says\n\nJefferies Q2 profit beats estimates on dealmaking rebound\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Amazon AMZN is leaving no stone unturned to expand its grocery retail footprint in the United States on the back of brick-and-mortar concept.\r\n\r\nIn this regard, the company recently inaugurated its second Amazon Fresh store in New Jersey.\r\n\r\nThe new 35,500-square-foot store offers prepared foods, international condiments and grocery items from more than 75 local brands and Amazon private brands.\r\n\r\nCustomers who visit this store can also use Amazon Dash smart carts, palm-scanning Amazon One technology and Alexa kiosks, making grocery shopping more convenient for shoppers.\r\n\r\nThe latest move not only strengthens Amazon Fresh business but also boosts the company’s physical retail footprint.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Focus in Grocery Business\n\nIn addition to opening a new store in New Jersey, Amazon is set to open another Amazon Fresh store in Virginia.\r\n\r\nThe company is also set to launch a smaller Whole Foods Market concept in Manhattan called Whole Foods Market Daily Shop. These quick-shop stores, ranging from 7,000 to 14,000 square feet, will offer grab-and-go meals, snacks, weekly essentials, seasonal produce, prepared foods, bread, alcohol, supplements and local specialties.\r\n\r\nMoreover, the company’s smart shopping cart, called Amazon Dash Cart, powered by advanced computer vision technology, is a plus. It provides personalized shopping experiences with an on-cart screen featuring maps and navigation and helps customers skip checkout lines. Dash Cart also tracks customers' savings and spending in real-time, making it a preferred choice for customers.\r\n\r\nThis Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company also launched a Prime grocery benefit, offering $9.99 monthly delivery for orders under $40 from Whole Foods or Amazon Fresh. This offering is expected to help customers satisfy their grocery needs and potentially change how people split their orders over time. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nThe growing grocery retail efforts will help Amazon fend off competitors like Walmart WMT, Costco COST and Target TGT, which are making concerted efforts to expand their grocery business.\r\n\r\nWalmart is replacing price stickers with electronic shelf labels in grocery stores, allowing employees to update prices every ten seconds. The labels also feature product descriptions with barcodes that can provide additional information, such as product sourcing, gluten-free status, or keto-friendly options, using mobile devices.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Costco’s growing strategic investments, a customer-centric approach, merchandise initiatives, and an emphasis on membership growth have been the key factors in driving its grocery business.\r\n\r\nTarget, on the other hand, plans to bolster its grocery business further with the introduction of its generative AI technology, Store Companion. The chatbot tool, currently in pilot testing at 400 locations, will answer process and procedure-related questions of store employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon’s shares have gained 20.3% in the year-to-date period, outperforming the Zacks Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 15.1%. The company is benefiting from its strengthening grocery business, solid Prime momentum, strong adoption rate of AWS, deepening focus on generative AI and its robust smart home security devices portfolio. It is also gaining from a strong global presence, solid momentum among small and medium businesses and growing capabilities in pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving.\r\n\r\nThese factors are expected to continue driving the overall financial performance of the company in the near term.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.04%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.58 per share, indicating a 57.9% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 11.7% in the past 60 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research? Today, you can download 7 Best Stocks for the Next 30 Days.

        "title": "Prediction: This Is What Amazon Stock Will Do Next",
        "content": "E-commerce and cloud-computing giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is one of my favorite businesses. The company's diversified business model, strong brand recognition, and robust financial profile make it a no-brainer choice for growth investors.\n\nFor most of the last year, the majority of chatter surrounding Amazon has revolved around artificial intelligence (AI). And while I acknowledge the company is making some savvy moves in the AI realm, I have a prediction for something else that Amazon may have up its sleeve.\n\nLet's dig in.\n\nAmazon is a cash-flow machine\n\nAmazon generates revenue from several sources. According to the company's filings, Amazon reports revenue into the following categories: online stores, physical stores, third-party seller services, advertising, subscriptions, cloud computing, and other services.\n\nThe majority of Amazon's operating income comes from its cloud services, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This isn't entirely surprising. While e-commerce and retail are the biggest revenue drivers, profitability margins in these segments can fluctuate dramatically in any given quarter.\n\nNevertheless, a close look at Amazon's financial statements reveals just how profitable the overall business really is. For the quarter ended March 31, Amazon reported $15.3 billion in operating income -- an increase of 219% year over year.\n\nMoreover, free cash flow has ballooned to $50 billion on a trailing-12-month basis, while operating cash flow has soared 82% over the same time period -- reaching $99.1 billion. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nWhat could Amazon use its cash for?\n\nThroughout 2024, investors have gained some insight into how Amazon is deploying its cash. After completing a $4 billion investment into AI start-up Anthropic, Amazon swiftly announced another initiative -- an $11 billion infrastructure project to build data centers in Indiana.\n\nObviously, these investments carry a hefty price tag. But all things considered, neither of them even puts a dent in Amazon's staggering cash pile, which currently sits at roughly $85 billion. Although this is a rather bold prediction, I think Amazon will begin using its excess profits to more directly reward shareholders in the form of a dividend.\n\nNot only does Amazon have the financial horsepower to pay a dividend, but peers including Alphabet and Meta Platforms both initiated their own dividends earlier this year. Furthermore, \"Magnificent Seven\" peer Nvidia recently raised its dividend by 150% as noted during the company's latest-earnings report.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nAs of now, only Amazon and Tesla remain as the two Magnificent Seven members that do not pay a dividend. On top of that, many of Amazon's megacap peers also compete in the AI world and offer leading cloud-computing alternatives. Since they also pay a dividend, Amazon may not seem as enticing for big tech investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nAt the end of the day, I cannot say if or when Amazon could initiate a dividend. However, considering the company's mammoth heaps of cash and strong tailwinds across many different growth markets, I think its management should be considering the prospects of a dividend given how feasible it is from a financial perspective.\n\nWith all of this said, I'd caution investors from buying Amazon shares on speculation that it could one day become a dividend stock. As explored above, the company's diversified business and massively profitable operation are more concrete reasons to scoop up shares in Amazon and hold on for the long haul.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple\n\nOn Monday, EU regulators found that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) violated the Digital Markets Act due to its lucrative App Store by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store. Regulators also revealed that they opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU. Apple responded that it is confident that the changes it made in the EU comply with the DMA.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Apple is defending itself against antitrust charges made by the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. In March, they sued Apple for using illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe new law designed to rein in tech giants and limit their power is already starting to give Big Tech legal headaches.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act that went into effect in March aims to limit the monopoly power that Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), ByteDance, and Meta (NASDAQ: META) enjoy by imposing more restrictive rules around competitive practices. Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly raised the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators. As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for abusing its market dominance in the distribution of music streaming apps, and is appealing the court’s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple’s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its pay or consent” model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers and will question if Meta is obtaining consent from users when intending to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average(DJINDICES: ^DJI) has only risen 4% this year, compared to the S&P 500's 15% gain and the Nasdaq-100's 17% return. The Dow underperformed the other two major indexes for two main reasons: It only tracks 30 prominent companies, and it's more heavily weighted toward slower-growth industries. It's also a price-weighted index, which arguably makes its less accurate than a market cap-weighted index like the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq-100.\n\nNevertheless, the 30 companies of the Dow -- which are also included in the S&P 500 -- still represent a good starting point to look for stable blue chip stocks. So today, I'll highlight three of those stalwarts that are set to soar in 2024 and beyond: Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), and IBM(NYSE: IBM). Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon is the world's largest e-commerce and cloud infrastructure company. In 2022, its revenue only rose 9% as macro headwinds throttled the growth of its marketplace and cloud businesses. Its investment in the struggling EV maker Rivian also backfired and caused Amazon to post a net loss for the full year.\n\nThat slowdown spooked a lot of investors. But in 2023, its revenue rose 12% as it returned to profitability. That acceleration was driven by the stabilization of its North American and international retail divisions, faster delivery speeds, its expansion into higher-growth overseas markets, and the growth of its integrated advertising business. Its cloud unit, which usually subsidizes its lower-margin retail segment with higher-margin revenue, recovered as more companies upgraded their infrastructure to support bigger workloads, large language models, and new generative AI applications.\n\nAnalysts expect Amazon's revenue and earnings to grow 11% and 57%, respectively, this year. Its stock still looks reasonably valued at 40 times forward earnings, and it could head a lot higher as the macro environment improves.\n\n2. Walmart\n\nWalmart is one of the few brick-and-mortar retail giants that has consistently kept up with Amazon. It accomplished that by expanding its e-commerce marketplace, turning its stores into fulfillment centers for online orders, matching Amazon's prices, and rolling out its own Walmart+ subscription plans to counter Amazon Prime.\n\nWalmart also competes against Costco in the warehouse retail market with Sam's Club, and it operates additional banners and e-commerce sites across 19 other countries. That makes it a lot more diversified than many U.S. retailers.\n\nIn fiscal 2024 (which ended this January), Walmart's revenue and adjusted EPS both increased 6%. For fiscal 2025, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to grow 4% and 9%, respectively, as its domestic business recovers and its international business expands. The company's stock still seems reasonably valued at 28 times forward earnings, it pays a decent forward dividend yield of 1.2%, and it's in better shape than most of its competitors.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. IBM\n\nIBM was once considered a dinosaur of the tech industry that had fallen far behind its nimble cloud-based peers. But the company divested its slower-growth managed infrastructure services unit as Kyndryl in late 2021, expanded its subsidiary Red Hat to develop more hybrid cloud services, and rolled out more AI features.\n\nBy streamlining its business and expanding higher-growth hybrid cloud and AI businesses, IBM started to grow again. In 2023, revenue and adjusted EPS rose 2% and 5%, respectively, even as the cloud market faced tough macro headwinds. In 2024, analysts expect its revenue and adjusted EPS to increase 2% and 3%, respectively.\n\nThose growth rates might seem anemic, but they mark a massive improvement from previous years of revenue declines. IBM stock looks cheap at 17 times forward earnings, and its high forward dividend yield of 3.9% should limit its downside potential. Over the long term, its stock could head a lot higher as its hybrid cloud and AI businesses accelerate.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights NVIDIA, Micron Technology, Super Micro Computer, Dell Technologies and Amazon.com",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 26, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: NVIDIA Corp. NVDA, Micron Technology Inc. MU, Super Micro Computer Inc. SMCI, Dell Technologies Inc. DELL and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN.\n\nHere are highlights from Tuesday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nCatch These 5 Big Fish at Next Dips for Long-Term Gains\n\nWall Street is set to close a successful first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. Aside from large-cap stocks, mid caps have also performed well year to date. Though the rally is primarily driven by generative artificial intelligence (AI), several old-economy stocks have also flourished.\n\nThe bull run is expected to continue in the second half supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate, solid earnings results, and Fed’s indication of at least one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in the benchmark interest rate in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, several stocks with strong exposure to AI, have skyrocketed year to date. These stocks have helped the broad-market index — the S&P 500 — to post 31 all-time highs this year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to surge nearly 18.5% after jumping 43.4% in 2023. Both indexes are currently trading near their all-time highs.\n\nA section of market participants is now skeptical about the continuity of the AI frenzy and the price momentum of these high-flying stocks. I believe a lot more is yet to come for these tech heavyweights and every dip in these stocks will be a good entry point for long-term gains.\n\nAfter last year’s tremendous performance, many financial experts started claiming that U.S. markets are overvalued. Concerns regarding the overvaluation of stocks, especially technology stocks, have stuck around since the beginning of this year.\n\nOn Jan 5, I wrote that buying on the dip would be the best strategy this year. (Read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip). In the first half, this strategy has proven right. Every dip in stocks, especially in tech giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This trend is likely to last in the second half, too.\n\nTop Picks\n\nHere, I have selected five U.S. behemoths with robust upside left for the long term. Every dip in their stock prices should call for a prudent buy to maximize long-term returns.\n\nNVIDIA Corp. is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong owing to the significant adoption of generative AI and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. On the other hand, demand is likely to outpace supply, resulting in price hikes for NVIDIA chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products. On May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company’s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called “Rubin.” The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNVDA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 37.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has soared more than 138.5% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 2.7% from the last closing price of $118.11. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $69-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. Finally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA’s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.4% over the last seven days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 69.6%.\n\nThe stock price of Micron Technology has climbed 62.9% year to date. Notwithstanding this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 7.3% from the last closing price of $139.01. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100 -$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI’s top and bottom lines. The company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI’s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSMCI has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.1% and 44.1%, respectively, for next year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 18.5% over the last 60 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 52.4%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has skyrocketed 191% year to date. Yet, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 8.3% from the last closing price of $826.98. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $285-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nDell Technologies Inc. has expanded its AI offerings in partnership with NVIDIA with \"new server, edge, workstation, solutions and services advancements.\" On May 20, DELL announced the new Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server, which \"offers direct liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs for fast processing in a compact form factor.\"\n\nDELL is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers driven by the ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. DELL’s PowerEdge XE9680 AI-optimized server is in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding DELL.\n\nDell Technologies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 27.7%.\n\nThe stock price of this Zacks Rank #1 company has jumped 79.9% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 10% from the last closing price of $137.56. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $97-$186.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the last 60 days.\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 48.2%.\n\nThe stock price of Amazon.com has surged 22.2% year to date. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 16.9% from the last closing price of $185.57. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $140-$246. The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year.

        "content": "On Wall Street, many artificial intelligence (AI) and automation stocks have been leading the charge in 2024. As these transformative technologies continue to reshape industries, long-term investors turn their attention to companies at the revolution’s forefront.\n\nAccording to a report by McKinsey, AI technologies could potentially deliver additional global economic output of $13 trillion by 2030. In addition, the management consulting group suggests that AI and automation “…are transforming businesses and will contribute to economic growth via contributions to productivity.”\n\nThe potential for explosive growth in the AI and automation sectors is undeniable. So, this creates an opportune time to identify the most promising players. From self-driving cars to advanced robotics in manufacturing, and from sophisticated algorithms powering financial decisions to AI-driven healthcare solutions, the applications of these technologies seem limitless. With that information, let’s explore three promising AI and automation stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nRockwell Automation (ROK) An image of a man in a suit holding a tablet, controlling manufacturing equipment in front of him\n\nSource: PopTika/Shutterstock\n\nIndustrial automation and digitalization solutions heavyweight Rockwell Automation (NYSE:ROK) offers factory automation software, industrial control systems and information solutions used across a wide range of industries.\n\nIn early May, Rockwell Automation released mixed results for the second quarter. The company reported revenues of $2.126 billion with an organic 8% year-over-year (YOY) decline. Despite the decline, it was above market expectations. Adjusted EPS came in at $2.50, also surpassing expectations.\n\nRecently, Rockwell Automation and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) announced a collaboration to develop next-generation autonomous mobile robots using NVIDIA’s Isaac robotics platform. This collaboration aims to improve efficiency and performance in manufacturing facilities. Rockwell Automation’s OTTO Motors division will create the robots.\n\nDespite these positive steps, ROK stock has declined close to 17% year-to-date (YTD). Meanwhile, the dividend yield is over 1.9%. Currently, Rockwell shares are changing hands at 23.1 times forward earnings and 3.3 times sales. The 12-month median price forecast is $292.50, suggesting an upside potential of  13%.\n\nPegasystems (PEGA) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEnterprise software company Pegasystems (NASDAQ:PEGA) focuses on customer relationship management (CRM) and business process management (BPM) solutions. PEGA is known for its platform that helps organizations streamline their operations and enhance customer engagement through automation and AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso, Pegasystems reported a strong first quarter, exceeding analyst expectations. Revenues were $330 million, just 1% above last year’s first quarter. Adjusted EPS came in at 48 cents, a significant 109% YOY increase.\n\nRecently, the software company made strides to expand its cloud capabilities and strengthen its partner ecosystem. Pegasystems announced it will expand its Pega GenAI framework to integrate with generative AI models from Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud and Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS. This expansion will enable Pegasystems’ clients to use a variety of AI models to enhance workflows and decision-making processes.\n\nOver the past quarters, PEGA stock has been getting attention for its potential in the rapidly growing low-code application development market. This segment is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 22.5% from 2024 to 2030.\n\nSince January, Pegasystems stock has advanced 20%. At present, PEGA shares are trading at 21.6 times earnings and 3.5 times sales. Meanwhile, the 12-month median price forecast for PEGA stands at $70.00, an upside potential of 19%.\n\nServiceNow (NOW) ServiceNow office building in Silicon Valley;\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nA prominent player in the enterprise cloud computing space, ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW) offers a suite of solutions that streamline and automate various business processes across industries. Founded in 2004, ServiceNow has grown to become a key provider of workflow automation, robotic process automation (RPA), AI and machine learning solutions.\n\nFurther, ServiceNow’s recent quarterly earnings showcased the company’s robust performance and growth trajectory. Subscription revenue grew by 24.5% YOY, surpassing the high end of guidance. Investors were pleased with the strong adoption of generative AI products, with Pro Plus net new Annual Contract Value (ACV) continuing a strong trend. Also, management raised its subscription revenue guidance for fiscal year 2024 to $10.560 billion to $10.575 billion, representing 21.5% to 22% YOY growth.\n\nThe global cloud computing market is expected to grow at a CAGR of over 21% from 2024 to 2030. We believe ServiceNow is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth, given its strong market presence and continuous innovation in cloud-based workflow solutions.\n\nYTD, NOW stock is up 6%. Yet, investors should note that shares command a premium valuation of 53.5 times forward earnings and 16.3 times trailing sales. Finally, Wall Street’s 12-month price target suggests a potential advance of 13.5% from current levels.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The AI industry has been a significant factor in propelling the technology sector to new heights. It has been a major draw for investors due to the improvement and creation of new and innovative technologies that could continue to offer considerable returns.\n\nMany different stocks related to generative AI have seen their share prices multiply over the last year.

        "title": "EU keeps flexing its antitrust muscles with US tech giants",
        "content": "The EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nEuropean regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge Tuesday, one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple (AAPL) with violating European Union competition law.\n\nThe European Commission (EC), the EU’s antitrust authority, said it informed Microsoft of its view that the tech giant had been illegally bundling — or \"tying\" — its Teams software to other proprietary business software, including Office 365 and Microsoft 365. Microsoft offices in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, France. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nTying the software applications together, according to the EC, violates the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits abuse of dominant market positions.\n\nFines for violations can run up to 10% of a company’s worldwide annual revenue. For Microsoft, global revenue in 2023 totaled $212 billion.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said the company has already untethered Teams from some of its other software products.\n\n\"We appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the commission‘s remaining concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe EC on Monday took a similar step against Apple, informing the iPhone maker that the rules for its lucrative App Store violated a different antitrust law — the EU’s recently enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA) — by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the store.\n\nApple defended its practices, saying, \"We are confident our plan complies with the law.\"\n\nThe actions this week are the latest examples of how the EU is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data and social media content, as well as the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers, and it readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US. European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. (REUTERS/Johanna Geron) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, even though that industrial union had received approval in the US.\n\nIn 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions.\n\nIn more recent years, the EU’s attempt to rein in tech giants has become a core focus. The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations on companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft, and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\nThe charges announced this week against Microsoft and Apple are detailed in separate legal filings, or statements of objection, that detail the EC’s investigative evidence and justifications for its claims. An Apple store in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn its statement outlining the charges against Microsoft, the EC said the tech giant’s practices may have granted Teams a distribution advantage because customers had no choice about whether to acquire access to Teams when subscribing to the company’s software productivity applications.\n\nThe commission went on to say that Microsoft imposed interoperability limitations on competing software with Teams, and that those limitations may have prevented competition, stifled innovation, and disadvantaged consumers.\n\nComplaints over Microsoft’s software bundles originated back in 2020 when Salesforce-owned Slack, a business software competitor, claimed the company was abusing its market power.\n\nThe EC’s investigations into the matter led Microsoft in October 2023 to untether Teams from some of its other software products. In April, it applied the change globally.\n\nMicrosoft will now have an opportunity to present its own evidence in response to the objections before the EC issues a final decision on whether or not the bloc’s antitrust laws were breached.\n\nThe EC’s final determinations are handled through administrative proceedings without a trial. However, appeals from the Commission’s final determination can be made to the European Court of Justice.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 Upcoming Stock Splits to Add to Your 2024 Calendars Right Now",
        "content": "Trends come and go, but one in fashion again is stock splits. Two years ago, there was a frenzy of splits in the tech space. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and even Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) all split their stock. But then the phenomenon died down last year. Now, it seems to be rebounding — with a twist.\n\nWhile tech stocks are still splitting their shares (Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently split its shares 10-to-1), a lot of the upcoming stock splits are among more consumer discretionary stocks. It began earlier this year when Walmart (NYSE:WMT) split its shares 3-to-1. Uniform provider Cintas (NASDAQ:CTAS) will split its stock by a similar ratio in September and Sony (NYSE:SONY) will follow suit with a 5-for-1 split later this fall.\n\nThere are three more upcoming stock splits investors will want to keep an eye on, including one happening after the stock market closes today.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough splits change nothing about a company, they offer positive signals about a company, and investors seem to like them. So, let’s see if the three upcoming stock splits below are worth buying now at the higher price or if you should wait til they are more accessible.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) Chipolte Mexican Grill sign. Chipolte is a chain of casual dining restaurants specializing in burritos and tacos. CMG stock\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first upcoming stock split is Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG). Currently trading over $3,200, the Mexican food chain’s stock will split by a whopping 50-to-1 after the closing bell today. Afterward, they will go for a more reasonable $64 a stub.\n\nChipotle is on a tear. Although shares slid 6% the other day, the restaurateur is still up 41% year-to-date and 57% over the past year. The stock has more than doubled over the past three years because business is booming.\n\nSales jumped 14% in the first quarter to $2.7 billion on a 7% jump in comparable restaurant sales. Operating margins widened 80 basis points (bp) to 16.3% from last year while restaurant-level margins expanded to 27.5% from 25.6% — a 190 bp gain.\n\nWall Street believes profits will keep flowing Chipotle’s way. Analysts forecast earnings will grow long-term at a compounded annual rate of 22% as the restaurant chain is seen as a good exchange for value. At this point, you may as well wait for the split to take effect tomorrow to add it to your portfolio.\n\nWilliams-Sonoma (WSM) Williams-Sonoma (WSM) store in a shopping mall\n\nSource: designs by Jack / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn just about two weeks, kitchen wares giant Williams-Sonoma (NYSE:WSM) will split its shares 2-for-1. The upcoming July 9 split will take WSM stock from just over $300 a share down to around $150 a share.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn announcing the halving event two weeks ago, the kitchen wares stock said the purpose is to make its stock more accessible to investors and employees. It is notable, though, that Williams-Sonoma stock has not really gone anywhere since it peaked at the end of March and the beginning of April. It actually trades 3% lower than it did three months ago, and even the split announcement did little to rally the stock.\n\nAlthough the company typically caters to a more upscale customer, which normally shields a business from the worst effects of inflation and high interest rates, the retailer is having trouble gaining traction. It had to reach out to more middle-income consumers who are feeling the pinch more.\n\nSales were down 5% in the first quarter on a similar percentage decline in comparable brand revenue. Over a two-year period, the comp is down 11% and off 1.4% over three years.\n\nDespite trading in the low triple digits, there doesn’t appear much need for Williams-Sonoma to split its stock. And until its business shows the kind of traction signaling long-term growth, I wouldn’t be a buyer before or after.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors have a little more time to think about Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which isn’t set to split its stock until July 15. Currently trading at around $1,600 per share, the 10-for-1 upcoming stock split will put shares at a more attainable $160 each.\n\nIn March, I had anticipated the mobile device chip maker would announce an upcoming stock split even as it was trading about 16% lower than it is now. I noted at the time that “Broadcom’s network and server solutions for data centers are optimized for artificial intelligence (AI). That blends well with the AI chips it is developing as well. AI is a fast-growing business and generated $1.5 billion in revenue for the company last quarter.”\n\nMore recently, Broadcom shifted its focus from mobile chipsets to data center infrastructure. It began building custom accelerators and is finding demand among hyperscalers growing. In a bid to make its wares available to the widest possible customer base, the chipmaker is concentrating on the lowest power accelerators based on open standards.\n\nThere is no limit to its growth potential at the moment as it heads towards a trillion-dollar valuation. An investor could buy AVGO stock before or after the split and do well.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally — why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme — not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "title": "Twitch CEO Dan Clancy sees slow and steady growth beating the ‘rocket ship’ approach despite parent Amazon slashing staff",
        "content": "Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has a clear vision for the Amazon-owned platform's future: sustainable growth over flashy, rapid expansion.\n\nAmazon acquired Twitch in August 2014 for roughly $1 billion, allowing the Jeff Bezos–founded tech giant to expand its presence in the live-streaming and gaming sectors.\n\nTwitch has since benefited from Amazon’s resources, infrastructure, and Prime membership integration, but according to reports, it remains unprofitable and was forced to lay off more than 500 employees in January this year, which is about 35% of its headcount.\n\nClancy, however, who has held the top job at Twitch since March 2023 having previously worked at Nextdoor and Google, remains undaunted by the pressures—and mapped out what he believes will be the company's path to success.\n\n\"I think we always get infatuated with ‘accelerated growth,’\" he said in a conversation with Fortune at the Cannes Lions festival, where Twitch was aiming to woo advertisers along with other tech titans at the industry equivalent of the Oscars.\n\n\"And those things that grow fast can also shrink fast.\"\n\nClancy emphasized the stability of Twitch’s model, highlighting the platform’s focus on building lasting connections.\n\n\"In today's social media world on some platforms, you might get discovered quickly and suddenly be a star. But tomorrow, someone else might be the star and you may be forgotten,” he said.\n\n“When you build a community on Twitch, there's a lot of longevity there.\"\n\nRather than chasing rapid growth, Clancy’s strategy is about \"sustained growth and sustained building of the community,\" which he believes is the best approach for Twitch.\n\nTwitch considers Prime and Netflix as main rivals, not YouTube or TikTok\n\nAddressing Twitch's competitors, Clancy dismissed the notion that all live streaming is the same. \"People don't confuse a novel with a newspaper article just because they both use text as a medium for communication. They're just different.\"\n\nPointing out the differences between Twitch and other platforms like YouTube and TikTok, he said: \"There’s live streaming on YouTube and TikTok. But because it's integrated with short-form content, you're sort of programmed to swipe on to the next thing. So people will watch live streaming, but you don't have the same community experience.\"\n\nClancy believes Twitch’s community-centric approach sets it apart. \"The Twitch streamers, some had gone over to YouTube because they had deals and many are now either back already or coming back, and every single one of them tells you, ‘Oh, it's not the same.’\"\n\nStory continues\n\nInterestingly, Clancy sees platforms like Amazon Prime Video and Netflix as bigger competitors.\n\n\"People sit and watch Twitch for an hour or two hours. I think, in some ways, we are a social, long-form, UGC [user-generated content] platform. So we are right between the streaming TV services and the social media companies.\"\n\nAI doomers 'wildly underestimate human intelligence'\n\nClancy, who holds a PhD in artificial intelligence and has an extensive background in the field, having headed up NASA’s AI and Robotics team, also offered his insights on the doomerism around AI.\n\n\"I know a fair amount about AGI. Are people nervous? Well, the people who work at Twitch are like the general population. They're all over the spectrum.\"\n\nWhile acknowledging the challenges that come with new technology, he pushed back against doomsday predictions from the likes of Geoffrey Hinton, widely considered the \"godfather of AI.\"\n\n\"I think all the doomsday stuff wildly underestimates human intelligence,” Clancy said.\n\n“I just think they mistakenly think that because AI has advanced at this pace, it keeps doing that.\"\n\nClancy argued human intelligence is far more complex than what AI currently mimics. \"The reason we have our big brain isn't to do math. It's to understand people, to reason about connections, to reason about relationships. AI doesn't do any of that.\"\n\nFor Clancy, human intelligence's distinctive and unique aspects, particularly in leadership and relationship building, are irreplaceable: \"It's not the smartest people that run the companies. It's the people that can lead, that can motivate, that can build all those things.\"\n\nWhile AI will undoubtedly continue to evolve, Clancy believes the human touch will always be essential. \"Thinking computers can play chess better than us. They can come up with facts better than us. That's okay. We can do all sorts of things. In fact, the biggest thing is that we think about reason, about relating with other people. And that's what runs these companies.\"\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Catch These 5 Big Fishes at Next Dips for Long-Term Gains",
        "content": "Wall Street is set to close a successful first half of 2024 after an impressive 2023. Aside from large-cap stocks, mid caps have also performed well year to date. Though the rally is primarily driven by generative artificial intelligence (AI), several old-economy stocks have also flourished.\n\nThe bull run is expected to continue in the second half supported by a resilient U.S. economy, a declining inflation rate, solid earnings results, and Fed’s indication of at least one rate cut of 25 basis points this year and a full 1% cut in the benchmark interest rate in 2025.\n\nMeanwhile, several stocks with strong exposure to AI, have skyrocketed year to date. These stocks have helped the broad-market index — the S&P 500 — to post 31 all-time highs this year and the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite to surge nearly 18.5% after jumping 43.4% in 2023. Both indexes are currently trading near their all-time highs.\n\nA section of market participants is now skeptical about the continuity of the AI frenzy and the price momentum of these high-flying stocks. I believe a lot more is yet to come for these tech heavyweights and every dip in these stocks will be a good entry point for long-term gains.\n\nAfter last year’s tremendous performance, many financial experts started claiming that U.S. markets are overvalued. Concerns regarding the overvaluation of stocks, especially technology stocks, have stuck around since the beginning of this year.\n\nOn Jan 5, I wrote that buying on the dip would be the best strategy this year. (Read: Best Investment Strategy for 2024: Buy on the Dip). In the first half, this strategy has proven right. Every dip in stocks, especially in tech giants, has resulted in more aggressive returns in a short span. This trend is likely to last in the second half, too.\n\nTop Picks\n\nHere, I have selected five U.S. behemoths with robust upside left for the long term. Every dip in their stock prices should call for a prudent buy to maximize long-term returns.\n\nThe chart below shows the price performance of five picks year to date. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNVIDIA Corp. NVDA is expected to benefit in two ways. Demand for its Hopper chips remains strong owing to the significant adoption of generative AI and an industry-wide shift from central processors to NVDA-made accelerators. On the other hand, demand is likely to outpace supply, resulting in price hikes for NVIDIA chips.\n\nThis undisputed global leader in the generative AI chipset developer space is aggressively differentiating its products. On May 22, CEO Jensen Huang said that the company’s next-generation AI chip, Blackwell Ultra, would be the next driver. These chips will be available in data centers in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Jun 2, NVDA unveiled its new AI chip architecture called “Rubin.” The Rubin architecture will have new GPUs to launch AI systems, CPUs and networking chips. Rubin is set to be introduced in 2026. NVIDIA will introduce an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNVDA has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 92.6% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 10.7% over the last 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term (3-5 years) earnings growth rate of 37.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 18.4%.\n\nThe stock price has soared more than 138.5% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 2.7% from the last closing price of $118.11. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $69-$200. Thus, every dip has a strong upside potential. Finally, NVIDIA currently sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy). You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nMicron Technology Inc. MU has been benefiting from the enormous growth of AI applications that boosted demand for its high bandwidth memory chips. MU is a major producer of memory chips used in NVIDIA’s GPUs. MU is benefiting from improved market conditions, robust sales executions and strong growth across multiple business units.\n\nMicron Technology anticipates the pricing of DRAM and NAND chips to increase, thereby improving its revenues. The pricing benefits will primarily be driven by rising AI servers, causing a scarcity in the availability of cutting-edge DRAM and NAND supply. Also, 5G adoption in IoT devices and wireless infrastructure will spur demand for memory and storage.\n\nMicron Technology has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 58.9% and more than 100%, respectively, for the current year (ending August 2024). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 9.4% over the last seven days. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 69.6%. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe stock price of Micron Technology has climbed 62.9% year to date. Notwithstanding this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 7.3% from the last closing price of $139.01. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $100 -$225. The stock carries a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy) at present.\n\nSuper Micro Computer Inc. SMCI has benefited on the back of robust demand for severs powered by high-end generative AI chipsets. SMCI designs, develops, manufactures, and sells energy-efficient, application-optimized server solutions based on the x86 architecture.\n\nAn astonishing rise in demand for high-performance rack servers boosted SMCI’s top and bottom lines. The company makes servers using NVIDIA processors. Super Micro Computer is positioned as a leading provider of one-stop-shop, high-performance rack servers capable of powering advanced AI applications.\n\nSMCI’s solutions include a range of rack mount and blade server systems, as well as components. SMCI’s Server Building Block Solutions provide benefits across many environments, including data center deployment, high-performance computing, high-end workstations, storage networks and standalone server installations.\n\nSMCI has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 60.1% and 44.1%, respectively, for next year (ending June 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for next-year earnings has improved 18.5% over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 52.4%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 7%.\n\nThe stock price has skyrocketed 191% year to date. Yet, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 8.3% from the last closing price of $826.98. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $285-$1,500. Super Micro Computer currently carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nDell Technologies Inc. DELL has expanded its AI offerings in partnership with NVIDIA with \"new server, edge, workstation, solutions and services advancements.\" On May 20, DELL announced the new Dell PowerEdge XE9680L server, which \"offers direct liquid cooling and eight NVIDIA Blackwell Tensor Core GPUs for fast processing in a compact form factor.\"\n\nDELL is benefiting from strong demand for AI servers driven by the ongoing digital transformation and heightened interest in generative AI applications. DELL’s PowerEdge XE9680 AI-optimized server is in demand. Strong enterprise demand for AI-optimized servers is aiding DELL.\n\nDell Technologies has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 9.4% and 9.7%, respectively, for the current year (ending January 2025). The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 0.6% over the last 30 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 11.8%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 27.7%.\n\nThe stock price of this Zacks Rank #1 company has jumped 79.9% year to date. Despite this, the average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 10% from the last closing price of $137.56. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $97-$186.\n\nAmazon.com Inc. AMZN is gaining on solid Prime momentum owing to ultrafast delivery services and a strong content portfolio. A deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus. Strengthening relationships with third-party sellers is a positive for AMZN.\n\nThe strong adoption rate of AWS is aiding AMZN’s cloud dominance. Improving Alexa skills along with robust smart home offerings are tailwinds. The advertising business is also pretty robust. AMZN enjoys a strong global presence and solid momentum among small and medium businesses. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are its other positives.\n\nAmazon.com has an expected revenue and earnings growth rate of 11% and 57.9%, respectively, for the current year. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for current-year earnings has improved 12.3% over the last 60 days. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nThe company currently has a long-term earnings growth rate of 29.6%. It recorded positive earnings surprises in the last four reported quarters, with an average beat of 48.2%.\n\nThe stock price of Amazon.com has surged 22.2% year to date. The average price target of brokerage firms represents an increase of 16.9% from the last closing price of $185.57. The brokerage target price is currently in the range of $140-$246. The stock presently carries a Zacks Rank #3. However, analyzing the above positives, this stock is a potential candidate to enter a Zacks Buy Rank (Rank #1 or 2).\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Here's What To Make Of Amazon.com's (NASDAQ:AMZN) Decelerating Rates Of Return",
        "content": "To find a multi-bagger stock, what are the underlying trends we should look for in a business? Ideally, a business will show two trends; firstly a growing return on capital employed (ROCE) and secondly, an increasing amount of capital employed. Ultimately, this demonstrates that it's a business that is reinvesting profits at increasing rates of return. With that in mind, the ROCE of Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) looks decent, right now, so lets see what the trend of returns can tell us.\n\nUnderstanding Return On Capital Employed (ROCE)\n\nJust to clarify if you're unsure, ROCE is a metric for evaluating how much pre-tax income (in percentage terms) a company earns on the capital invested in its business. To calculate this metric for Amazon.com, this is the formula:\n\nReturn on Capital Employed = Earnings Before Interest and Tax (EBIT) ÷ (Total Assets - Current Liabilities)\n\n0.13 = US$47b ÷ (US$531b - US$153b) (Based on the trailing twelve months to March 2024).\n\nTherefore, Amazon.com has an ROCE of 13%. That's a relatively normal return on capital, and it's around the 11% generated by the Multiline Retail industry.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com  roce\n\nIn the above chart we have measured Amazon.com's prior ROCE against its prior performance, but the future is arguably more important. If you'd like, you can check out the forecasts from the analysts covering Amazon.com  for free.\n\nHow Are Returns Trending?\n\nThe trend of ROCE doesn't stand out much, but returns on a whole are decent. The company has employed 230% more capital in the last five years, and the returns on that capital have remained stable at 13%. 13% is a pretty standard return, and it provides some comfort knowing that Amazon.com has consistently earned this amount. Stable returns in this ballpark can be unexciting, but if they can be maintained over the long run, they often provide nice rewards to shareholders.\n\nIn Conclusion...\n\nIn the end, Amazon.com has proven its ability to adequately reinvest capital at good rates of return. And since the stock has risen strongly over the last five years, it appears the market might expect this trend to continue. So even though the stock might be more \"expensive\" than it was before, we think the strong fundamentals warrant this stock for further research.\n\nIf you're still interested in Amazon.com it's worth checking out our  FREE intrinsic value approximation for AMZN to see if it's trading at an attractive price in other respects.\n\nWhile Amazon.com may not currently earn the highest returns, we've compiled a list of companies that currently earn more than 25% return on equity.

        "title": "Why Do Big Tech Funds Love Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs mega-cap technology stocks continue to soar to new highs, the number of Wall Street analysts highlighting the “concentration of gains” problem are increasing. It’s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that “Big Tech” has  “largely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.” Krishna said that Q1 results showed the “ongoing dominance” of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\n“This makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,” Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen’s New AI Fund\n\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet “on and against” companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez. The fund’s expected launch date is later this year or early 2025.\n\nBillionaire Cohen is already ramping up his bets on AI. To see his AI investments this year, click 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nMethodology\n\nSince Krishna of Barclays talked about the rise of big tech funds and their concentration into AI, in this article we will take a look at the major AI stocks that form the portfolios of these funds and discuss their growth catalysts and long-term outlook. For that we first listed down all holdings of major tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and iShares Global Tech ETF and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Are Big Tech Funds Buying Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) AI Stock?\n\nJeff Bezos\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Big Tech funds are buying amid the AI boom.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to revolutionize our lives -- at least if big tech is to be believed. Plenty of products already hit the market, like ChatGPT, and while they have made a splash, the technology's true impact has yet to be felt. That promise of more to come is driving incredible growth for companies involved in AI.\n\nTop fund managers are snapping up shares of these businesses as they try to capture as much value from the technology's explosive growth as possible. Funds with more than $100 million in assets under management need to report their trades every quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission on form 13F. Lucky for us, it's public knowledge.\n\nKnowing where the \"smart money\" is flowing can help you make sound decisions, but it should only be part of your information gathering. It turns out that the smart money isn't always so smart -- and besides, there are plenty of managers selling shares of all of the following five stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTo perhaps no one's surprise, the company with the most hedge-fund buys was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It captured the investing world's imagination after positioning itself as the go-to chipmaker for all things AI.\n\nIts revenue growth has been incredible, and it's done it all while keeping costs relatively low. The chart below measuring the growth of its net income over the past three years shows the point where AI took off. NVDA Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $15.9 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $6.2 billion from Vanguard and $1.8 billion by BlackRock.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nOne of my favorite AI plays, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), runs the largest cloud computing operation in the world, Amazon Web Service (AWS), controlling over 30% of the cloud market and is investing heavily to maintain this share. It partners with Nvidia to outfit its data centers with the latest and most powerful chips, and it put $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic.\n\nFund managers bought $14.4 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.5 billion (Vanguard) and $1.9 billion (BlackRock).\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nAnother solid AI play, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), backs OpenAI, the maker of the most popular AI application, ChatGPT. When OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 to the public, it became the most quickly adopted technology in history. For much of the public, ChatGPT is as far as their knowledge of AI goes, unaware of Anthropic's offering or Alphabet's.\n\nMicrosoft is No. 2 in the cloud and has been slowly eating into AWS' market share. Its partnership with OpenAI means Microsoft has the most-used AI application in the world on its servers. And Microsoft is also outfitting them with Nvidia chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nFund managers bought $13.1 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.8 billion (BlackRock) and $1.3 billion from Geode Capital Management.\n\n4. Apple\n\nThis one is different from the previous three. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares slid for much of last year as investors worried it had fallen behind in AI.\n\nBut the company finally jumped on board this month, unveiling Apple Intelligence, its cleverly named AI offering. Its products will have all sorts of AI enhancements (maybe now Siri will actually know what I ask her to do).\n\nCrucially, the enhancements will require too much computing power for many older products in Apple's lineup, forcing users to upgrade to the latest (and most expensive) models. This will help boost the company's sagging iPhone sales, an essential part of its bottom line.\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.3 billion (Geode Capital) and $983.9 million by Lazard.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) supplies hardware to the AI industry. They don't compete head to head, leaving Nvidia to dominate the core chip market. But one of the most crucial components in AI data centers is the one that allows all of those chips to talk to one another fast enough and seamlessly, which is where Broadcom comes in. Broadcom is a top designer, manufacturer, and supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Its product offerings serve the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets.\n\nThe company also made some key acquisitions that have driven immense growth, as the revenue chart below shows. (It also indicates an inflection point close to the one in Nvidia's chart above.) AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.6 billion (Vanguard) and $1.5 billion from Jennison Associates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Reddit Stock’s Risky Bet: Will Flooding Comments With Ads Save or Sink RDDT?",
        "content": "Social media site Reddit (NASDAQ:RDDT) has one glaring problem that holds it back from getting ahead. Most of its users don’t log into the platform but simply skim the comments. While that means they can’t create posts or comment on them, most people prefer to just read what others have to say.\n\nThat’s bad for Reddit stock because most of the money the social media site makes comes from ads on its homepage that logged in users view.\n\nSince Reddit’s potential for growth is based on user engagement, the fact that most people on the site aren’t engaging with it is a significant problem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet Reddit has a plan that may overcome this flaw in its business that could lead to substantial revenue growth.\n\nEngaging With Ads\n\nAccording to a Barron’s report, analysts at JMP Securities say Reddit is planning to start running ads in its comments section.\n\nThat way users can view them whether they are logged into the site or not. The analysts believe it can attract even more advertisers to the platform to drive revenue significantly higher.\n\nAd revenue rose 39% in Reddit’s first quarter as a publicly traded company. Ads accounted for 92% of the social media site’s total revenue for the quarter.\n\nYet the plan is not quite so new as you may believe. Reddit users say the platform has been experimenting with the idea for at least a year now.\n\nA user posted an image of a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) ad in the comments that was promoting Walmart+. Notably, the ad didn’t seem especially relevant to the discussion.\n\nAdvertising Backlash and Reddit Stock\n\nMore ads in the comments section, though, could also open up the advertisers to user criticism.\n\nReddit isn’t quite like the old 4Chan forums but there is a lot of trash talking that occurs on the site (there is another word for such posts that can’t be used on a family-friendly investment site) and could open up the advertiser to more negative feedback than they would care to receive.\n\nWorse, they could just be ignored.\n\nAlthough Reddit claims a User Respondent Survey found 61% of ads on the site are more relevant than on other sites.\n\nThe same percentage says they pay more attention to ads they see on Reddit more than elsewhere. Flooding the comments section with ads could stir up a hornet’s nest of negativity.\n\nMoreover, it may induce its logged in users to install ad blockers. It is a problem Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) is facing with YouTube.\n\nThe Race for More Revenue\n\nIn a bid to increase ad revenue, the video sharing site has been flooding the site with more ads and have them run for longer periods of time.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhere ads used to be five seconds before you could hit the skip button, now they make you sit for 20 seconds or more before skipping them, if at all. Recently ad run times have gone as high as a minute.\n\nIt also makes YouTube almost unwatchable.\n\nBut ad blocker site SponsorBlock says Google is trying to defeat ad blockers by inserting ads directly into the video stream instead of having them run on top.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) also started inserting ads into its movies and TV shows too. What was once a safe haven from having to watch commercials has devolved into a race to the bottom where we’re now paying for ads when broadcast TV is free.\n\nHeck, even cable was essentially ad-free.\n\nShort-Term Salve for Reddit Stock\n\nWhile Reddit’s plan could initially boost revenue as advertisers try to reach a new and different audience, more ads also raise the risk of users ignoring them.\n\nThe more you see of something the more it tends to blur into the background. It could have negative implications for Reddit stock too.\n\nAlthough it might not be as easy as holding your finger over a countdown timer to skip a YouTube ads Reddit comment section ads might not be nearly as effective as the social media site hopes. It may not be the long-term solution Reddit needs to grow.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Amazon is partnering with hip-hop star Megan Thee Stallion to boost sales for its 10th annual Prime Day discount event.\n\nOn Tuesday, the rapper unveiled a new original song called “It’s Prime Day.” An accompanying music video shows her purchasing a pink dog collar, fake eyelashes and other items from Amazon.\n\nThe online retailer's two-day discount bonanza is set to take place on July 16 and 17 this year. It is open to Prime members who pay Amazon $14.99 per month, or $139 per year, for access to deals and other perks, such as free shipping.\n\nThe company doesn't disclose how much revenue it pulls in from such events. But it has been hosting more of them in recent years to attract consumers dealing with rising credit costs and high — but easing — inflation.\n\nAmazon held an October event for Prime members in the last two years to kick off the holiday shopping season. In March, the company — which has faced more competition from low-cost retailers Shein and Temu — held its first-ever spring sales event for all shoppers.\n\nAmazon said Prime members in two dozen countries will participate in July's discount event, which will also mark the start of the back-to-school shopping season. Historically, Prime discounts have attracted shoppers to items offered on Amazon’s site.\n\nThe company says Megan Thee Stallion’s Prime song, a bonus track from her forthcoming album “MEGAN,” will be available for fans listening only on Amazon Music. It also said it would offer early deals on items from the rapper's new tour merchandise collection.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Google Shopping’s new exec spent 15 years at Amazon: Here’s his plan to hijack Prime Day",
        "content": "For more than 20 years, Google executives haven’t been quite sure what they wanted their Google Shopping search portal to be when it grew up.\n\nA price comparison tool?\n\nAn actual product marketplace or online retailer that would compete with the likes of Amazon or Walmart or eBay?\n\nA combination of the two?\n\nFor now at least, it’s made up its mind. And one of its executives, a former Amazon leader named Sean Scott, is trying to make the case that “it’s fiscally irresponsible to start your shopping anywhere else other than Google,” as he said in a recent exclusive interview with Fortune.\n\n(If that “irresponsible” line sounds familiar, you might be an e-commerce nerd like me: Jeff Bezos once used a similar phrase in an annual shareholder letter, writing, “We want Prime to be such a good value, you’d be irresponsible not to be a member.”)\n\n“We don’t have inventory, we don’t take payment, we don’t ship anything, we are really neutral,” Google’s Scott continued in the interview with Fortune. “And we’re just at it to show customers the best prices on the web from any merchant.”\n\nCall Google the Switzerland of shopping. (Albeit a Switzerland where retailers and brands need to buy ads if they want to appear at the tippy top of search results.)\n\nThe timing of Scott’s pronouncement is not coincidental. In July, Amazon will host its annual two-day shopping event for Prime members, attracting attention not just from millions of shoppers around the web, but other merchants big and small that will also offer deals in an attempt to court some consumer attention. Scott knows the power of Prime firsthand; he worked at Amazon for nearly 15 years, including as a vice president overseeing the online retailer’s core shopping experience. He joined Google in the fall of 2023 to run the consumer side of Google Shopping after a three-year stint at PagerDuty.\n\nDuring Amazon’s Prime Day shopping extravaganza, Google searches for shopping deals actually surpass those related to travel or vacation, according to Scott.\n\nSo Google has been rolling out and expanding shopping features in its search engine to try to capitalize on the increase in shopping activity around the web thanks to Prime Day. It has rolled out a special deals section to highlight discounted items across the web, and has also expanded its price comparison tools, including a feature that will show shoppers special pricing that a retailer might be offering members of their rewards or loyalty programs.\n\nGoogle is also touting its price-tracking features, which give shoppers the ability to get notifications if a product’s price drops at an online retailer, and also track the price of goods over a 90-day period to understand if a deal that Amazon or another retailer is touting is actually a good deal.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Google, Amazon is both friend and foe. On one hand, Amazon remains one of the largest advertisers on Google, paying to place sponsored product listings at the top of Google search results to pick off shoppers that may have started their product search there rather than on Amazon itself.\n\nBut over the past decade, Amazon has become a product-search powerhouse itself, with more than half of online shoppers in the U.S. beginning product searches on the everything store and less than half on Google.\n\nAs that has happened, Amazon has built a massive advertising business within its own shopping empire, generating nearly $47 billion in revenue in 2023. Google’s core business, of course, is also advertising. A product search that begins on Amazon (or Walmart or Temu or Shein for that matter) is a product search that Google can’t monetize with ads. Part of the problem if you’re Google, or advantage if you’re Amazon, is that many Amazon customers that become reliant on the Prime shipping program don’t price-compare or shop around except, perhaps, on expensive items.\n\nMaybe more should. To be clear, Amazon has a reputation for low prices. Last year, for example, e-commerce analytics firm Profitero named Amazon the online retailer with the lowest prices for the seventh year in a row. (Note that a company like Temu wouldn’t be included in a research study like that one because it doesn’t sell brand-name goods across a wide selection of categories.)\n\nBut price-comparison research can indeed be worthwhile. I recently was in the market for an exciting purchase: an air filter for a furnace. For a variety of uninteresting reasons, I wanted to buy a single filter and not a multipack as I usually would. After wading through multipacks on Amazon’s search results page, I found a single filter for sale. It cost around $18.\n\nThat’s quite high, so I turned to Google. A quick search turned up a $6 filter being sold from a local Ace Hardware store, and a Pick Up Today badge further cemented my decision. Perhaps Amazon (or Walmart or another retailer) will show you a good price on many items, or the shipping speed you desire that matters more than saving money, but it’s hard to argue with the idea of clicking over to Google for a minute or two if the lowest price is what you seek.\n\nAnd yet, other new digital shopping tools continue to launch, especially as a result of the generative AI boom. A startup called Daydream, for example, recently announced a $50 million investment from venture capital firms including Forerunner Ventures. Daydream is run by well-respected industry veteran Julie Bornstein and says it is building an AI-powered search engine for products. Mass retailers like Amazon and Walmart are also testing gen AI shopping assistants to further personalize the product search and browsing experience.\n\nShoppers also continue to get inspiration from influencers on video platforms like TikTok (which sells goods through TikTok Shop), Instagram, and Google sister-site YouTube.\n\nBut Google is investing in AI-powered shopping tools as well, from a virtual try-on feature for various body types and skin tones, to product-recommendation features.\n\nIn the end, though, Scott maintains that the goal is a straightforward one.\n\n“We’re just trying to help the customer shop, opening your eyes to new selections and new merchants at great prices,” he said.\n\nAre you a current or former Google or Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "content": "Betting on Warren Buffett stocks to buy now is the kick your portfolio needs ahead of a broader rally.\n\nPopularly known as the “Oracle of Omaha,” Buffett’s investing acumen is second to none, taking Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) to spectacular heights. Since becoming CEO in 1965, Berkshire’s class A shares have delivered an aggregate return of more than 4,900,000%. In the past decade alone, it has delivered a price return of 227%, beating the S&P 500 by a wide margin.\n\nHence, those waiting for a broader rally will want to align their strategies with Buffett’s long-term investing approach. His time-tested track record of success makes Buffett’s choices remarkably compelling for those looking to invest confidently.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, these three standout Warren Buffett stocks to buy now imbibe his investment philosophy and have consistently anchored his portfolio for years. Moreover, these top picks offer robust long-term upside and can be picked up for just $500.\n\nWarren Buffett Stocks to Buy: Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum Corporation (Oxy) logo seen on billboard.is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration in the United States, and the Middle East. OXY stock\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nOil and gas giant Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) has been one of the most popular Warrant Buffet stocks over the past few years. Since first snagging OXY stock in Q3 2019, Berkshire has scooped up shares over 32 times while only selling twice. It currently represents the 6th largest investment in Berkshire’s portfolio, owning roughly 30% of Occidental’s outstanding stock.\n\nOf late, we’ve seen Berkshire significantly increase its stake in OXY, adding $105.5 million worth of OXY stock, as per its recent filing. Despite the headwinds in play, this massive accumulation of OXY stock indicates Berkshire’s confidence in the oil giant’s future. Over the long term, though, the challenges in meeting global crude oil demand should continue to push oil prices higher, which bodes well for Occidental and its peers.\n\nMoreover, even though fossil fuels will remain relevant for years, Buffet is also betting on OXY stock for its investments in green energy, particularly in carbon capture technology.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett, a big admirer of Jeff Bezos, has lamented missing early investment opportunities in Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, like any great investor, he has learned from past mistakes and now owns a sizeable stake in the company. Berkshire now holds 10 million shares of AMZN stock, valued upwards of $1.8 billion.\n\nAmazon’s business has been booming recently, as it has for the past several years. Analysts commend its effective belt-tightening measures, including job reductions post-pandemic while bolstering growth in its cloud computing division. Moreover, there’s been plenty of excitement surrounding its AI-driven initiatives and their impact on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntegrating AI tools to enhance product recommendations, streamline inventory management, and boost developer capabilities and storage underscores AWS’s critical role in powering Amazon’s growth engine. Also, its diversification into new realms, such as streaming, continues building on its massive market footprint, leading to comfortable top-and-bottom-line beats.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffet turned heads earlier this year when he offloaded roughly 116 million shares of Apple (AAPL) in the first-quarter (Q1). Though mostly for tax purposes, trimming his stake in arguably his favourite investment led to a sell-off in AAPL stock. Over the years, Buffet has showered praises on Apple, calling it “a better business than any we own.” These comments reflect the value he sees in Apple’s business model and its contribution to Berkshire’s investment strategy.\n\nHowever, the tech giant is turning a corner after unveiling grand AI ambitions at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. Following the recent rally in AAPL stock, Buffett’s remaining stake of 789 million is valued north of $135 billion.\n\nApple introduced its groundbreaking generative AI technology called “Apple Intelligence”, which is set to significantly enhance Siri and other services. Moreover, this move is set to have a massive impact on user interaction across Apple devices, while maintaining the firm’s strict privacy standard. Also, given the pervasiveness of its AI endeavors, I expect these developments to spark a major upgrade cycle.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) legal headaches mounted Monday with the news that European Union regulators found it violated a new law designed to rein in tech giants.\n\nThe EU’s European Commission said it informed Apple that the rules of Apple's lucrative App Store violated the Digital Markets Act by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\n\nThe regulator also announced it had opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny overseas comes as Apple defends itself in the US against antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold onto a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit; it has yet to comment on the new EU actions.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple’s stock up more than 1%.\n\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" — Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) — and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\n\nThe law’s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\n\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\n\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\n\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAnd that’s what regulators said Apple did. The logo of Apple is illuminated at a store in Munich, Germany, in 2020. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\n\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company’s global annual revenue. In Apple’s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\n\nApple doesn’t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category that includes the store’s revenue reached $85 billion that same year.\n\nThe EC’s announcement significantly broadened financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple’s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 Euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify, targeted Apple’s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\n\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

Ives said that the AI “party” is just getting started and the clock is showing “9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.” Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the “only game in town.” Ives thinks the “first wave” of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth “derivatives” beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\n\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\n“The tech bull market is just starting,” Ives reportedly said.\n\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nAlexander Supertramp / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the stocks Dan Ives of Wedbush thinks have the potential to grow based on the AI revolution.\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon’s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\n\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\n\nAlphabet's future position in AI\n\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\n\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\n\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\n\nFundamental and competitive analysis\n\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\n\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\n\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\n\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\n\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\n\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\n\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\n\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\n\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\n\nConclusion\n\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Warren Buffett Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Warren Buffett has been outperforming the stock market for many years. Along the way, he’s shared valuable tidbits with investors, such as buying when others are fearful and waiting for your pitch instead of investing just for the sake of it. Warren Buffett stocks have also been analyzed by Wall Street to determine which can be rated as a “strong buy.”\n\nMany investors look at Warren Buffett’s portfolio and recent moves for stock picks. As the logic goes, if Warren Buffett has been outperforming the stock market for so long, chances are many of his stock picks should outperform the S&P 500.\n\nHowever, some of Warren Buffett’s stock picks are better than others. Investors shouldn’t buy a stock just because it’s in the investing legend’s portfolio, but it’s still good to get additional ideas. Wall Street analysts also look at Buffett’s portfolio for some ideas, and some of them have a lot of good things to say about his picks. These are some of the top Warren Buffett stocks that have received “strong buy” ratings from Wall Street.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) has been around for decades and looks like it will be around for centuries. That type of stability is a key theme for many of Buffett’s picks. Rather than chasing speculative stocks, Buffett focuses on stocks like Visa that have high-profit margins and respectable growth.\n\nThe fintech firm reported 10% year-over-year (YOY) revenue and net income growth in Q2 FY24. Cross-border transactions drove growth and played a big role in the company’s successful quarter. Visa closed out the quarter with a 53.1% net profit margin and returned $3.8 billion to its investors through stock buybacks and dividends.\n\nVisa has generated steady gains over the years. It’s up by 6% year-to-date (YTD) and has gained 58% over the past five years. Visa also has a 0.76% yield and a double-digit dividend growth rate over more than a decade. Visa is currently rated as a “strong buy” and has a projected 16% upside.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) A Nubank sign outside of an office building.\n\nSource: Jo Galvao / Shutterstock.com\n\nBuffett loves corporations in the financial sector, and Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is no exception. The Brazilian digital bank has been growing at a rapid pace while expanding its profit margins. Investors have noticed, resulting in a 50% YTD gain. Wall Street is also clamoring over the stock and rated it as a “strong buy.” The average price target suggests a 17% upside, while the highest price target of $15 indicates that a 28% gain is possible.\n\nStory continues\n\nNu Holdings is achieving strong growth in all of the areas that matter for the business. The  company went from 79.1 million customers in Q1 2023 to 99.3 million customers in Q1 2024, marking a 26% YOY increase. More than 80% of the company’s customers were active on the platform.\n\nNu Holdings offers bank accounts, brokerage accounts, loans, credit cards and other financial products. This diversified product mix contributed to 69% YOY revenue growth in the quarter. Net income also surged, going from $141.8 million in Q1 2023 to $378.8 million in Q1 2024. These healthy growth rates suggest more gains can be in store for the stock.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) smartphone with Amazon (AMZN) logo displayed on screen. Strong Buy Warren Buffett Stocks\n\nSource: Volodymyr Plysiuk / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the few big tech companies in Warren Buffett’s portfolio. The stock has proven to be a good pick with a 26% YTD gain and a 97% gain over the past five years. The company offers almost every product you’ll ever need from the convenience of your home. That’s been Amazon’s selling point for decades, and it continues to work wonders.\n\nRevenue increased by 13% YOY in the first quarter. North American and international sales both had double-digit growth rates. Amazon’s online marketplace contributes to most of the company’s revenue, but the tech giant has several exciting revenue streams to monitor.\n\nAmazon Web Services sales accelerated and were up by 17% YOY. Amazon’s cloud computing segment should receive a boost from the artificial intelligence boom. Groceries, advertising and streaming are additional segments that investors should monitor. Amazon has quietly become one of the largest advertisers on the planet, and its ad placements will help with profit margins.\n\nThe firm has received steady praise from numerous Wall Street analysts. It’s rated as an unanimous “strong buy” with a projected 21% upside from current levels. Recent ratings have been more bullish, with the highest price target of $246 per share implying a potential 34% gain.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has recently been on Zacks.com's list of the most searched stocks. Therefore, you might want to consider some of the key factors that could influence the stock's performance in the near future.\n\nShares of this online retailer have returned +4.6% over the past month versus the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.7% change. The Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, to which Amazon belongs, has gained 0.7% over this period. Now the key question is: Where could the stock be headed in the near term?\n\nWhile media releases or rumors about a substantial change in a company's business prospects usually make its stock 'trending' and lead to an immediate price change, there are always some fundamental facts that eventually dominate the buy-and-hold decision-making.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nOur analysis is essentially based on how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to take the latest business trends into account. When earnings estimates for a company go up, the fair value for its stock goes up as well. And when a stock's fair value is higher than its current market price, investors tend to buy the stock, resulting in its price moving upward. Because of this, empirical studies indicate a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and short-term stock price movements.\n\nFor the current quarter, Amazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share, indicating a change of +61.9% from the year-ago quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +57.9%. This estimate has remained unchanged over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +26.6% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has remained unchanged.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\n12 Month EPS\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nEven though a company's earnings growth is arguably the best indicator of its financial health, nothing much happens if it cannot raise its revenues. It's almost impossible for a company to grow its earnings without growing its revenue for long periods. Therefore, knowing a company's potential revenue growth is crucial.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $638.24 billion and $709.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nWithout considering a stock's valuation, no investment decision can be efficient. In predicting a stock's future price performance, it's crucial to determine whether its current price correctly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nThe Zacks Value Style Score (part of the Zacks Style Scores system), which pays close attention to both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics to grade stocks from A to F (an An is better than a B; a B is better than a C; and so on), is pretty helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Quantum Stocks to Buy Before the Masses Mobilize",
        "content": "AI is still the talk of the town, but prudent investors know when to look forward and seek new catalysts for the next technological breakthrough—and quantum computing is fast becoming the next big thing. Thanks to the potential to accelerate current computing technologies, the sector is slowly gaining traction, and keen-eyed investors are already looking for quantum stocks to buy.\n\nTo the uninitiated, quantum computing aims to utilize the law of quantum mechanics to increase computer calculation speeds by a factor of millions or even billions. However, the technology in its current form is not yet commercially viable, though remember, people said the same thing about AI a few years ago.\n\nThe opportunity lies here: companies are joining the quantum race, and many will eventually strike gold.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s look at three quantum computing-related stocks that can get you front-row seats to the latest technological revolution—and the returns that come with it. To get my list, I used the following criteria to screen for companies operating in the quantum computing market:\n\nPositive YOY growth in full-year operating cash flow, A high percentage of revenue is spent on R&D.\n\nI sorted the list based on the R&D expense-to-revenue ratio from highest to lowest to find companies willing to bet the farm and win the race.\n\nAmazon.com (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nBy now, everyone knows the tech giant Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). However, many may not be aware of its continuous success in breaking through the constraints of being just another online store.\n\nThe company has taken different paths in building its tech empire. Amazon Web Services, its metered, pay-as-you-go API, and on-demand cloud computing have seen some success. They also offer Braket Direct, a platform that allows researchers and software developers to reserve and utilize quantum computing technologies.\n\nAmazon also announced a quantum computing chip late last year that can reduce potential errors in computational processes by a factor of 100 (or 99% in layman’s terms). This is an incredibly important stride in quantum computing, as the increased computation speeds can result in increased errors.\n\nAmazon’s R&D spending, tagged as “Technology and infrastructure” in its financials, seems to be bearing fruit. It reached $85.62 billion in FY’23, representing 14.89% of its total revenue. In addition, the company’s operating cash flow grew from $46.75 billion to $84.95 billion—more than enough to spend on its quantum computing efforts. This makes Amazon one of the most attractive quantum stocks to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), is one of the biggest tech giants today and among several that stand at the forefront of modern technology.\n\nThe company is no stranger to innovation. Alphabet recently entered the AI arena with Gemini, a generative AI based on the multimodal large language models of the same name. While Gemini is still catching up to ChatGPT, the company’s efforts in quantum computing are a whole other story waiting to be told.\n\nSycamore, a quantum processor developed by Google’s Artificial Intelligence division, claims to have reached “quantum supremacy” by completing a task in 200 seconds that would take 10,000 years on a classical supercomputer. The company reached a significant milestone in 2023 after reducing logical qubit error rates to 10-2.\n\nAlphabet also launched XPRIZE, a global competition to develop quantum computing algorithms that can demonstrate problem-solving capabilities for real-world applications. Coupled with its long-term goal of building a one million-qubit supercomputer that could hasten the race towards quantum computing, real-life application may be just around the corner. Investors looking into quantum stocks to buy can’t go wrong with GOOGL.\n\nIn 2023, Alphabet spent $45.43 billion on research and development, or 14.77% of its total revenue. During the same period, its operating cash flow grew from $91.49 billion to $101.75 billion.\n\nInternational Business Machines Corp (IBM) Sign of IBM on the office building\n\nSource: Laborant / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnyone working in a corporate setting may have encountered International Business Machines Corp (NYSE:IBM) at least once daily. The company is famous for its hardware and software products in many corporate offices and businesses. However, there is more to what they do.\n\nIBM is a strong proponent of the development of quantum computing. In 2023, the company published a paper claiming it had developed a quantum error-correcting code 10 times more efficient than previously established methods. It also laid out a roadmap for quantum computing, showcasing its commitment to developing the technology.\n\nThe company also has a long-standing partnership with Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute to accelerate quantum computing research, workforce development, and education in New York. This partnership unveiled the world’s first-ever IBM quantum computer in the university’s Voorhees Computing Center Chapel. It partnered with the University of Melbourne and released the Qiskit quantum computing software stack.\n\nIn 2023, the company allocated around 11.31% of its revenue to research & development. Meanwhile, IBM’s cash flow increased from $10.43 billion to $19.93 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rick Orford held long positions in AMZN and GOOGL.

Microsoft Copilot\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the best tech stocks to own amid the rising demand for artificial intelligence, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is already enjoying the returns on its investment. The company’s timely investment in OpenAI and the integration of ChatGPT into its products and services helped boost the revenue.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nI believe Microsoft is only moving upwards from here.

One of the largest e-commerce companies, Amazon also holds the largest market share in the cloud and generated a revenue of $143.3 billion, up 13% in the first quarter from a year ago. Its operating income tripled to $15.3 billion.\n\nIts diversified business shields it from the market’s ups and downs, and it has seen impressive growth in the advertising segment. Marketers have understood the importance of investing in Amazon advertising, and as the economy improves, we could see a higher revenue growth rate in this segment.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts North American and international business segment saw impressive growth throughout the quarter, and the upcoming summer holiday season could lead to a surge in e-commerce sales.\n\nUp 23% in 2024, AMZN stock is heading to $200 very soon. With Amazon Web Services roaring higher in the industry, the company is a global giant with a strong runway.\n\nWalmart (WMT) A photo of the Walmart (WMT) logo on the side of a truck.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe world’s largest retailer, Walmart (NYSE:WMT) has come a long way over the past six decades. It has seen it all: the market ups and downs, a pandemic, war, and inflation. However, the company stood the test of time and in the past five years, WMT stock is up 83% and 28% so for in 2024.\n\nWalmart attracted consumers with its low-cost products, which has helped improve sales and profits. In the first quarter, it saw a 5.8% revenue growth and a 21% jump from a year ago in the e-commerce segment.\n\nOne solid reason to invest in Walmart stock is management’s commitment to keeping pace with the massive competition. It is investing in the e-commerce segment and a subscription service that has gained high popularity.\n\nThese investments are also paying off. Walmart has a “buy” rating from 25 TipRanks analysts with an average price target of $73.12. The stock also offers a dividend of 1.2% and recently hiked the dividend by 9%.\n\nNovo Nordisk (NVO) Novo Nordisk logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: joreks / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the most valuable biotech companies in the world right now, Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) is gaining massive popularity due to its successful weight loss drug. The company’s drug, Ozempic, led to a significant revenue surge and the stock is up 450% in the past five years.\n\nThe anti-obesity market will keep growing throughout the decade, and this is where Novo Nordisk is set to benefit. Investors are concerned about the rising competition in the industry but one thing to remember is that Novo is one of the first companies to develop and market the drug.\n\nThis gives it an early-mover advantage and it enjoys high trust from the industry. It reported a 28% jump in the net profit in the first quarter, following which the management raised the outlook for the year.\n\nNVO stock is very close to the 52-week high of $144 but it could keep moving upwards. It is up 38% so far this year and there is no stopping its momentum. Yes, competitors are working on oral weight loss drugs but that may take time and until then, Novo Nordisk will keep leading the market.\n\nChipotle Mexican Grill (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nA long-term buy and hold, Chipotle Mexican Grill (NYSE:CMG) stock is up 42% in 2024. Priced at more than $3,000 per share, the stock isn’t cheap but it is a brilliant blue-chip stock to add to your portfolio. It recently expanded in the Middle East and has signed the first franchise agreement for restaurants that will open in Kuwait.\n\nThe company saw a 14.1% year-over-year revenue jump in the first quarter and a 7% rise in comparable sales growth. This led to a 23.2% increase in net income. The company is also working on expansion plans and opened 47 new restaurants in the quarter.\n\nChipotle is an incredible stock with massive upside potential. One reason to buy the stock is the 50-for-1 stock split. It will start trading post-split basis from June 26.\n\nThe company enjoys pricing power and has reported impressive performance despite inflation.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Picture of a person laying on a couch holding a mobile phone that features the Netflix (NFLX) logo on the screen\n\nSource: Alex Ruhl / Shutterstock.com\n\nStreaming giant Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is ruling the market.\n\nThe stock is up 44% so far this year, and as one of the biggest streaming companies, Netflix has a long runway and I believe it will keep moving upwards.\n\nThe company is making significant revenue from advertising and has recently announced that it is moving into malls. Netflix has announced its locations for the first two Netflix House venues. It will be an experiential entertainment space set to open next year.\n\nOnly time will tell if the locations will be profitable, but they represent another potential line of revenue through them. Netflix enjoys a first-mover advantage in the industry and generates enough cash flow to keep investing in new content.\n\nIt puts in a lot of effort to ensure that there is fresh and content available for viewers. Its password crackdown decision has also paid off, and the company saw a 15% jump in revenue and a 54% jump in the operating income in the first quarter.\n\nWith Netflix, there is a lot more to come.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe stock market’s favorite tech stock, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a solid buy after the stock split. This is one stock that will keep you in the green for a very long time. The stock is up 171% this year and is steadily moving upwards. Having hit new highs after the quarterly results, the management announced a 10-for-1 stock split, making it easier for investors to accumulate this industry darling.\n\nOne solid reason to buy NVDA stock is the unprecedented demand for AI chips. With organizations and governments adopting AI, Nvidia will continue to see steady demand. Its revenue numbers are proof that the company is one of the best in the industry.\n\nToday, it is the most valuable company in the world, passing Microsoft. It is taking the S&P 500 to new highs and made several investors rich. In the first quarter, its data center revenue soared 427% from a year ago to $22.6 billion.\n\nNvidia’s Blackwell chip has brought about a new era of computing, and I believe this will help the company generate higher revenue. NVDA is a solid long-term buy and hold regardless of the market situation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "How to invest in AI as the rally continues",
        "content": "Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the AI rally. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to significantly influence equity market gains, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) contributing to 64% of the global equity market’s growth in total return terms in the past 18 months.\n\nNotably, chipmaker Nvidia became the largest listed company globally in June. Additionally, 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies mentioned “AI” in their first-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet data. Here’s how investors can seize the AI opportunity, according to UBS.\n\nNvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the split increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation, it does not change the company’s overall value. “Splitting the stock shouldn’t create economic value in theory, but it will make the company more accessible to smaller investors,” Morningstar technology equity strategist Brian Colello, explained.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said: “AI looks set to remain a key driver of equity market returns. We see opportunities in the enabling layer of the AI value chain and in vertically integrated megacaps.”\n\nSignificant investments are being directed towards AI, particularly at semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend approximately $200bn (£158bn) in the sector, a 35% increase over 2023, according to FactSet consensus. For this level of capital expenditure to be justified, AI use cases need to scale up significantly, UBS said.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nPotential applications span advertising, customer service, personal and coding assistants, R&D, cybersecurity, and more. However, AI-linked revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill AI justify the hype?\n\nUBS expects robust capital investment in AI to continue, driving strong earnings growth for companies within the enabling layer of the value chain. For instance, the Swiss bank expects earnings in the global semiconductor industry to rise by 50% this year and 25% in 2025. As the AI ecosystem expands, annual capital expenditure for the enabling layer could reach $331bn by 2027.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Apple, Bitcoin, Target and PepsiCo\n\nHowever, potential risks include the possibility of overcapacity in components like graphics processing units, custom chips, or memory if there’s a lack of significant model advancements or consumer/business uptake.\n\nThe AI value chain: three critical layers\n\nTo understand AI’s potential, UBS breaks down its value chain, comprising of three layers:\n\nEnabling Layer: Includes semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Intelligence Layer: Consists of large language models. Application Layer: Encompasses companies providing AI services for specific use cases, such as copilots and coding assistants.\n\nThe tech capex surge has primarily benefited the enabling layer. While fears of overcapacity could introduce volatility, this segment currently enjoys strong investment rates, offering a mix of attractive earnings growth profiles, competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway. UBS suggests focusing on semiconductor companies leading the AI infrastructure investments at data centres.\n\nMoreover, the AI investment landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major players.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\n“Over time, we expect the AI market to be dominated by an oligopoly of vertically integrated “foundries” and monolithic players along the value chain. So, alongside semiconductors, we also think investors should position in the oligopolies that are present across the entire technology stack, covering chips, cloud computing, and generative AI models and applications. We think these companies will be well positioned to navigate potential shifts in the competitive landscape in different parts of the value chain,” UBS wrote in its CIO 2H outlook.\n\nAI rally: China or US?\n\nWhile the US has seen the greatest benefits from the AI rally, UBS notes that China's tech giants remain undervalued, trading at similar levels as before ChatGPT's launch. Despite challenges like tariffs, export controls, and local regulations, China’s tech leaders are heavily investing in AI.\n\n“Ultimately, we expect China to develop an AI ecosystem that is distinct from that in much of the rest of the world. This should lead to significant monetisation potential for China’s AI giants,” UBS said.\n\nIs a company riskier than a country?\n\nThe market capitalisation of AI chipmaker Nvidia recently surpassed $3.3trn, more than double Switzerland’s entire blue-chip stock index and significantly more than China’s CSI 300. This raises questions about the risks of holding a single company versus a country-level index.\n\nWhile individual companies are generally more volatile, not participating in the returns these companies generate could pose a greater risk to investors’ wealth over time, according to the Swiss bank.\n\nInvestors should seek quality growth\n\nFinally, UBS said investors should focus on global quality wealth compounders—companies with a competitive edge, pricing power, and high barriers to entry. Such businesses, with a track record of disciplined capital allocation, strong balance sheets, and consistent profit growth, offer long-term sustainable value.\n\nQuality growth, often driven by structural growth themes like sustainable development, energy transition, and water scarcity, should be a core component of investors’ equity holdings, UBS added.\n\nWatch: Nvidia will remain dominant for next 3-5 years: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\\\">NVDA</a>) has reached<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-became-3t-company-133118501.html\\\"> a $3 trillion market capitalization,</a> surpassing Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\\\">AAPL</a>) to become the second most valuable company in the US.

        "content": "While blue chip stocks are always a good investment portfolio idea, I suggest some smart diversification. And one of the best ways that I know to diversify is to buy highly rated stocks under $10.\n\nStocks under $10 may not sound interesting, but these names can be a strategic move for anyone wanting to diversify and improve their portfolios.\n\nWhile cautious investors will associate lower-priced stocks with higher risk, the Portfolio Grader can help you find some outstanding choices to round out a portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIt’s important to remember that stocks under $10, when included in a portfolio of blue-chip equities, can expose you to smaller companies with high growth potential. And diversification is important because if you have a falling segment, your gains from other sectors can help you mitigate your losses.\n\nThe Portfolio Grader can help you find stocks that are priced low, not because they are struggling but because they are an excellent opportunity. Stocks under $10 could be priced that way because of restructuring or because the company is in an emerging industry.\n\nBy evaluating stocks based on momentum, analyst sentiment, revenue growth and earnings performance, you have a better chance of choosing quality stocks under $10 for your portfolio. These seven names are a good place to start.\n\nSummit Therapeutics (SMMT) MRNA Stock Will Continue Its Slump, but a $25 It Will Be a Great Buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSummit Therapeutics (NASDAQ:SMMT) is a biopharmaceutical company that works on the discovery, development and commercialization of therapies for unmet medical needs.\n\nThe company currently has two Phase 3 trials underway with its lead candidate, ivonescimab, an investigational bispecific antibody to treat non-small cell lung cancer.\n\nThe company recently raised $200 million from an institutional investor for 22.2 million shares of SMMT stock. It plans to use the money to advance the development of ivonescimab, with the goal of completing Phase 3 trials and submitting the treatment to regulators for approval.\n\nThat money will be added to the $157 million the company had on hand at the end of the first quarter, in which it spent $46.2 million on operating expenses. The company doesn’t have an income stream yet, so it posted a loss of $34 million, or 5 cents per share, for the first quarter.\n\nSMMT stock is up 196% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAnnexon (ANNX) Image of two scientists in lab coats studying results in a lab. best biotech stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnnexon (NASDAQ:ANNX) is a California-based bioscience company developing treatments for autoimmune, neurodegenerative, and ophthalmic diseases of the body, brain, and eye.\n\nStory continues\n\nIts impressive pipeline includes a potential treatment for Guillain-Barre syndrome, a rare disorder in which the body’s immune system is expected to report Phase 3 trials in the fourth quarter.\n\nIt also has Phase 2 trials for potential treatments for geographic atrophy, Huntington’s disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, otherwise known as ALS.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter included $21 million in research and development expenses and $7.6 million in administrative costs. The company has cash and cash equivalents of $264.9 million and expects to have enough money currently to fund operations into mid-2026.\n\nANNX stock is up 14% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nAurora Cannabis (ACB) aerial view of a cannabis plant in a pot. cannabis stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAurora Cannabis (NASDAQ:ACB) is a Canadian cannabis company that is considered a leading producer of medical cannabis in Canada.\n\nThe company has a variety of medical-use and adult recreational products, including flower products, vapes, edibles, concentrates and more.\n\nCannabis stocks were a hot commodity in 2020 when there was an expectation that the Biden administration and a Democratic-controlled Congress would push through federal legalization of marijuana rather than leaving it to the states.\n\nHowever, the Covid-19 pandemic and inflationary issues derailed those plans, and federal recreational use is still a pipe dream for Aurora investors.\n\nHowever, the Justice Department is recommending that cannabis be reclassified from a Schedule 1 to a Schedule 3 drug, which would give marijuana stocks a boost.\n\nAurora’s financial results for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024 (ending March 31) included $67.4 million in revenue, up 5% from the previous year. Medicinal cannabis made up a large part of that increase, as it was up 20% from last year, while adult recreational use was down 29%.\n\nI expect the numbers for adult recreational cannabis to improve. ACB stock is up 15% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nHimalaya Shipping (HSHP) A large ULCV container ship underway, sails on open water fully loaded with containers and cargo - the ZIM San Francisco\n\nSource: ImagineStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nBased in Bermuda, Himalaya Shipping (NYSE:HSHP) is a new entrant into the shipping business. It just accepted delivery of its 12th dual-fueled dry bulk vessel from a Chinese shipyard, with each ship capable of transporting 210,000 in dead weight tonnage.\n\nAs new ships, the fleet of next-generation cargo ships can use liquefied natural gas for propulsion, reducing per-ton emissions by 60%. The company also started paying a monthly dividend in January, and plans to continue the practice that will be popular for income investors.\n\nEarnings for the first quarter of 2024 included revenue of $23.6 million and net income of $2.5 million. Now that the fleet is fully operational, Himalaya Shipping should see those numbers improve.\n\nHSHP stock is up 27% in 2024 and gets an “A” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (EBS) A mobile phone displays the website for Emergent Biosolutions (EBS)\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmergent BioSolutions (NYSE:EBS) is a biopharmaceutical company headquartered in Maryland. The company develops vaccines and antibody therapies for infectious diseases and to treat opioid overdoses.\n\nThe company has countermeasures to combat some of the most critical public health threats in the world, including smallpox, anthrax and botulism. It also makes a reactive skin decontamination lotion kit among other products.\n\nMeanwhile, its pipeline includes potential treatments for Lassa fever, Ebola, and influenza.\n\nThe company is undoubtedly doing important work, and it’s being well rewarded. Revenues in the first quarter were $300.4 million, up from $164.3 million in the same quarter a year ago. The company also posted a profit of $9 million after posting a loss of $186.2 million in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nEBS stock is on a roll this year, up 169% so far. It gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nReborn Coffee (REBN) NUZE Stock. A photo of a cup of coffee and some coffee beans and a towel on a wooden table. Coffee stocks\n\nSource: Evgeny Karandaev/ShutterStock.com\n\nReborn Coffee (NASDAQ:REBN) is a specialty coffee maker. Coffee is one of the most popular drinks in the U.S., with an estimated 73% of American consumers acknowledging being a coffee drinker.\n\nIt seems there’s coffee for every pallet, including high-priced coffeehouse drinks to at-home drip coffee makers that give you a basic cup of joe.\n\nReborn Coffee is has only 14 locations, mostly in California. But it also offers a subscription service on its website, and makes whole-bean products, pour-over packs and cold brew packs.\n\nIt doesn’t expect to stay small for long. Reborn announced an expansion into China and Southeast Asia and plans to open a location in Abu Dhabi. It also has serious e-commerce plans by making its products available on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nEarnings for the fourth quarter of 2023 included revenue of $1.8 million, up 109% from the same quarter a year ago. Full-year revenue was $6 million versus $3.2 million in 2022.\n\nREBN stock is up 48% this year and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nNuScale Power (SMR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US nuclear power company NuScale Power LLC on screen in front of website.

The effort has $4 billion in commitments for U.S. financial institutions, and the company is hoping to get approval in 2025.\n\nSuch a deal would be a massive win for NuScale and its investors.\n\nSMR stock, which has reactors that can provide power in nuclear plants, is under $10 now but probably won’t be for long. It is currently up 190% in 2024 and gets a “B” rating in the Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Amazon Is Phenomenal, but Is Another E-Commerce Stock a Better Buying Opportunity Right Now?",
        "content": "Not many businesses dominate quite like Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) does. The massive tech enterprise is currently valued at nearly $2 trillion. This huge figure comes from a rapidly rising share price, which has soared $1,000% in the past decade and 7,400% in the past 20 years.\n\nThis \"Magnificent Seven\" stock has rewarded its shareholders in remarkable fashion. However, investors might want to consider another e-commerce business that could be flying under the radar right now. It might even be a better buying opportunity than Amazon.\n\nAmazon's dominance can't be overstated\n\nI believe we should first take the time to appreciate Amazon. The company originally sold just books online during its founding in the 1990s. But now, virtually any item you can think of can be purchased on the popular website.\n\nThis wide reach has resulted in nearly 40% of all money spent online in the U.S. going through Amazon.com. That's a tremendous statistic. Even more telling, Amazon's online stores raked in $235 billion in net sales in the past 12 months.\n\nThe company relentlessly focuses on low prices and a wide selection. And if that wasn't enough to provide customers with a great shopping experience, Amazon's massive and developed logistics footprint enables fast and free shipping. It's hard to compete with this.\n\nBesides e-commerce, Amazon has a strong position in other categories, namely cloud computing, streaming entertainment, and digital advertising. It has multiple growth engines that can propel it.\n\nA beaten-down niche player\n\nWhile Amazon deservedly gets a lot of the attention, investors need to get familiar with Etsy (NASDAQ: ETSY). Its shares have been obliterated. They currently trade 80% below their peak price, reached in November 2021.\n\nEtsy operates an online marketplace that sells unique, handcrafted, and vintage goods. This specialization separates the business from Amazon's mass-market focus. In fact, a survey found that 83% of Etsy buyers found items on the site that they couldn't find anywhere else. Amazon is the elephant in the room in the e-commerce world, but at least Etsy finds a way to stand out.\n\nThis company possesses an economic moat, too. As of March 31, it had 96.4 million buyers and 9.1 million active sellers on the platform. This two-sided ecosystem creates powerful network effects.\n\nEtsy doesn't handle inventory itself, so it also doesn't need to invest in warehouses or delivery trucks. This makes it an asset-light operation that generates consistent profits. In the past five years, the company's operating margin has averaged an impressive 15.9%.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, Etsy shares have gotten crushed. This is where the opportunity lies for investors. The stock trades at a dirt-cheap valuation. The current forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12.5 represents a 43% discount to the S&P 500. However, based on the factors discussed, one could easily argue that Etsy is an above-average business.\n\nThe challenge with buying shares right now, particularly when the company is struggling to drive meaningful growth, is that it's hard to know when the situation will improve. Gross merchandise sales in the first quarter of 2024 were down almost 4% year over year. Etsy could continue to struggle for a little while longer.\n\nHowever, for investors who have a time horizon of five years, this stock could work out nicely. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis, online shopping only represents 15.9% of all retail sales in the U.S. On a global level, I'd suspect that proportion is a lot lower. This gives Etsy a favorable backdrop to achieve healthy, profitable growth over the long haul.\n\nOnce the company is on a better footing, I believe the valuation multiple will follow suit. This makes now a good time to buy the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Etsy right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Etsy, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Etsy wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Best Stocks to Invest $50,000 In Right Now",
        "content": "This may be one of the best times ever to invest in technology stocks as we're facing a game-changing moment. The development of artificial intelligence (AI) is just getting started, and this technology has the potential to revolutionize our daily lives and how many businesses operate. The results could save time and money and even result in major transformations such as the discovery of life-saving medicines. Analysts predict the AI market, valued at about $200 billion right now, could reach beyond $1 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nSo now is a great time to invest $50,000 across a basket of stocks present in the area of AI. (This should be part of a diversified strategy so I would only advise investing this entire amount in AI stocks if you already have built a solid portfolio including other industries and stocks. Otherwise, consider investing a smaller portion, according to your investment style, in the following stocks and the rest across quality players in other industries.)\n\nMost of the following AI powerhouses already are winning today -- one is a recovery play -- and they all might have a lot more to gain down the road. You could you, too, if you invest in them early on. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) may be the first stock many investors think of when someone mentions AI. That's because the company dominates the AI chip market, holding an 80% share, and this has helped Nvidia increase earnings in the triple digits in recent quarters.\n\nThe stock price has followed, climbing nearly 200% in the past year, but there's still room for this player to run over time thanks to its commitment to innovation. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) power critical AI tasks like the training and inferencing of models, and they are the fastest on the market. The company isn't standing still, though, and aims to update GPUs on an annual basis -- so Nvidia could stay far ahead of rivals for the long term.\n\nThe next catalyst for Nvidia is a big one, the launch of its Blackwell architecture and most powerful chip ever later this year. So right now is a great time to get in on this market giant.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is benefiting from AI in two ways. The e-commerce powerhouse has been using AI to streamline and generally improve its operations -- for example, determining the fastest delivery routes for packages. This can lower costs over time and boost earnings, and it also can keep customers coming back as they'll appreciate the optimized services.\n\nAmazon also is a leader in cloud computing, operating the Amazon Web Services (AWS) business, and here, its AI investments are already bearing fruit. AWS offers customers a variety of tools, from chips to a fully managed service featuring large language models to customize for any AI project. And this has helped AWS recently reach a $100 billion annual revenue run rate.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's important to remember that Amazon also has a long track record of earnings growth and delivers sales and net income in the billions of dollars. So, Amazon makes a solid buy for its long-term strength and AI potential ahead.\n\n3. Super Micro Computer\n\nSuper Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) has been around for about 30 years, gradually growing revenue, but the business truly took off thanks to the AI boom. The company makes servers, workstations, and full rack scale solutions needed in AI data centers. This has helped Super Micro's earnings soar in recent years, and the stock price has followed.\n\nHere's why this should continue. Super Micro's strategy of working hand-in-hand with the world's top chipmakers allows it to immediately incorporate their chips into its products as soon as they launch. On top of this the company's product lines including many common parts, making the assembly of a customized product fast.\n\nThis speed should keep Super Micro's growth going -- and the company's liquid cooling technology is becoming a key growth driver too. Heat generation in AI data centers is a huge problem, but Super Micro's technology addresses it perfectly.\n\nAll of this makes Super Micro an AI winner today, and this success should continue well into the future.\n\n4. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) fell behind in the AI race over the past few years, but the stock could make a great recovery play right now. Especially since the company has reached an important turning point. Intel recently launched a new portfolio of AI products that could help it carve out a decent share in this market -- and demand is so high that there is room for more than one chip maker to excel.\n\nThe company launched the Gaudi 3 accelerator, one it says may outperform Nvidia's current GPU when it comes to inference and power efficiency -- and at a lower cost.\n\nIntel also may climb as it makes progress to become the world's second-biggest foundry by 2030. The company has opened its manufacturing network to others, meaning it will produce chips for these customers. This won't result in earnings growth overnight, but over the long haul, the results could be big. And that makes now a good time to bet on Intel's future.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nBroadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) has been in the news lately because it announced a 10-for-1 stock split, set for July. But that isn't the reason to buy this semiconductor and networking giant. The reason to buy the stock has to do with the demand Broadcom is seeing from AI customers as well as growth from its recent acquisition of VMware. Broadcom reported a 43% increase in revenue in the recent quarter to more than $12 billion, and these two elements drove the gains.\n\nThe company makes thousands of products that you'll find anywhere from your smartphone to a data center. This has helped Broadcom grow earnings over time, but the great demand from AI these days could spur a new era of growth.\n\nIn the quarter, AI revenue soared 280% to $3.1 billion, and Broadcom predicts AI revenue will surpass $11 billion for the year. As Broadcom says, the networking of AI accelerators is difficult, but Broadcom has the technology to make it happen -- so there's reason to be optimistic about growth as the AI market develops. And that's why Broadcom is a buy before and after the upcoming stock split.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Is Ditching Plastic and Moving to Paper Fillers. Here's the Hidden Small-Cap Stock That Could Soar as a Result.",
        "content": "The world's largest e-commerce company, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), kicked off summer by announcing that it's kicking plastic to the curb. By the end of this year, the company hopes to replace 95% of the plastic pillows in its packages with paper fillers. The company's press release says this move \"[w]ill avoid nearly 15 billion plastic air pillows annually.\"\n\nMany people likely processed this announcement simply by thinking about the environmental implications. But as an investor, my thoughts immediately went to something else: That's a lot of plastic pillows to replace with paper. And I wondered if there was a company that could profit from this decision from Amazon.\n\nIn fact, there is. Ranpak Holdings(NYSE: PACK) is a company that few investors have ever heard of. But it could find itself as a sudden beneficiary of Amazon's abrupt move.\n\nRanpak is a surprisingly strong business\n\nRanpak sells machines for filling, wrapping, and cushioning packages. It also sells consumable paper products for these machines. As of the first quarter of 2024, the company had 141,000 machines placed with various businesses. And as these businesses use their machines, they eventually go back to Ranpak when they need more paper.\n\nAccording to certain investor presentations, Amazon is already a customer of Ranpak, although it's unclear how big a customer it is. Craig-Hallum analyst Greg Palm says that Amazon is Ranpak's largest direct customer, according to The Fly. But this isn't explicitly stated in Ranpak's annual filings.\n\nThat said, 30% of Ranpak's revenue in 2023 came from e-commerce companies. This is important to keep in mind. The company also says that 11% of revenue comes from direct customer purchases, whereas the rest comes through its distributor business model. So this is the ballpark of how big Amazon could be for Ranpak.\n\nRanpak won't necessarily blow you away with growth or profit margins. But there is a certain strength to its model. Once businesses buy its machines, they have incentive to keep using them. And as they consume the paper products, they need to replenish supplies from Ranpak. This is a form of recurring revenue, which is good. The company doesn't break out these financials, but it does say that its consumables are \"high margin.\"\n\nWhat could happen after Amazon's big move?\n\nRanpak went public with a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) -- the deal was complete in 2019. Therefore, it's traded under its current ticker symbol for almost five years. As the chart below shows, revenue growth and earnings per share (EPS) progress have been better than the stock's performance.\n\nStory continues PACK Chart\n\nRanpak's revenue and profits could be on the cusp of getting a bigger boost as Amazon moves to replace 15 billion plastic pillows with paper. Ranpak won't necessarily be Amazon's only supplier, but the boost to its business could be meaningful. Moreover, the boost to profitability could be even more pronounced, since management says that consumable paper products are higher-margin.\n\nAdditionally, Craig-Hallum's Palm theorizes that Amazon's decision could send ripples throughout the e-commerce space. More businesses could similarly move away from plastic in the coming months, following the leader in the industry. Since 30% of its revenue comes from e-commerce companies, this secondary ripple effect could be an ever-bigger deal for Ranpak.\n\nI've avoided giving concrete numbers when it comes to the potential benefit to Ranpak, because investors simply don't have enough information to be that precise. There are plenty of unanswered questions.\n\nHowever, here are some encouraging things for investors to keep in mind with Ranpak today. First, the stock is reasonably priced. As of this writing, it has a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of about 1.5 -- that's typical for a low-growth business. PACK PS Ratio Chart\n\nInvestors don't have to pay up for Ranpak stock -- the valuation is reasonable.\n\nThe other important thing to keep in mind is that Ranpak is a low-risk investment, in my opinion. Since there is a recurring-revenue element to its business, financial results are consistent. It's unreasonable to be worried about something suddenly changing and putting the business in jeopardy.\n\nIn other words, if Amazon's move toward paper doesn't provide a benefit, Ranpak's business should continue along as it is now. The stock won't necessarily rise. But I wouldn't expect things to go south.\n\nHowever, if Amazon's move toward paper does provide a benefit, the positive effect for Ranpak could be large. Moreover, if other e-commerce companies follow Amazon's lead, Ranpak's financial results could really soar.\n\nI don't believe the market is pricing in this potential upside with Ranpak stock today, which is why this is an interesting opportunity. It won't make many headlines. But this could be an under-the-radar way to profit from Amazon's packaging announcement.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Ranpak right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Ranpak, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Ranpak wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock is in “a league of its own,” BTIG analysts said in a note released Sunday.\n\nThe chipmaker’s shares have recently traded approximately 100% above its 200-day moving average (DMA). According to BTIG, this is unprecedented, as the widest spread any U.S. company has ever traded above its 200 DMA while holding the position of the largest company was 80%, achieved by Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO) in March 2000, marking its all-time high.\n\nJust like NVDA this time, Cisco also briefly surpassed Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in March 2000 to become the world’s most valuable company.\n\n“While we fully recognize the fundamentals are much different this time around, in the last five years, NVDA is +4,280% compared to CSCO's +4,460% gain in the five years leading up to its peak,” BTIG analysts highlighted.\n\n“Over the last 18 months, NVDA is +827% which is actually double that of CSCO's 18-month gain into '00,” they continued.\n\nMore broadly, there have been significant inflows into large-cap tech and growth funds, suggesting a potential market froth following the recent run, BTIG noted.\n\nLooking ahead, the investment firm said it remains concerned about a potential near-term unwind of many year-to-date leaders. However, they also note that within the Magnificent 7, group, there is some dispersion, with stocks like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) still appearing constructive and not overly stretched.\n\n“If the SPX is going to avoid a bigger pullback into July, bulls need to see continued rotation below the surface,” analysts concluded.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia is 'in a league of its own,' BTIG says\n\nHyundai Motor's union in South Korea votes to strike\n\nChina wants EU to remove tariffs on EVs by July 4 as talks resume\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Up 45% to 226%, Are These 3 Stocks Too Hot to Buy Now?",
        "content": "There's no denying it: The stock market is red-hot. The S&P 500, Nasdaq Composite, and Dow Jones Industrial Average are up about 25%, 31%, and 13%, respectively, over the last 12 months. Many individual stocks are up even more.\n\nBut here's the thing: Touching red-hot items can leave you burned.\n\nSo, is now the time to load up on stocks or to play it cool? This week, a panel of Motley Fool contributors examined three of the hottest stocks on Wall Street: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), CrowdStrike (NASDAQ: CRWD), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is up 45% over the past year. Here's why it could go higher.\n\nJustin Pope (Amazon): Shares of the cloud and e-commerce giant Amazon have surged 45% over the past 12 months, outpacing the S&P 500 by a comfortable margin. But at a time when many stocks have outrun their fundamentals and could face setbacks, Amazon might be ready to take it up a notch.\n\nAmazon's culture is arguably my favorite part of the company. It relentlessly invests profits back into the company to grow, always looking for its next big thing.\n\nThe pandemic juiced demand for e-commerce and digital services, impacting Amazon's core retail and cloud businesses. The company stepped up to the plate and significantly invested in growing its supply chain capacity and cloud capabilities. You can see that Amazon has spent tens of billions of dollars on capital expenditures over the past several years: AMZN Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart\n\nNow, Amazon is starting to see a return on all that invested capital. Its cash flow from operating the business is at all-time highs, and earnings are poised for a stretch of high-speed growth. Analysts believe the company could grow earnings by an average of 30% annually for three to five years -- meanwhile, shares trade at \"just\" 39 times earnings today. In hindsight, that valuation will look like a bargain if Amazon's earnings growth meets expectations.\n\nOver the years, Amazon has shown it will continue swinging for the fences by investing in itself. Not every Amazon project will be a home run, but long-term investors can comfortably put their money behind a management team like that. Fortunately, you may not need to wait long for the stock to create wealth for shareholders, even if you're relatively new to the stock. The stock's 45% run is remarkable, but the reality is that there could be more to come.\n\nCrowdStrike's run is a cause for celebration and concern\n\nWill Healy(CrowdStrike): Perhaps no cybersecurity stock has benefited more from the artificial intelligence (AI) boom than CrowdStrike. The endpoint security specialist has risen 151% over the last year as it capitalized on the threats and functionality brought by the emerging technology. Amid this increase, the company will become the newest member of the S&P 500 on June 24.\n\nStory continues\n\nCrowdStrike's Falcon platform has long served as a leader in endpoint security, a segment focused on protecting laptops, smartphones, servers, and other devices.\n\nMoreover, the company offers what it says is the most complete AI-native defense, using the highest-fidelity security data to train its AI models. As such, the more its models train, the better they become at defending customer networks.\n\nCrowdStrike has also maintained growth in an environment where customers increasingly deal with just one cybersecurity vendor. Its management said on the fiscal Q1 2025 (ended April 30) earnings call that 65% of its customers have purchased five or more of its modules. Also, deals involving eight or more modules rose 95% in the quarter, a factor that could indicate its market share is rising.\n\nThe question for prospective buyers is whether they waited too long to buy the stock. Revenue in fiscal Q1 grew 33% yearly to $921 million, slower than the 36% increase in fiscal 2024. Also, if fiscal 2025 revenue comes in at the midpoint of the forecast $3.97 billion to $4.01 billion, it will slow to 30%.\n\nThat slowdown in revenue growth may prompt investors to question its elevated sales multiple. CrowdStrike's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio is now 29, well above the average P/S ratio of 20 over the last year and approximately 10 times the average 2.9 sales multiple for the S&P 500. Such valuations increase the danger of a pullback in the stock.\n\nAdmittedly, a high P/S ratio does not undermine its longer-term bull thesis. Nonetheless, investors should probably hold out for a lower sales multiple before putting more money to work in CrowdStrike.\n\nNvidia has climbed the mountain and is now the world's most valuable company\n\nJake Lerch (Nvidia): Up 226% over the last 12 months, Nvidia's recent rise will go down in history. The company recently surpassed Microsoft to become the world's most valuable company, with a market cap topping $3.4 trillion.\n\nYet, for many investors, the question has to be whether Nvidia's rally can go on. Can a stock that has already risen more than 10x in less than two years really be a smart long-term investment?\n\nTo answer this question, you have to dig into the numbers -- and they're eye-popping.\n\nLet's start with Nvidia's revenue. The company's trailing-12-month sales more than tripled from a low of $26 billion to almost $80 billion. What's more, revenue estimates continue to skyrocket. For Nvidia's current fiscal year (which ends on Jan. 28, 2025), analysts predict $120 billion; sales estimates rise to $160 billion the following year. In short, Wall Street expects the company's 2026 sales total to be roughly 6x its 2022 total.\n\nSo, despite the company's impressive revenue and lofty estimates of its future revenue, Nvidia's stock is still running ahead of the numbers. This is easy to see if you look at the stock's forward price-to-sales (P/S) ratio, which is nearing its all-time high of 46x.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- At the Spanish Grand Prix on Sunday, Formula 1 plans to debut a new artificial intelligence “Statbot” with Amazon.com Inc., whose executives described plans for AI-powered personalized broadcasts to keep viewers hooked.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nNvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can’t Keep Up How Long Will High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Russia Is Storing Up a Crime Wave When Its War on Ukraine Ends CDK Hackers Want Millions in Ransom to End Car Dealership Outage Hedge Funds’ Bullish Copper Bets Run Into China’s Slowdown\n\nThe statbot will trawl race archives and parse torrents of real-time racing data to feed context and trivia to broadcast presenters live during the Barcelona race, using technology from the Seattle-based company’s Amazon Web Services cloud computing division, said Neil Ralph, the tech company’s lead on technical collaboration with F1.\n\nIt’s a sign of how AI is creeping into media, and of how F1’s owner, Liberty Media Corp., is hunting for ways to keep fans glued to screens.\n\nSteered by billionaire cable magnate John C. Malone, Liberty bought F1 from CVC Capital Partners in a deal announced in 2016. Since then, it has focused on increasing the sport’s global appeal, growing its audience with marketing gambits like behind-the-scenes Netflix Inc. documentary series Formula 1: Drive to Survive.\n\nBut in a sport heavy on engineering, whose human protagonists are hidden behind helmets, executives want ways to jazz up the live race broadcast too. The companies say they’re also using AI to offer in-race predictions on matters like pit-stop timing or when a driver might try to overtake a rival, based on real-time details such as car performance and tire degradation.\n\n“With this data and the intimacy with the fan, you can contemplate hyper-personalized experiences,” AWS Canada Managing Director Eric Gales said in an interview at the Canadian Grand Prix in Montreal earlier in June.\n\nRalph said: “That’s where we want it to go, so you as a fan can choose how much data to see and what stories you want to be told.”\n\nVying against other sports, streaming shows, TikTok and video games, the battle for attention has never been so intense. While F1 has broadened its reach in the US with the Netflix series and new races such as the Las Vegas Grand Prix, the sport is still sometimes panned as too predictable. Last year, F1’s top driver, Red Bull Racing’s Max Verstappen, won 19 of the 22 races; this year he has won six of nine.\n\n“We can’t just rely on giving them a passive experience,” said Dean Locke, F1’s director of broadcast and media, speaking to reporters in Montreal remotely from the group’s media and technology center in Biggin Hill, UK.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works How Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon",
        "content": "Perhaps no two tech-oriented, consumer product companies are ingrained in U.S. consumers' everyday lives as much as Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAmazon is the leader of e-commerce, controlling a nearly 38% market share in the U.S. It's next closest competitor is Walmart, which has a less than 7% market share.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is estimated to hold a more than 59% market share in the smartphone market in the U.S.; Samsung is a distant second at 23%.\n\nWhile both companies have dominant market positions in the U.S. in their respective fields, the question is which stock is the better buy at the moment?\n\nGrowth and future prospects\n\nAmazon has been solidly outperforming Apple on the revenue growth front the past few quarters. The e-commerce giant has been able to grow its revenue by double digits each of the past four quarters, including by 13% last quarter to $143.3 billion.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has been struggling with growth. The company has only seen its revenue increase once in the past four quarters, a scant 2% gain in its December quarter. Last quarter, meanwhile, revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion. The company has been hampered by struggling iPhone sales in China and a lengthening replacement cycle.\n\nBoth companies are looking toward artificial intelligence (AI) to help spur growth.\n\nWhile not growing as quickly as its two main cloud computing competitors, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is still showing solid revenue growth, up 17% last quarter. The company plans to increase capital expenditures to expand its data center operations in order to meet the increasing demand for generative AI. The company believes this upfront investment will lead to strong free cash flow and better operating margins down the road.\n\nThe company is also helping customers build out their own AI solutions through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms. With BedRock, the company is providing foundational large language models (LLMs) from both itself and AI start-ups, while SageMaker helps customers create their own AI models.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has just jumped into the AI race with a number of AI features that will be powered by its Apple Intelligence solution. Apple Intelligence will be incorporated into its latest operating systems and be able to be used within its own and third-party apps while maintaining user privacy. It will also be added to its voice assistant, Siri, to help with various tasks such as finding a specific photo or hotel booking information.\n\nThe big hope for Apple is that the new AI features will help spur a hardware upgrade cycle, as later versions of its devices are generally needed to run these AI-related functions. The company has seen upgrade cycles start to lengthen, so these new features and future AI capabilities could spur people to more quickly upgrade their smartphones and computers.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images\n\nValuations\n\nApple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 33, lower than Amazon's forward P/E of over 40. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, Amazon has been growing its revenue at a much faster clip than Apple, which has struggled to grow its revenue over the past 12 months. Amazon has also been seeing more earnings growth, as the company leverages fixed costs to grow its bottom line.\n\nBoth companies have solid balance sheets. Amazon carries about $8 billion in net cash, while Apple has a whopping $68.6 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Apple's large cash position and prolific free cash flow give it a lot of flexibility to buy back shares, and the company recently announced an additional $110 billion share repurchase program.\n\nThe winner\n\nAmazon and Apple have proven to be two of the most successful companies in the world, and both should be long-term winners for investors. If I had to choose only one, I'd pick Amazon at this time given its higher growth. The company has also shown a willingness to spend a lot of cash in order to win in the past, and combined with the potential of AI, I think this will be a winning strategy.\n\nHowever, considering the potential of a hardware upgrade cycle due to AI, a cheaper valuation, and a boatload of cash, I wouldn't just toss Apple aside. Fortunately, investors can own both of these solid stocks if they choose.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy Now and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Some companies are so strong and have such incredibly long runways of growth ahead that you may never need to sell the shares. The advantage with this approach is that the stock can compound in value without you having to pay capital gains taxes.\n\nHere's why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Shopify(NYSE: SHOP) are two quality stocks you can buy today and hold for potentially years of compounding returns.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nOnline shopping might seem commonplace today, but it only comprised 15% of total retail sales in the U.S. in the first quarter of 2024. That relatively small figure highlights the enormous runway of growth for the leader Amazon that continues to absorb a growing share of the e-commerce market.\n\nAmazon is a large business with multiple revenue streams. While non-retail services like cloud computing and advertising have been two of its faster-growing businesses in recent years, revenue from online stores still makes up more than a third of its total revenue, and it's still gaining market share. J.P. Morgan expects Amazon's share of U.S. e-commerce to reach 44.5% this year, surpassing the current leader, Walmart.\n\nThe reason this is significant is that Amazon's online retail business is becoming more efficient at converting revenue into more profit, which is why the stock is up 48% over the last year. In the first quarter, the company's operating income jumped 221% year over year due to higher margins from online sales. Lowering retail costs is an ongoing process, so investors should expect more robust profit growth over the next year.\n\nAs management shortens the time that inventory sits in fulfillment centers and speeds up delivery times, it will lead to more frequent shopping behavior, which could boost sales and earnings. The average analyst on Wall Street expects Amazon's earnings per share to grow 23% on an annualized basis in the coming years. Assuming the stock continues to trade at the same valuation, it could climb at roughly the same rate over the next few years.\n\n2. Shopify\n\nThe global e-commerce market is valued at $4.1 trillion, according to Statista, but Amazon is not going to capture 100% of that market. That means there are potentially millions of businesses around the world that could turn to Shopify to help grow their online retail presence.\n\nShopify generates roughly a quarter of its revenue from subscriptions, but most of its revenue comes from service fees in merchant services, including payment processing. This means Shopify can grow through adding more merchants but also helping those merchants grow sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nShopify is basically a business partner with its merchant customers. It continues to bring more tools to the platform, which is widening the company's competitive advantage.\n\nOver the past two years, Shopify has launched more than 400 new features. It's no surprise to see the company's merchant services revenue grow 20% year over year to $1.4 billion in the first quarter. It's continuing to see growing adoption of Shopify Payments, which is the primary driver of merchant services revenue.\n\nShopify's growth is translating to growing free cash flow that management can reinvest into more innovation for its merchant customers. Since exiting its logistics business, the company has seen trailing-12-month free cash flow increase sharply over the last year to surpass $1 billion. Shopify's innovation and growing free cash flow is setting up another bull run for the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Doesn't Own Nvidia. Here's How He's Profited From the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock's Big Gains Anyway",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and tech stocks go together like...well, they usually don't go together. The legendary investor typically avoids stocks that are out of his wheelhouse. And tech isn't his strong suit.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Buffett doesn't own a single share of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). So, has he missed out on the artificial intelligence (AI) stock's massive gains over the last few years? Not entirely.\n\nBuffett's direct ways of profiting from Nvidia\n\nAlthough Buffett doesn't own any shares of Nvidia, Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio includes two exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that do. As a result, he has directly profited as Nvidia stock has skyrocketed.\n\nNvidia was added to the S&P 500 in 2001, replacing the beleaguered energy company Enron. In the fourth quarter of 2019, Berkshire initiated positions in two S&P 500 index ETFs -- the SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust(NYSEMKT: SPY) and the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO). The conglomerate hasn't sold shares of either ETF since then.\n\nGranted, Buffett hasn't directly profited very much from Nvidia's gains via Berkshire's stakes in these two S&P 500 index ETFs. For one thing, Berkshire owns only small positions in the funds -- 39,400 shares of the SPDR ETF and 43,000 shares of the Vanguard ETF. These holdings comprise less than 0.1% of Berkshire's total portfolio. For several years, Berkshire's wholly owned subsidiary, New England Asset Management (NEAM), has also owned positions too small to move the needle much in both ETFs.\n\nAdditionally, Nvidia makes up only 7.25% of the S&P 500, which is weighted based on market cap. When Berkshire first bought the two S&P 500 ETFs in late 2019, the AI stock had a much smaller weight than it does now.\n\nHow the \"Oracle of Omaha\" has indirectly profited from Nvidia\n\nBuffett has indirectly profited from Nvidia's remarkable rise, too. Exactly how he's done so requires some deductive analysis.\n\nLet's start with the fact that the stocks of the leading cloud services providers have performed exceptionally well recently. Shares of Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), whose Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the top cloud service platform, skyrocketed 81% last year and more than 20% year to date. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) stock jumped 57% in 2023 and is up almost 20% this year. Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), which operates Google Cloud, has seen its shares soar 58% last year and more than 25% so far in 2024.\n\nThere's no question that the AI boom, especially with the surging adoption of generative AI, has been a key factor in the performance of all three cloud stocks. Importantly, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are major customers of Nvidia. The three companies almost certainly wouldn't have been able to handle the increased demand for cloud services with Nvidia's AI chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nI think it's fair to say, therefore, that Nvidia is partly responsible for the share price gains experienced by Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet. However, how much of those gains can be attributed to Nvidia is hard to determine.\n\nSo, how does this tie in with Buffett? First, Berkshire owns 10 million shares of Amazon. Second, NEAM (Berkshire's subsidiary) owns positions in Alphabet and Microsoft. Third, all three cloud stocks are also key holdings of Berkshire's two S&P 500 index ETFs.\n\nYou might have made money from Nvidia in the same ways\n\nIt's possible (and perhaps even probable) that you're in the same position as Buffett -- profiting from Nvidia without owning the stock. The SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust is the largest ETF based on assets under management, while the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF ranks third. Even if you don't own either ETF, your investment portfolio could include one or more other ETFs or mutual funds with positions in Nvidia.\n\nAmazon, Alphabet, and Microsoft are also widely owned stocks. You could either directly own some or all of them or own funds with stakes in the megacap stocks.\n\nTo be sure, these ways of making money from Nvidia aren't nearly as rewarding as owning shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker. But it could at least provide some consolation for investors who have kicked themselves for not buying Nvidia sooner. It also underscores one of the advantages of investing in S&P 500 index ETFs: Big winners like Nvidia garner increasingly higher weights in the index as their market caps grow -- and can make you more money in the process.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\n\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\n\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\n\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\n\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\n\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\n\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\n\nA customer entering an internet retail store, illustrating the convenience of online shopping.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 293\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is an interesting stock. This is because while its fortunes are because of the highly lucrative and fast growing eCommerce market, the firm has used this growth to establish a commanding position in the enterprise computing market too. This means that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) can balance its eCommerce and enterprise computing businesses, and use AI to the benefit of both. The firm's dominant market share in eCommerce insulates it from new entrants or competitors to provide it with a stable moat. Additionally, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS platform designs its own chips and has integrated AI into customer offerings too, in order to adequately compete with offerings from Microsoft. Keeping an eye high growth industries, the firm's satellite internet subsidiary Kuiper which plans to launch satellites soon can also provide it an entry into an attractive cash flow generating market currently dominated by SpaceX's Starlink.\n\nIthaka Group mentioned Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter. Here is what the firm said:\n\nFounded in 1994, Amazon has evolved from its early roots as an online bookstore to become one of the world’s largest eCommerce retailers. At the end of 2022 Amazon stood poised to capture ~40% of all US e-commerce sales, representing five times more share than the next closest competitor. In addition to eCommerce, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”) has become the market leader in outsourced cloud infrastructure. Further, Amazon Advertising is garnering significant share in digital advertising, particularly product placement ads, thanks to consumers beginning their product searches on Amazon’s site. Amazon’s stock appreciated on the back of stabilization of the company’s cloud computing segment and increased confidence the company would be able to contain expenses and push operating margins above prior peaks in the near-to-medium term.\n\nOverall AMZN ranks 2nd on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Cathie Wood Says Software Is the Next Big AI Opportunity -- 2 Super Stocks You'll Wish You'd Bought Today if She's Right",
        "content": "Ark Investment Management operates eight exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that invest primarily in innovative technology stocks. Last year, Ark CEO Cathie Wood said software companies will be the next big opportunity in artificial intelligence (AI), predicting they could generate $8 in revenue for every $1 spent on chips from suppliers like Nvidia.\n\nArk's ETFs reflect that stance. Tesla stock is the largest holding in the flagship Ark Innovation ETF because Wood has called its self-driving software the biggest AI opportunity in the world. Plus, Wood recently acquired stakes in leading AI software companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Elon Musk's xAI through the Ark Venture Fund.\n\nIf Wood is right about AI software, several stocks could be set for substantial gains in the coming years. Here's why Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Duolingo (NASDAQ: DUOL) might be among them.\n\n1. Amazon: AI software is just the start\n\nAmazon is one of the most versatile AI stocks investors can buy. It's weaving the technology into many of its existing businesses, from e-commerce to streaming, and its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud division is developing everything from AI chips to AI chatbots.\n\nAmazon uses AI to power the recommendation engine on Amazon.com. It learns what products customers like to buy so it can promote more of them to drive sales. Plus, the company developed a suite of AI software tools for sellers, which helps them craft product descriptions and create more engaging ads to increase conversions.\n\nBut Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the beating heart of Amazon's AI ambitions. It designed its own data center chips for training and inferencing AI models, and they have become popular with developers because they can reduce costs up to 50% compared to Amazon's other infrastructure (which is powered by Nvidia's more expensive chips, for example).\n\nThen, there is Amazon Bedrock, where developers can access a suite of ready-made large language models (LLMs) in the cloud from leading start-ups like Anthropic. It also features a family of LLMs designed in-house by Amazon, called Titan. Developers can create AI applications for their businesses far more quickly by using ready-made LLMs compared to building their own, which would require substantial amounts of time, data, and money.\n\nFinally, AWS offers finished AI applications like the new Amazon Q, a comprehensive virtual assistant that can be tailored to suit the needs of almost any organization. It can scan, analyze, and even write computer code to accelerate product development, in addition to answering questions from employees on a wide range of topics.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon could soon surpass a $2 trillion valuation, which is a milestone only four other U.S. technology companies have achieved. Here's the kicker: Wall Street expects Amazon to generate a record $638 billion in revenue during 2024, which is significantly more than each of those four other companies will bring in -- Apple is the closest to the mark with estimated revenue of $386 billion in its current fiscal year.\n\nFrom that perspective, Amazon stock looks cheap at the moment. The company is quickly improving its profitability through cost reductions, efficiency initiatives, and AI, which could be the final key to unlocking a higher stock price over the long term.\n\n2. Duolingo: Supercharging language education with AI\n\nDuolingo isn't an enterprise software company, but its app-based language education platform is set to benefit from a new subscription-based revenue stream thanks to AI. Before we dive into that, let's examine its existing business.\n\nAs of the first quarter, Duolingo served 97.6 million monthly active users, up 35% from the year-ago period. It also had 7.4 million users who were paying a monthly subscription to accelerate their learning, and these paying users boasted an even faster growth rate of 54%. That is awfully impressive when you consider up to 90% of the platform's users are acquired organically (without paid advertising).\n\nSo, where does AI fit into the picture? Duolingo users complete 10 billion exercises every week, which means the company collects more data than any other language education platform in the world. That's valuable when it comes to training AI models, which Duolingo has done since 2013 in an attempt to create a learning experience that rivals human tutors.\n\nThe launch of its Max subscription last year brought it a step closer to that goal. It introduced two new AI-powered features: Explain My Answer, which gives users personalized feedback based on their mistakes in each lesson, and Roleplay, a chatbot users can talk to in the language of their choice to improve their conversational skills. These new AI features run on a combination of Duolingo's own models and OpenAI's latest GPT-4 models.\n\nThe company is also using AI to craft lesson content, which gives employees more time to work on other important initiatives like new features instead.\n\nDuolingo increased its revenue 45% year over year to $167.5 million last quarter. It also turned a profit with net income of $26.9 million, proving to investors it doesn't have to burn truckloads of cash to deliver strong revenue growth.\n\nThe new AI-powered Duolingo Max subscription is still in the early stages of its rollout, but it sells at a higher price point than the company's other paid tiers, which could drive a continuation in its strong financial results going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Most Charming Small Town in America",
        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the most charming small town in America. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 30 Most Charming Small Towns in America.\n\nSmall towns in America play an important role in contributing to tourism and economic well-being. They attract visitors with their charm, history, and local culture, bringing in significant economic benefits. Preserving small towns in America is essential as these towns reflect the core values on which the country was built.\n\nAgriculture has traditionally been a major revenue source for towns in rural America. The sector provides jobs not only on farms but also in related industries such as food processing, transportation, services, and retail. The income from these jobs supports the local economy by circulating within the community.\n\nHowever, small towns across the country face many challenges, including limited job opportunities and rising poverty. According to a report from USDA, small towns recorded a decline of over 1.4 million jobs between 2007 and 2010. The 2009 recession played a major role in this downturn.\n\nAlthough employment gradually increased from 2010 to 2019, it never returned to pre-2007 levels. Unemployment in small towns is often due to a lack of available work, even for those actively seeking jobs.\n\nRural communities are experiencing a shift in their workforce dynamics now. According to American Progress, the service industry now employs the largest segment of the small-town workforce. This marks a change from the past when agriculture, manufacturing, and mining were the primary employment sectors in these areas.\n\nData from the US Census revealed that in 2016, 10.9% of rural Americans worked in retail trade, while 7.3% were employed in the entertainment, arts, accommodation, and food services sectors. These roles are all categorized under the service industry. These figures together account for 18.2% of the workforce, almost one-fifth.\n\nAmazon's Role in Small-Town Economies\n\nSmall towns frequently struggle with residents leaving for larger cities in search of work. Creating even a few jobs in these areas can make a significant difference. Companies such as Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have played an important role in supporting small towns and expanding their economies.\n\nMany of Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment centers are situated in small towns across the US, with a population of fewer than 50,000. These centers have a positive influence on these communities by generating employment opportunities and supporting local businesses. In the last five years, Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) fulfillment centers have averaged employment for over 750,000 individuals, with 40% of these positions in small towns.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe jobs created in these communities open up new opportunities for residents. On average, 47% of individuals hired for logistics positions by Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) did not have jobs earlier. These roles offer an average hourly wage nearly three times the federal minimum wage.\n\nResearch conducted by economists at Amazon and The Wharton School, University of Pennsylvania, indicated that for every 10 positions Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) directly creates, nine additional jobs are generated indirectly at other places in the county where the facility is situated. Furthermore, the establishment of an Amazon facility is estimated to result in an annual increase of $1,225 in median household incomes and an average decrease in poverty rates by up to 3.3% in the county. The Most Charming Small Town in America\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 30 most charming small towns in America, we used a consensus methodology. We referred to multiple credible sources such as Far & Wide, Travel and Leisure,NC Travel Guides, HGTV Quora, and Reddit threads. Our approach focused on gathering insights into each town's scenic beauty, historical significance, and other attractions. Following the shortlisting of the cities, we assigned a score to each city based on the number of times it appeared across our sources. In the case of cities having the same score, tiebreaking was done on the basis of which city was outranking the other in our sources. The most charming small towns in the US have been ranked in ascending order of their scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Most Charming Small Towns in America\n\nTaos, New Mexico\n\nScore: 4\n\nTaos is a small town in northern New Mexico that is celebrated for its rich cultural heritage. The town is surrounded by the majestic Sangre de Cristo Mountains. The town’s notable landmarks include Taos Pueblo. This multistory adobe complex has been inhabited by Native Americans for centuries.\n\nAs of 2022, Taos was home to around 6,460 people, with a median age of 49.3. The town has a median household income of $40,185. Over the year from 2021 to 2022, Taos' population saw a slight decrease from 6,524 to 6,458, reflecting a decline of over 1%. During this period, the median household income in Taos increased from $37,083 to $40,185, marking an 8.37% rise.\n\nDiscover which town secured the second spot.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is widely regarded as the greatest investor of our time. Since he took the reins of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, the nearly $900 billion multinational holding company's stock has achieved a compound annual growth rate of 19.8%. In comparison, the S&P 500 has posted a total annual return of 10.2% over the same period, suggesting he is worthy of the title.\n\nGiven Buffett's outsized success, prudent investors consistently monitor Berkshire's nearly $400 billion investment portfolio to see which stocks the Oracle of Omaha believes can beat the market. With that in mind, here are three stocks reflecting his enduring investment strategies that promise long-term growth for shareholders.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nWhile Berkshire's investment in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was made by one of Buffett's appointed portfolio managers and not by Buffett himself, the company embodies many of his philosophies of a winning stock.\n\nOne key metric Amazon excels in is operating earnings, a calculation of a company's direct profits from its core operations. Buffett prefers this metric when analyzing a company like Amazon because it excludes volatile unrealized capital gains and losses due to its investments.\n\nFor Amazon's most recently reported quarter, the company generated a record $15.3 billion in operating earnings, representing an impressive year-over-year increase of 69%. Beyond its earnings growth, the balance sheet is in tremendous shape, with $27.4 billion in net cash (cash and cash equivalents minus total debt).\n\nDespite the healthy cash position, Amazon doesn't offer dividends or regular share repurchases. As a result, its shares outstanding continue to rise incrementally due to stock-based compensation, with a 5% increase over the past five years. Warren Buffett prefers share repurchases at \"value accretive\" prices over share dilution because investors will lose ownership-stake percentage over time.\n\nInstead of returning capital to shareholders, the company is investing heavily in artificial intelligence (AI), which is already showing up in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) division. Specifically, management projected a $100 billion annual revenue run rate for AWS in 2024, up from $90.8 billion in 2023.\n\nAs for Amazon's valuation, it appears expensive on the surface, trading at 43 times free cash flow. However, the stock is arguably underpriced when you consider that the company has always traded at an expensive valuation, with its 10-year median being 63 times free cash flow.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. American Express\n\nBerkshire initiated its position in American Express (NYSE: AXP) in 1991 and completed its $1.3 billion investment in 1995. The investment has paid off handsomely for Berkshire despite not reinvesting dividends or purchasing additional shares.\n\nIt is now worth $34.7 billion and will likely generate about $409 million in dividends this year alone. Moreover, Berkshire's ownership stake has grown from roughly 10% to 21% through share repurchases.\n\nWith returns like that and Berkshire's lack of further capital investment since 1995, investors are wise to scrutinize the stock's prospects, but American Express isn't slowing down. The banking and payments company reported impressive financial metrics for the first quarter of 2024, including $15.8 billion in total revenue and diluted earnings per share (EPS) of $3.33, representing a year-over-year increase of 11% and 39%, respectively.\n\nFurthermore, management reaffirmed its confident outlook for the remainder of 2024, projecting revenue growth in the range of 9% to 11% and an increase in diluted EPS between 13% and 17%.\n\nAs previously alluded to, management prioritizes returning capital to shareholders through dividends and share repurchases. The company has regularly paid and increased its dividend since 1989, with a current quarterly payout of $0.70 per share, representing an annual yield of 1.2%.\n\nAnd management has repurchased nearly 14% of the shares outstanding during the past five years, with authorization to buy back another estimated 95 million shares out of its current 719 million.\n\nOne area to watch for American Express is its growing provisions for credit losses -- a noncash expense for expected losses that will likely be unrecoverable -- as elevated interest rates continue to weigh on consumers. The metric is on the rise for American Express, hitting $1.3 billion for the first quarter, a year-over-year increase of 18%.\n\nDuring the company's most recent earnings call, Chief Financial Officer Christophe Le Caillec said, \"We expect to see these delinquency and write-off rates remain strong with some continued modest increase in 2024.\"\n\nDespite macroeconomic headwinds, American Express's growth and capital allocation strategy favor long-term shareholders. This explains why Berkshire's ownership stake in American Express has doubled since 1995, and it has recouped its entire investment and then some through dividends.\n\n3. Berkshire Hathaway\n\nOften, the most successful investments are hiding in plain sight. So, for the last stock, consider Buffett's all-time favorite: Berkshire Hathaway.\n\nBerkshire has a diverse portfolio, with majority stakes in more than 60 subsidiaries, including well-known brands like Geico and Dairy Queen. Together, these companies delivered operating earnings of $11.2 billion in the first quarter of 2024, representing a year-over-year increase of 39%.\n\nWith Berkshire's insurance business, the company receives premiums from its customers up front. This cash, known as the float, is available for investment until it is needed to pay out policyholders' claims. Consequently, Berkshire had $189 billion on hand at the end of the first quarter of 2024 for potential acquisitions or stock investments.\n\nIn the near term, Buffett appears content with holding the majority of Berkshire's cash in Treasury bills -- a short-term security backed by the U.S. Treasury Department with a maturity of one year or less -- because of their higher-than-average yields of 5% to 5.4%.\n\nAlthough some investors might be critical of Buffett's strategy of sitting on a pile of cash, it sets the company up to benefit in the event of a financial downturn in the markets.\n\nBuffett wrote on this topic in his most recent annual letter to shareholders: \"During the 2008 panic, Berkshire generated cash from operations and did not rely in any manner on commercial paper, bank lines or debt markets. We did not predict the time of an economic paralysis but we were always prepared for one.\"\n\nHe then summed up his thoughts on his fiscally conservative approach: \"Berkshire is built to last.\"\n\nAre these Buffett stocks worth buying?\n\nGiven Warren Buffett's unparalleled track record, investors are wise to model their investing strategies and portfolios after him. These three very different stocks offer a combination of growth, consistent income, and a hedge against a market downturn, making each of these market-leading companies worthy of any portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Berkshire Hathaway right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Berkshire Hathaway, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Berkshire Hathaway wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "MercadoLibre(NASDAQ: MELI) may not be a household name where you live. But that's probably only because you don't live where it operates. If you were a resident of South America, you most definitely would have heard of it. There's even a good chance you'd be a customer. After all, it's often referred to as the Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) of Latin America specifically because it's got such a ubiquitous, Amazon-like presence there.\n\nJust because you're not a resident of its geographical market, however, doesn't mean you can't tap into growth potential. Indeed, investors outside of South America may want to make a point of plugging into this growth stock if only to add some regional diversification to their portfolio. Of course, it doesn't hurt that MercadoLibre shares are also bringing some Amazon-like potential of their own to the table.\n\nBeing the Amazon of Latin America at the exact right time\n\nThe comparison to Amazon is a fair one, although it's arguably incomplete. MercadoLibre is also a payment middleman and an e-commerce/online auction platform. It's just as accurate to say that the company is akin to both PayPal(NASDAQ: PYPL) and eBay(NASDAQ: EBAY).\n\nWhatever it is, it works. MercadoLibre's first-quarter revenue was up 36% year over year, extending a long streak of similar growth. Last fiscal year's sales of $4.2 billion were more than 40% better than the prior year's top line. Data source: StockAnalysis.com. Chart by author.\n\nWhat gives? How is this company growing so well in such a challenging economic environment?\n\nIn many ways (although not every way), Latin America is where North America was a couple of decades ago.\n\nThe rapid proliferation of internet-enabled smartphones underway right now is one of these ways. Numbers from market research outfit Canalys indicate shipments of smartphones to the region soared 26% to 34.9 million during the first quarter, marking the third consecutive quarter of double-digit growth after a prolonged, pandemic-prompted lull.\n\nAnd yet, there's plenty more room for continued growth of the continent's number of smartphone users. GSMA suggests only 72% of Latin America's residents own a mobile phone, while only 65% of this population uses a mobile internet service. More are on the way, though. GSMA believes the mobile internet's penetration rate in South America will swell to 72% by 2030 when over half of these connections will be super-high-speed 5G connections.\n\nAs was the case in other parts of the world, online shopping is following the advent of widening access to the web. Market research outfit Americas Market Intelligence says Latin America's e-commerce industry is set to grow to 24% this year, and expand another 21% next year and another 21% the year after that.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy MercadoLibre is crushing it\n\nMercadoLibre isn't the only way to tap into this growth. It is, however, arguably the best way.\n\nThe company doesn't operate everywhere in South America, but it's doing business in 18 countries as well as Mexico. Notably, it offers its services in highly populated Latin American countries including Argentina, Colombia, and Brazil. While its market share varies widely from one country to the next, the company boasts more regular users of its services in the region than any of its rivals.\n\nHow has MercadoLibre done so well in such a highly fragmented and highly competitive economic environment? By pulling off the seemingly impossible task of (proverbially) being all things to all people.\n\nYes, it's comparable to eBay. Just keep in mind that eBay isn't solely an auction site. Plenty of sellers are operating online stores using eBay's \"buy it now\" option, as they can with MercadoLibre. The company also facilitates stand-alone shopping carts for sellers looking to manage their own e-commerce website. MercadoLibre even offers logistics services, handling 90% of the parcels ordered through its platforms.\n\nBolstering the reach and penetration of the company's e-commerce arm is its surprisingly robust suite of fintech solutions. See, MercadoLibre isn't just a payment middleman. It facilitates loans, offers its own credit card, and supplies brick-and-mortar merchants with payment-acceptance equipment.\n\nCombine all of these different components into a single, integrated operation. The whole is greater than the sum of the parts. MercadoLibre is a powerful ecosystem that's not only in the right place at the right time but capable of keeping any and all of its competitors in check -- including Amazon.\n\nDon't overthink it with MercadoLibre\n\nAnalysts seem to think it's a winner. Their current consensus price target for MercadoLibre shares stands at $2,027.22, which is nearly 30% above the stock's present price thanks to its recent lull. Of the 22 analysts covering the company, 17 of them rate it a strong buy, and none of these professionals consider the stock anything worse than a hold. The analyst crowd is also calling for an extension of its recent revenue and earnings growth, at least for the next several years, driven by the maturation of South America's mobile tech industry.\n\nWith or without the analyst community's bullishness, however, MercadoLibre's story alone makes MercadoLibre stock a compelling growth prospect.\n\nBottom line: Don't overthink it. If you've got a few thousand bucks you're looking to put to work but aren't finding anything you like well enough (that is to say, anything affordable enough) among the market's usual growth suspects like Nvidia or Amazon, MercadoLibre is a great option most other investors aren't even aware of. Their lack of awareness only bolsters the depth of your opportunity.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,960!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $39,620!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $366,195!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 11, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "content": "Sun Country Airlines will operate 20 Boeing 737-800 freighters (pictured) for Amazon’s private cargo airline by the end of 2025. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nSun Country Airlines’ cargo activity and profits will significantly improve under an amended transportation services agreement to operate freighter aircraft for Amazon’s e-commerce parcel network, an executive with the leisure carrier said Friday.\n\nUnder the revised contract announced Thursday, Amazon will place eight additional Boeing 737-800 converted freighters with Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) to operate on its behalf. The retail giant also extended the contract until 2030. The aircraft, which Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is transferring from Atlas Air’s air operating certificate to Sun Country’s, will be delivered between the first and third quarters next year.\n\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country, which has operated a dozen 737-800 freighters for Amazon for four years, will earn profit margins on par with its passenger business once all the aircraft join the fleet after negotiating improved terms, Chief Financial Officer Dave Davis said on a briefing call with equity analysts. Flight hours for the cargo fleet will increase by 60% to 65% next year because of the additional aircraft and then continue to grow on an annual basis at 13% to 15%, he added.\n\nSun Country generated cargo revenue of $100 million in 2023, up 10% from the prior year.\n\n“Once we are fully ramped towards the late third quarter of 2025, the contribution margin of the Amazon flying will be basically on par with the contribution margin of our passenger flying on a historical basis,” Davis said.\n\nSun Country’s operating margin for passenger operations was 14% in 2023 and negative 5% for cargo. Cargo is expected to align with passenger margins by 2026. Although they may not exactly equalize in financial statements due to the way overhead and block hours are allocated between the segments, the magnitude of the cargo improvement will be about 19% to 20%, Davis explained.\n\nTalks with Amazon about an expanded role for Sun Country began about six months ago and intensified in the past two or three months.\n\nAmazon in May agreed to end its partnership with Atlas Air, which will gradually wind down flying for the e-commerce marketplace over the next 15 months. Atlas Air also operates 16 Boeing 767 freighters for Amazon, which will reallocate at least 10 of them to cargo airline ABX Air between now and December. No reasons were given for the breakup.\n\n“It’s our belief that Amazon has focused on reliable service above all else to serve their customers. So we think we’ve demonstrated that over the years and been rewarded with these additional aircraft. They’re our most important relationship at the company, and we want to continue to provide that level of service as we go forward,” Davis said.\n\nStory continues\n\nSun Country will temporarily cut scheduled passenger capacity by about 11% in 2025, mostly during the slow seasons, to accommodate the transition with pilots and other resources, and then begin adding passenger flights again in 2026 as more planes join the fleet, management said. The reduction in scheduled passenger operations comes as passenger business is softening because of excess capacity across the industry and slower demand from leisure travelers.\n\nDavis foreshadowed an improved deal with Amazon at Bank of America’s annual transportation conference in mid-May, saying high cargo margins at the contract’s start in early 2020 have since come down and that Sun Country needed to take more aircraft and negotiate better terms to achieve acceptable profit. Pilot costs are the primary reason behind the lower margins, he said.\n\nAmazon hasn’t informed Sun Country yet about the new routes it will fly, but the airline hopes the extra freighters will enable it operate a more efficient schedule, which will contribute to the bottom line, the CFO added.\n\nSun Country has virtually no ownership costs associated with growing the fleet because Amazon provides the aircraft, which are leased from an aviation investment company, and is responsible for loading and unloading. Davis acknowledged startup costs, such as pilot training, will be in the low-digit millions of dollars.\n\nOne of the benefits of a hybrid business is that pilots are interchangeable among passenger, cargo and charter flying, but Davis said Sun Country will need to hire more pilots to support the larger fleet.\n\nAmazon pays Sun Country a flat amount per aircraft operated as well as by the number of flight hours.\n\nUnder the original transportation services agreement, Sun Country issued warrants giving Amazon the option to purchase up to 15% of the airline’s stock. No additional stock warrants were issued with the amended agreement, but management said the time for exercising the options could be accelerated because they are based on the amount of total revenue Sun Country receives and revenue will now come in faster than before.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAmazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines\n\nAtlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers\n\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\n\nThe post Revised Amazon deal to boost Sun Country’s cargo profits appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Nvidia's 'gravy train' could come to 'screeching halt' after a volatile trading week",
        "content": "Nvidia's (NVDA) stock went on a wild ride this week as shares reversed direction from all-time highs and Wall Street continued to debate how much more the chip giant can add to its record-setting rally.\n\n\"The stock's steep climb makes it vulnerable to profit taking, but we argue any volatility [is] likely to be short-lived,\" Bank of America wrote on Thursday. The bank reiterated its Buy rating and $150 price target, calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\n\nThe chipmaker, which briefly dethroned Microsoft (MSFT) as the world's most valuable company on Tuesday, saw its market cap edge lower on Friday to sit at around $3.12 trillion, below Microsoft's $3.33 trillion.\n\nPatrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance on Friday that investors should be watchful for signs of a pullback.\n\nWhile he said he doesn't see the status quo of Nvidia's dominance changing over the next six to nine months, investors should focus on \"the downstream profitability that people in the ecosystem are making or not making.\"\n\n\"These are the software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow. Because if those enterprises and those consumers aren't paying more for these new AI features, then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, like we saw in the internet bust,\" he explained.\n\nIncreased competition could also serve as a headwind to pricing power, Moorhead warned, as Nvidia competes with not only \"merchant silicon providers\" like AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) but also \"homegrown ones\" from Amazon's AWS (AMZN), Microsoft's Azure (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL). President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, Sunday, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThe flurry of AI investment has continued to boost optimism over Nvidia's growth rate. In its latest earnings, the company reported adjusted earnings that surged 461% year over year while revenue grew by 262%.\n\nIn addition to stellar earnings, Nvidia also completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10 and doubled its quarterly cash dividend — a move that's been echoed by other tech giants in recent quarters.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up about 200% over the last 12 months and more than 3,200% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained around 160%.\n\nBut despite its sky-high valuation, the case for $4 trillion has been building.\n\n\"I don't see any reason it couldn't get up to $4 trillion,\" Moorhead said. \"A lot of this is based on expectations because you look at the price to earnings ratio, it's pretty astronomical. And if we can see some positive signs from the downstream players...[I] don't see any reason why this couldn't get to $4 trillion.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives agreed, writing in a note to clients on Thursday: \"We believe over the next year the race to $4 trillion market cap in tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft.\"\n\nIves said the AI revolution is a party that is \"just getting started,\" driven by the pace of data center spending by tech giants. He expects incremental AI spend to hit $1 trillion over the next decade with over 70% of enterprises ultimately heading down the AI use case path.\n\n\"Its 9pm in a party going till 4am with the rest of the tech world now joining,\" he said.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) the Best AI Stock to Buy for Long Term?",
        "content": "We recently published a list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nUBS Global Wealth Management’s (GWM) recently published a detailed report discussing different layers of the AI “value chain,” estimating the combined market value opportunity from the layers at $1.2 trillion by 2027.\n\nUBS segments the AI market into three layers –  Enabling Layer, Intelligence Layer and Application Layer. The enabling layer is what actually powers the AI ecosystem — infrastructure, GPUs, data centers, Cloud, servers. UBS further divided this layer into two segments,  Infrastructure and Cloud. The firm expects a combined $516 billion revenue opportunity from the enabling layer by 2027.\n\nNext up is the intelligence layer, which acts as the brain of the entire AI ecosystem. Large language models and backed software systems sit at this layer. UBS estimates that this layer presents a $225 billion opportunity by 2027.\n\nThe third layer in the AI market highlighted by UBS is the application layer. This is where the end user comes in. Cloud, data centers, GPUs, LLMs and algorithms amount to nothing if the end user cannot benefit from their huge processing power. UBS said estimating monetization opportunity of this layer was the hardest since it’s still in its very early stage. The application layer addresses actual AI software used by customers — think AI assistants, GitHub CoPilot, marketing, customer service software, etc. UBS expects a whopping $395 billion in revenue opportunities for the application layer by 2027.\n\nKey AI Predictions\n\nThe UBS report also made key “predictions” about the AI landscape. The firm’s analysts believe the race to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) could give rise to a “capex cycle” that could “inflate” the AI investment bubble. UBS sees the dominance of a few companies in the AI industry will continue to be a reality moving forward, as it expects “monolithic players” and “AI foundries” prevailing in the near future.\n\nBased on this report, let’s take a look at the top companies that will directly benefit from this $1.16 trillion opportunity by 2027. For this article we analyzed UBS analysis and picked 10 stocks that are directly exposed to the three layers in the AI ecosystem highlighted by UBS in its latest report. These companies are positioned extremely well to benefit from the monetization opportunities in the enabling, intelligence and application layers of the AI market. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Best AI Stock With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”?\n\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nInvestment firm UBS in a latest report named Trainium and Inferentia as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strengths in the AI Enabling layer to profit from the $1.16 trillion opportunity. Trainium is a machine learning (ML) chip that AWS purpose-built for deep learning (DL) training of 100B+ parameter models. Inferentia is an AI accelerator for deep learning (DL) and generative AI inference applications.\n\nAmazon Web Services is another major factor that makes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) well positioned in the Enabling layer of the AI value chain. However, UBS believes Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) doesn’t have any offering in the Intelligence layer of the AI value chain. The firm labeled “chatbot recommendations” as Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) strength in the application layer of AI.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Best AI Stocks With More Upside on $1.2 Trillion AI “Value Creation Opportunity”. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Forget Intel: 2 Tech Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) has become a stock to watch in recent months. The company's hyperfocus on artificial intelligence (AI) and chip manufacturing has potentially spelled out a bright future for it.\n\nHowever, with its negative $12 billion in free cash flow -- along with quarterly revenue and operating income that have plunged 35% and 112%, respectively, since 2021 -- it could take many years for Intel to regain a leading position in tech.\n\nWhile Intel remains an excellent buy for those with the time, investors with fewer years until retirement might want to consider alternative companies with more cash in the bank to invest in their future. NVDA Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nThe chart above shows Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are potentially swimming in cash compared to Intel. Both companies have enjoyed major financial growth over the last five years, indicating that they could be better equipped to expand their reach in tech at a faster rate than Intel. As a result, Nvidia and Amazon are potentially more reliable investments in the near term.\n\nSo, forget Intel for now and consider buying these two tech stocks instead.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia's business has exploded over the last decade, with its stock up 27,000%. The company has profited from soaring demand for graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for intensive computing tasks like training AI models, running video games, video editing, cryptocurrency mining, and more.\n\nNvidia's success has seen it become one of the world's most-valuable companies and the first chipmaker to achieve a market capitalization above $3 trillion. The company's chips have allowed it to secure lucrative positions in multiple sectors of tech. It has become best known for its dominant role in AI, beating out rivals like Intel and Advanced Micro Devices in market share.\n\nBut the company has also spent years supplying its chips to cloud platforms, video game consoles like the Nintendo Switch, self-driving cars, and custom-built computers that many consumers use to run high-powered gaming PCs.\n\nAs a result, Nvidia has growth catalysts across tech that will likely keep its business expanding for years. According to Grand View Research, the AI market hit $196 billion last year and is expanding at a rate that would see that figure reach close to $2 trillion by the end of the decade. And that's just one avenue of growth.\n\nNvidia also has an automotive segment, which includes income from selling its chips to the self-driving car market. This industry is forecast to have a compound annual growth rate of 13% through 2030, which would see it triple in value from its 2021 figure.\n\nStory continues\n\nShares have climbed 206% over the last 12 months yet seem nowhere near their ceiling thanks to significant potential across tech. A 10-for-1 stock split earlier this month has made the stock more accessible. Meanwhile, its price/earnings-to-growth ratio is less than one, indicating Nvidia's stock could be trading at a bargain and is worth considering over Intel right now.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon has expanded to multiple areas of tech and can seemingly do no wrong. The company is the biggest name in e-commerce with its online retail site. Recent quarterly earnings show Amazon also has a budding digital ad business through its streaming service Prime Video and is home to a highly profitable cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nThe company is on a growth trajectory that is just too good to pass up. In the first quarter of 2024, the company proved that its retail business (which accounts for 80% of revenue) is still going strong, with sales rising 12% year over year between its North American and international segments.\n\nHowever, the brightest spot in the quarter was AWS, which posted revenue gains of 17% year over year as operating income nearly doubled to over $9 billion (outperforming its entire retail business). Its cloud platform has quickly become the most profitable part of the business and isn't done yet as it invests heavily in an AI expansion.\n\nAmazon shares have exploded over the past year but likely have much more to offer investors as the company continues to develop and use its massive cash reserves. The stock's price-to-sales ratio is currently hovering around 3, making it a better value than many of its rivals and potentially worth buying over Intel.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Wall Street Analysts See Amazon (AMZN) as a Buy: Should You Invest?",
        "content": "When deciding whether to buy, sell, or hold a stock, investors often rely on analyst recommendations. Media reports about rating changes by these brokerage-firm-employed (or sell-side) analysts often influence a stock's price, but are they really important?\n\nLet's take a look at what these Wall Street heavyweights have to say about Amazon (AMZN) before we discuss the reliability of brokerage recommendations and how to use them to your advantage.\n\nAmazon currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.11, on a scale of 1 to 5 (Strong Buy to Strong Sell), calculated based on the actual recommendations (Buy, Hold, Sell, etc.) made by 47 brokerage firms. An ABR of 1.11 approximates between Strong Buy and Buy.\n\nOf the 47 recommendations that derive the current ABR, 43 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy respectively account for 91.5% and 6.4% of all recommendations.\n\nBrokerage Recommendation Trends for AMZN Broker Rating Breakdown Chart for AMZN\n\nCheck price target & stock forecast for Amazon here>>>\r\n\r\nThe ABR suggests buying Amazon, but making an investment decision solely on the basis of this information might not be a good idea. According to several studies, brokerage recommendations have little to no success guiding investors to choose stocks with the most potential for price appreciation.\n\nDo you wonder why? As a result of the vested interest of brokerage firms in a stock they cover, their analysts tend to rate it with a strong positive bias. According to our research, brokerage firms assign five \"Strong Buy\" recommendations for every \"Strong Sell\" recommendation.\n\nIn other words, their interests aren't always aligned with retail investors, rarely indicating where the price of a stock could actually be heading. Therefore, the best use of this information could be validating your own research or an indicator that has proven to be highly successful in predicting a stock's price movement.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool, the Zacks Rank, which classifies stocks into five groups, ranging from Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) to Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), is a reliable indicator of a stock's near -term price performance. So, validating the Zacks Rank with ABR could go a long way in making a profitable investment decision.\n\nZacks Rank Should Not Be Confused With ABR\n\nIn spite of the fact that Zacks Rank and ABR both appear on a scale from 1 to 5, they are two completely different measures.\n\nBroker recommendations are the sole basis for calculating the ABR, which is typically displayed in decimals (such as 1.28). The Zacks Rank, on the other hand, is a quantitative model designed to harness the power of earnings estimate revisions. It is displayed in whole numbers -- 1 to 5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts employed by brokerage firms have been and continue to be overly optimistic with their recommendations. Since the ratings issued by these analysts are more favorable than their research would support because of the vested interest of their employers, they mislead investors far more often than they guide.\n\nIn contrast, the Zacks Rank is driven by earnings estimate revisions. And near-term stock price movements are strongly correlated with trends in earnings estimate revisions, according to empirical research.\n\nFurthermore, the different grades of the Zacks Rank are applied proportionately across all stocks for which brokerage analysts provide earnings estimates for the current year. In other words, at all times, this tool maintains a balance among the five ranks it assigns.\n\nAnother key difference between the ABR and Zacks Rank is freshness. The ABR is not necessarily up-to-date when you look at it. But, since brokerage analysts keep revising their earnings estimates to account for a company's changing business trends, and their actions get reflected in the Zacks Rank quickly enough, it is always timely in indicating future price movements.\n\nIs AMZN Worth Investing In?\n\nIn terms of earnings estimate revisions for Amazon, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has remained unchanged over the past month at $4.58.\n\nAnalysts' steady views regarding the company's earnings prospects, as indicated by an unchanged consensus estimate, could be a legitimate reason for the stock to perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nThe size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) stocks here >>>>\n\nIt may therefore be prudent to be a little cautious with the Buy-equivalent ABR for Amazon.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Penny Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Penny stocks to buy now are notorious for their high risk, often characterized by low trading volumes, minimal pricing and precarious fundamental and financial standings. These factors combine to make their price movements more volatile than those of larger-cap cousins. However, for the discerning investor, penny stocks can offer a path to massive returns on a comparatively slim initial investment.\n\nIf you’re building out a penny stock portfolio, remember to consider a company’s operational prospects and enduring viability carefully. Though many penny stocks to buy now have inherently speculative value propositions, it’s important to steer clear of potential “pump and dump” traps by thoroughly evaluating the practicality and market demand for a company’s products and its capacity for sustained growth.\n\nWhile certainly speculative, these three penny stocks to buy now have operational prospects that outweigh their shakier standing and lessened liquidity. Better yet, they’re priced to buy, and offer an opportunity to 10x your investment if the stars align in their favor.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDesktop Metal (DM) 3d printer printing chips, 3D printing stocks\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Alex_Traksel\n\nA reverse split is rarely a bullish indicator, but in the case of 3D printing stock Desktop Metal (NYSE:DM), it may be the opening move for an imminent resurgence. The company executed a 1-for-10 reverse split at the beginning of June, and since then, prospects have improved considerably, as per-share pricing popped 32% this week alone. However, a range of bullish news items may be the wind that fully lifts Desktop Metal from its long-term slump.\n\nMost notably, Desktop Metal recently added platinum 3D printing to its jewelry production offerings in conjunction with metals science production firm Legor Alloys. Platinum printing, in particular, was a tough nut to crack because of the metal’s “high hardness and melting point,” but the new tech developments promise to allow “all-new, once-impossible designs.” Desktop Metal will show off the new opportunities later this month at a 3D printing industry event, so keep a close eye on the stock in the meantime.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) A photograph of the ocean.\n\nSource: Manu Galdamez/ShutterStock.com\n\nIn late April, I looked at The Metals Company’s (NASDAQ:TMC) potential among penny stocks to buy now, highlighting the addition of Steve Jurvetson, known for his involvement with SpaceX and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), to their board. I also looked at the company’s high burn rate as a potential hurdle since deep-sea metals mining requires huge upfront capital with long exploratory and development timelines before generating revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, recent developments suggest a potential turnaround. In late May, The Metals Company announced a breakthrough in their operations — the first successful extraction of battery-grade nickel from deep-sea sources. Independent third-party evaluations confirmed that the nickel extracted from the Pacific Ocean could be processed into nickel sulfate, a top battery manufacturing component.\n\nCompany forecasts indicate that their undersea resources could potentially fulfill the material needs of up to 280 million electric vehicles, equivalent to the current number of vehicles on U.S. roads. Analysts predict a break-even point by next year or 2026. That positions The Metals Company as a compelling near-term investment among penny stocks to buy now and negates much of the concern around the cash flow I previously highlighted.\n\niRobot (IRBT) IRBT short-squeeze stocks\n\nAlthough iRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) doesn’t strictly fall into penny stock classification with its per-share pricing around $9, its modest $270 million market cap positions it alongside smaller companies like Desktop Metal and The Metals Company. And, like the other two penny stocks to buy now, iRobot has plenty of latent upside potential that may send the stock surging. Already, iRobot is emerging as a potential standout comeback story this year, poised to generate strong momentum in the robotics sector irrespective of broader market trends.\n\nInterest in iRobot spiked early in the year amid Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) attempted (and failed) acquisition, largely motivated by iRobot’s extensive patent portfolio and innovative technology despite a slowdown in robotic vacuum sales. This justification underscores the ongoing renaissance in robotics, spotlighting iRobot as a primary player in developing advanced robotics and sensing tech, even if the end product (vacuums) aren’t top sellers. Instead, iRobot’s strength lies in its patent portfolio, as evidenced by its $174 million intangible assets balance.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of the Magnificent 7 stocks long-term growth investors should continue to hold. That’s been my view for a long time, and it’s still true.\n\nHowever, after the company got dethroned by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and as I’m writing this, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as well, the question is whether this dominance will continue?\n\nNow, it’s entirely possible all three could continue to race higher from here. In other words, whether you buy Microsoft, Apple or Nvidia, you could still win, even if one doesn’t keep pace with the rest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut with that said, let’s dive into what may lead Microsoft to outperform relative to these peers moving forward.\n\nTesting Sharing Files to Android\n\nMicrosoft recently enhanced integration between Windows PCs and smartphones, enabling users to handle texts, calls, and notifications on their computers. The Phone Link app syncs Android and iPhones with Windows, facilitating file sharing. In the latest Windows Insider Preview, Microsoft introduced a streamlined feature for quick content sharing from PC to Android. Now, users can select a file and share it directly to a paired Android phone via a quick share window.\n\nMicrosoft stated that users need to pair their smartphone with their Windows PC using the Link to Windows app on Android and Phone Link on their PC for the feature to work. Currently, only paired Android phones appear in the share window, with no information on iPhone compatibility. Right-clicking a file on Windows and selecting Share now shows options to email or use Nearby Share.\n\nThis feature, part of the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22635.3785, is rolling out in the Beta Channel and may take time to reach all users.\n\nMicrosoft Will Still Be an AI Winner\n\nMost of the focus on the AI race is on Nvidia now, and for good reason. On this catalyst alone, it’s entirely possible Nvidia could break away from the pack. But I don’t think that means Microsoft will be a laggard, by any means.\n\nWedbush analysts predicted the AI boom for tech stocks is just starting, driving customer spending on Microsoft’s AI products. Analysts at Wedbush raised their price target on MSFT stock to $550, citing strong potential for monetizing its AI-powered Copilot tool and Azure cloud service based on recent customer checks.\n\nWedbush analysts observed accelerating deal conversions for enterprise AI deployments and maintained an outperform rating for Microsoft shares. They highlighted AI’s potential to transform Microsoft’s cloud growth, with over 70% of customers expected to adopt automated options. Rapid growth in AI usage is anticipated by 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts noted the stock has not yet fully priced in the upcoming AI and cloud growth wave. Microsoft shares, boosted by OpenAI investments, have risen over 19% this year, reaching a $3.29 trillion market cap. Wedbush also mentioned Microsoft’s race with Nvidia and Apple to achieve a $4 trillion valuation.\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) limited-time collaboration on the Copilot+ PC has entered the pre-order phase, marking a significant step in AI-powered PCs. This initiative is the first major result of their partnership.\n\nAt COMPUTEX 2024, Qualcomm representatives expressed optimism about the strong pre-order levels, which have exceeded Microsoft’s expectations. The momentum now depends on early adopter feedback. Qualcomm and other IC suppliers hope this trend continues through the year’s second half, establishing a solid foundation for AI PCs’ future.\n\nInitially met with skepticism, Microsoft’s exclusive use of the Snapdragon X series for Copilot+ PC challenged the x86 norm in Windows PCs. Qualcomm’s past PC market struggles added to doubts. Despite this, Microsoft’s aggressive strategy and partnerships with major notebook manufacturers helped overcome initial concerns, leading to higher-than-expected pre-orders.\n\nThe success of Copilot+ PC in the long run hinges on these early sales. The initial high pricing suggests realistic pre-order targets, making surpassing them a manageable feat.\n\nYes, MSFT is a Buy\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud division gains ground, challenging Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services amid widespread business digitization. Investments in AI (and OpenAI specifically) position the company for robust long-term growth. Recent quarterly results showcased diversified growth, with cloud revenue up 23% to $35.1 billion and operating income rising 23% to $27.6 billion.\n\nWith the cloud market accelerating, MSFT stock stands out as a top tech investment to load up on right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Amazon has dubbed the new voice assistant \"Remarkable Alexa,\" the people said.\n\nThe sources include eight current and former employees who worked on Alexa and who spoke on the condition of anonymity because they were not authorized to discuss confidential projects.\n\nAmazon has pushed workers towards a deadline of August to prepare the newest version of Alexa, three of the people said, noting that CEO Andy Jassy has taken a personal interest in seeing Alexa reinvigorated. In an April letter to shareholders, Jassy promised a “more intelligent and capable Alexa,” without providing additional details.\n\nThe company's plans for Alexa including pricing and release dates could be altered or canceled depending on the progress of Project Banyan, the people cautioned.\n\n\"We have already integrated generative AI into different components of Alexa, and are working hard on implementation at scale—in the over half a billion ambient, Alexa-enabled devices already in homes around the world—to enable even more proactive, personal, and trusted assistance for our customers,\" said an Amazon spokeswoman in a statement.\n\nThe service -- which provides spoken answers to user queries, like the local weather, and can serve as a hub to control home appliances – was a pet project of Amazon founder Jeff Bezos who envisioned a technology that could emulate the fictional voice computer portrayed on television’s Star Trek series.\n\nFor Amazon, keeping up with rivals in generative AI is critical as Google, Microsoft and OpenAI have garnered more favorable attention for their so-called chatbots that can respond almost instantaneously with full sentences to complicated prompts or queries.\n\nThe release of ChatGPT in late 2022 set off a frenzy of investing in AI firms and has pushed chipmaker Nvidia past Amazon and others by market capitalization, briefly becoming the world’s second-most valuable company.\n\nApple too is pushing ahead with its own AI strategy, including updating its Siri voice activated software embedded in iPhones to include more conversational answers.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome of the Amazon employees who have worked on the project say Banyan represents a “desperate attempt” to revitalize the service, which has never turned a profit, and was caught flatfooted amid the rise of competitive generative AI products over the past 18 months. Those people said they have been told by senior management that this year is a critical one for the service to finally demonstrate it can generate meaningful sales for Amazon.\n\nAccessed primarily through Amazon TVs and Echo speaker devices, Alexa is popular mostly for setting timers, quickly accessing the weather, playing songs or answering simple questions. Amazon’s hopes for goosing sales in its e-commerce operation through the service have fallen flat, mostly because users like to first see the products they are buying for easy comparison.\n\nThe Seattle retailer cut thousands of jobs in the unit in late 2023, part of a major restructuring after a pandemic-fueled e-commerce surge lost steam.\n\n'MUST WIN'\n\nWith an embedded AI, Amazon expects Alexa customers will ask it for shopping advice like which gloves and hat to purchase for a mountain climbing trip, the people said, similar to a text-based service on its website known as Rufus that Amazon rolled out earlier this year.\n\nSome said they’ve been told by senior management that 2024 represents a “must win” year for Alexa, which along with the Prime membership and Kindle and Fire devices are the brands most closely associated with Amazon.\n\nBut an AI-powered version of the service demonstrated in September has yet to be released to the broader public while competitors have pushed out multiple updates to their chatbots. In the demonstration, Alexa lost its robotic tone and answered questions like the start time for a football game. \"You can now have a near-human-like conversations with Alexa,\" promised Dave Limp, Amazon's hardware chief at the time, who has since left the company.\n\nAmazon is working to replace what it refers to internally as “Classic Alexa,” the current free version, with an AI-powered one and yet another tier that uses more powerful AI software for more complicated queries and prompts that people would have to pay at least $5 per month to access, some of the people said. Amazon has also considered a roughly $10-per-month price, they said.\n\nThere is no tie-in with Amazon's $139-per-year Prime membership being considered, the people said.\n\nAs envisioned, the paid version could perform more intricate tasks such as composing a brief email, sending it and ordering dinner for delivery from Uber Eats, all from a single prompt, some of the people said. It could also eliminate the need to repeatedly say \"Alexa\" during a conversation with the software and offer more personalization, they said.\n\nBut the people said they struggled to see why customers would be willing to pay for a service, even a revamped one, that is offered for free today.\n\nAmazon has also been plagued by false starts in developing the AI and other challenges such as hallucinations – when software produces false or misleading information – and poor employee morale in the division.\n\nSome of Amazon’s plans for the service were previously reported by Business Insider, including its struggles with the performance of the underlying AI and its hopes for a paid service, however Reuters is first to report the tiered pricing, internal deadline and potential monthly fee.\n\nAmazon is also aiming to supercharge the home automation offered through Alexa, the people said. Alexa now can wirelessly connect to so-called smart devices so that they can be controlled by voice, allowing a user to, for example, turn the porch lights on every day at 8 pm.\n\nBut Remarkable Alexa could learn from users so that it powers on the television for a favorite weekly program or turns on a user's coffee pot after a morning alarm goes off, which is possible today through prompts that Amazon calls Routines.\n\nSome of the people noted that for such a service to work properly it will require customers to buy additional Alexa-enabled devices.\n\nThe company had been working on devices last year to get the service into more rooms of the house, such as Alexa-enabled home energy consumption trackers and a carbon monoxide detector, people familiar with the matter previously told Reuters.\n\n(Reporting by Greg Bensinger; editing by Kenneth Li and Nick Zieminski)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe broadening of the stock market rally hasn’t yet arrived as investors keep piling into (just about) anything AI touches.\n\nElon Musk revealed earlier this week that Super Micro (SMCI) will provide hardware for the supercomputer his AI startup is building. That triggered a pop in the stock.\n\nWhen Dell's (DELL) CEO said his company would be building an \"AI factory\" for Musk's xAI in partnership with AI kingpin Nvidia (NVDA), its shares also rose.\n\nAnd though the jumps in both names were short-lived, their performance this year and the response to Musk's one-word post are reminders that what he says matters to a lot of people and that anything related to AI will push markets around.\n\nSo far this year, SMCI is up over 200%. Dell, which to some harkens back to a PC 1.0 world, has seen its stock nearly double.\n\nIt doesn't take a contrived plan or a sideways approach to profit from Wall Street's excitement around AI technology. The main driver of 2024's seemingly unstoppable run is the earnings potential of the Magnificent Seven, which includes Nvidia, Tesla, and the platform giants.\n\nCiti analysts, who earlier this week upped their S&P 500 year-end target to 5,600, observed that more than two-thirds of the stock market’s gains so far have flowed from the Magnificent Seven.\n\nAnd adding Elon to the mix certainly doesn't hurt.\n\nThe Super Micro news has a clear Musk dimension, and part of the multi-CEO’s dynamism is that his businesses cross into different industries and are themselves interconnected. But since Tesla is the only public Musk company, most investors can only get in on his other ventures indirectly. If you can’t buy into xAI, why not acquire a piece of its suppliers? Elon Musk attends 'Exploring the New Frontiers of Innovation: Mark Read in Conversation with Elon Musk' session during the Cannes Lions International Festival Of Creativity 2024 - Day Three on June 19, 2024, in Cannes, France. (Marc Piasecki/Getty Images) (Marc Piasecki via Getty Images)\n\nA similar dynamic is at play within the world of AI.\n\nThe AI rally extends beyond hardware manufacturers too. Investors attempting to create a makeshift Musk basket of related tech holdings are doing the same thing with Nvidia. Because it's not just the Big Tech platforms churning out apps and productivity software that are drafting off AI exuberance. There's an entire ecosystem out there.\n\nPowering the computer systems that train and run AI systems requires huge amounts of energy. Utility companies are catching a ride on the AI wave.\n\nAmazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META) are expected to spend a combined $200 billion this year on cloud and AI investments, which will include building and running data centers. In turn, power demand from US data centers is expected to more than double by 2030, in part because of AI, according to estimates from consulting firm McKinsey.\n\nStory continues\n\nGetting in early is nice. But the AI frenzy is proving that getting in at all is more than enough. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "Five men were convicted for running Jetflicks, a low-cost streaming service that amassed more TV shows than Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon Prime combined",
        "content": "If a streaming service sounds too good to be true, it probably is. In the case of Jetflicks, it was too good to be legal.\n\nA federal jury in Las Vegas convicted five male defendants for their roles in a complex scheme of scraping popular television shows and award-winning movies from pirate sites and bundling them into a streaming service called Jetflicks, said the Department of Justice in a statement on Thursday.According to the indictment, Jetflicks operated as a subscription-based streamer that allowed users to watch and download copyrighted TV shows and movies without permission from the copyright owners.\n\n“The defendants operated Jetflicks, an illicit streaming service they used to distribute hundreds of thousands of stolen television episodes,” said principal deputy assistant attorney general Nicole M. Argentieri, head of the Justice Department’s Criminal Division, in a statement. According to the DOJ, the group ripped off thousands of copyrighted television episodes generating a mass of content larger than \"the combined catalogues of Netflix, Hulu, Vudu, and Amazon Prime.\"\n\nFor a $10 monthly subscription fee, users could watch shows on multiple devices and platforms within days of new episodes appearing on legitimate services and channels, authorities said.\n\n“The defendants ran a platform that automated the theft of TV shows and distributed the stolen content to subscribers,” said assistant director in charge David Sundberg of the FBI Washington Field Office, in a statement.\n\nThe five are Kristopher Dallmann, Douglas Courson, Felipe Garcia, Jared Jaurequi, and Peter Huber. The indictment states that the cadre obtained content from pirate sites such as SickRage, (also known as SickChill), Sick Beard, SABnzbd, and TheTVDB and offered it up in one place to subscribers. At one point, Jetflicks claimed to have more than 37,000 paid users and 183,200 episodes of television. Authorities estimated the monetary harm to program owners to be in the millions.\n\nLike a legitimate business, Jetflicks eventually ran into problems, such as subscribers sharing logins and passwords, authorities alleged in the indictment. Officials also said the group tried to disguise the site as an entertainment service for aircraft flyers after it faced inbound demands to remove unlicensed content.\n\n“When complaints from copyright holders and problems with payment service providers threatened to topple the illicit multimillion-dollar enterprise, the defendants tried to disguise Jetflicks as an aviation entertainment company,” noted Sundberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd much like in the legitimate business world, about seven years after Jetflicks started, one member of the group broke away to launch a new, competing endeavor, officials said.\n\nDarryl Julius Polo, aka djppimp, launched iStreamItAll, which allowed users to stream and download TV and movies, the indictment states. iStreamItAll (ISIA) subscription plans had a monthly fee of $19.99, plus quarterly, semi-annual, and yearly options. Similar to Jetflicks, ISIA did not have permission to provide content, officials said. Polo, a computer programmer, pleaded guilty in 2019 to one count of conspiracy to commit criminal copyright infringement and one count of criminal copyright infringement. Polo was sentenced to 4.75 years in prison and ordered to pay $1 million.\n\nJetflicks also had its own org structure, authorities alleged. Dallman ran operations while Courson and Jaurequi assisted with management involving strategic decisions, hiring, and dealing with vendors and payment processors. Programming and coding was handled by Dallman, Polo, and Huber, who wrote and revised computer scripts for the website and mobile applications. That group also handled web design, customer interface, and technical assistance, authorities said.\n\nIn 2016, an undercover agent streamed an episode of the science fiction show The OA, which aired on Netflix, according to the indictment. The agent also downloaded two episodes of a dystopian series, 12 Monkeys, which caused the distribution of the episodes without permission from the copyright owner, authorities wrote.\n\nCourson, Garcia, Jaurequi, and Huber each face a maximum penalty of five years in prison, and Dallmann faces a maximum penalty of 48 years in prison, according to the DOJ. A sentencing date has not been set.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\n.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Consumer Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "Strong buy consumer stocks are a resilient option in the current economy. For the first four months of 2024, core retail sales, excluding cars, gas and restaurants, rose 3.8%. The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to rise 2.5% to 3.5% this year.\n\nIn addition, Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC) is up about 7% this year, while the S&P 500 index is up over 15%, meaning the consumer sector has not yet caught up to the growth that the “Magnificent Seven,” led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are enjoying in 2024, leaving you plenty of upside to exploit.\n\nHowever, McKinsey worries inflation is making consumers more cautious, forcing them to prioritize essential items over luxury ones. Over the past eight years, the cost of acquiring a new customer has also gone up 222%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation is still strong. The Consumer Price Index increased by 3.3% in the last year, with economists expecting it to stay at 3.4%. Even though it’s cooling after a high of 9.1% in 2022, it’s hot enough for the Federal Reserve to cancel its plans for three rate hikes. Instead, they have settled on one.\n\nWhat this means is that even though consumer stocks are in a good position to grow, it’s probably best to keep investing in strong buy ones just to play it safe.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the most highly rated of all strong buy consumer stocks, with 42 out of 42 analysts covering the stock recommending a “Buy.” AMZN’s price target of $221.48 reflects a potential upside of over 21%.\n\nAmazon Web Services, which dominates the worldwide cloud infrastructure industry with a 31% market share, drives AMZN’s enthusiasm. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google Cloud are its closest rivals at 25% and 11%, respectively. AWS earned $22.1 billion in Q1 2024 and $90 billion in 2023.\n\nTo expand, the division will spend extensively on building new infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and Mexico. Plus, AWS’s $10 billion Mississippi data center construction will create at least 1,000 jobs.\n\nAWS’s creative artificial intelligence (AI) service Amazon Bedrock, is also integrating new Anthropic Claude 3 models. Many companies utilize Bedrock to develop AI in science and healthcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s strategic partnership with Anthropic enhances its AI goals. As a result of the $4 billion deal, complex AI models are built and used utilizing AWS Tranium and Inferentia processors.\n\nFinally, for five consecutive quarters, AMZN has reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Most recently in the first quarter of 2024, it amassed a $73.9 billion cash war chest. there is no shortage of resources for AMZN to power forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another favorite among strong-buy consumer stocks, with 20 buy ratings and an average price target of around $316, indicating 15% upside potential.\n\nMuch of Visa’s appeal as a payments processor comes from constant innovation, especially with new fintech startups trying to chip away at its more than 60% market share.\n\nAmong product innovations, the introduction of Visa Flexible Credential stands out. It is a new card that lets users select between debit, credit, “pay-in-four” with Buy Now Pay Later and rewards points. It’s currently accessible in Asia and Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) will help release it in the U.S. this summer.\n\nVisa is also introducing tap-to-pay functionality, so any device can be a cash register. Plus, it is automating and easing payments from one account to another. After being a hit in Europe, this service is now growing in the U.S. thanks to Visa’s purchase of Tink.\n\nAt the same time, Visa is investigating blockchain-based solutions to expand small- and medium-sized businesses’ global financial market access. Project partners include Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia.\n\nVisa also runs the Universal Payment Channel, a blockchain center. This project links blockchain networks to move digital assets across wallets and protocols. The UPC simplifies stablecoin, central bank digital coins and other crypto transactions.\n\nApplovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nApplovin (NASDAQ:APP) keeps growing its ecosystem, which is why it is fast becoming one of the best AI ad platforms. In Q1 2024, its income rose 91% year over year.\n\nAppLovin’s first quarter of 2024 financial results were strong, with EPS of 67 cents and sales of $1.06 billion, both higher than analyst expectations. However, the real excitement is with its product enhancements.\n\nThe most recent updates add support for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy files and new apps for game engines like Godot and Unreal, making it easier for developers to switch between engines. Applovin’s MAX Flutter driver also support native ads, making ad displays more consistent in apps built with it.\n\nCustom product pages and store listings let users create app store pages that are more relevant to their users and encourage them to buy. The platform also has new tools and A/B testing features that provide more detailed information and better chances to improve things.\n\nWhat’s more, APP keeps growing its partner ecosystem, which includesAdjust, SparkLabsandWurl. Each of them adds to AppLovin’s full set of solutions for improving strategies for making money from apps and getting new users.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "Wall Street is soaring to new heights in 2024, buoyed by a robust U.S. economy as well as investor interest in advancements in artificial intelligence. As a result, the S&P 500 index gained over 15%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite index has advanced over 18% year-to-date. This impressive rally has sparked investor interest in tech stocks to buy in July despite concerns about a potential market peak.\n\nAnticipated earnings growth and potential Federal Reserve rate cuts are further buoying optimism. In other words, despite the recent gains, there are still potential opportunities to establish strategic positions within the tech sectors. Getting in early allows investors to capitalize on the full growth potential of innovative firms and maximize returns as these stocks appreciate.\n\nAmdocs (DOX) software stocks: Coding software developer work with augmented reality dashboard computer icons of scrum agile development and code fork and versioning with responsive cybersecurity\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nA top tech stock to buy on our list is Amdocs (NASDAQ:DOX).

The company also aims for a double-digit EPS increase.\n\nRecently, Amdocs partnered withAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google Cloud to streamline eSIM activation, enhancing remote device management and customer satisfaction. Collaborations with industry leaders like Virgin Media O2, Japan’s JCOM, and Paramount Global (NASDAQ:PARA) for the MTV operations in Japan further strengthen the company’s market position.\n\nDespite a 13% decline in 2024, DOX stock remains a strong dividend-growth stock with a 2.5% yield. Currently, the shares trade at 10.6 times forward earnings and 1.8 times sales, indicating a potentially attractive valuation for long-term investors.

        "title": "The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gift for Employees",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 20 Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees, and in this article we will look at the best budget-friendly corporate gift for employees.\n\nImportance of Corporate Gifts\n\nAccording to a report by GlobalNewsWire, 68% of individuals state that receiving a memorable gift from their employer has enhanced their relationship with them. This underscores the capacity of gifts to foster positive connections, whether in personal or professional contexts. Data from a survey by Mrs Prindables indicates that 57% of surveyed employees are more likely to remain loyal to a company that provides gifts. In comparison, 62% do not anticipate receiving gifts from their employer this holiday season. This suggests an opportunity for employers to surprise their workers with tokens of appreciation, potentially fostering increased employee loyalty.\n\nThe WorldMetrics Report 2024 indicates that the global corporate gifting market is expected to grow to $242.9 billion. This means that companies worldwide are spending more on gifts for clients, employees, and partners. It shows how important giving gifts is for building good relationships and promoting brands. To make your employees feel valued and respected, your choice of gift is very important.\n\nGifts express gratitude and are more effective than mere objects. Marcel Mauss, a noted anthropologist, explored gift-giving in his 1925 study, “The Gift.” He revealed its complexity, highlighting its role in shaping relationships within workplaces and with clients. Mauss emphasized the multifaceted nature of gift-giving, involving legal, economic, spiritual, and moral obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate.\n\nGift-giving in the workplace often benefits the giver more than the receiver, yielding both tangible and intangible rewards. Many businesses, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), recognize the importance of fostering a positive company culture through corporate gifting. By offering enticing gifts, benefits and perks, companies create an environment that promotes employee satisfaction, productivity, and creativity. Research, such as a Gallup poll, shows that employees who are actively engaged in their work tend to perform much better than their less engaged colleagues. This heightened level of engagement can lead to a significant increase in earnings per share, sometimes as much as 147%.\n\nTop Corporate Gifting Ideas for 2024\n\nIn 2024, corporate gifting trends are driven by technological innovation, personalization, and a strong focus on sustainability and well-being. Businesses increasingly opt for eco-friendly gifts to show their commitment to environmental responsibility, choosing items like reusable drinkware, eco-friendly office supplies, and products made from recycled materials with minimal packaging. Tech gadgets remain popular, with wireless chargers, Bluetooth headphones, and smart home devices being highly appreciated for their practicality and ability to enhance daily life. Personalization is key, with companies using advanced techniques to create unique, custom gifts that leave a lasting impression.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperience-based gifts are gaining traction, moving beyond traditional tangible items to offer memorable experiences like spa days, cooking classes, or event tickets. These gifts significantly boost employee morale and client loyalty while aligning with the company’s brand values and mission. Health and wellness gifts, such as fitness trackers, yoga mats, and customized health snack boxes, reflect a growing focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle. These options show the company’s commitment to the well-being of its employees and clients, fitting into broader corporate wellness trends.\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong appreciation for cultural and artisan gifts that support local businesses and artisans. Handcrafted items that reflect cultural significance or artisanal dedication are highly valued, offering a story that recipients can cherish. These gifts not only support local communities but also allow companies to showcase their local pride or global outreach, making them perfect for businesses looking to make a meaningful impact through their gifting choices.\n\nWith the dominance of e-commerce giants like Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), finding affordable options has become easier than ever. Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has exhibited steady revenue growth over recent quarters, with current quarter (June 2024) revenue estimated at $136.8 billion, marking a 1.8% increase from the same quarter last year ($134.38 billion). This growth continues into the next quarter (September 2024), where revenue is projected to be $145.7 billion, reflecting a 3% rise from the previous year’s $141.41 billion. Annually, Amazon’s revenue for 2024 is expected to reach $588.05 billion, a 2.3% increase from 2023’s $574.78 billion, with a potential jump to $653 billion in 2025, indicating an 11% growth. This growth is primarily driven by the company’s expanding market share in e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), and various other services. However, the short-term growth rate shows a slight slowdown, likely due to market saturation and broader economic conditions.\n\nIn terms of earnings, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has consistently surpassed expectations, showcasing strong performance. For the quarter ending June 2023, the estimated EPS was $0.35, while the actual EPS was $0.65, an 85.7% surprise. This trend continued in September 2023, with an estimated EPS of $0.53 and an actual EPS of $0.86, a surprise of 62.3%. December 2023 also saw a positive earnings surprise, with actual EPS of $1.00 compared to the estimated $0.80, a 25% difference. For March 2024, the actual EPS was $0.90 against an estimated $0.77, a 16.9% surprise. Looking forward, the estimated EPS for the current quarter (June 2024) is $0.94, and for the next quarter (September 2024), it is $1.06. The full-year EPS for 2024 is projected at $4.18, with an expected rise to $5.31 in 2025.\n\nValuation measures for Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reflect its premium valuation status. The trailing P/E ratio has decreased from 310.38 in Q1 2023 to 49.96, indicating improved earnings. The forward P/E ratio stands at 38.31, showing continued expectations of earnings growth. We should note that these estimates don’t tell much about whether Amazon is a cheap or expensive stock because Amazon has been shoveling its profits back into its business to subsidize either its growth or new initiatives. It isn’t a company that’s trying to maximize its short-term earnings. That’s why we believe Amazon shares will continue to perform better than the market. And we aren’t alone. AMZN is the #1 stock on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nWith this backdrop, let’s explore our list of affordable corporate gifts for employees. The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify affordable corporate gifts for employees, we implemented a consensus-based approach to collect information from various sources: including Social Imprints, Snappy, Meetings & Incentives, Babble for Business, Gemnote, and Hoppier. From these blogs we identified popular affordable gift items in 2024, and developed a systematic scoring system. Each gift item we found through our sources was listed, along with the number of times it appeared in sources. In order to refine our search, we checked and averaged out the prices of these gift items from Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), as these platforms are typically deemed affordable.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWith this backdrop, let’s proceed to #1 budget-friendly corporate gifts for employees.\n\n1. T-Shirts\n\nAverage Price: $6.48\n\nAffordable and practical, corporate t-shirts are a great investment. The saying “less is more” is perfect for T-shirts; all you need is a solid color, and little to no design. Gifting an ‘Employee of the Month’ t-shirt sounds like pure motivation. This gift option creates a sense of unity and belonging among employees, fostering team spirit and camaraderie.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Amazon but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about The Cheapest AI Stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: none.

        "title": "Amazon is already disrupting the streaming advertising market — here's how",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) entered the ad-supported streaming space in January by defaulting all of its Prime Video subscriptions to ads. Just six months later, the tech giant's impact is already being felt.\n\nPrime Video subscriptions now automatically default to the ad-supported tier at current monthly rates of $14.99 for Prime delivery members and $8.99 for non-Prime members—or those who only subscribe to the standalone video service. Subscribers who want the ad-free version will now see their monthly bill go up by $3 a month.\n\nAmazon's entrance builds on the presence of Netflix (NFLX) and Disney (DIS), which introduced their respective ad tiers in late 2022. That means an automatic expansion of ad-supported options for consumers — along with prospective ad buyers.\n\n\"There's no question it has created an excess of supply in the marketplace,\" Rita Ferro, Disney's president of global advertising, told Yahoo Finance earlier this week at Cannes Lions, an annual event for the global advertising and communications industry.\n\nBottom line: companies like Disney must work that much harder to lure advertisers to their platforms.\n\nMoffettNathanson estimated Prime Video could add over 50 billion impressions to the connected TV (CTV) market this year, \"an amount that is likely to dwarf a lot of the smaller players in the space\" as increased inventory simultaneously drives down the price for ads.\n\n\"Amazon knows how to gain market share and they know how to use price to gain market share,\" said Mark Douglas, CEO at MNTN, an ad tech company that specializes in the CTV space. \"That's one of the big things this week [at Cannes] — Amazon is being pretty aggressive in terms of lowering price.\"\n\nAd buyers have paid Amazon a reported cost per thousand, or CPM rate, between $30 and $35. The low price has forced competitors to follow suit. Netflix dropped its CPM rate from a previous $39 to $45 range last summer to roughly $29 to $35 currently, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\n\"Why can they do that and the rest of the industry considers that a problem is because Amazon has [a] big search advertising business and they can bring those advertisers over into Prime,\" Douglas said. \"They can monetize the content way better and bring down the price. That is the main dynamic at work right now.\"\n\n'It just raises the stakes'\n\nAmazon has one of the broadest audience reaches of all the streaming services due to its Prime delivery service and ability to keep consumers within its ecosystem. That's helped the company easily secure customer data and increase its targeting capabilities — both attractive to advertisers.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"It just raises the stakes,\" Macquarie analyst Tim Nollen previously told Yahoo Finance of Amazon's ads rollout. \"Everybody now faces another competitor and a very large supply of inventory that they're going to be competing for.\"\n\nBut there might be enough inventory to go around, especially as more consumers opt for ad-supported streaming options.\n\nAccording to subscription analytics platform Antenna, which released its second quarter \"State of Subscriptions\" report on June 13, more users are opting for ads, with 38% of overall accounts now choosing ad tiers.\n\nThose trends have continued to encourage the shift of ad buyers from linear to streaming, with MoffettNathanson predicting total advertising video on demand will grow 33% this year, compared with a 17% increase in 2023.\n\n\"Platforms with the most inventory, least must-have content, and worst targeting capabilities are most at risk,\" the firm said. Mike Hopkins, head of Prime Video & Amazon MGM Studios, speaks onstage as Amazon debuts its inaugural upfront presentation at Pier 36 on May 14 in New York City. (Slaven Vlasic/Getty Images for Amazon) (Slaven Vlasic via Getty Images)\n\nBut Douglas believes competitiveness will force the rest of the industry to adapt to Amazon's moves.\n\n\"There's a transformation underway,\" the executive said, explaining Amazon and other Big Tech companies concentrate on capturing overall market share rather than securing the highest price for a 30-second ad, the prior standard for traditional media buying.\n\n\"The rest of the industry is not set up for that. That's the problem,\" he said. \"Still, I actually don't think it's some big long-term threat where Amazon is going to eat everyone's lunch. In the near term it's accelerating trends that needed to happen anyway.\"\n\nBut, he cautioned, \"it's going to take thinking a little more like a tech company and a little less like a media company.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

Amazon will shift the aircraft in phases to Sun Country Airlines next year. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nLeisure carrier Sun Country Airlines will fly up to eight additional Boeing 737-800 converted freighters for Amazon under a contract extension announced Thursday.\n\nMinneapolis-based Sun Country (NASDAQ: SNCY) has operated a dozen Amazon-supplied Boeing narrowbody cargo jets since 2020. It said its contract for providing crews, maintenance and insurance has been extended until 2030 and that it will begin operating the initial aircraft in the first quarter of 2025.\n\nAll eight aircraft are expected to be operational in Amazon’s domestic parcel network by the third quarter of 2025, increasing Sun Country’s freighter fleet to 20 aircraft.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is reallocating the eight 737-800 freighters after agreeing last month to terminate its transport partnership with Atlas Air, which also lost flying business from 16 Boeing 767-300 freighters Amazon is transferring to ABX Air.\n\nAmazon directly controls the eight 737-800s, which are leased from AerCap.\n\n“Amazon is an extremely important customer to Sun Country and strong execution on our current cargo services positioned us well to grow our business. We look forward to continuing to provide services to Amazon into the 2030s,” said Sun Country CEO Jude Bricker in the announcement.\n\nSun Country’s cargo revenue in 2023 increased 10.4% year over year to $100 million even though the rest of the air cargo industry, including express air carriers, experienced downturns in aircraft utilization and revenue. The airline benefitted from Amazon gaining share in a declining domestic parcel market, where iit overtook FedEx and UPS last year in total deliveries.\n\nSun Country, which entered the cargo space to diversify revenue in a highly competitive passenger market, and Amazon have the right to extend the amended contract through 2037.\n\nAmazon relies on partner carriers to operate its network because it isn’t a pure airline with its own operating authority. Amazon’s active fleet has plateaued in the past 20 months at about 80 aircraft, according to various aircraft databases. During the peak of pandemic home shopping the fleet reached 88 aircraft.\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide’s leasing division, Titan Aviation, continues to lease to Amazon the 16 Boeing 767-300s being placed with ABX Air.\n\nClick here for more FreightWaves stories by Eric Kulisch.\n\nSign up for the weekly American Shipper Air newsletter here.\n\nRECOMMENDED READING:\n\nAtlas Air to end Amazon flights, focus on international customers\n\nAmazon hires ATSG to fly 10 Boeing 767 freighters\n\nSun Country revenue rises on higher Amazon flying\n\nThe post Amazon transferring Boeing 737-800 cargo jets to Sun Country Airlines appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "An Nvidia Correction Might Be Inevitable. Here Are 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks I'd Buy Instead.",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm over the past 18 months or so. Brought to the mainstream by the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI tools, it has become an unavoidable topic in tech and business.\n\nThe biggest beneficiary of this newfound AI hype is Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Its stock has been on one of the best runs you'll ever see from a company of its size. It is up nearly 620% in the past two years and over 160% this year, making it the world's third-most-valuable company, with a market capitalization of over $3.2 trillion as of June 17.\n\nNvidia's impressive rally has been great news for its investors, but with its lofty valuation surpassing even the most optimistic fundamentals, the stock could be due for a correction. Don't worry, though. There are plenty of companies dealing with AI that make for great investments.\n\nHere are three to consider now:\n\n1. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), or TSMC for short, is the world's largest semiconductor foundry and a company that I'd argue flies under the radar regarding its importance to the tech world.\n\nWhile Nvidia has received much attention, it can't be overstated how vital TSMC is to its business. People have been flocking to Nvidia because of its high-performance GPUs, which are needed to train and power AI applications. However, TSMC manufactures the advanced chips Nvidia uses for its GPUs.\n\nCould Nvidia and others purchase chips from another manufacturer? Sure. Will those chips be as advanced and efficient as TSMC's? Not likely. Its chips are essentially the foundation of the AI ecosystem. Take them away, and every part of the AI pipeline becomes less effective.\n\nThe company's CEO said it expects revenue from some of its AI processors to more than double this year and account for a low-teens percentage of its total revenue. That's great news after it saw its revenue and operating income decline last year due to a weak smartphone and PC market. TSM Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) has been using AI for a while for everything from Alexa to shopping recommendations to tailoring its logistics for its supply chain.\n\nIts true profit maker is its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Although it only generated close to 16% of the company's revenue in the first quarter, it accounted for over 61% of its operating income. AWS also stands to gain the most from AI advancements.\n\nIt's the leading cloud platform, with a 31% market share, topping second-place Azure from Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) at 25%. While Amazon has been enhancing AWS with AI features, how it uses the platform to enable businesses to develop and scale their own AI applications could be a huge growth driver for the foreseeable future.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon SageMaker, for example, allows businesses to build, train, and deploy machine learning (ML) models for virtually any purpose. Amazon Bedrock allows businesses to build and scale generative AI applications that transform their operations and customer experiences.\n\nProviding the infrastructure and tools that companies need to leverage AI makes AWS an important part of the technology's ecosystem. As Amazon continues to innovate and expand its AI capabilities and infrastructure, it should remain a key player in the tech world.\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft, maybe more so than any other tech company, has done a great job diversifying its business and building a comprehensive suite of products and services. That's largely why it has had so much sustained success over decades and now sits as the world's most valuable public company.\n\nThe tech powerhouse has its hand in many aspects of the business world. Companies rely on it for productivity tools (including Excel, Word, and Teams), enterprise software (Dynamics365), cloud services (Azure), recruiting (LinkedIn), operating systems (Windows), and other vital business applications.\n\nAfter signing a partnership with OpenAI that gives Microsoft exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models (LLMs), the company has the chance to bolster its suite of products and maintain its stronghold in the enterprise technology world. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMicrosoft's stock seems like a no-brainer for long-term investors, even with its relatively expensive valuation. The stock is priced well above its average for the past few years, but AI -- and the efficiency boost that should come with it -- should give the company newfound growth areas and continue its strong rise with its cloud platform.\n\nMicrosoft is a stock you can feel comfortable buying and holding for the long haul. It has excellent financial health, a history of consistent growth, and its importance to the business world ensures it won't easily be replaced. It's a trifecta you can't go wrong with today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Budget Management (Photo: Business Wire) System for Cross-domain Identity Management (Photo: Business Wire) Guided Buying (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nNew innovative tools and features provide business customers with a convenient, intuitive, and personalized buying experience\n\nThrough Amazon Business, multinational enterprisesincluding Fortune 100, FTSE 100, and DAX-40 can maximize value for their company to help navigate challenges and stay on track for long-term growth\n\nThese technologies were highlighted at Amazon Business Exchange—a single-day event for European industry leaders to discover new innovations and successful strategies to grow their business\n\nSEATTLE, June 20, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Business (NASDAQ: AMZN), the company’s online business-to-business procurement store, today announced a number of new technology features including the Amazon Business App Center, System for Cross-domain Identity Management, and Integrated Quoting. Amazon Business also made a number of updates to its Budget Management and Guided Buying solutions. These technologies are designed to help large business customers, including multinational enterprises, universities, government agencies, education organizations, and healthcare networks, simplify and modernize the way they shop for business supplies.\n\n\"Amazon Business wants to change how companies shop for supplies through our unmatched selection, deep discounts, and smart capabilities,\" said Shelley Salomon, worldwide vice president of Amazon Business. \"We don't just react to the biggest challenges our customers have shared with us; we get ahead of them with new technologies so our customers can use their resources to navigate the unexpected and continue expanding their business.\"\n\nRecent research conducted by Amazon Business revealed that U.S. procurement teams are struggling to drive efficiencies within their organization, with close to 49% of respondents reporting complexity of systems and multi-step processes as the main contributors to this problem. As a result, 95% of procurement leaders acknowledge that there’s a need to optimize their procurement functions. Specifically, respondents feel that business buying is cumbersome, convoluted, and time-consuming. Instead of a convenient, intuitive, and personalized experience, teams are spending too much time performing tasks related to processing orders and leaders see improved procurement tools as the solution for this challenge.\n\nTo help address this challenge, Amazon Business has introduced and upgraded several tools available to business buyers in Canada, France, Germany, Italy, France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, including:\n\nAmazon Business App Center is a new one-stop shop where business customers can discover, quickly set-up, and connect their Amazon Business account with more than 25 third-party applications from around the world. Solutions in the App Center include integrated shopping, accounting management, expense management, inventory management, rewards and recognition, and business analytics. The App Center helps save leaders time and money through a single point of discovery as well as eliminating or reducing the need to develop a custom solution for their organization. System for Cross-domain Identity Management is a new feature that automatically syncs users and group data from their organization’s identity provider with their Amazon Business account. This feature helps administrators spend less time on maintaining and updating their Amazon Business account. Budget Management streamlines the process of setting and reviewing time-bound budgets across an organization. Now, business customers can set spend thresholds and make budget amounts visible to buyers to get ahead of overspending. Amazon Business also launched new ways for leaders to actively manage their budgets including real-time tracking and usage reports, notifications when a budget is about to expire, pre-purchase approvals, and an option to create one purchase order (PO) instead of multiple, manual orders. These updates empower procurement buyers to make informed purchasing decisions for their organization while reducing the amount of time leaders spend auditing their purchases. Guided Buying makes it easier for leaders to manage employee spending by steering buyers to purchase decisions that align with their organization’s preferences and goals. Through a new toolbar, account administrators can now instantly prefer products with sustainability certifications in the Climate Pledge Friendly program with a single click. Leaders can also restrict, block, and require an approval for certain product categories with an eligible Business Prime plan. Through easy-to-follow visuals, Guided Buying helps procurement leaders save time educating their employees on what items they should or should not purchase. Integrated Quoting is a new feature that helps business customers generate custom quotes for Amazon Business bulk orders as well as other suppliers via third-party e-sourcing and e-procurement platforms. Integrated Quoting is ideal for business customers purchasing more than 1,000 items or more than $10,000 in total value. After requesting a bid, the feature centralizes an organization’s Request for Quote (RFQ) activity making it even easier for leaders to identify cost savings and select the most competitive bid.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon Business makes business buying simpler by offering the same easy-to-use experience customers know and love from Amazon. Since launching in the U.S. in 2015, Amazon Business has empowered businesses of all sizes through unmatched selection, deep discounts, and smart capabilities. Today, Amazon drives roughly $35B in annualized gross sales and has more than 6 million customers worldwide including 96 of the Fortune 100, 66 of the FTSE 100, and 37 of the DAX-40 companies. Working closely with customers to understand their business buying challenges, Amazon Business continues to develop new technologies that make it easy for organizations and administrators to define, meet, and proactively measure progress toward their purchasing budgets and goals. Amazon Business is now a strategic partner to businesses in 10 countries including Canada, France, Germany, India, Italy, Japan, Mexico, Spain, the United Kingdom, and the United States.\n\n\"As a purchasing manager for a large public school district, I know all too well that teachers don’t have extra time during the day to buy the supplies they need. Amazon Business makes the buying process easy as teachers are already familiar with the Amazon shopping experience,\" said Greg Long, purchasing manager at Seminole County Public Schools. \"One of our favorite Amazon Business features is Budget Management. It gives teachers visibility into our budget so they know how much they have to spend, making it easier to stay within our annual budget.\"\n\nVisit the Amazon Business website to learn more.\n\nAbout Amazon Business\n\nAmazon Business helps millions of customers worldwide — from small businesses, schools, hospitals, nonprofits, and government agencies to large enterprises with global operations — reshape their procurement with cost and time savings, greater productivity, and insightful purchasing analytics. Procurement and business leaders enjoy convenient shipping options on hundreds of millions of supplies across categories like office, IT, janitorial, food service, and medical supplies.

        "content": "Amazon is shifting from the plastic air pillows used for packaging in North America to recycled paper because it's more environmentally sound, and it says paper just works better.\n\nThe company said Thursday that it's already replaced 95% of the plastic air pillows with paper filler in North America and is working toward complete removal by year's end.\n\n“We want to ensure that customers receive their items undamaged, while using as little packaging as possible to avoid waste, and prioritizing recyclable materials,” Amazon said.\n\nIt is the company's largest plastic packaging reduction effort in North America to date and will remove almost 15 billion plastic air pillows from use annually.\n\nAlmost all customer deliveries for Prime Day this year, which happens next month, will contain plastic no air pillows, according to Amazon.\n\nAmazon began transition away from plastic air pillows in October at an automated fulfillment center in Ohio. The company said that it was able to test and learn at the center there, which helped it move quickly on transitioning to recycled paper filling.\n\nThe transition process included changing out machinery and training employees on new systems and machines.\n\nAmazon discovered through testing that the paper filler, which is made from 100% recyclable content and is curbside recyclable, offers the same, if not better protection during shipping compared with plastic air pillows, the company said.\n\nChristian Garcia, who works at Amazon's fulfillment center in Bakersfield, California, said in a release that the paper filler is easier to work with and that the machinery gives staff more space so that it's easier to pack orders.\n\nOngoing efforts to reduce waste include a campaign to ship items without any additional packaging, the company said.

        "title": "7 REITs to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "High interest rates weighed on real estate investment trusts during 2022 and 2023, but REIT stocks have recovered thus far this year. Better yet, it’s not too late to capitalize on this trend, by accumulating positions in the top REITs to buy now.\n\nWhy? Although the prospect of interest rate cuts has helped the REIT sector embark on a comeback, as rates still have not started to come down, this comeback/recovery has been minimal.\n\nHowever, starting later this year, when the U.S. Federal Reserve is expected to implement at least one interest rate cut, the REIT rebound could kick it into high gear.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs rate hike led to outsized losses for REIT stocks, rate cuts could do the opposite, driving big gains. Beyond their potential as a way to play lower interest rates, there are also several names in the space that stand out, because of REIT-specific catalysts.\n\nPut it all together, and it’s easy to see why there is a big opportunity with the top REITs to buy now, such as the following seven real estate investment trusts listed below.\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust (FRT) tiny house figures atop letter blocks spelling out REIT, representing reits to buy. stock predictions. best REITs\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFederal Realty Investment Trust (NYSE:FRT) is a REIT specializing in the ownership of shopping centers and other high-end retail properties.\n\nAcross the U.S., particularly in affluent metro areas like D.C., Boston, Los Angeles, and the San Francisco Bay Area, FRT owns a total of 102 retail properties.\n\nWith this focus on quality and geographic diversification, it’s no surprise that FRT stock has built a track record of dividends and dividend growth.\n\nWith 56 years of consecutive dividend growth under its belt, Federal Realty is not just a “dividend aristocrat”; it’s a “dividend king” as well. At current prices, FRT has a forward dividend yield of 4.34%. Over the past five years, annual dividend growth has averaged just 1.39%.\n\nHowever, if interests begin to move lower later this year, this could have a big impact on FRT’s valuation. Trading at a forward price to funds from operations of 14.9, sports a fair valuation today, but lower rates could drive a rerating for the REIT sector.\n\nJBG Smith Properties (JBGS) image of small toy homes with a red arrow pointing up to represent reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nJBG Smith Properties (NYSE:JBGS) is another of the REITs to buy now based in the Washington, D.C. metro area, yet instead of retail properties, JBG Smith is considered an office REIT.\n\nYes, with a rebound in commercial office space demand stymied by the remote work trend, the “office real estate apocalypse” has and continues to be a thing.\n\nEven so, with JBGS stock, investor pessimism about office REITs could benefit you. For starters, while considered an office REIT, a look at JBG Smith’s current portfolio says otherwise.\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to a May 2024 investor presentation, a majority of the REIT’s portfolio is now in multifamily properties. JBG Smith’s portfolio spans various property classes in the affluent D.C. metro area.\n\nIn particular, in the National Landing section of Arlington, Virginia, home to Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) HQ2. Besides possibly surging on rate cuts, this REIT could also rise in value, as the market appreciates its move from being office building-focused.\n\nWhile you wait for price appreciation, you can collect a relatively high dividend yield of 6.92%.\n\nModiv Industrial (MDV) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nModiv Industrial (NYSE:MDV), a lesser-known REIT, but is nonetheless a potential rising star in the space.\n\nAs its corporate name suggests, Modiv is an industrial REIT, focused on the ownership of properties like manufacturing facilities.\n\nIn past coverage of MDV stock, I’ve pointed out multiple positives with this micro-cap REIT. For one, the fact that Modiv both has a high dividend yield, and is a monthly dividend stock.\n\nBased on Modiv’s last declared monthly dividend of 9.58 cents per share, the REIT has a forward annual yield of around 7.84%. Not only that, Modiv is selective in the types of properties it acquires.\n\nThe REIT primarily focuses on buying industrial properties under triple-net leases, with long lease terms and steady annual base rental increases.\n\nFor instance, Modiv’s portfolio has a weighted average lease term of 14 years, with an average annual rental increase of 2.5%.\n\nPut it all together, and Modiv may have the ingredients in place to generate strong returns, through dividends and price appreciation. In the more immediate future, rate cuts could drive a big increase in price for this high-yielding REIT.\n\nNet Lease Office Properties (NLOP) a wooden house shape holds 3 bags of cash representing reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe name of Net Lease Office Properties (NYSE:NLOP) is pretty self-explanatory, but rather than being an opportunity for investors to own a triple-net lease office portfolio, what makes NLOP one of the REITs to buy now is the upside potential from property divestitures.\n\nSince being spun off from net-lease giant W.P. Carey (NYSE:WPC) last year, NLOP has been busy whittling down its portfolio. As Seeking Alpha commentator REITer’s Digest explained earlier this month, this REIT’s objective is to sell off its properties, pay down debt, and distribute the proceeds to shareholders.\n\nTaking a look at NLOP’s balance sheet, the payoff could be substantial. According to its latest quarterly financials, NLOP has a book value of $43.78 per share, versus a $24.73 per share stock price.\n\nThat said, completing a full liquidation could prove easier said-than-done. Now is of course not an optimal time to be divesting of office properties.\n\nHowever, if you are a fan of special situation investments, and believe that the discount priced into NLOP and other office REITs has become overdone, Net Lease Office Properties is an opportunity to consider.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nRealty Income (NYSE:O) is regarded by REIT investors as a top-shelf name in the space.\n\nFocused on the ownership of triple-net lease retail properties, Realty Income not only is known for paying monthly dividends. This REIT literally trademarked the phrase “the monthly dividend company.”\n\nTo top things off, besides paying monthly dividends, Realty Income frequently increases the size of its monthly distributions. Earlier this month, the REIT announced its 126th monthly dividend increase since 1994.\n\nAt current prices, O stock has a forward annual dividend yield of 5.94%. Over the past five years, O’s payouts have increased by an average of 3.55% annually.\n\nWhile Realty Income has bounced back from its late 2023 lows, with interest rates staying “higher for longer,” O shares have been sitting tight in the low-$50s for several months.\n\nHowever, if the Fed sticks to its plan to lower rates at least once later this year, and implements further rate cuts during 2025 and beyond, this could spark a rebound for this much-followed REIT. During a lower interest rate environment, O traded for prices north of $70 per share.\n\nUMH Properties (UMH) a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nUMH Properties (NYSE:UNH) focuses on the ownership of manufactured home communities. Better known as mobile home parks, this is a lucrative, fast-growing area of the multifamily real estate market.\n\nLargely, since it’s a lower-cost housing option, demand is rising. This means greater opportunity for organic growth via rent increases.\n\nThere are several manufactured housing REITs out there, but UMH stock may be the one to consider as one of the REITs to buy now. With a dividend yield of 5.54%, UMH beats peers on yield.\n\nFor instance, Equity Lifestyle Properties (NYSE:ELS) has a 2.89% forward yield. Another peer, Sun Communities (NYSE:SUI), has a forward yield of 3.24%.\n\nIn terms of valuation, using the price to funds from operations metric, which is the REIT version of price-to-earnings, UMH is also cheaper than both ELS and SUI.\n\nThis comes despite forecasts calling for UMH’s FFO to rise 10.75% next year, versus expected FFO growth of 6.2% for ELS, and 6.04% for SUI. With all of this in mind, UMH Properties may have the strongest rebound potential, in the event rate cuts lead to a broad rally for REIT stocks.\n\nVici Properties (VICI) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American real estate company Vici Properties Inc. on screen in front of web page. VICI stock.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock\n\nVici Properties (NYSE:VICI) is the biggest landlord on the Las Vegas Strip. This REIT owns the land and physical buildings that house many of the top casino resorts in Vegas.\n\nBeyond “Sin City,” Vici’s portfolio extends to properties in other top U.S. regional gambling markets.\n\nVICI stock currently has a forward dividend yield of 5.91%. Annual payouts have grown by an average of 7.62% over the past five years.\n\nWhile you may at first be concerned that Vici’s fortunes depend heavily on the fortunes of its tenants, keep in mind that, boom times or recession, this house always wins.\n\nThat is, with fixed rental rate terms, Vici always gets paid, no matter the circumstances. During the Covid-19 lockdowns of 2020, Vici kept collecting full cash rent from its tenants.\n\nIn the near-term, rate cuts could drive a big rally for VICI. Long-term, other catalysts could come into play.\n\nBuilt-in rental rate increases point to continued FFO growth, and hence, continued dividend growth. Also, as I have noted previously, Vici Properties is well-positioned to make further needle-moving acquisitions. Another strong opportunity for yield and price appreciation, consider VICI one of the REITs to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon's Dr. Angela Shippy wants to help AI transform the healthcare system",
        "content": "As artificial intelligence and machine learning roll out across virtually every sector of the economy, helping fuel the stock market to record highs, the biggest tech companies are racing to bring those efficiencies over to healthcare, a sector that spent $4.5 trillion in 2022.\n\nDr. Angela Shippy, a medical doctor turned executive at Amazon (AMZN) Web Services, is leading the charge for the world's biggest cloud provider. At Houston Medical Center, where Shippy previously saw patients, she now meets with hospital executives to discuss how tech can be incorporated into patient care.\n\n“I have the opportunity to really bridge that gap between what's happening day-to-day within healthcare organizations and technology that can help them really transform and really find the solutions to any pain points that they have,” Shippy said. An Amazon Echo Spot sits among the smart devices being studied in a lab at Northeastern University in Boston, Mass., on Oct. 14, 2021. (REUTERS/Brian Snyder) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nShippy works directly with at least 700 healthcare providers across the country to expand their use of AWS-backed technology.\n\nAmong the tools are AI-powered rooms that transcribe conversations and take notes for doctors, Echo Dot devices that patients can use to order things like ice, and even virtual intensive care services, which decrease burnout in providers by allowing them to focus on patient care.\n\n“If we can take away those tiny administrative burdensome tasks and allow [care providers] to do what they truly love, then we know we're making it a better experience for them, and we're making it a better experience for the patient as well because they're in control,” Shippy said.\n\nAWS is not alone in this effort. Amazon, Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), and Meta (META) said this earnings season they are investing another $16 billion in AI this year, a 31% increase from last year.

(Jordan Pettitt/PA Images via Getty Images) (Jordan Pettitt - PA Images via Getty Images)\n\nAlthough more than half of hospitals' total operating revenue goes toward labor, the field remains challenged by labor shortages and increased patient volumes. Shippy aims to address these issues by deploying devices like Amazon Alexa to empower patients to make requests like turning a light on and off while reducing pressure on staff.\n\nBecause of her previous work as a healthcare provider, Shippy is uniquely positioned as fluent in both the medical and tech worlds. Prior to joining AWS, she was the chief medical and quality officer at the Memorial Hermann Health System, where she used her affinity for technology to develop a COVID-19 dashboard at the height of the pandemic.\n\n\"I saw the power of technology, and how it would be used to transform healthcare,\" Shippy said. \"And that's really what made coming to a role like this at AWS possible for me because I saw what that transformation could really lead to.\"\n\nStory continues New technology allows doctors and care providers to interact with a virtual reality 3D heart. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nOne example of that transformation is a virtual reality headset that projects 3D images. The AWS executive donned the headset, which allowed her to flip and turn the three-dimensional beating heart of a hypothetical patient. “This patient is having a heart attack,” Shippy explained to Yahoo Finance.\n\nThe 3D virtual heart is among the more futuristic tools in the hospital, but Shippy sees value in tools across the spectrum of technology. That vision and her experience during the pandemic informed her decision to move from health to tech — a leap of faith for a doctor who decided her career path at just 9 years old.\n\n“When ... somebody like me at 9 years old says, 'I want be a doctor. I want to help people,' that never goes away,” Shippy said. “Being from an underrepresented community or being in a community where maybe healthcare isn't like what you've seen in the Texas Medical Center today, we want to close those gaps.” Lead This Way\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest health industry news and events impacting stock prices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Amazon Is Ditching Plastic Air Pillow Packaging in North America",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc., seeking to become more environmentally friendly, is replacing plastic air pillows in its North American shipments with recycled paper.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCar Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack Putin’s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO’s Eastern Border Hedge Fund Talent Schools Are Looking for the Perfect Trader Car Dealers Across US Are Crippled By a Second Cyberattack What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan\n\nThe e-commerce giant says it has already eliminated some 95% of the thin plastic cushions in its largest market and anticipates removing the rest by year-end. It’s among Amazon’s biggest moves to date to stop dispatching packages with single-use plastic that, while technically recyclable in specialty facilities, more often winds up in landfills or clogging machinery in recycling centers not designed for thin film.\n\nThe next step: replacing the similarly hard-to-recycle white and blue plastic mailers with paper sleeves, said Pat Lindner, an Amazon vice president who oversees the company’s sustainable packaging initiatives. “We’re now at the stage where we’re pretty confident that we’re going to be able to scale that in the coming months,” he said. “We’re pleased with the progress we’ve made.”\n\nAmazon has ramped up its plastic-reduction efforts following criticism from environmental watchdogs who said the company was contributing to the tide of plastic waste finding its way into the world’s oceans. At Amazon’s annual shareholders’ meeting in 2022, almost half of Amazon investors backed a proposal recommending that the company outline steps to reduce plastic use.\n\nAmazon disclosed a detailed figure on a portion of its plastic use for the first time later that year, though it has stopped short of setting a public goal to entirely eliminate plastic from its operations. Amazon says it used 85,916 metric tons of single-use plastic in shipments worldwide in 2022, down 12% from the prior year.\n\n“We, a couple years ago, really decided based on all the customer input that reducing the amount of plastics packaging was important to have on our road map,” Lindner said.\n\nAmazon said it stopped using most plastic packaging in Europe by late 2022. Last year, the company retrofitted a warehouse in Ohio to ship products without any added plastic, using custom paper mailers and machines capable of building made-to-fit cardboard boxes around individual products. Those materials and machines added to Amazon’s costs, compared with its prior plastic-based infrastructure, Lindner said. But that was partly offset by increased automation that required less manual labor in areas of the warehouse where employees pack items in boxes.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe paper filler is likewise more expensive than the plastic air pillows, though Lindner said ditching the machines that dispensed the pillows in favor of simpler tissue-box like paper dispensers should lower Amazon’s maintenance costs.\n\nBefore rolling out the paper filler, which is designed to be recyclable in curbside bins, Amazon tested the material to make sure it protected the products it was wrapped around. By many measures, paper performed better.\n\nClint Haynes, a vice president with Stress Engineering Services, which Amazon paid to carry out tests, likened paper wrapping to the crumple zone in cars that absorb the shock of collisions. The pillows, on the other hand, act as tiny trampolines when jostled in a truck rattling down a bumpy road, further bouncing the products they’re meant to protect.\n\nPlus when they’re pushed to the limit, pillows pop.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into These 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "With all eyes on the Federal Reserve and earnings season, it's possible investors missed what was, arguably, the most-important data release of the quarter five weeks ago.\n\nOn May 15, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\n\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\n\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nTop-notch billionaire money managers dumped shares of Nvidia\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\n\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares)\n\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont piled into AI networking and cloud companies\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\n\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\n\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\n\nBillionaire Ken Griffin chose something a little more \"Magnificent\"\n\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\n\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\n\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Stocks That Have Created Many Millionaires, and Will Continue to Make More",
        "content": "Are you hoping to become a self-made millionaire? It's certainly possible even if you're not a professional artist or athlete. The key for most ordinary people is just investing what you can when you can, picking the right stocks, and then leaving them alone long enough to let them do the heavy lifting.\n\nHere's a rundown of three magnificent stocks that have not only helped bunches of investors become millionaires, but will likely continue doing the same into the distant future.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nThere's nothing particularly exciting about The Coca-Cola Company(NYSE: KO). Sure, it's the name behind the world's most popular soft drink. It also owns several other familiar brands, like Gold Peak tea, Minute Maid juices, Powerade sports drinks, and Dasani water, just to name a few. But the drinks industry is crowded, competitive, and limited in terms of growth potential.\n\nBut this market saturation doesn't really matter when you've perfected the art -- and science -- of convincing people to purchase your product over and over again, which is precisely what this company has done. From a brilliant combination of steady lifestyle branding efforts (most Gen-Xers and older folks still remember the \"I'd like to teach the world to sing\" jingle from 50 years ago!) to leveraging its sheer size when negotiating pricing, production, and product placement with its retail and bottling partners, Coca-Cola has become parent to several of the world's most recognized beverage brand names.\n\nInvestors have come along for the ride, too. A $10,000 investment in Coke stock 50 years ago would be worth roughly half a million bucks today. And that's just the stock's price appreciation. By reinvesting any dividends paid in the meantime into more shares of Coca-Cola, your initial investment would be worth over $2 million now. Slow-and-steady clearly wins the race.\n\nThe toughest part of owning a stake in this slow-moving dividend payer is, of course, remaining patient enough to let your reinvested dividends create enough of a cash-driving critical mass to matter. Not everybody is willing or able to simply wait and watch, trusting that big returns are in the cards.\n\nThis might help: The Coca-Cola Company has raised its dividend every year for the past 62 years. The split-adjusted quarterly dividend of $0.195 it was dishing out in 1994 has grown to $0.485 per share now. It's also worth remembering that there's never going to be a time when people don't get thirsty.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) doesn't pay a meaningful dividend. Its current yield stands at just under 0.5%. Rather, Google's parent has taken a more direct approach to turning its investors into millionaires. Since the company's initial public offering in 2004, shares have gained an incredible 7,000%.\n\nStory continues\n\nGranted, the company's very best days are probably in the past. Search engines aren't exactly a high-growth business anymore, now that much of the developed world is already regularly online. It's also a crowded market, with alternative search engines like Microsoft's Bing getting traction.\n\nThat line of thinking looks past a couple of important realities regarding Alphabet, however.\n\nOne of these realities is the fact that while the search engine market is no longer a huge growth driver, that business isn't the only meaningful one Alphabet is in. YouTube now accounts for roughly one-tenth of the company's top line, and a little more than one-tenth of the company's total revenue comes from its still-young cloud computing arm. Alphabet's cloud arm only recently swung to an operating profit, and its bottom line continues to grow at a much faster clip than any of its other businesses. The market may be underestimating the near-term profit growth that's in the cards here.\n\nThe other detail worth drawing out is that while Alphabet's breadwinning Google already controls a commanding 90% of the world's search engine market -- according to numbers from GlobalStats -- there's actually still ample opportunity for above-average growth on this front. Market researcher Mordor Intelligence believes the so-called next-generation search engine market (improved by the addition of artificial intelligence, for instance) is set to grow at an annualized pace of nearly 15% through 2029. Alphabet's first-quarter search advertising revenue was also up 14.3% year over year.\n\nConnect the dots. Every time it seems like the company's out of opportunities, it finds a new lever or two to pull.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLast but not least, add Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to your list of magnificent stocks that have already minted lots of millionaires, but could continue making more.\n\nThe company doesn't need much of an introduction. It arguably launched the entire e-commerce industry once internet access became common in the late 1990s and early 2000s. Market research company eMarketer reckons Amazon controls on the order of a commanding 40% of the United States' e-commerce market. But, despite Amazon's dominance of North America's online-shopping landscape, eMarketer believes Amazon's share of this market is going to continue growing at least through 2025 rather than stagnating, or even shrinking.\n\nThat dominance is only part of the bullish argument for owning Amazon stock, however. Amazon is also the world's single-biggest cloud computing service provider, and this business is a beast. It accounts for more than 60% of the company's operating income,lifted again by its first-quarter revenue growth of 17%. Although it's well-developed already, Mordor Intelligence says the global cloud computing services market is on pace to grow at an average annual pace of more than 16% at least through 2029.\n\nAmazon is finally firing on all cylinders on another front as well. That's international e-commerce. While this arm's regularly operated in the red (with the exception of the height of the coronavirus pandemic), it's been cutting its international business' operating costs and growing sales for a couple of years. Last quarter's international operating income of $903 million is the most profitable this unit's been since its record-breaking profit of $1.25 billion in Q1 2021. Only this time, there's room and reason for the trajectory to continue carrying both its sales and income upward. Data source: Amazon Inc. Chart by author. All figures are in millions of dollars.\n\nIn the meantime, Amazon remains North America's online shopping powerhouse.\n\nIt's unlikely Amazon stock will be able to repeat the 244,000% gain logged since its 1997 IPO over the course of the next 27 years. That certainly doesn't mean it can't continue outperforming the overall market, though.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

The car has advanced technology, including 1,200 TOPS of computer power and a complex sensor design with 38 sensors: it can drive itself at Level 4 and has automatic parking features, and boasts 8 LiDARs, 6 millimeter-wave radars, 12 ultrasonic radars, and 12 cameras.\n\nBIDU is the first company in China to gain permission to run fully driverless robotaxi services. Baidu’s Apollo Go cars can drive without a safety driver during the day in certain areas of Wuhan and Chongqing, thanks to the permits. Baidu wants to use thousands of self-driving cars and cut the price of robotaxi rides by a substantial margin, with the goal of making them half the price of regular cabs.\n\nSince 2020, Baidu’s Apollo Go robotaxi service has served over a million individuals; it wants to serve 100 cities by 2030, up from 65 currently. In the next years, Baidu will use Apollo RT6 automobiles extensively. A sprawling conglomerate, BIDU doesn’t need to rely on its autonomous driving segment to fuel its business line; it’s the other way around; analysts rate it a ‘strong buy’, forecasting a potential upside of 67%.\n\nLuminar Technologies (LAZR) Luminar (LAZR stock) sign with greenery around it\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto/shutterstock.com\n\nLuminar Technologies (NASDAQ:LAZR) accomplished a significant manufacturing milestone in April when it started producing automobiles for Volvo Cars worldwide, marking the first step toward using Luminar’s lidar technology in consumer vehicles.\n\nIn addition, LAZR is also working withApplied Intuition to expedite ADAS and autonomous driving research. This cooperation uses Applied Intuition’s modelling and software tools to improve Luminar’s lidar-based technologies for automakers’ robust and efficient development processes.\n\nLuminar Technologies also narrowed its losses in Q1 2024 versus Q1 2023, losing $0.30 per share instead of $0.40 per share, while also highlighting its relationship with Gatik for multi-year production deals.\n\nBut Luminar’s decision to lay off 20% of its staff and move toward contract manufacturing to become asset-light somewhat balances the bullish theory. Plus, LAZR’s ‘hold’ consensus and BofA Securities‘ downgrading indicate cooling analyst love right now, but ignoring the 236% upside potential in LAZR stock is unwise, particularly given the importance of its vision-based lidar technology among autonomous driving stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Shopify’s gains with big retailers is setting up a nearly $1 trillion opportunity, according to this legendary Wall St. analyst",
        "content": "Since its 2006 launch, Shopify has slowly but surely built an $83 billion software business by “arming the rebels” – the mom and mom shops and upstart digital-native consumer brands  hawking everything from floral arrangements to workout clothes online.\n\nBut its next big opportunity may be arming some of retail’s larger incumbents, from global toy brand Mattel to shoe retailer Steve Madden, and it's a huge piece of the nearly $850 billion market opportunity standing in front of the e-commerce software giant.\n\nThat’s according to legendary wall street tech analyst Mark Mahaney and his colleagues at the research firm Evercore ISI. Mahaney and company recently upgraded Shopify’s stock to an “outperform” rating with a price target of $75 per share. The stock was trading around $64 at the time.\n\nAnd a major component of the Shopify upside that Evercore sees has to do with Shopify’s work in recent years to appeal to large enterprises in addition to small and mid-sized merchants. In interviews with Shopify merchants, Mahaney and team found that the moves seem to be working. In addition to Mattel and Steve Madden, Shopify has also attracted large fast-growing brands like Kim Kardashian’s Skims apparel company.\n\n“Merchants were consistently bullish on SHOP’s ability to penetrate Enterprise merchants, with the majority believing SHOP has built out the capabilities to address Enterprise merchants needs over the past 3-4yrs,” the research team wrote.\n\nThese merchants also told the Evercore team that migrating onto Shopify software has gotten easier and that the ability to pick and choose only certain Shopify tools – maybe it’s only the Shop Pay checkout feature to start – is attractive.\n\nAs Shopify has targeted larger brands and retailers in recent years, its field of competitors has also expanded to include enterprise software giants like Salesforce and Adobe. Beyond Shopify’s continued move into the enterprise ecommerce space, Evercore sees its $850 billion addressable market also including physical retail, where the company offers point-of-sale software and other tools.\n\nThen there’s Amazon. It’d be fair to call Shopify and Amazon frenemies. Shopify founder and CEO Tobi Lutke hasn’t been shy about his feelings about how Amazon views sellers.\n\n“Amazon’s worldview is that merchants don’t matter; factories and consumers matter,” Lutke told this reporter years ago in an onstage interview at an industry conference. “Everything in between is Jeff’s [Bezos] opportunity,” he said, referring to Amazon founder Jeff Bezos.\n\nIn recent years, though, the companies have found ways to work together. Shopify merchants can use the e-commerce software to sell through Amazon too, and Shopify merchants can also integrate Amazon’s “Buy with Prime” feature into their own web stores.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the biggest competition between the two companies may still lie ahead–but with a twist, according to a former Shopify leader. As Shopify courts bigger merchants, and Amazon’s AWS cloud division aims to sell AI and other cloud products to large consumer brands and retailers, a new face-off may be on the horizon.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Stocks You Don’t Want to Be Caught Holding When the Market Drops",
        "content": "Not every stock is a winner, and it’s important to know when to cut your losses. While it’s normal for corporations to report bad earnings every once in a while, some earnings reports can shatter growth narratives and put investors in tough spots.\n\nFurthermore, some stocks can rally substantially for 1 to 2 years before coming back down to earth. These growth stocks are particularly risky as some investors may hold their shares, hoping the corporations can reclaim their all-time highs. Investors should remember they can choose from thousands of companies. You can find many growth stocks that don’t have red flags and have plenty of growth opportunities. With that in mind, why would you stick with a company that looks like it will underperform the stock market?\n\nThese are some of the stocks to sell before the market drops. Even if the market rallies, these stocks will likely be left behind.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZoom (ZM) A woman sitting at a desk waves at a large number of people on the videoconferencing software Zoom (ZM).\n\nSource: Girts Ragelis / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoom (NASDAQ:ZM) enjoyed its heyday during the pandemic as people were forced to stay in their homes. The stock quickly soared as more people used the video conferencing app to meet friends, attend class and arrive for business meetings.\n\nA return to normal times hasn’t done much for Zoom. Shares are down 20% year-to-date and are roughly 90% down from their all-time high. Zoom trades at a 21 P/E ratio, but that shouldn’t fool investors. Growth is stagnant at the company, as revenue only inched up 3.2% year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter of fiscal 2025.\n\nZoom’s profits soared YOY, but it’s a bit discouraging when profits come amid cost-cutting without revenue growth. Profit margin expansion possibilities are very limited when a company is only maintaining a single-digit revenue growth rate. Most Wall Street analysts are on the sidelines for this stock. It’s rated as a Hold with five Buy ratings and one Sell rating. The remaining 15 analysts rated the stock as a Hold.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is facing several headwinds. The company is losing ground in China as other EV manufacturers gobble up market share. China is an important market for Tesla’s long-term growth story, and it appears to be shaky. Chinese EV manufacturers are producing high-quality vehicles at much lower prices than what you’d find in the United States.\n\nChinese EV makers aren’t showing up in the United States or the European Union solely because of high tariffs. That doesn’t bode well for Tesla and other EV makers when they try to tap into markets that aren’t affected by those elevated tariffs. However, the problem is worse for Tesla stock since it trades at a 47 P/E ratio.\n\nStory continues\n\nTesla’s revenue dropped by 13% YOY in the first quarter of 2024. Most of its revenue comes from automobiles, which doesn’t warrant a tech company’s valuation. Even its net profit margins look like an automobile company.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is another stock that performed well during the pandemic and has been well removed from its all-time highs. Shares have crashed roughly 80% from all-time highs and are down 27% year-to-date. Declining gross merchandise sales (GMS) are the main culprit for the lack of enthusiasm around the stock. If this metric continues to decline, revenue and earnings will go along with it.\n\nInvestors saw that on full display in the first quarter of 2024. During that quarter, consolidated GMS dropped by 3.7% YOY. A lower GMS figure also impacted revenue and net income. Revenue was only up by 0.8% YOY, as higher fees and advertising helped to keep this figure flat. The company wasn’t as lucky with its profits, as net income dropped 15% YOY.\n\nEtsy isn’t the same place as it was a few years ago. It’s more difficult to find handmade goods that don’t resemble products you could buy from Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Furthermore, the company’s heightened fees have frustrated sellers. Etsy’s management got greedy with its fees during the pandemic in hopes of boosting shareholder returns. Now, investors are jumping off the ship before things get worse.\n\nOn the date of publication, Marc Guberti did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Quote\n\nStrengthening Blink Portfolio Aids Prospects\n\nPer a Mordor Intelligence report, the global smart home security market is expected to hit $32.46 billion in 2024 and reach $61.97 billion by 2029, exhibiting a CAGR of 13.8% between 2024 and 2029.

It features improved image quality, low light sensitivity, and a wider field of view, with up to two years of battery life and support for person detection.\r\n\r\nThese efforts will continue aiding Amazon’s overall financial performance in the upcoming period.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11.04%.\r\n\r\nThe consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at $4.58 per share, indicating a 57.9% rise from the year-ago figure. The figure has been revised upward by 0.9% in the past 30 days.\n\nCompetitive Advantage\n\nStrengthening the Blink portfolio has placed this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company at a competitive advantage against players like Honeywell HON, Adobe ADBE and Alphabet GOOGL, which are also making concerted efforts to strengthen their foothold in the smart home security market.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nHoneywell has been a prominent player in the smart home security market on the back of its robust portfolio, which includes a wide range of smart home security products, from home security cameras like the C2 WiFi Security Camera to smart alarm systems to wireless doorbells, enabling customers to take control and protect their home from internal and external threats.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Adobe strengthened its position in the smart home security market with the recent launch of Abode Edge Camera.

        "title": "2 Millionaire-Maker Technology Stocks to Consider in June",
        "content": "The tech market has made many millionaires over the years. In fact, investing mogul Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, has dedicated over 40% of its portfolio to the industry. Meanwhile, Berkshire's value increased at an estimated compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% from 1965 to 2023, outperforming the S&P 500's annual return of about 10%.\n\nOf course, past growth doesn't always guarantee future gains. However, advances in budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI), cloud computing, e-commerce, and more suggest tech still has plenty more to offer investors over the long term. The AI market on its own is expected to grow at a CAGR of 37% until at least 2030, which would see it hit nearly $2 trillion in spending.\n\nSo, it's not too late to consider buying these two millionaire-maker technology stocks this month.\n\n1. Intel\n\nIntel(NASDAQ: INTC) was once a leader in the chip market, best known for its dominance in central processing units (CPUs) -- which are critical for computing tasks. While the company has retained a majority market share in CPUs, a boom in AI has shifted chip demand. Graphics processing units (GPUs) have become crucial to the tech market with their ability to handle the intensive workloads that come with training AI models, rendering video games, and mining cryptocurrency.\n\nThe changes in the industry put Intel on the back foot while GPU leader Nvidia enjoyed soaring earnings and stock growth. However, Intel has pivoted its business to AI and could deliver major gains in the coming years. In April, the company unveiled AI-enabled Xeon 6 processors and its Gaudi 3 accelerator, which Intel has said delivers \"50% on average better inference and 40% on average better power efficiency than Nvidia H100 -- at a fraction of the cost.\"\n\nIn addition to new product designs, Intel is vastly expanding its chip manufacturing operations. The company is working to generate revenue by making chips for other companies, which could secure it a lucrative position in AI. The move could allow Intel to profit from rising chip demand across the industry by even manufacturing chips for its competitors.\n\nOf course, manufacturing is costly, and it will take time for Intel to see returns on its hefty investment. However, plans to prioritize opening plants in the U.S. could see it gain some of tech's most prominent players as clients.\n\nIntel's stock is trading at about 28 times its forward earnings, making it a significantly better value than fellow chipmakers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices. And with solid growth opportunities across tech, Intel is a company that could make you a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAfter a stellar growth year, it's hard not to be bullish about Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The company is up by nearly all accounts since the start of 2023, as seen in the chart below. AMZN Chart\n\nAmazon has enjoyed immense growth in its stock price, quarterly revenue, operating income, and free cash flow. And yet, its price-to-sales ratio of about 3 suggests it remains a bargain buy.\n\nThe company has benefited from an impressive turnaround in its e-commerce business after an economic downturn in 2022 led to steep declines. Easing inflation and strategic cost-cutting measures have paid off for Amazon and illustrated its ability to navigate tricky market conditions successfully.\n\nIn its first quarter of 2024 (ended in March), Amazon's revenue increased by 13%, outperforming Wall Street estimates by $750 million. Its retail segments posted similar sales growth between 10% and 12%. Meanwhile, operating income between its North American and international divisions hit a combined $6 billion, significantly improving on the $349 million in losses it experienced the previous year.\n\nAmazon has become a household name worldwide thanks to its success in online retail. While it remains a promising part of the company's business, Amazon's role in cloud computing makes its stock a potential millionaire-maker. The tech giant's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), posted revenue gains of 17% year over year in its latest quarter. Meanwhile, operating income nearly doubled as it hit over $9 billion, outperforming profits from Amazon's entire retail business.\n\nAWS is investing billions into expanding its AI offerings and has the cash to continue doing so well into the future. The company has become one of the biggest threats in the budding AI market, which will likely boost earnings for years.\n\nAs a result, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer and could make you a millionaire as the company continues to thrive in e-commerce and develop its position in AI.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "We recently published a list of Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. Since Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhen the AI revolution started with the launch of ChatGPT, investors started pouring money into a handful of companies that are leading AI technology development, thanks to their industry position and unending free cash flows. Market analysts soon started pointing to the concentration of gains phenomena in the market, where just a few stocks accounted for most of the broader market gains. This tech concentration remains strong as of today, as all important AI and Cloud technologies that we see in the news are developed, acquired or marketed by mega-cap tech companies we’re all familiar with.\n\nBig Ten AI Stocks\n\nBank of America analyst Michael Hartnett recently said in a report that the S&P 500 has gained about 12% so far in the year, but if we remove 10 technology companies from the equation, these gains shrink to just 3.6%. Hartnett calls these companies the “AI Big Ten” group.\n\nWhat about the Magnificent Seven group of stocks that kept making headlines in 2023 and early 2024? Hartnett calculated that the broader market gained just 4.9% so far this year if these seven stocks are taken out of the equation. There is a third group of stocks that most investors are unaware of: Hedge Fund Top 30. These 30 stocks include the Magnificent Seven as well as 23 other promising stocks. These 30 stocks returned 53.2% in 2023, 20.2% during the first 5 months of 2024 vs. 11% for the S&P’s large cap index. You can check out the latest list here: 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at the Big 10 AI stocks Bank of America analyst Michael Hartnett highlighted in his report. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors, as of the end of the March quarter. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon, is AMZN a good stock to buy, NASDAQ:AMZN, Tony Hsieh, Zappos, Jeffrey Sonnenfeld, Matt Britton, Holacracy, hypocrisy, order, management,\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is one of the top AI stocks and BofA’s Michael Hartnett counted the ecommerce and Cloud giant among his list of the Big 10 AI stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nMar Vista Strategic Growth Strategy stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates. Should the economic climate continue to improve, we believe Amazon’s investment potential aligns with its projected 15-20% intrinsic value growth trajectory.”\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled Forget Magnificent 7: Analysts are Talking About ‘Big 10’ AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT:Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Here’s what Target needs to do to get its act together",
        "content": "Target (TGT) has to clean up its operational aisles if it's to close the financial gap with surging rival Walmart (WMT).\n\n\"I'm worried about Target getting its act together,\" said retail expert and investor Jeff Macke on Yahoo Finance's 'Opening Bid' podcast (video above; listen in here).\n\nMacke knows a thing or two about the history of Target.\n\nHis father was Kenneth A. Macke, the former chairman and CEO of mall operator Dayton Hudson — the forerunner of Target. The elder Macke rose from sales trainee to chairman and CEO of Target, then a division inside of Dayton Hudson.\n\nHe went on to lead the entire company over the span of a 33-year career, and is seen as the creator of modern day Target.\n\nThe younger Macke vividly recalls going up and down Target aisles with his dad to spot potential operational troubles and opportunities. He was maniacal about efficient operations, Macke recalls.\n\nBut the Target of today continues to endure some challenges.\n\nIn May, the company reported a surprise earnings miss for the first quarter. Chairman and CEO Brian Cornell cited cost-inflated food and household essentials as culprits, adding that inflation was “putting a strain on the consumer wallet.”\n\nWhile consumers sleuthed out cost-effective staples like bread, eggs, and milk, interest in discretionary items wavered once more.\n\nTo remedy shifting consumer demands, Target has begun lowering prices on consumer staples, with around 5,000 items up for discount by year-end. This move could boost foot traffic, encourage longer browsing, and hopefully result in more sales.\n\nMacke offers up a few other suggestions to Target execs.\n\nFirst, manage the shrink — or retail theft — factor.\n\nAccording to a report by the National Retail Federation (NRF), the average shrink rate rose to 1.6% in fiscal 2022, up from 1.4% in fiscal 2021. “When taken as a percentage of total retail sales in 2022, that shrink represents $112.1 billion in losses,” wrote the NRF.\n\nTarget execs said throughout 2023 that shrink had damaged profit margins substantially. Another effect of theft includes stolen goods being offloaded by third-party sellers.\n\nMacke said Target became, well, an easy target in this frenzy. As “the friendliest discount store, it was not a setup that prepared them for that rampant shopping spree.”\n\nThe company needs to cultivate a cheerful shopping environment that deters theft, added Macke. Locking away items and putting entire aisles of merchandise behind plastic might not be the best way, but take inspiration from Costco (COST), which uses associates to check guests in and out seamlessly.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile executing on this, Target needs to stay inclusive and mindful — but also practical.\n\nCompared to the Pride launch that received its own Wikipedia entry last year, it’s been a pretty mellow June for Target. Recall in 2023, the release and the company’s response to consumers put it in hot water with conservatives and liberals alike.\n\nAs Target looks forward, Macke said the retailer should aim to execute well on its core competencies, and continue to build out its Circle rewards program.\n\nIn April, Target launched Circle 360, a membership program that costs $99 a year. The program offers unlimited free same-day delivery for orders over $35 in as little as one hour, among other perks.\n\nIt competes with Amazon (AMZN) Prime and Walmart+ paid membership programs.\n\n\"That's where Walmart has separated itself,\" Macke said of Walmart+.\n\nWell there and its financials and stock price.\n\nTarget's same store sales dropped 3.7% year over year in Q1, compared to a 3.8% gain for Walmart. While Target's earnings fell 1% in the quarter, Walmart's popped 22%.\n\nOver the past year, Target shares are up 7%, underperforming the S&P 500's (^GSPC) 25% gain. Walmart's stock has jumped 32%.\n\n\"We think Target can turn traffic positive and ultimately get margins to 6%. It’s a question of how long, the investment needed to get there, and what the market should pay for it. Walmart still appears to have the share gaining momentum to us,\" said Evercore ISI analyst Greg Melich in a client note.\n\nThe buy now, pay later industry continues to change how consumers pay for goods and services. Affirm (AFRM) co-founder and CEO Max Levchin shares what his company is up to with Apple (AAPL) on this front on the 'Opening Bid' podcast.

        "content": "Finding solid stocks to buy is vital for portfolio growth and stability in today’s adverse market environment. Businesses at the forefront of data management, infrastructure solutions and technical innovation provide attractive prospects as industries change quickly.\n\nHere are three exceptional businesses poised to benefit from significant market developments and game-changing technologies, set for a massive bull run driven by the rise of data centers and the increasing demand for computing power.\n\nIndeed, these companies’ contributions are reshaping their respective industries. They span fast technological advancements that power artificial intelligence (AI)-based data centers and electric vehicle (EV) chargers to strategic international market expansions, customized solutions for major enterprises, and dominance in hyper-converged infrastructure solutions for large enterprises. Those looking for solid stocks in 2024 should focus on these companies’ capacity for advancement, market expansion and value-added solution delivery.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOverall, these companies demonstrate resilience and growth potential in a very competitive field by maximizing data storage capacity, improving energy efficiency or simplifying IT systems.\n\nNavitas (NVTS) a machine manufactures semiconductor chips in a factory setting. AI Semiconductor Stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNavitas (NASDAQ:NVTS) specializes in advanced semiconductor solutions. The company has taken the lead in important areas. These include industrial applications, solar inverters, EV chargers and AI-based data centers. Higher efficiency and power capabilities in these industries have been made possible largely by adopting their Gen-3 Fast silicon carbide and GaN (gallium nitride) technology.\n\nFor instance, improvements in the company’s GaNSafe technology will allow clients to raise the efficiency of the server power supply from 96% to 97% by the end of the year. The company wants to reach 8 to 10 kilowatt capacity.\n\nAdditionally, in several areas and sectors, Navitas has greatly increased the number of its clients and the pipeline of projects. Partnerships with significant organizations such as Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, and top automakers for electric vehicle (EV) applications are examples of specific engagements. Since December 2023, the pipeline of possible EV-related projects has risen by more than 50%, with $400 million in deals.\n\nTo sum up, Navitas’ lead in these high-growth sectors to benefit from the global push towards energy efficiency and electrification makes it a compelling choice among top stocks to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nData Storage (DTST) The word value is written in the clouds over a blue sky.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nData Storage (NASDAQ:DTST) provides data management and cloud solutions. By integrating CloudFirst and its flagship subsidiaries, the company has increased efficiency, better leveraged technical teams and improved operations. Along with improving internal resource allocation, this strategic decision increases the potential of the company’s client base for cross-selling and upselling.\n\nAdditionally, with the launch of a CloudFirst office in London, Data Storage has begun its global development. The company increased its operational area by over 40% without significantly raising costs. This was when the company moved to a new and expanded headquarters in Melville, N.Y. Hence, their growth plan is supported by this expansion, which can handle more technical, sales and marketing projects.\n\nFurther, Data Storage now serves over 450 firms and it is growing both its clientele and its market share. In Q1 2024, Data Storage signed important contracts, including extending an agreement with a global telecommunications firm and obtaining a new agreement with one of the biggest insurance providers in the U.S.\n\nOverall, Data Storage’s extended market reach and ability to secure significant contracts with major multinational firms make it a top mark on the stocks to buy list.\n\nNutanix (NTNX) An image of a blue and green \"Nutanix\" logo on the front of a tan building, a row of windows below the sign, and the blue sky in the background.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe cloud computing company Nutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) is a leader in hyper-converged infrastructure solutions and offers cloud software and services to large enterprises. Nutanix signed important agreements, including a large renewal and expansion with a Fortune 500 consumer packaged goods provider and an eight-figure annual contract value (ACV) contract with a Fortune 50 financial services business.\n\nAdditionally, these wins demonstrate Nutanix’s capacity to join and grow big companies, demonstrating the strength of its product appeal and edge over competitors. The pipeline for prospects with an ACV of more than $1 million has expanded significantly, indicating a growth in business clients’ interest in Nutanix products.\n\nMoreover, in Q3 2024, the company exceeded the projected range of around 85% to achieve a non-GAAP gross margin of 86.5%. In Q3, the non-GAAP operating margin exceeded the projected range of 7.5% to 8.5% by a substantial margin, reaching 14%. Higher revenue, improved gross margin performance, and decreased operational costs –including one-time gains from partnership agreements — were the main drivers of this increase.\n\nTo conclude, Nutanix’s ability to secure substantial contracts, strong market position, and attractiveness in the cloud computing and infrastructure sectors support its presence as one of the top stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

This is thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYear to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\n\nNvidia first crossed a $1trn market cap on June 13, 2023. The company's advance from a $1trn to a $3trn market cap was the fastest on record.\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\n\nBerkeley (BKG.L)\n\nHousebuilder Berkeley was in the red this morning despite lifting its earnings outlook for the current financial year by 5% to £525m.\n\nIt was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index as it reported a pre-tax profit of £557m for the year to 30 April, down from £604m last year.\n\nThe company said that it would plunge back into the private rental market for the first time in a decade by launching a build-to rent arm to tackle the “severe shortage” of properties in and around London.\n\nBerkeley, which built 3,500 homes for private sale last year, will establish a build-to-rent business, which aims to create 4,000 homes in London and the south-east over the next decade.\n\nIt plans to develop the properties across 17 brownfield sites and launch a dedicated online platform to manage them.\n\nBerkeley said: \"The operating environment has become increasingly uncertain over recent years as a high number of well-intended regulatory and policy changes came into effect.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This contributed to a marked decrease in private and affordable homebuilding activity, with SME developers and housing associations particularly impacted.\n\n\"This significant decline in housing delivery has been acknowledged by policymakers at all levels and triggered a renewed focus on addressing barriers within the regulatory and planning system.\"\n\nRead more: UK inflation drops to Bank of England's 2% target\n\nGames Workshop (GAW.L)\n\nWarhammer maker Games Workshop rallied 8% in London after it said it expects a jump in annual pre-tax profits to at least £200m compared to £171m a year earlier.\n\nThe maker of miniature figurines for tabletop battle games posted annual profits growth of at least 17%, following an acceleration in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nCore revenues came at above £490m for the 53 weeks to 2 June, up 10%, meanwhile, profit before tax is estimated to come in \"not less than £200m\", compared to £171m the year before.\n\nIn the first half of the year PBT grew 14% to £95.2m.\n\nIncluded in the profit estimate is the allowance for £18m of staff profit-share scheme, which is paid in cash on an equal basis to each employee, while £138m of dividends were shelled out and declared in the year, with 415p per share paid out.\n\nJust Eat (JET.L)\n\nShares in Just Eat rose more than 2% on Wednesday amid news that it has joined forces with Amazon (AMZN) in Germany, Austria and Spain.\n\nEurope's biggest food delivery firm said the move will allow it to offer free delivery of food orders above 15 euros ($16.13).\n\nThe deal, which marks its first collaboration with Amazon in Europe, comes with no financial terms to the partnership meaning it was \"mutually beneficial\" for both companies.\n\nThe initial deal between the two companies was struck in mid-2022.\n\nLast month, Amazon said its customers in the US can order from Just Eat-owned Grubhub directly on its shopping app and the website, extending a deal that already offers its Prime members a no-fee access to Grubhub+ membership.\n\nJamil Ghani, vice president at Amazon Prime, said: \"Giving Prime members no delivery fees from restaurants on Just Eat Takeaway.com is another way we help members save money every day.\n\n\"The value of a Prime membership continues to grow with this offer, and now is the best time to enjoy the convenience, savings, entertainment – and deliciousness – that the membership provides.\"\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Get ready. You are about to discover three tech stocks to buy that have not participated in the broader tech sector’s upward momentum in 2024.\n\nAs a result, we believe these tech shares offer significant long-term profit potential. Year-to-date (YTD), the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has advanced over 17%. Now it hovers near all-time highs. Tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have led the rally. However, a number of tech stocks have been left behind.\n\nAs a result, these overlooked companies currently trade at a discount, providing attractive entry points for long-term investors. Despite the recent share price weakness, many of these companies have strong profitability metrics and positive analyst outlooks. With that information, let’s explore three tech stocks to buy, worthy of your attention in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) technology heavyweight Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is first. The company’s Customer 360 platform brings companies and customers together. It offers a range of services from sales and service to marketing and commerce. Many of our readers follow CRM stocks as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30.\n\nRecently, Salesforce reported financial results for Q1 of fiscal year 2025. The company delivered $9.13 billion in revenue, an 11% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Subscription and support revenue, a significant component of Salesforce’s business, grew by 12%.\n\nHowever, investors were not pleased Salesforce’s metrics fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. This was the first time since 2006 that Salesforce missed revenue expectations. Investors were concerned about Salesforce potentially being left behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Yet, InvestorPlace.com contributor Alex Sirois has recently reported on this. Salesforce management has been investing in the AI safety and research company Anthropic, known for its large language model (LLM) Claude.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce has been actively pursuing strategic deals and partnerships to enhance its offerings and expand its reach. One notable development has been the creation of the Zero Copy Partner Network. This includes major tech players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), privately-held Databricks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, CRM stock has declined over 12%. The shares are trading at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.4x and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.2x. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains optimistic with a 12-month median target that signals a 30% upside potential.\n\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic design and test solutions provider Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) makes electronic equipment, instruments and components segments. It serves customers in a wide range of industries, including communications, government, automotive, industrial and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Q2 of 2024, Keysight Technologies reported revenue of $1.216 billion. Although the number was above the high end of their guidance, it represented a 13-14% decline on a core basis compared to the previous year. Orders for the quarter were $1.219 billion, down 8-9%. Looking ahead, Keysight’s management expects Q3 revenues to be between $1.180 billion and $1.200 billion.\n\nAlso, Keysight Technologies has been active in expanding its capabilities and market reach. Recently, the firm was designated as a technical service provider for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in automotive cybersecurity and software regulations. Also, management introduced a pulse generator software for its FieldFox handheld analyzers, supporting numerous advanced applications.\n\nSince January, KEYS stock has lost around 14%. Currently, it is changing hands at 23.3 times forward earnings and 4.6 times sales. Despite the decline in Keysight share price, analysts expect a potential advance of around 19% in the next 12 months.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, SkyworkSolutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in the design and manufacture of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors. The company serves various end markets, including mobile, automotive, industrial, infrastructure and the IOT.\n\nRecent earnings showed revenues of close to $1.05 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55. The gross margin for the quarter was 45%, down 140 basis points sequentially, reflecting the seasonally weakest period for SWKS.\n\nLooking ahead, Skyworks Solutions expects revenue of $900 million for the June quarter. And the gross margin is projected to improve to 45-47%, with further expansion anticipated in the remainder of 2024.\n\nSkyworks Solutions has been actively expanding its pipeline and initiating new programs. For instance, management has secured several audio system-on-chip (SoC) designs with major players like Sony Group (NYSE:SONY)  and Samsung Electronics. Recently, it has also showcased several AI-enabled phones, highlighting the potential for AI to drive a meaningful replacement cycle in the smartphone market.\n\nYTD, SWKS shares are down over 5% and are changing hands at 17.9 times forward earnings and 3.7 times sales. Investors could regard any potential dip in SWKS stock as an opportunity to invest for the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Russell 2000 Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Small-cap stocks tend to outperform their larger brethren over time. Coming out of the pandemic, the Russell 2000 small-cap index was handily beating the barometer of the 500 largest stocks on the market.\n\nHowever, after government spending caused inflation to rise to its highest levels in 40 years, the Federal Reserve enacted an unprecedented series of 11 hikes in interest rates. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed Funds rate rose from 0% to between 5.25% and 5.50%, where it stands today.\n\nThe effect was devastating on small-cap stocks. Because small companies don’t have the same financial resources as their large-cap stocks, their borrowing costs soar, causing a hit to their bottom line. It took a toll on businesses. The Russell 2000 went from matching the performance of the S&P 500 throughout 2022 to falling behind beginning in March 2023.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOver the past 15 months, the broad market index returned more than 25% compared to just 7.4% for their smaller cousins. This year the Russell 2000 is basically at break-even, while the S&P 500 is up 15%.\n\nBut the following seven Russell 2000 stocks to buy now hold the promise of not only outperforming their index but also their bigger siblings.\n\nPaysafe (PSFE) Paysafe (PSFE) Card Apple Store Apps on Iphone Screen on a Wooden Summer Floor with Aces Card and Green Climbing Plants\n\nSource: Devina Saputri / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayments processor for the entertainment industry Paysafe (NYSE:PSFE) is the first small-cap stock to buy. Almost a year ago I highlighted it as a company to consider for a breakout performance.\n\nAlthough the payments space is crowded with larger, better-financed peers like PayPal Holdings (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block (NYSE:SQ). Paysafe reorganized its business and zeroed in on a niche market. It primarily targets online sports, casino games, poker and video gaming, as well as the hospitality industry and cryptocurrencies.\n\nI noted Paysafe’s business was gaining traction and its stock is up 43% since then. Its shares trade under $18, up 38% this year alone. And PSFE stock is still a bargain. Wall Street forecasted earnings to grow 163.8% next year, and shares go for just 17x forward p/e earnings. It also trades at a fraction of its sales and an incredible 3x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces.\n\nAnalysts have a $25.02 per share one-year price target on the stock, implying 43% more upside, and Paysafe stock may not stop there.\n\nQXO (QXO) A hexagonal grid with different tech-related icons; Tech stocks illustration. Best Tech stocks. tech stocks trading at bargain prices\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock\n\nBradley Jacobs has the golden touch. He might not be a household name, but he is brilliantly successful as a serial kingmaker. Jacobs took United Rentals (NYSE:URI) from a small equipment rental company to the national stage by buying up smaller rental shops. He did the same thing with United Waste Systems until he sold it to trash-hauling giant Waste Management (NYSE:WM) for $2.5 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nJacobs also turned Express-1 Expedited Solutions into the massive logistics powerhouse known as XPO Logistics (NYSE:XPO). He subsequently spun off both RXO (NYSE:RXO) and GXO Logistics (NYSE:GXO) from XPO, respectively, turning them into some of the largest trucking and logistics businesses in their own right. Now he is doing it again.\n\nJacobs recently invested $1 billion in SilverSun Technologies and rebranded it as QXO (NYSE:QXO). I’m sensing a pattern here. He is breaking into the $800 billion building products distribution market and will use his proven strategy of rolling up the industry under QXO’s umbrella. Jacobs said he expects “to achieve a revenue run-rate of at least $1 billion by the end of year one, at least $5 billion within three years, and tens of billions of dollars over the next decade.”\n\nAs everything Jacobs touches turns to gold, I expect he will be wildly successful with QXO. What happens when he runs out of letters to tack onto his companies, however, remains to be seen.\n\nRackspace Technology (RXT) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nCloud computing platform Rackspace Technology (NASDAQ:RXT) is benefiting from the rush by businesses to put their data in the cloud. It is also enhanced by the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), giving its hybrid and multi-cloud platform greater resonance with customers.\n\nAlmost exactly one year ago, it launched a new AI unit called Foundry for Generative AI by Rackspace (FAIR). Its purpose was to provide a comprehensive set of generative AI solutions across multiple cloud computing platforms. It then partnered with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to give Rackspace customers access to Google Cloud’s portfolio of generative AI tools.\n\nRackspace Technology is a company in transition as it stumbled when competing against the likes of Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as cloud services grew. It considered going private in 2022 but couldn’t find a buyer. It ultimately reorganized itself into a services-led sales business and is now gaining traction.\n\nAlthough sales were down year-over-year (YOY), it handily beat estimates, and the stock is marching higher. Shares are up 26% this year and have more than doubled from their 52-week low. Rackspace Technology is proving it has more growth in the cards.\n\nTutor Perini (TPC) An image of a blurry magnifying glass lens focusing on a screen displaying a white box with a grey top outline and a green bottom outline with the text \"Tutor Perini\" in a grey and green font.\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nTutor Perini (NYSE:TPC) is the third-largest construction and engineering firm in the country behind its two better-known peers Jacobs Solutions (NYSE:J) and AECOM (NYSE:ACM). Yet, at a market cap of just $1.1 billion, it is one-tenth the size. It generated $3.9 billion in revenue last year or about one-tenth of what Jacobs produces in one quarter.\n\nBusiness is booming, though. Revenue surged 35% in the first quarter to $1.05 billion, and its backlog of projects grew to $10 billion, up 26% year over year. It forecasts equally strong backlog growth for the full year and all of 2025.\n\nSpurred, in part, by the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, Tutor Perini has been winning contracts for complex megaprojects that other contractors can’t handle and don’t bid on. That allows it to demand partial payment of the contracts upfront, forcing the client to finance the cost of labor and materials from Day 1. It helped the construction and engineering firm post a $15.8 million profit in the first quarter compared to a $49 million loss a year ago.\n\nTutor Perini stock is up 136% so far this year and has tripled over the last 12 months. Despite the gains, with such a backlog of projects in the pipeline, TPC stock can build on its gains and grow even more.\n\nRocky Brands (RCKY) A photograph of a person running along the side of a road.\n\nSource: It for you / Shutterstock.com\n\nFootwear manufacturer Rocky Brands (NASDAQ:RCKY) owns well-known shoe and boot brands, including its namesake banner Rocky, Georgia Boot, Durango and the Original Muck Boot Company. It is another stock trying to make a turnaround, and there are signs it may be successful.\n\nRocky reported first-quarter earnings in May that showed a 2.2% rise in sales to $113 million on a GAAP basis. On an adjusted basis, though, excluding the Servus brand it divested in March 2023, revenues jumped 7.6%. Even better, operating profits surged 90% YOY to $8 million. That led to net profits of $2.6 million or 34 cents per share. It was a big reversal from the losses recorded in the year-ago period.\n\nThe footwear maker spent most of 2023 shoring up its financials by reducing inventories and paying down debt. Rocky Brands is now in a much better position than last year or even at the start of 2024. The market is starting to catch on to its resurgence, and shares are up 26% this year. Rocky Brands stock is 81% over the last 12 months and has more than tripled from its 52-week low.\n\nNow that it has greater freedom of movement, expect Rocky Brands to take it to the next level.\n\nConsol Energy (CEIX) A man holds coal in his hands over a pile of more coal.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nFew industries have been as vilified as coal, and politicians have been promising to bankrupt producers for years. Over the past decade, the number of coal-fired power plants was cut in half. The Energy Information Administration says 557 coal plants were operating in 2012 but fell to 242 in 2022, the last year data is available.\n\nDespite coal being a cheap and plentiful source of energy, policies prefer so-called cleaner forms, primarily natural gas. That has weighed on coal producers like Consol Energy (NYSE:CEIX), which operates the largest underground coal mine in the United States. Consol’s Pennsylvania Mining Complex is really a series of three underground mines.\n\nConsol also operates a marine terminal in the Port of Baltimore. The port was recently in the news because of a cargo ship that rammed the bridge spanning the waterway, causing it to collapse and block ocean-going traffic.\n\nThat was hard for Consol because its coal shipments bound for international markets ship from there. But the waterway was reopened in May, and Consol began moving coal once again.\n\nAlthough Consol stock is down 5% year-to-date, shares are up 55% from their 12-month lows and will be steaming higher still.\n\nImmersion (IMMR) IMMR stock: two people using virtual reality (VR) headsets\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBefore the arrival of artificial intelligence, one of the premier technologies people considered was haptics, or the ability to use touch to provide sensory feedback to technology users. The digital keyboard on your smartphone, for example, is possible because of haptics, as are the vibrations it emits when someone calls. Immersion (NASDAQ:IMMR) is one of the leading providers of haptics technology that it licenses to some of the biggest names in tech today.\n\nMost recently, Immersion renewed its license agreement with Samsung for its devices. Previously it did so with Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) for use in their respective gaming systems, hardware, software and virtual reality products. Because haptics is so ubiquitous and commonplace, we hardly even consider it anymore. One day, AI will likely be the same.\n\nImmersion’s first-quarter revenue soared to almost $44 million from $7 million last year. While not even the company expects that kind of performance to repeat, chairman and CEO Eric Singer says, “Immersion is operating from a position of strength as we work to protect and monetize our intellectual property.”\n\nProfits also more than doubled during the quarter to 59 cents per share from 25 cents. Immersion made its seventh quarterly dividend payment of 4.5 cents. Shares are up 54% in 2024, but almost all of the gains came since May 1. Trading just under $11 a share, Immersion stock is an affordable entry into this newly strengthened tech player.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "The transportation industry is one that will always exist, and there will never be a time when it will not grow. People are always looking to travel more efficiently, and the push for innovation will continue. Transportation stocks are the types that investors can feel comfortable to buy now for the long term. The global transportation services market, valued at $7.31 trillion in 2022, is expected to double to around $15.94 trillion by 2032, reflecting a robust CAGR of 8.11%. The transportation industry has seen challenges this year regarding supply chains, as auto production has been delayed and freight has been paused due to labor shortages.\n\nHowever, the companies I recommend below have healthy financials and the potential to dominate their respective markets. They have consistently shown financial performance despite the macroeconomic headwinds facing them. Lets take a look at three of the best transportation stocks to buy now.\n\nFord Motor Company (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the largest U.S. automakers, and was the first to mass-produce vehicles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s stock is down 2.55% year-to-date (YTD) as its losses have widened due to the price war in the EV market. In addition, Ford has faced shipments delays.\n\nHowever, Ford reported $42.8 billion in revenue for Q1 2024, a 3% increase year-over-year (YOY) despite fewer shipments. The Ford Pro segment outperformed by growing over 36% YOY to $18 billion. In addition, it saw its software subscriptions growing 43% YOY.\n\nFord’s famous brand, primarily the F-150, is the equivalent of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Its popularity helps Ford grow even during tough times for the company. In addition, its rapid growth of software subscriptions represents a new revenue stream and promises higher margins compared to its labor-intensive manufacturing business.\n\nUber Technology (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom a simple ride-share application, Uber Technology (NYSE:UBER) has expanded to food delivery and freight transportation. Its stock is up over 20% YTD due to strong revenue growth and increased profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024 its revenue increased by 15% YOY to $10.13 billion. It showed strong profitability as adjusted EBITDA increased by 82% to $1.3 billion. It’s generating strong cash flow for investors, with free cash flow multiplying from $986 million to $4.17 billion in just a year.\n\nOne of the critical catalysts is Uber’s partnership with Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), which allows Uber’s deliveries to compete in the grocery delivery market. The U.S. market is expected to be worth $65.51 billion in 2031 and grow at a 9.31% CAGR from 2024. This partnership gives Uber at least 21.6% market share, just below Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With Uber’s large base of existing delivery drivers, the partnership makes Uber a formidable competitor in a fast-growing market.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnion Pacific Corp (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.\n\nSource: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnion Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP) is a major owner of freight railroads in America. They are vital to the U.S. economy and move one third of all U.S. exports. Its stock is down over 9% this year due to decreased coal shipments and a soft economy.\n\nUnion Pacific Corp maintains a strong position in the U.S. freight industry with a 34.94% market share. The company pioneers itself as the second largest railroad in the U.S., sharing a duopoly with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. This has helped Union Pacific maintain its revenues and margins to outperform the rest of the sector.\n\nOperating income for Q1 2024 was $2.4 billion, up 3% YOY. Revenue declined by 1%, and net income increased by 1% YOY. Overall, despite headwinds, management has been strong in maintaining its financials.\n\nUnion Pacific Corp plans to invest $3.4 billion to upgrade its older trains to improve efficiency, maintain infrastructure and expand to newer high-growth areas. As a company with such a rich history and assets of rail networks, it’s stock drop this year could mean it’s an opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "In case you haven't noticed, Wall Street is in the midst of a full-fledged bull market. But it hasn't always been this way.\n\nSince this decade began, the ageless Dow Jones Industrial Average, widely followed S&P 500, and growth stock-powered Nasdaq Composite have flip-flopped between bear and bull markets in successive years, through 2023. Though these periods of volatility and uncertainty are unavoidable, the current bull market speaks to the power of time as an ally. With every correction and bear market throughout history eventually (key word!) getting put into the back seat by a bull market rally, it means any time can be ideal for long-term-minded investors to put their money to work. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFurthermore, online brokers have made it easier than ever for retail investors to grow their wealth on Wall Street. In recent years, they've eliminated minimum deposit requirements and commission fees on common stock trades completed on major U.S. exchanges. In other words, any amount of money -- even $500 -- can be the perfect amount to invest.\n\nIf you have $500, a long-term mindset, and are certain this isn't cash you're going to need to pay bills or cover emergency expenses, the following three stocks stand out as no-brainer buys right now.\n\nAmazon\n\nThe first astounding business that's begging to be bought with $500 right now is none other than e-commerce leader Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN).\n\nMost people are familiar with Amazon because it's the company behind the largest online marketplace in the world. In 2023, it's estimated that its e-commerce site accounted for almost 38% of domestic online retail sales. While this would, presumably, expose the company to downside during a U.S. recession, Amazon's online marketplace isn't as important to the company's bottom line as you might think.\n\nThe bulk of Amazon's operating income and cash flow derives from three of its considerably faster-growing and higher-margin segments, none of which is more important than Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nAWS entered 2024 holding a 31% share of the global cloud infrastructure service market. Businesses are continuing to shift a higher percentage of their information technology spending to the cloud, which bodes well for AWS. During the March-ended quarter, AWS surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales.\n\nThe other two segments of importance for Amazon are subscription services and advertising services. With Amazon attracting around 2.5 billion visitors to its website each month, it shouldn't come as a surprise that advertising services are growing by a sustained double-digit percentage.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon possesses exceptional pricing power with its Prime subscription. Prime is a powerful tool that helps to keep subscribers within its product and service ecosystem.\n\nSince Amazon reinvests most of its operating cash flow back into its business, cash flow is a far better measure than the traditional price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio to determine if the stock is a good \"value.\" As of the closing bell on June 17, Amazon was trading at roughly 12 times estimated cash flow for 2025. That's considerably lower than the 23 to 37 times cash flow investors willingly paid to own Amazon stock throughout the 2010s, and demonstrates what an incredible value it is right now.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties\n\nA second no-brainer stock that makes for a surefire buy right now is real estate investment trust (REIT) Innovative Industrial Properties(NYSE: IIPR), or \"IIP\" for short. Since initiating a quarterly dividend seven years ago, IIP's payout has grown by a jaw-dropping 1,167%, and its yield has surged to north of 7%.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties is just like any other REIT, with one key twist. It aims to lease its properties for extended periods to (drum roll) cannabis companies. IIP acquires and leases medical marijuana cultivation and processing facilities, often with the goal of leasing these assets for 10 to 20 years.\n\nAdmittedly, marijuana stocks lost their buzz shortly after President Joe Biden took office. The industry had been expecting meaningful reforms, but had these hopes dashed over the last two years. The good news for cannabis stocks is that the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency has proposed shifting marijuana to a Schedule III drug, which could brighten the horizons of the entire industry.\n\nThere are a couple of factors that make Innovative Industrial Properties special. The obvious is that its rental income is predictable. The company's weighted-average remaining lease term on the more than 100 properties it owns is nearly 15 years. Further, it's been able to rework master lease agreements or dispose of certain properties in the rare instances where tenants have been delinquent.\n\nAnother reason investors can trust IIP is the company's lease structure. As of the end of March, 95.2% of its operating portfolio was triple-net leased (also known as \"NNN-leased\"). Triple-net leases require tenants to cover virtually all property expenses, including maintenance, insurance, and utility costs. Removing these unknown expenses from the equation makes IIP's adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) all the more predictable.\n\nInnovative Industrial Properties has also successfully leaned on its sale-leaseback program to expand its lease portfolio. With this program, IIP purchases properties for cash and immediately leases them back to the seller. It's a way for cannabis companies to get their hands on cash without having to rely on traditional financing methods. Meanwhile, it provides a steady source of AFFO expansion for IIP. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nJohnson & Johnson\n\nThe third no-brainer stock that makes for a genius buy with $500 right now is Dow component and healthcare juggernaut Johnson & Johnson(NYSE: JNJ). Johnson & Johnson, which is best-known as \"J&J,\" has raised its base annual dividend for 62 consecutive years and is parsing out a yield (3.4%) that's well over twice the average yield of the S&P 500.\n\nIf you're looking for a good reason why J&J has underperformed in the current bull market, outstanding litigation concerning its now-discontinued talcum-based baby powder is the answer. The company is facing in the neighborhood of 100,000 lawsuits that allege this talcum-based baby powder causes cancer. J&J has, on two separate occasions, unsuccessfully attempted to settle this litigation.\n\nWhile legal overhangs are never good news, Johnson & Johnson is generating plenty of operating cash flow, and it has more than enough cash on its balance sheet to cover whatever the final settlement might be. J&J is, after all, one of only two publicly traded companies to still bear the highest possible credit rating (AAA) from Standard & Poor's.\n\nWhat's made Johnson & Johnson such a phenomenal investment for so long is its consistency. As an example, its management team has purposely shifted the company's focus to high-margin pharmaceuticals. Aggressively reinvesting in internal drug development and collaborations ensures that J&J won't be a victim of the patent cliff.\n\nManagement has also overseen an organic and acquisitive expansion of the company's medical technologies segment. As the global population ages and access to preventative care improves, demand for medical devices should climb.\n\nAs I've pointed out many times before, J&J's consistency at the top has led to sustained growth. Since its founding in 1886, the company has had just 10 CEOs. Not surprisingly, adjusted operating earnings grew for 35 consecutive years before being temporarily disrupted by the COVID-19 pandemic. Few businesses deliver consistent earnings growth quite Johnson & Johnson.\n\nThe final piece of the puzzle is that J&J stock is cheaper than it's been in at least a decade. Shares can be scooped up for roughly 13 times forward-year earnings, which represents a 16% discount to its average forward earnings multiple over the last five years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The California Labor Commissioner's Office has fined Amazon a total of $5.9 million on allegations the company violated a state law by working warehouse employees so hard that their safety was put at risk.\n\nThe two citations, which were issued in May, said Amazon.com Services LLC violated the state's Warehouse Quota Law at facilities in Riverside and San Bernardino counties, the labor commissioner's office said Tuesday in a press release.\n\nAmazon was fined $1.2 million at a warehouse in Redlands and $4.7 million at another warehouse in Moreno Valley.\n\nThe Warehouse Quota Law, enacted in 2022, requires warehouse employers to provide employees with written notice of any quotas they are expected to follow, including how many tasks they need to complete per hour and any discipline that could result from not meeting the requirements, the labor commissioner's office said.\n\nCALIFORNIA THIEVES TARGETING LEGO STORES FOR BLACK MARKET DEALS: 'LEGO LARCENY'\n\nAmazon said Tuesday that it denies the allegations from the state and has appealed the citations.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\n\"The truth is, we don't have fixed quotas,\" Amazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in a statement to The Associated Press. \"At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site’s team is performing. Employees can — and are encouraged to — review their performance whenever they wish. They can always talk to a manager if they’re having trouble finding the information.\"\n\nThe citations accuse Amazon of not providing written notice of quotas.\n\nThe labor commissioner's office said the law defines a quota as work that must be performed at a specified speed or the worker could face discipline. The law also puts limits on quotas that prevent compliance with meal or rest periods, use of bathroom facilities or compliance with occupational health and safety laws, according to the labor commissioner's office, which noted that a quota may be illegal if it is not disclosed to workers or prevents workers from exercising these statutory rights.\n\nLabor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower said Amazon used \"exactly the kind of system\" that the law was put in place to prevent.\n\n\"The peer-to-peer system that Amazon was using in these two warehouses is exactly the kind of system that the Warehouse Quotas law was put in place to prevent,\" she said in a statement. \"Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nSTEVE JOBS' WIDOW GRABS $94 MILLION CALIFORNIA LOT\n\nThe labor commissioner's office started its investigation in 2022 after employees at the two warehouses said they were facing unfair quota practices. The Warehouse Worker Resource Center, a nonprofit that advocates for improving working conditions, assisted the investigation.\n\n\"Amazon’s push for speed leads to high rates of injuries,\" Warehouse Worker Resource Center staff attorney Mindy Acevedo said in a statement. \"AB 701 provides important protections against dangerous work speeds and unfair quota practices, but these citations show Amazon failed to follow fundamental parts of the law.\"\n\n\"Courageous workers sounded the alarm about these violations and the Labor Commissioner took prompt action,\" Acevedo continued. \"We heard from workers that not only were they required to work at an unsafe pace, there was little transparency around work expectations and they could lose their jobs if they failed to meet these undisclosed quotas. Amazon workers are entitled to what AB 701 promises — fairness and transparency around quota expectations and a safe pace of work.\"\n\nSimilar laws have taken effect in other states, including Minnesota, New York, Oregon and Washington, the resource center said in a press release. In May, Sen. Edward Markey, D-Mass., introduced a warehouse worker protection bill in Congress.\n\nOriginal article source:California fines Amazon $6M for alleged violations of warehouse quota law at 2 warehouses\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Better Artificial Intelligence Stock: Nvidia vs. Amazon",
        "content": "Whether you're a casual investor or trade professionally, you're likely aware of the boom in the artificial intelligence (AI) market that has captivated Wall Street over the last year. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT toward the end of 2022 reinvigorated the industry and led countless companies to pivot their businesses toward AI.\n\nExcitement over the generative technology has led to companies across tech enjoying significant stock growth. Notable are Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), which have seen their share prices soar 222% and 45%, respectively, since last June. These companies have achieved powerful positions in AI, with one leading the chip market and the other excelling in software.\n\nDespite recent growth, these companies likely still have much more to offer new investors, with the AI market projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030.\n\nSo, let's take a closer look at these tech giants and determine whether Nvidia or Amazon is the better stock to invest in AI this June.\n\nNvidia\n\nAfter soaring growth over the last year, Nvidia introduced a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10. The split has lowered its price per share, making now an attractive time to buy -- and multiple analysts seem to agree.\n\nArgus Research and Oppenheimer recently increased their price targets from $110 per share to $150, maintaining a buy rating. Meanwhile, Evercore ISI raised its target to $145 from $131, expressing a similar sentiment.\n\nDespite delivering record gains, Nvidia's powerful position in AI and tech in general indicates it's still nowhere near hitting its ceiling. The company maintains an estimated 90% market share in AI graphics processing units (GPUs) -- the chips necessary to train AI models. Meanwhile, chip demand is expected to rise for the foreseeable future as the AI market develops.\n\nMoreover, Nvidia is keeping up with the demand for powerful hardware and retaining its lead among competitors by making a change to its product release schedule. The company will now design new chips yearly rather than every two years, like was once customary.\n\nThe move has forced rivals like AMD to do the same. However, with $39 billion in free cash flow compared to AMD's just over $1 billion, Nvidia is better equipped to retain its lead in AI and keep investing in its business.\n\nAmazon\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon is leading its respective area of AI. The company is home to the world's largest cloud platform, Amazon Web Services, which outperforms competitors Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud in market share.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, Amazon has been able to leverage its extensive list of clientele to tout its AI products and get ahead in the industry. The company's success was evident in recent quarterly earnings. In the first quarter of 2024, AWS posted revenue growth of 17% year over year, with operating income soaring 84%. The segment has quickly become the most lucrative part of Amazon's business, responsible for 60% of its operating income.\n\nConsequently, Amazon is investing billions into expanding AWS' reach and building data centers in multiple countries, including Taiwan and India. Meanwhile, AWS has ventured into chip design, announcing its Trainium2 chips last year, built specifically for training AI models.\n\nAmazon's free cash flow has soared more than 1,000% since last June, while its operating income has increased by 99%. The figures highlight the reliability of Amazon's business and prove it has the financial resources to go far in AI.\n\nIs Nvidia or Amazon the better AI stock this June?\n\nNvidia and Amazon have delivered stellar gains thanks to AI, but they are likely not done yet. These companies continue to have massive growth potential in the industry and would likely prove to be assets to any portfolio over the long term. As a result, it could be a good idea to consider their valuations when determining which is the better buy. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart shows Amazon's stock is trading at a bargain compared to Nvidia's, with a lower price-to-sales and forward price-to-earnings ratio. In addition to a promising position in AI, Amazon is a no-brainer over Nvidia right now.

        "content": "California has fined Amazon nearly $6 million for violating a law meant to protect warehouse workers from misuse of production quotas, state officials announced Tuesday.\n\nThe $5.9 million in penalties, which were issued last month, stem from demands that the behemoth e-commerce company placed on thousands of workers at two of its Inland Empire fulfillment centers. The California Labor Commissioner’s Office found that managers at the facilities failed to provide employees with adequate explanations of quotas that they were expected to meet as they prepared orders for shipment.\n\nMindy Acevedo, staff attorney with the Warehouse Worker Resource Center, an advocacy group, said in a statement released Tuesday that \"these citations show Amazon failed to follow fundamental parts of the law.”\n\nThe law, AB 701, went into effect at the beginning of 2022 and requires that companies explain in writing the speed at which warehouse workers are expected to complete a certain amount of work as well as the discipline the company may impose for failure to meet the quotas. Under the law, an employee cannot be required to meet a quota that prevents them from taking meal or bathroom breaks and rest periods.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said in an email that the company plans to defend itself against the citations.\n\nRead more:Amazon says it will improve warehouse conditions\n\n“We disagree with the allegations made in the citations and have appealed. The truth is, we don’t have fixed quotas. At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site’s team is performing,\" Vogel said. \"Employees can — and are encouraged to — review their performance whenever they wish. They can always talk to a manager if they’re having trouble finding the information.”\n\nThe citations include penalties of more than $1.2 million at a warehouse in Redlands and nearly $4.7 million at one in Moreno Valley.\n\nThe fines imposed on Amazon are among the first issued by the Labor Commissioner’s Office for failing to provide written quota descriptions to its workers. Since September 2023, the office has handed down $7.8 million in penalties — a total that includes the Amazon fines, according to the Warehouse Worker Resource Center.\n\nThe enforcement comes after years of scrutiny over working conditions inside Amazon’s warehouses, including investigations by state and federal agencies into the company's safety practices. They also come as California has come under fire for failing to enforce labor laws around wage theft and other violations.\n\nLilia Garcia-Brower, the California Labor Commissioner, said Tuesday at a news conference in Ontario that Amazon had not been singled out for enforcement. Her office, she said, sent out hundreds of letters notifying companies of possible violations and followed up with inspections on companies that failed to respond or comply.\n\n\"We are not playing the game of gotcha here,\" Garcia-Brower said.\n\nGarcia-Bower said her office will defend the Amazon citation at an appeal hearing. She encouraged workers to reach out to worker centers and other community organizations for help.\n\n\"It is so important for workers to come together, understand it is the bad-faith employer who wants you to feel isolated and alone and unfamiliar with your rights.\"\n\nRead more:Two deaths at Amazon warehouses being investigated by OSHA\n\nAt the news conference, Veronica Kern, who has worked at Amazon for seven years, and currently sorts products and loads them onto conveyor belts at the Moreno Valley warehouse, said it “can be a stressful and intense place,” with managers publicly chastising workers when they decide they aren’t working fast enough.\n\nShe described her manager telling her she needed to work faster and that she was performing in the bottom 5% of workers. He would stand outside the bathroom and get workers to hurry back to work, she said.\n\n“They started treating us like a number rather than humans,” Kern said.\n\nKern recalled how managers would show workers real-time productivity data that they said showed them falling short of production targets, but often would not tell workers what those targets were, she said.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Daniel Wiessner\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon.com has been fined $5.9 million by a California labor regulator who says the online retail giant failed to properly inform workers of productivity quotas at two warehouses, including one where some workers are trying to unionize.\n\nThe office of California Labor Commissioner Lilia Garcia-Brower announced the fines, which were issued in May, on Tuesday.\n\nA 2022 California law requires employers to provide written descriptions of quotas to workers if they can be disciplined for failing to complete jobs at a specified speed. The commissioner said Amazon violated that law nearly 60,000 times in a five-month period ending in March at massive warehouses in Moreno Valley and Redlands, outside of Los Angeles.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said the company is appealing the citations and denied that warehouse workers have fixed quotas.\n\n\"At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site’s team is performing. Employees can – and are encouraged to – review their performance whenever they wish,\" Lynch Vogel said in a statement.\n\nCriticisms of Amazon's alleged quota system have been a focal point of a nationwide campaign to unionize its warehouses. Workers at a New York City warehouse voted to join a union in 2022, while others at two facilities in New York and Alabama have since spurned unions.\n\nA union in 2022 filed a petition to hold an election at the Moreno Valley warehouse, known as ONT8, which was later withdrawn amid allegations of illegal union-busting activity by Amazon. An administrative judge is scheduled to hold a hearing on those claims, which Amazon has denied, in August.\n\nGarcia-Brower in a statement said Amazon's quota system is exactly what the California law was designed to prevent.\n\n\"Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks,\" she said.\n\nCongress is considering a Democratic-backed bill that would largely mirror the California law by requiring written notice of quotas and prohibiting quotas that prevent workers from taking breaks or using bathrooms.\n\nSenator Ed Markey of Massachusetts, one of the bill's sponsors, said the fines against Amazon announced on Tuesday highlighted the need to crack down on \"punishing\" quota systems.\n\n\"We need more than a patchwork of state laws,\" Markey said in a statement.\n\n(Reporting by Daniel Wiessner in Albany, New York, Editing by Alexia Garamfalvi and Rod Nickel)\n\nView comments",

In May, U.S. Sen. Edward Markey, a Democrat from Massachusetts, introduced a federal version of the warehouse worker protection act in Congress.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It's possible that the Disney (DIS) CEO succession race ends before 2025.\n\n\"I think we may know this year, but [Bob Iger] has two and a half more years. So it wouldn't surprise me if it is extended a little bit beyond this calendar year into next calendar year,\" close adviser and Candle Media co-founder Kevin Mayer told Yahoo Finance at the Cannes Lions Festival on Tuesday.\n\nMayer is a former longtime Iger deputy, leading the launch of Disney+ before a brief stint as the CEO of TikTok.\n\nMayer, who said he has no exact date or specific insight into the process, added succession \"will be very clean and very good this time around.\"\n\n\"In the not-too-distant future, he's going to make it known who a successor is so he has some time to spend with him or her at the helm,\" predicted Mayer.\n\nThere are reportedly four internal candidates being considered for the coveted position, which Iger held from 2005 to 2020 before returning in November 2022: entertainment division co-chiefs Dana Walden and Alan Bergman, parks division head Josh D'Amaro, and ESPN chairman Jimmy Pitaro. Walden is seen as having a slight edge, but it's far from certain.\n\nThe company could also choose to go with an outside candidate.\n\nBut what all media experts agree on is that the process must be executed flawlessly, following a high-profile bungling last time, when former CEO Bob Chapek was fired in favor of bringing back Iger.\n\nAny new Disney CEO is getting a giant media ship contending with considerable change.\n\nDisney signaled it is closing in on profitability for all of its direct-to-consumer streaming services and networks, according to its fiscal second quarter earnings results.\n\nIt topped quarterly earnings estimates days after beating back an activist attack from Nelson Peltz, but consumer spending has slowed at its theme parks.\n\nThis comes as the company's linear TV networks are bleeding business to streamers like Netflix (NFLX) and Amazon (AMZN). The company is preparing to launch an unproven sports streaming business dubbed Venu Sports in the fall in partnership with Warner Bros Discovery (WBD) and Fox (FOX).\n\n\"While we are cautious on the media landscape due to pay TV sub losses and advertising headwinds, Disney is our favorite in the group due to the company’s unique content, improving streaming financials, and parks operation, which provides an avenue to attractively deploy capital,\" said JPMorgan analyst David Karnovsky in a client note.\n\n\"Challenges remain on the legacy side of the business, though we expect Disney can navigate this through more substantial cost savings at linear networks and novel distribution arrangements at ESPN.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Amazon.com Inc. was fined $5.9 million for failing to provide written work quotas to employees at two warehouses in Southern California, an escalation in regulatory penalties imposed on the online retailer in the wake of a new state law that took effect in 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n‘I Live in Hell’: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Nvidia’s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves Nvidia Becomes World’s Most Valuable Company as AI Rally Steams Ahead Stocks Rise as Bullish Nvidia Call Boosts AI Trade: Markets Wrap\n\nThe California Department of Industrial Relations issued two citations in May, alleging Amazon violated the state’s warehouse quota law. It requires companies to give workers written notice of productivity quotas — the number of tasks per hour required to avoid being disciplined. The state agency said Amazon failed to do this for employees at facilities in Moreno Valley and Redlands between October and March.\n\n“Undisclosed quotas expose workers to increased pressure to work faster and can lead to higher injury rates and other violations by forcing workers to skip breaks, ” State Labor Commissioner Lilia García-Brower said in a news release.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Maureen Lynch Vogel said the company has appealed the fines and disputes subjecting workers to quotas.\n\n“At Amazon, individual performance is evaluated over a long period of time, in relation to how the entire site’s team is performing,” she said. “Employees can – and are encouraged to – review their performance whenever they wish.”\n\nThe Seattle-based company has been fending off federal and state regulators for a variety of allegations regarding working conditions in its warehouses. The US government doesn’t regulate workplace quotas used to encourage employees to move quickly. So California, Minnesota, Oregon, Washington and New York have enacted their own laws specifically targeting warehouse quotas, while several other states have considered them. US Senator Edward Markey has proposed a similar law at the federal level.\n\nThe California fines stand out for the size of the penalty. The federal Occupational Safety and Health Administration has fined Amazon for safety violations the agency said expose workers to injury risks at multiple warehouses in different states, but they tend to be in the tens of thousands of dollars. The new California law poses a bigger financial risk for Amazon, which has multiple warehouses in the state.\n\n(Updated with labor commissioner and Amazon comments beginning in third paragraph)\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Coke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Investors looking for high-growth investments in the financial sector should consider the top fintech stocks to buy now for long-term returns.\n\nThe financial industry has seen a significant transformation in the last few years, marked by the emergence of fintech apps. Ranging from digital payments to peer-to-peer lending apps, these platforms have provided a more transparent and secure means of transacting. As a result, consumer trust in these platforms is on the rise with businesses benefitting from greater convenience and better connectivity with customers.\n\nThe rise of fintech apps has created a shift towards a largely cashless society and experts predict that nearly 91% of the transactions in the U.S. will be online this year. Keeping with this trend, the global fintech market is expected to exceed a $1,152 billion valuation by 2032.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high growth potential of fintech apps serve as a tailwind for companies leading the charge. For investors, this optimistic outlook presents a great opportunity to get behind the top names in the sector.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s been a bumpy ride for Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) these last few years but several signs signal brighter days ahead.\n\nAs an early mover in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space, the company saw its stock surge during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. However, a decline in digital spending and inflationary headwinds soon took center stage and sapped Affirm’s growth. In fiscal year 2023, the company’s revenue grew just 18% compared to a 55% spike in 2022 year-over-year (YOY).\n\nNevertheless, recent developments in the company give investors good reason to remain bullish on this stock. Shares of the company gained last week on news that Affirm’s BNPL loans will now be available on Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay. AFRM stock was up 8% following the news.\n\nNow, taking a holistic view, this partnership will not have any short-term impact on its finances but it will certainly open doors for Affirm in the long-haul. The integration with Apple Pay will allow the company to expand geographically and branch out into additional service offerings.\n\nMoreover, things are also looking up for Affirm on the numbers front. After a slow 2023, the company’s revenue is up by 40% this year. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is also projected at 20% in the next five years. That’s a rosy outlook worth investing in.\n\nAffirm may not be at the top of its game right now. However, I think there are several tailwinds that make this one of the top fintech stocks to buy now for long-term returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlock (SQ) The Cash App (SQ) logo is displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that’s worth investing in this month is Block (NYSE:SQ) — formerly known as Square. The company was no stranger to the post-pandemic decline and has struggled with profitability over the last few years. Shares of Block are down 78% from its highs in 2021. However, the company shines in one area that will fuel its growth in the coming years: digital payments.\n\nBlock has certainly expanded its offering since its Square days but it is still best known for its core products, Square and Cash App. The payment apps continue to generate income for the company with its Cash App segment seeing a 49% increase in gross profit YOY in Q1 this year.\n\nThe company is also heavily invested in this ecosystem and is constantly adding new features to its platform. According to Block’s management, it has barely scratched the surface of a total addressable market (TAM) of $130 billion in digital payments. This hints at endless growth opportunities for the company in this space.\n\nBlock’s current price presents a great entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the top fintech stocks to buy now for future returns.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to fintech platforms, Visa (NYSE:V) is definitely at the top of my list. After a pandemic driven dip in 2021, the stock has been on the rise since- growing its revenue by 10% YOY. This spike can be attributed to several trends.\n\nFor one, Visa’s status as the largest card network in the world means that it has plenty to gain from an increasingly cashless society. In 2023, the company managed $12.3 trillion in payment volume. This number will only grow as more people switch to digital payments.\n\nSecondly, Visa will benefit from an increase in consumer spending. As global economies grow, the increase in spending will help the company maximize revenue. Visa is a high margin business and makes money on every small transaction. Its global presence and broad technology infrastructure across platforms presents a huge opportunity for revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, the company is actively expanding its ecosystem with the launch of several initiatives. This includes a partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to streamline services for cloud-native institutions and a collaboration with DashSolutions to enhance the efficiency of instant payments.\n\nVisa stock is trading at a high multiple and isn’t a bargain buy by any means. However, its strong market position in a digitally-driven payment landscape makes this one of the best fintech stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "U.S. government assails Adobe for putting up ‘wholly unnecessary’ roadblocks when subscribers try to cancel",
        "content": "It’s now a dozen years since Adobe became the poster child for what marketing folks and techies used to call the “software-as-a-service” model. This subscription-based approach has its advantages—you, the user, always get the latest features delivered to you—but it also means you’re constantly paying Adobe for as long as you want to use its products.\n\nNow, it used to be the case that Adobe was an inescapable software provider for many if not most creative professionals, but some viable rivals have come up in recent years, such as Affinity (now owned by Canva) for photo editing and publishing layouts, and Blackmagic’s DaVinci Resolve for video. Not only are these options hugely cheaper than Adobe’s Photoshop and InDesign and Premiere Pro respectively—DaVinci even has a free version that's more than enough for most users—but they only require one-off payments.\n\nHowever, Adobe has been making life very difficult for users who decide to cancel their subscriptions, according to a lawsuit filed yesterday by the Justice Department and the Federal Trade Commission—naming as defendants not only Adobe, but also senior executives David Wadhwani and Maninder Sawnhey.\n\nThe complaint alleges that Adobe broke consumer protection law in two big ways: First, by pushing customers towards an “annual, paid monthly” plan while not clearly telling them that they’ll have to pay a “hefty” early termination fee (sometimes amounting to hundreds of dollars) if they cancel within the first year; and secondly, by prominently highlighting that fee when someone does try to cancel early, making the fee “a powerful retention tool.”\n\nThere are loads of redactions in this filing—the allegations specifically about Sawhney remain a complete mystery—but what’s on public display paints a pretty grim picture of Adobe’s cancellation process. Cancelling online means having to “navigate numerous pages with multiple options, much of which is wholly unnecessary to honor consumers’ cancellations requests” and those trying their luck over the phone regularly find their calls dropped or disconnected.\n\nThe FTC also filed a complaint against Amazon a year ago, alleging that the e-commerce giant “knowingly duped” many users into signing up for its Prime subscription—and, again, making it difficult to cancel those subscriptions. Amazon has unsuccessfully tried to have that lawsuit dismissed, but it should go to trial early next year.\n\n“Americans are tired of companies hiding the ball during subscription signup and then putting up roadblocks when they try to cancel,” said Samuel Levine, director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, in a statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd here’s Adobe general counsel Dana Rao: “We are transparent with the terms and conditions of our subscription agreements and have a simple cancellation process. We will refute the FTC’s claims in court.”\n\nWho’s right? Drop me an email if you’ve had issues with Adobe’s subscriptions, or if you find their processes just tickety-boo! Either way, Adobe's shareholders don't seem to care much—the share price dipped a little yesterday before bouncing right back this morning.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Cathie Wood Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks She Just Bought",
        "content": "Cathie Wood is trying to get back on track since blowout returns in 2020 that made her one of the most widely followed growth stock investors in the country. It hasn't been easy for the co-founder, CEO, and investor at Ark Invest. Her exchange-traded funds have trailed the market badly in two of the past three years, and she's falling well short in 2024.\n\nHer most popular fund is trading 16% lower year to date, but she's not going down without a fight. She kicked off the new trading week with several portfolio moves on Monday. She added to existing positions in Amazon.com(NASDAQ: AMZN), Palantir(NYSE: PLTR), and PagerDuty (NYSE: PD) this week. Let's take a closer look.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThe leading online retailer isn't the torrid growth story it was through most of its first two dozen years of public trading. It has posted positive net sales every year since going public in 1997, but the 9% growth it posted in 2022 and the 12% top-line gain it mustered last year are the weakest two years of its 27 years on the market.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy is trying to make the most of this phase of the e-commerce company's life cycle. He's improving Amazon's efficiency by cutting costs and trying to find ways to use AI to drive engagement. It's working. Net sales rose a modest 13% in the first quarter of this year, but the bottom line more than tripled. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAmazon is still a beast even in this low-growth environment. It drummed up $48.8 billion in free cash flow over the past four quarters. However, it's not ready to return some of that money to its shareholders in the form of distributions. It's the country largest company by market cap that doesn't currently have a dividend policy in place.\n\nBut investors will be fine. They're here for capital appreciation, and the shares are up 47% over the past year.\n\nThere are challenges for Amazon to stand out in a more competitive marketplace than in the past. Brick-and-mortar chains are getting better about nailing digital sales. There has also been a surge in popularity of Chinese e-commerce platforms offering ridiculously low prices. Net product sales rose just 7% in the first quarter. It was strength in its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud-hosting juggernaut and other services lifting results to double-digit growth.\n\nAmazon is one of Ark Invest's smallest holdings, and that's a shame. The stock is beating the market this year, and it could've helped move the needle if Wood had a larger stake in the popular e-tailer.\n\n2. Palantir\n\nNot all of Ark Invest's largest holdings are in the red. Palantir, one of Wood's 10 largest combined holdings, is beating the market this year. The provider of software tools for the intelligence community has also nearly quadrupled since the start of last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe market is still catching up to Palantir's potential. The stock soared 6% on Monday after Argus analyst Joseph Bonner initiated coverage with a buy rating. He thinks Palantir's push into the commercial sector beyond its roots serving the public sector is expanding the company's upside. Commercial revenue rose 40% in its latest quarter, roughly double the 21% increase in total revenue for the period.\n\nBonner thinks Palantir's earnings power and cash flow will appreciate substantially this year, but it doesn't make the stock cheap. Palantir's is trading for 76 times the analyst's profit target for this year and a still rich multiple of 63 if we look out to next year.\n\n3. PagerDuty\n\nFinally we get to a name that is down this year. The provider of cloud-based enterprise analytics and uptime monitoring is trading 8% lower in 2024.\n\nRevenue growth has decelerated for seven consecutive quarters, going from 34% to 8% in that time. But sentiment is starting to turn positive. The stock has risen nearly 20% since bottoming out last month, and it even collected an analyst upgrade last week. Yes, PagerDuty is still trading lower this year, but it was far worse a month ago. And analysts do see revenue growth accelerating for the balance of this year.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Blink Moments view in the Blink App. (Photo: Business Wire)\n\nWith the Blink Subscription Plus Plan, customers can now view multiple motion events in a single \"Moment\" that’s easy to save, share, and enjoy.\n\nBOSTON, June 18, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Blink, an Amazon company, today announced Blink Moments, a new video viewing experience that automatically combines clips captured across Blink cameras into a streamlined video.

        "content": "No one can predict the future.\n\nThat's why long-term buy-and-hold investing is the best method for success in the stock market. As a strategy, it doesn't guarantee success, but it gives investors more time for their investments to compound -- which studies show is one of the best ways to consistently deliver a positive return.\n\nAnother way to maximize your chances of success is to invest in companies with great business models and solid fundamentals. Let's examine two of my favorites. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nVisa\n\nFirstup is Visa (NYSE: V). I like Visa for a simple reason, best explained by a Warren Buffett quote: \"The secret of life is weak competition.\"\n\nTo put it bluntly, Visa has little competition. Sure, its great rival, Mastercard, operates an extensive payment network similar to Visa's, but it's not entirely identical.\n\nMoreover, given the complexity of the global payments system, neither company is out to crush the other root and branch. Rather, Mastercard and Visa's competition is more similar to other famous corporate rivalries, like Coca-Cola and Pepsi or Home Depot and Lowe's Companies.\n\nIn other words, both companies recognize that there is plenty of room for the other in their respective markets. More to the point, Visa and Mastercard compete by enticing card issuers, such as banks and credit unions, to offer their customers access to a wide variety of global merchants.\n\nIn turn, there are over 4.3 billion Visa-branded credit, debit, and pre-paid cards in circulation today -- that's more than half the world's population of roughly 8 billion.\n\nThat's a lot of cards. And it adds up to a tremendous amount of revenue, profits, and free cash flow, as Visa collects fees on each transaction processed on its network. V Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nWhat's more, Visa is growing rapidly for a company of its size. Analysts expect the company's sales to increase 21% this year and a further 11% in 2025. With that level of growth -- coupled with the company's already lucrative profit margin -- investors should be happy to own Visa for many years to come.\n\nAmazon\n\nIf you're going to hold a stock forever, you should have supreme confidence in a company's business model, management, and track record. That's why I've owned Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) for years and plan to own it for as long as I'm around.\n\nAmazon began as a humble bookselling business, operating out of a nondescript garage in Seattle. Today, the company is massive. Its annual revenue of $590 billion is larger than the total economic output of Nigeria, Greece, and Croatia -- combined.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor most people, Amazon's e-commerce network is its most visible business segment. But the company also makes over $25 billion quarterly from its industry-leading cloud services segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS). Image source: Statista\n\nAll in all, despite its enormous size, Amazon continues to deliver double-digit revenue growth. In turn, that revenue drives fantastic free cash flow per share, which is an excellent driver of long-term stock price growth. In fact, Amazon founder Jeff Bezos went so far as to say that free cash flow per share was his \"ultimate financial measure.\"\n\nAt any rate, with Amazon's combination of growth, diverse revenue streams, and profitability, long-term investors would be wise to consider buying and holding shares of Amazon well into the future.\n\nDon’t miss this second chance at a potentially lucrative opportunity\n\nEver feel like you missed the boat in buying the most successful stocks? Then you’ll want to hear this.\n\nOn rare occasions, our expert team of analysts issues a “Double Down” stock recommendation for companies that they think are about to pop. If you’re worried you’ve already missed your chance to invest, now is the best time to buy before it’s too late. And the numbers speak for themselves:\n\nAmazon: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2010, you’d have $20,685!* Apple: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2008, you’d have $40,151!* Netflix: if you invested $1,000 when we doubled down in 2004, you’d have $360,991!*\n\nRight now, we’re issuing “Double Down” alerts for three incredible companies, and there may not be another chance like this anytime soon.\n\nSee 3 “Double Down” stocks »\n\n*Stock Advisor returns as of June 11, 2024\n\nJohn Mackey, former CEO of Whole Foods Market, an Amazon subsidiary, is a member of The Motley Fool’s board of directors.

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks to Hold Forever",
        "content": "As the head of Berkshire Hathaway, Warren Buffett has become one of the world's best-known investors. He and his team have turned Berkshire into an $875 billion behemoth, and Buffett's net worth has skyrocketed along the way.\n\nWhen you have that type of investing success, people tend to look to you for investing guidance. While Berkshire Hathaway's financial situation vastly differs from the average person's, there's nothing wrong with looking at its stock holdings for inspiration.\n\nThe following three companies, in particular, can be great options to buy and hold on to for the long haul.\n\n1. Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola(NYSE: KO) is Berkshire Hathaway's fourth-largest holding, accounting for 6.5% of its stock portfolio. After a slump, Coca-Cola's stock has made some progress this year and is only a few percentages below its 52-week high, which it hit on June 6.\n\nCoca-Cola's main appeal is its dividend, which is likely a large part of why Buffett is such a fan of the company. Its annual dividend is $1.94, and the forward yield is close to 3%. Owning 400 million shares, Berkshire Hathaway can expect to earn $776 million from the beverage giant by the end of this year.\n\nNot only does Coca-Cola have a high-yield dividend, but it's also known for its annual dividend increases. It has upped its annual dividend for 62 straight years, making it a Dividend King. Only eight companies have longer streaks of annual increases, so investors can be confident that this streak will continue for the foreseeable future. KO Dividend Chart\n\nCoca-Cola's financial health is one of the more robust you'll find. It has over $99 billion in assets compared to around $71 billion in liabilities (current and non-current) and its brand power allows it to exercise its pricing power to offset periods of stagnant volume growth.\n\nThe beverage industry is constantly evolving, and Coca-Cola isn't afraid to spend to keep up with changing consumer preferences. Yes, its flagship Coca-Cola soda will likely continue to be its bread and butter, but via acquisitions the company has added eight brands, each producing over $1 billion in sales, such as Topo-Chico, Smartwater, and Fairlife.\n\nDespite Coca-Cola's historical success, it does a great job of constantly evolving and not getting complacent. That's a company you can feel comfortable holding on to for the long haul.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nBuffett wasn't interested in investing in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) initially, but has admitted that he regrets not buying shares in the company sooner. Looking at Amazon's gains over the past decade (up over 1,000%), it's easy to see why.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon's e-commerce business has made it a household name and continues to be its main revenue generator (roughly 84% of total revenue in 2023). However, Amazon's growth will likely come from its cloud segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and its growing advertising business. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAWS is the world's leading cloud platform by market share, and new generative AI capabilities should help drive further growth. Its SageMaker and Bedrock platforms simplify building and scaling AI applications and should attract more enterprise customers looking to leverage AI for their respective businesses.\n\nAmazon's ad business was its fastest-growing segment in 2023. With a combination of live sports, premium content, and large scale, Amazon presents a compelling case for advertisers. It also has an advantage because it can track when customers buy relevant ad products on Amazon, giving advertisers more insight into the effectiveness of their campaigns.\n\nAmazon has its hand in many different industries and is becoming a formidable force in each. The diversity and history of innovation puts it in a position for continued success.\n\n3. Procter & Gamble\n\nProcter & Gamble(NYSE: PG) (P&G) may be the poster child for defensive stocks. Whenever the economy is going through rough periods, investors lean on P&G for its reliable stability and performance.\n\nYou shouldn't expect market-beating growth from P&G year in and year out, but its dividend is one of the surest things on the stock market. It's paid out a dividend for 134 years and increased it for 64 straight years.\n\nWith a portfolio of brands that include household names like Tide, Pampers, Tampax, and dozens more, there's likely no major retail store you can step into in America without encountering one of P&G's products. It's not just the number of brands P&G owns, either. A big part of its appeal is the fact these products sell regardless of economic conditions.\n\nIf you're looking for a stock you can buy and hold on to forever, P&G is a great choice because of its reliable dividend, strong brand portfolio, and resilience in virtually all economic conditions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coca-Cola right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coca-Cola, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Coca-Cola wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "If you’re looking for a list of REITs with strong buy analyst ratings in June, you’ve come to the right place. This article explores several real estate investment trusts (REITs) that are attractively priced given the current economic environment of falling interest rates. Lower rates reduce borrowing costs for REITs and can act as a catalyst to push these stocks higher.\n\nMany REITs have been hammered by high interest rates, but the predicted falling rates this year will lighten their load, making them attractive to investors seeking substantial dividend and income growth potential. These top REITs also trade at very attractive valuations, as most of the market has turned toward more attractive and riskier options such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) or other growth stocks in pursuit of capital appreciation.\n\nSo if you are after the best REITs with strong buy analyst ratings, keep reading. Here are several of the most highly recommended REITs to buy in June for U.S. investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlpine Income Property Trust (PINE) Commercial shopping center in a tropical climate\n\nSource: mTaira / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlpine Income Property Trust (NYSE:PINE) has a high occupancy rate and a significant dividend yield, making it an attractive investment for those seeking stable returns. Pine pays a 7.29% dividend yield.\n\nPINE reported strong performance for 2023, with a high occupancy rate of 99.1% and annualized base rent of $38.8 million. The company’s portfolio consists of 138 properties across 35 states, heavily weighted towards investment-grade tenants, which represent 65% of its base rent. In 2023, PINE sold 24 properties for $108.3 million, generating gains of $9.3 million.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, PINE aims to continue growing its portfolio by selling non-investment grade assets and acquiring higher-quality investment-grade properties. The company is focused on maintaining its high occupancy and stable revenue streams through strategic property management and acquisitions\n\nAnalysts have rated PINE as a strong buy, with a consensus price target suggesting an upside potential of around 10% to 15%. For Q1 2024, PINE reported adjusted funds from operations (AFFO) per share of 42 cents, a 16.7% increase year-over-year.\n\nLXP Industrial Trust (LXP) workers on a construction site with the sun setting in the background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nLXP Industrial Trust (NYSE:LXP) owns and leases industrial properties, benefiting from strong demand in logistics and warehousing. Its substantial dividend growth and major tenants like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) highlight its investment appeal​. LXP pays a 5.91% dividend yield.\n\nIn 2023, LXP reported net income attributable to common shareholders of $23.9 million, or 8 cents per diluted share, and generated Adjusted Company funds from operations of $206.2 million, or 70 cents per diluted share. The company completed 6.8 million square feet of new leases and lease extensions, raising industrial base and cash base rents by 40.1% and 27.0%, respectively.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, LXP reported Adjusted Company FFO of $48.8 million, or $0.16 per diluted share. The company maintained a strong balance sheet with a net debt to Adjusted EBITDA ratio of 6.1x and total consolidated debt of $1.8 billion, with 92.8% of this debt at fixed rates.\n\nColliers International Group (CIGI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAlthough more broadly classified as a real estate services company, Colliers International Group (NASDAQ:CIGI) has significant REIT operations. Analysts appreciate its comprehensive service offerings and strong market positioning​. CIGI pays a dividend yield of 0.27%.\n\nIn 2023, Colliers’ revenue was $4.34 billion, with notable segments being Americas, EMEA, Asia Pacific, and Investment Management. Despite a challenging market, the company managed to increase its Investment Management revenue by 29% year-over-year, reaching $487.5 million, and ended the year with $98.2 billion in assets under management (AUM)​.\n\nFor the first quarter of 2024, Colliers reported revenue of $1 billion, a 3.7% increase compared to the same period in 2023. Net income for the quarter was $12.7 million, recovering from a loss of $20.2 million in Q1 2023. Adjusted EBITDA for Q1 2024 was $104.6 million.\n\nAnalysts have a positive outlook on Colliers, with a consensus rating of “strong buy” and a price target range between $125 and $150, suggesting a potential upside of around 25.5% from the current stock price.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Asia is, of course, an incredibly vast continent. But most of the Asian companies in which Americans can and should invest are based in either China or India. Since the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese economy has been stuck in a deep slump. And though it still has major problems, including a very weak real estate market, it is showing signs of rebounding.\n\nFor example, last month the country’s retail sales rose 3.7% versus May 2023 while its industrial production advanced 5.6% year-over-year. For its part, the Indian economy, boosted by the opening of many factories that have relocated from China, grew at a blistering 8.2% above inflation during its fiscal year that ended in March 2024. And the country’s central bank expects the economy to expand at a fast pace of 7.2% during the current fiscal year, up from its previous estimate of 7% growth.\n\nWith China’s economy showing signs of recovery and India looking like the “next big thing” from an investing standpoint, here are the three best Asian stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNot only is India’s economy growing at an extremely rapid pace but foreigners are investing large amounts into the country. As of May 11, U.S.-based ETFs that invest in Indian stocks benefited from almost $2.7 billion of net inflows since the beginning of the year. That trend paused briefly earlier this month amid doubts about whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be reelected. But after it became clear he would remain in office, the pattern resumed, with foreign investors buying $985.5 million of Indian stocks on June 7 and June 10, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAmong the key beneficiaries of foreign interest in Indian stocks has been The WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSEARCA:EPI). Shares climbed 12% in the last three months and it should continue to advance as optimism about the Asian country’s economy increases.\n\nThe WisdomTree India Earnings Fund’s holdings are very diversified. Financial services companies account for 21.8% of its holdings while basic materials firms weigh in at 13.4%. Technology stands at 10.5% and industrials are at 9.6%.\n\nGiven the ETF’s well-diversified exposure to the rapidly growing Indian economy, it is one of the best Asian stocks to buy.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading Indian online travel agency MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), boosted by India’s rapidly expanding middle class, continued to grow very rapidly and quickly increase its profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter its top line jumped 36.6% versus the same period a year earlier to $148.5 million, while operating profits, excluding certain items, soared 70.4% year-over-year to $19.03 million. For all of fiscal 2024, the company’s adjusted operating profit came in at a brisk $124 million, up from $70 million during the prior year.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the trend of increasing disposable income among Indians, spurred by the country’s strong economic growth, CEO Rajesh Magow reported last month. The company is also getting a big lift from an increasing desire by tourists to view India’s spiritual landmarks, Magow noted. Over the last two years, searches for spiritual destination on the company’s platform have nearly doubled, he stated.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nChinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is continuing to grow incredibly rapidly, driven largely by the market share gains of its Temu marketplace. Temu caters to foreign consumers and its share of the U.S. retail market had reached a very impressive total of 17% in April.\n\nThe company’s prices tend to be cheaper than Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) and it became the top overall shopping app on Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store.\n\nIn Q1, PDD’s revenue soared 131% versus the same period a year earlier to $12 billion, while its operating profit jumped an incredible 275% year=-ver-year to $3.6 billion.\n\nOn May 24, Goldman Sachs responded to the firm’s Q1 results by upgrading PDD stock to “buy” from “neutral.” The bank reported that the company is benefiting from rising ad revenue along with the increased profitability of Temu. Goldman placed a $184 price target on PDD stock, well above the shares’ current price of around $150.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in EPI.

        "content": "The excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has yet to run its course on Wall Street.\n\nThree analysts recently upgraded their forecasts for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) amid early signs that investments in generative AI are driving earnings growth at large-cap tech companies.\n\nOn Sunday, Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 6,000 from 4,750, noting the \"AI revolution is in the early innings.\" Emanuel's target is the highest on Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200 on Friday. Goldman highlighted that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCiti's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, struck a similar tone, boosting its end target to 5,600 from 5,100 on Monday. The analysts noted that the market would have trended toward their prior target had it not been for outsized performance from large-cap tech.\n\n\"The generative AI influence as an ongoing incremental growth driver is permeating the US equity environment right now,\" Chronert wrote.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the S&P 500's nearly 15% gain this year is attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia, according to Citi.\n\nIf this \"megacap exceptionalism\" continues, Goldman's model shows the S&P 500 could end the year at 6,300. This would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\"\n\nBarclays head US equity strategist Venu Krishna currently holds a 5,300 call on the S&P 500 but also noted that continued outperformance from tech provides upside risk to his target and could result in a bull-case scenario with the S&P 500 ending the year above 6,000.\n\nKrishna told Yahoo Finance that he's been asked for more than a year whether a small group of stocks can continue to drive the market higher.\n\n\"The answer is yes, it is possible,\" Krishna said. \"We are in that environment.\" A sign for a Nvidia building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMarket concentration\n\nThe top-heavy market has some concerned that the rally is too narrow. However, strategists say this shouldn't deter investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnider noted it's important for investors to remember that if the trend of large-cap tech leading the S&P 500 higher continues, a narrow rally with only a few stocks leading the market higher is a feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\n\"This is part of the beauty of the S&P 500 ... When a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now.\"\n\nThere is also risk AI enthusiasm has driven stock valuations too high. JPMorgan chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic, who has stuck by Wall Street's most bearish year-end S&P 500 target of 4,200, noted on June 3 that equity valuations are \"rich\" while sentiment is \"near highs.\"\n\nAnd Kolanovic has a point. Emanuel at Evercore ISI pointed out that with the S&P 500 trading above 20 times its forward earnings estimates, the index is \"expensive\" on a historical basis. But what sticks out to Emanuel is how long stocks can stay at those levels.\n\nThe S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio crossed 20 143 days ago, per Emanuel. In the 2021 economic reopening frenzy, the S&P 500 traded at similar valuation levels for 614 days. During the dot-com boom, the S&P 500 lasted at those levels for 737 days.\n\nEmanuel notes this shows that \"high valuations can remain higher for longer.\" And with that could come further returns.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Forget AMD: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "Chip stocks have soared since last year alongside a boom in artificial intelligence (AI). As a leader in the industry, Advanced Micro Devices' (NASDAQ: AMD) stock has risen 28% since last June, outperforming the S&P 500's increase of 24% in the same period. The company has rallied investors with a promising role in graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for training AI models.\n\nBut while AMD stock's growth has benefited current investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones. AMD PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart uses price-to-sales (P/S) and forward price-to-earnings ratios to compare AMD's valuation to two other companies active in AI, Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). For both metrics, Intel and Amazon are a better value than AMD. So, while AMD likely has a bright future in AI over the long term, it could be worth investing in alternative AI stocks that offer more bang for your buck.\n\nSo, forget AMD and consider buying one of these artificial intelligence stocks instead.\n\n1. Intel\n\nYou might be surprised to see Intel on this list after its performance over the last decade. The company is coming out of a slump that saw its stock plunge 47% since 2021, alongside dips in revenue and lost market share in what was once its bread and butter, the central processing unit (CPU) market.\n\nHowever, recent restructuring indicates it's not over for Intel, and the company could be on the road to recovery. Meanwhile, its stock is one of the biggest bargains in AI right now, making it hard to ignore as a long-term option.\n\nIntel is preparing to invest $100 billion in building chip manufacturing plants throughout the U.S. The company has secured close to $20 billion in federal grants and loans, with hopes of securing another $25 billion in tax breaks. The chipmaker is partially backed by the federal CHIPS Act, a 2022 initiative to increase the U.S.' foundry capacity.\n\nIntel's manufacturing expansion is particularly promising for its AI potential. CEO Pat Gelsinger expects its coming Ohio plant to become \"the largest AI chip manufacturing site in the world\" as early as 2027. Meanwhile, prioritizing chip fabrication differentiates Intel from rivals like Nvidia and AMD, which are focused on design over manufacturing. Intel could see major boosts to earnings in the coming years as AI growth continues to increase demand for chips.\n\nThe company has a long way to go before seeing significant returns on its hefty investment, but for investors, it could be worth getting in on the ground floor to potentially profit from its comeback.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon is one of the most compelling AI stocks right now, with its cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), forging a powerful role in the industry. Meanwhile, the company's P/S ratio of about 3 makes it a bargain buy despite its share price soaring 45% over the last 12 months.\n\nThe retail giant's business has exploded since last year. Amazon's operating income has risen more than 1,300%, with free cash flow doubling to nearly $46 billion. The company has enjoyed significant gains in its e-commerce segments, which benefited from easing inflation and management's cost-cutting measures.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on AWS in recent months. Its leading 31% market share in cloud computing potentially gives it an edge in AI, which the company is taking full advantage of by expanding AWS. Amazon is increasing its cloud capacity by investing billions into building more data centers worldwide.\n\nThe tech giant has a 15-year plan to develop AWS' infrastructure in Taiwan. Meanwhile, Amazon has committed to investing $13 billion on a similar project in India, which will scale up its cloud infrastructure in one of the faster-growing data center markets in the world.\n\nIn addition to significant cash reserves and a dominant position in the cloud market, Amazon's stock is worth considering based on the range of ways it could boost its business with the generative technology. Expanding AI capabilities could allow it to better analyze shopping trends and more accurately recommend products on its retail site, improve shipping logistics, expand its AI offerings on AWS, and offer more pointed advertising on its streaming service, Prime Video.\n\nAmazon is on a promising growth trajectory in AI and is worth investing in over AMD this June.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nConsider when Nvidia made this list on April 15, 2005... if you invested $1,000 at the time of our recommendation, you’d have $808,105!*\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Billionaire David Tepper Has 25% of His Portfolio Invested in 3 Brilliant AI Stocks",
        "content": "David Tepper's Appaloosa is the 12th most profitable hedge fund in history as measured by net gains since inception. The hedge fund returned 58% during the three-year period that ended in March 2024, while the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) returned just 32% during the same period. That makes Tepper an excellent case study for investors.\n\nWith that in mind, Tepper had nearly 25% of his Appaloosa portfolio invested in three artificial intelligence stocks as of the March quarter: Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) accounted for 10%, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) accounted for 8.7%, and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) accounted for 5.9%. All three stocks have been brilliant investments over the last five years, outperforming the S&P 500, and Tepper clearly remains confident in their ability to beat to the market.\n\nAre these technology stocks worthwhile investments?\n\nAmazon: 10% of Tepper's portfolio\n\nAmazon looked strong in the first quarter. Revenue increased 13% to $143 billion on accelerating sales in advertising and cloud services. Meanwhile, the company's continued focus on operating efficiency helped GAAP net income triple to reach $0.98 per diluted share. Amazon is well positioned to maintain that momentum given its growth prospects across three markets.\n\nSpecifically, Amazon operates the largest online marketplace in North America and Western Europe. It is also the biggest retail media company in the United States, and the third biggest ad tech company worldwide. And Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the market leader in cloud infrastructure and platform services revenue. In short, Amazon will undoubtedly benefit as the e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud services markets expand.\n\nCloud computing is a particularly important opportunity because it overlaps with artificial intelligence (AI). To elaborate, running AI workloads in the cloud is generally more cost effective than purchasing equipment for on-premises data centers, so more businesses should gravitate toward the cloud in the coming years. As the leader in cloud infrastructure services, AWS is well positioned to benefit from AI's gravitational pull. But the company is also leaning in with new products like Amazon Bedrock, a platform that supports the fine-tuning of large language models and the development of generative AI applications.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow earnings per share at 23% annually over the next three to five years. That consensus estimate makes its current valuation of 51.5 times earnings seem fairly reasonable. Personally, I would be comfortable buying a small position in this AI stock today.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft: 8.7% of Tepper's portfolio\n\nMicrosoft reported solid financial results in the third quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 31), beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 17% to $61.9 billion, an acceleration from 7% growth in previous year. That was driven by momentum in enterprise software and cloud computing, which itself was partially due to demand for artificial intelligence products. Meanwhile, GAAP net income jumped 20% to $2.94 per diluted share.\n\nMicrosoft has emerged as the leading cloud provider in the generative AI gold rush. Indeed, CEO Satya Nadella says 65% of Fortune 500 companies use Azure OpenAI Service, a product that empowers businesses to build generative AI applications with OpenAI large language models, including the models that power ChatGPT. Last year, Azure accounted for 30% of revenue related to generative AI models and platform services, second only to OpenAI, according to IoT analytics.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft is also integrating generative AI features into its software products. Copilot for Microsoft 365 complements its business productivity software by automating tasks in Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and Teams. Microsoft has also introduced copilots that complement its enterprise resource planning software by automating tasks across its sales, service, and finance applications. Nearly 60% of the Fortune 500 use a Microsoft Copilot product.\n\nGoing forward, Microsoft will undoubtedly benefit as the enterprise software and cloud services markets expand, helped along by growing demand for artificial intelligence. Indeed, Wall Street expects earnings per share to grow at 13.7% annually over the next three to five years. But that consensus makes its current valuation of 38.8 times earnings look expensive.\n\nPersonally, I question whether Microsoft can beat the market from its current price. I would be more comfortable buying shares at a cheaper multiple, closer to 30 times earnings. But Microsoft is a financially healthy business with a strong competitive position in several markets and excellent growth prospects, so eager investors could purchase a small position today.\n\nNvidia: 5.9% of Tepper's portfolio\n\nNvidia reported phenomenal financial results in the first quarter, beating Wall Street's expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 262% to $26 billion on strong momentum in the data center product category, which itself was driven by demand for AI hardware solutions. Meanwhile, non-GAAP net income soared 461% to $6.12 per diluted share.\n\nNvidia graphic processing units (GPUs) are synonymous with accelerated computing and AI infrastructure. In fact, the company holds 90% market share in data center GPUs and 80% market share in AI chips. But Nvidia is truly formidable because it offers a full-stack accelerated computing platform comprising hardware, software, and services purpose-built for AI.\n\nThat full-stack strategy affords the company a durable economic moat. Nvidia not only sells the fastest AI chips on the market, but also offers the most robust ecosystem of supporting software for developers. More broadly, Nvidia is innovating rapidly across its portfolio of data center products. Argus analyst Jim Kelleher highlighted that advantage in a recent note to clients. \"Nvidia's expertise, market leadership, and continued investment in new technology puts it several generations ahead of rivals and gives it a sustainable advantage in its markets.\"\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects the company to grow earnings per share at 32% annually over the next three to five years. That makes its current valuation of 76.7 times earnings seem slightly expensive. Personally, I would still feel comfortable buying a few shares today, but I would limit my purchase to 1% of my portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In recent years, the e-commerce scene has battled macro headwinds and rapidly changing consumer behavior. Undoubtedly, high rates and fears of anything worse than an economic soft landing have caused some consumers to cut back not just on discretionary goods but also on necessities by opting for the cheapest alternatives where possible.\n\nWith one rate cut likely in store in the second and economic growth that could pick up speed (perhaps via a productivity boost from AI), the consumer has reasons to be more hopeful. Whether it’s enough to take e-shopping sprees into overdrive, though, remains to be seen. Regardless, given that most discretionaries are better bought online these days, I’d argue the following e-tailers—PDD, AMZN, MELI— seem best equipped to power back.\n\nTherefore, let’s use TipRanks’ Comparison Tool to check in with a trio of e-commerce titans that analysts have rated as Strong Buys.\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD)\n\nPDD Holdings (formerly Pinduoduo) is a Chinese e-tailer that’s been riding high on its international e-commerce business Temu. Even if you’ve never shopped on Temu, you’re probably familiar with the platform and the ad that lets you “shop like a billionaire,” whereby you can shop freely without worrying too much about price. With obscenely low prices on a wide selection of goods, which come straight from the source, Temu seems to be winning the “race to the bottom” in terms of pricing for digital retailers.\n\nWith hard-to-match prices, a unique, “gamified” shopping experience that’s uniquely Chinese, and a world of growth opportunities, Temu stands out as the new e-commerce disruptor. All things considered, I remain bullish on PDD stock as it looks to extend its glorious two-year run that saw shares gain almost 150%.\n\nThanks to Temu, PDD has been able to one-up Chinese e-tailer Alibaba (NASDAQ:BABA) to become China’s largest e-commerce firm by market cap. With Alibaba in a horrid multi-year slump and Temu continuing to soar in popularity, the lead is likely PDD to keep for the long haul.\n\nIn the first quarter, Temu helped power PDD to 131% year-over-year sales growth. That’s the kind of growth that makes the added risks from investing in Chinese stocks forgivable. Nowhere else on Earth can you find that kind of growth for 19.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) or around 13 times forward P/E.\n\nWhat’s even more remarkable is the user growth, with nearly 30 million global Temu app downloads as of February 2024. Clearly, the ads seem to be working. But the big question is if PDD can keep new customers continue “shopping like billionaires” for the long haul. I think they can with its rock-bottom prices amid inflation and the engaging “gamification” of the platform.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat Is the Price Target for PDD Stock?\n\nPDD stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 14 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average PDD stock price target of $217.75 implies 46.9% upside potential.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nIf you want rock-bottom prices on goods, you head on over to Temu, but you’ll have to wait a long time for the delivery to arrive on your doorstep. Indeed, if you’re in the U.S., it could take weeks before your Temu order finally arrives. If time is of the essence and speed is what you need, you’ll probably want to take your business over to Amazon. The prices aren’t unreasonable on Amazon, but they are far from being the absolute cheapest for any given product category. I guess that’s the price you pay for blazing delivery speed.\n\nEven if Temu can reduce delivery times by a few days or so, it will probably never come close to matching the speed of Amazon Prime deliveries. Indeed, a profound amount of logistical innovation is going on behind the scenes to make same-day shipping possible. Given this, I’m staying bullish on AMZN stock.\n\nAdditionally, Amazon is home to many authentic brand-name goods, many of which you can’t find over at Temu. In that regard, I don’t view Temu as a massive threat to Amazon’s e-commerce moat. That said, Amazon could lose some business to Temu in this environment, where consumers are price-sensitive and willing to wait weeks to get their product.\n\nThe good news for AMZN stockholders is that Temu and its fashionable Chinese e-commerce peer Shein have the attention of the Seattle-based e-commerce titan. Reportedly, Amazon drastically decreased fees for cheap clothing (articles going for under $20), a move that should help it hit back at fast-moving Chinese e-tailers as they look to disrupt the original disruptor in e-commerce.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of AMZN Stock?\n\nAMZN stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 42 unanimous Buys assigned in the past three months. The average AMZN stock price target of $221.20 implies 20.2% upside potential.\n\nMercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI)\n\nMercadoLibre is an e-commerce and payments firm that serves Latin America. It’s pretty much the Amazon for Latin American nations—like Brazil, where the actual Amazon rainforest is located. Serving emerging markets can entail significant long-term growth potential, making MercadoLibre an e-commerce play for those who seek growth above all else. With a robust growth narrative and a dominant position in its circle of competence, I’m staying bullish on the stock despite its frothy multiple.\n\nAt writing, MELI stock goes for more than 70.9 times trailing P/E, which makes AMZN (51.6 times trailing P/E at writing) and PDD (19.7 times) look like relative bargains. That said, having a dominant position in higher-growth markets does entail a greater premium. Given PDD’s international presence with Temu, however, I’d argue PDD stock is, by far, a better option for value-conscious growth investors.\n\nLooking ahead, analysts envision 2024 sales hitting $19 billion, up 25% year-over-year. With a similar growth playbook as a younger Amazon in markets that have far more growth potential, MELI stock seems like a name to watch or even buy on a pullback.\n\nWhat Is the Price Target of MELI Stock?\n\nMELI stock is a Strong Buy, according to analysts, with 12 Buys and two Holds assigned in the past three months. The average MELI stock price target of $1,921.82 implies 23.3% upside potential.\n\nConclusion\n\nThe e-commerce market looks primed for performance as the economy rises from an inflationary environment full of macro headwinds. Believe it or not, Amazon isn’t the growthiest pick of the pack these days when you expand your horizons to encompass some of the international e-tailers. Of the trio, analysts like PDD stock the most.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Wall Street Favorites: 3 Dow Stocks With Strong Buy Ratings for June 2024",
        "content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average is a stock index comprised of 30 of the largest blue-chip companies in the U.S. Because of its number of component stocks, the index is commonly known as the Dow 30. Taken together, the stocks in the Dow are meant to provide a snapshot of the U.S. economy and how it is performing.\n\nThe Dow has come under criticism in recent years for its continued underperformance versus the two other major U.S. stock indices. Critics point to the fact that the Dow is up only 2% this year versus a 15% increase in the benchmark S&P 500 index and a near 20% rise in the Nasdaq Composite. Despite the criticism, some stocks in the index have outperformed by a wide margin, and analysts are extremely bullish on them.\n\nHere are three strong buy Dow stocks to consider in June 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon logo\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is a new component of the Dow 30, having been added to the index earlier this year. But it’s one of the stocks that analysts are most bullish on. Amazon stock currently has a Strong Buy rating, with all 42 analysts who cover the company rating it a Buy. There are no Hold or Sell ratings on the stock. And although AMZN stock has risen a healthy 46% in the last 12 months, analysts see more upside ahead. The median price target on the shares is 20% higher than where they currently trade.\n\nAnalysts are bullish on Amazon’s prospects, particularly as its cloud computing business unit continues to dominate and the company’s revenues get a boost from a resurgence of online advertising. Amazon is also winning praise for right-sizing its e-commerce business after the pandemic and growing its Prime streaming service, securing a lucrative broadcast deal with the National Football League. So far in 2024, Amazon stock has gained 21%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) An image of a Canoo, Inc. (GOEV) Walmart electric delivery vehicle\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT), the world’s largest retailer and Amazon competitor, also rates a Strong Buy among analysts who track the company’s progress. Of the 28 professional analysts offering a rating on WMT stock, 25 call it a Buy, while 3 have a Hold rating on it. There isn’t a single Sell rating on the stock. The median price target on the shares is almost 10% higher than their current levels. The bullish outlook comes as Walmart’s stock enjoys a very good year.\n\nSo far in 2024, Walmart stock has risen 28%, marking one of the best starts in recent memory for the company. Currently trading at an all-time high, Walmart split its stock on a 3-for-1 basis this February. The shares have continued rallying since the split. Analysts view Walmart as a best-in-class retailer and praise the company for distinguishing itself from many of its floundering competitors, such as Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe key to Walmart’s success, say analysts, has been its push into groceries. The company is now the largest grocery retailer in the U.S.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) continues to be a favorite among analysts. Coke’s stock has a Strong Buy rating, with 13 Wall Street analysts giving it a Buy recommendation and 3 analysts labeling it a Hold. There are no Sell ratings on KO stock. The consensus view is that Coca-Cola’s share price will rise 8% higher over the coming 12 months. The bullish outlook comes despite the fact that the stock is up only 6% this year, trailing the 15% gain in the benchmark S&P 500 index.\n\nDespite the underperformance, analysts continue to like Coca-Cola’s stability and strong brand, which they say gives the company pricing power or the ability to raise prices without losing customers. Analysts also like Coca-Cola’s dividend. The company pays a quarterly distribution of 48 cents a share, giving the stock a yield of 3.10%. Coke has raised its dividend for 62 consecutive years, making it one of the most consistent shareholder payments.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Walmart is becoming the new Amazon as customers make smaller, but frequent purchases: ‘That’s a trend that’s not going to reverse,’ CFO says",
        "content": "As the battle for e-commerce dominance wages on, Walmart CFO John David Rainey says the company has the tools to edge out competitors. The Arkansas-based retail giant has seen more frequent, yet smaller, orders through its Walmart+ membership program, with most consumers preferring delivery, all ingredients Amazon hailed as part of its secret sauce to becoming the U.S.’s biggest online retailer.\n\n“We've seen delivery surpass pickup, and I believe that that's a trend that's not going to reverse, really speaks to how customers are thinking about this convenience factor for us,” Rainey said Wednesday at the Evercore ISI Consumer & Retail Conference. “We're simply getting better at our ability to serve our customers that way.”\n\nWalmart+ customers, who are able to get free deliveries and member prices through the service resembling Amazon Prime, spend twice as much as average Walmart customers, he added, and they shop more frequently and with smaller orders, sometimes only buying one or two items at a time.\n\nThe membership program has been a boon to Walmart as its revenue soared 6% to $161.5 billion last quarter, in large part to its 21% growth in e-commerce sales, led by wealthier consumers looking for convenience and speed.\n\nRainey said earlier this month that Walmart expects its e-commerce division, which includes advertising and consumer data business, to become profitable within the next two years. Sam’s Club, the company’s membership warehouse club chain, is already profitable in e-commerce.\n\nWith its boom in online delivery orders, Walmart has its sights set on dethroning Amazon as the country’s top e-commerce site. Amazon has coasted on customers’ frequent orders—72 per year on average, or about once or twice a week—with items tallying an average of $37 per order, amounting to an annual spend of $2,662. Almost all Amazon shoppers are repeat customers.\n\nThe delivery blitz\n\nThe delivery speed Rainey touted last week has become the focal point of the battle for e-commerce authority as the pandemic created tremendous demand for quick and convenient deliveries. While online orders took almost two weeks to be delivered in January 2020, as of May 2023, orders took less than three days on average to arrive at a customer’s doorstep, according to supply-chain consulting platform Project44’s State of Last Mile Delivery report from June 2023.\n\nAmazon announced in April its Prime delivery speeds were the fastest in company history, with 60% of Prime orders to the 60 biggest U.S. cities arriving the same or next day. CEO Andy Jassy said in an April 2023 letter to shareholders the company would shift from a national to regional fulfillment model, scaling back warehouses and investing in hubs similarly used by FedEd and UPS in an effort to move inventory closer to consumers.\n\nStory continues\n\nTarget announced in February that year it would invest $100 million over three years in expanding next-day deliveries. Even clothing brands like American Eagle and Nordstrom have tried to optimize their e-commerce operations by improving delivery times.\n\nWhile companies are going all-in on delivery efficiency, they’re on the razor’s edge, as making deliveries any faster could lose them money in the long run. Air freight is expensive and limited by traffic, which has already pushed shippers like UPS to cut back air cargo operations in favor of cheaper, but slower, ground transportation.\n\n“We can be in that three-to-five-day click-to-deliver timeline,” Laura Ritchey, COO of e-commerce fulfillment company Radial, told Retail Dive in June 2023. “It gets really expensive to go faster than that.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution",
        "content": "With a market capitalization of approximately $3 trillion, Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT) holds the title of the largest publicly traded company globally. Following its acquisition of OpenAI, the software giant has aggressively expanded its customer base and significantly enhanced its overall performance. The company's shares have surged in recent quarters, surpassing expectations and delivering substantial returns. I expect this trend to persist, as Microsoft continues to lead in the artificial intelligence space and invest heavily in new AI initiatives, building on the success achieved with OpenAI.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Sign with MSFT.\n\nFigure 1: Microsoft shares have surged since late 2023 Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nMicrosoft has strategically positioned itself ahead of its competitors through massive research and development spending, large acquisitions and strategic partnerships with external companies. These maneuvers have provided the company with a competitive edge, enabling it to outshine rivals and roll out AI services to end users more quickly and effectively. The intensifying competition between Google's (NASDAQ:GOOGL) updated Gemini and OpenAI's flagship GPT-4 underscores the evolving landscape of generative AI. As more multi-modal interactive platforms are launched, it is clear we are witnessing a three-horse race in the generative AI arena. Microsoft is likely to benefit temporarily from its early investments in OpenAI, solidifying its position as a leader in the field.\n\nThe driver behind Microsoft's cloud dominance\n\nMicrosoft is actively deploying AI-as-a-service features on its Azure cloud computing platform, which has become one of the company's largest revenue generators, surpassing even its Office software suite. The launch of Azure in 2010 marked a pivotal change in the company's revenue trajectory. Seven years post-launch, it saw significant revenue jumps, largely driven by the success of Azure. This trend continues today, with Microsoft's cloud computing services contributing substantially to its financial growth.\n\nFigure 2: Azure has been the key driver of Microsoft's revenue growth Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: GuruFocus\n\nGiven Azure's significant contribution to Microsoft's revenue, it is crucial for the company to continuously attract new customers to sustain the expected growth. Microsoft is well-positioned to achieve this, as evidenced by Azure's capture of 25% of the cloud market, even as Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS has seen a slight decline in market share. The ongoing cloud super-cycle and the generative AI boom have been key factors in Azure's growing market share, which now stands at 25%, gradually closing the gap with AWS, which holds 31%.\n\nStory continues\n\nFigure 3: Azure inches closer to market leader AWS Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Statista\n\nWith the increasing demand for cloud services and AI capabilities, Microsoft is poised to continue exceeding market expectations. Azure's robust performance and strategic advancements ensure it remains a critical component of the company's overall success, reinforcing its leadership in the rapidly evolving cloud and AI industries.\n\nStrategic moves\n\nMicrosoft made headlines with its substantial acquisition of a significant stake in OpenAI back in 2019, initially investing $1 billion. Since then, the company has invested an additional $10 billion into this partnership. Beyond this major investment, it has also made several other notable investments in cloud computing and AI in recent months.\n\nJust in the past two months, Microsoft announced a series of strategic investments: $2.9 billion in Japan to open a research center in Tokyo, $1.5 billion in the United Arab Emirates for a stake in AI company G42 and infrastructure and $3.3 billion in Wisconsin to build a manufacturing-focused AI research lab, among others. More recently, the company announced it they will invest $3.2 billion to expand its cloud and artificial intelligence infrastructure in Sweden over a two-year period. Additionally, Microsoft's venture capital fund, M12, has taken positions in several private AI companies. One of the most notable moves was a $650 million stake in Inflection AI, co-founded by Mustafa Suleyman and LinkedIn co-founder Reid Hoffman. Suleyman, a prominent figure in the AI space, is now the head of AI at Microsoft.\n\nFigure 4: Generative AI to become a $1.3 trillion market by 2032 (according to a Bloomberg study) Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSouce: Bloomberg\n\nWith the generative AI market expected to exceed $1 trillion in value within the next decade and global IT spending is forecasted to grow at 8% this year, Microsoft is well-positioned to scale its business significantly. These strategic investments provide the company with numerous catalysts to drive growth and solidify its leadership in the AI industry for the foreseeable future.\n\nFinancial performance and outlook\n\nIn its earnings report for the third quarter of 2024, which was released last month, Microsoft reported a remarkable 17.1% year-over-year increase in revenue, reaching $61.90 billion. The company's GAAP earnings per share were $2.94. The operating margin expanded significantly from 42.30% to 44.60%, demonstrating substantial improvement for a company of its scale. This growth was achieved despite costs associated with the acquisition of Activision and an accounting change related to the useful life and depreciation of certain data center equipment. Both the top-line and bottom-line results exceeded expectations.\n\nFigure 5: Third-quarter earnings summary Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nA key driver of this performance was the accelerating growth of the Intelligent Cloud segment, Microsoft's largest and fastest-growing business, which saw a 21% year-over-year increase to $26.70 billion, with operating margins expanding to 46.80% (up 4 points). Additionally, search and news advertising revenue grew by 3.30% year over year to $3.13 billion, aided by the market share gains of OpenAI-powered Bing, which reached 3.64% of the search engine market as of April 2024. As a result of these strong performances, Microsoft's quarterly levered free cash flow increased from $13.50 billion to $16.90 billion, despite a $4.30 billion increase in capital expenditures.\n\nFigure 6: Intelligent Cloud segment revenue and operating income performance Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nRevenue growth is crucial for Microsoft's future success, particularly as the costs of training new AI models and improving Azure, its primary AI delivery method, continue to rise. The company has demonstrated robust growth over the past few years, with mid-teens growth in 2020, 2021 and 2022. Looking ahead to the fourth quarter of 2024, Microsoft is expected to continue exceeding expectations, with projected revenue of $64.40 billion, indicating 14.60% year over year expected growth. Adjusted earnings per share are anticipated to grow from $2.69 to $2.93, reflecting improved operating leverage. A significant driver of this growth is its flagship AI product, Copilot, which has been instrumental in scaling subscriptions and generating sales. As Copilot gains traction, Microsoft has announced new functions for its AI assistant, which could create new streams of recurring revenue. Additionally, the integration of GPT-4o into Bing is expected to attract more users and expand Microsoft's share in the search market. Bing recently captured over 10% of the search market, suggesting that Google's monopoly is being challenged.\n\nAccording to management guidance, full-year operating margins are expected to increase by over 2 points despite cloud and AI investments, the impact of the Activision acquisition and changes in useful life accounting. This margin expansion highlights Microsoft's efficiency and disciplined cost management, with expectations for continued growth in cloud and AI investments next year, which are high-margin revenue streams. The same trajectory of margin improvement is anticipated into 2025, driven by these factors.\n\nBeyond the impressive revenue and margin figures, Microsoft's free cash flow is a standout financial strength. The company is cash-rich with an $80 billion cash pile supporting its acquisition and talent hiring strategies. Last 12 months free cash flow generation reached $70.57 billion (up 22.90% sequentially), enabling aggressive partnerships and M&A activities, including the recent $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard. While there was a reduction last year, the company is on track to outperform and increase its free cash flow this year, providing ample resources for future acquisitions. The gap between cash from operations and free cash flow has widened as management has invested heavily in cloud and AI infrastructure, suggesting that FCF could expand much faster in the medium to long term once the infrastructure build-out is completed.\n\nFigure 7: CFO, FCF and capex progression  Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: Microsoft Investor Relations\n\nMicrosoft has committed substantial resources to research and development and capital expenditures, with last 12-month R&D expenses of $28.19 billion (up 3.20% sequentially) and capital expenditures of $39.54 billion (up 51.9% sequentially). These investments ensure Microsoft remains well-capitalized to pursue growth opportunities. Management's commitment to sustaining momentum in the cloud and AI business is evident from the rapid ramp-up in investments in these areas.\n\nAs of the end of the third quarter, Microsoft had $80 billion in cash and short-term investments and $65.44 billion in long-term debt. The company's debt-to-Ebitda ratio stands at 0.60, indicating strong financial health and the ability to pay down its long-term debt efficiently.\n\nThoughts on valuation\n\nAlthough Microsoft has significant potential upside if its generative AI goals go according to plan, the stock is currently not the most affordable despite being a sensible long-term investment. It is important to note long-term plays often require substantial time to yield returns. Despite the numerous growth catalysts in its favor, the current share price offers little margin of safety to warrant a bullish rating at this juncture. While Microsoft's business has performed exceptionally well and is likely to continue thriving, there are questions about whether it is prudent to purchase shares at the current levels. Various valuation methods indicate that none provide a sufficient margin to justify buying at the current price. Even with aggressive estimates for Microsoft's growth rates, margins and free cash flow generation, it is challenging to justify a long position solely based on fundamentals.\n\nFigure 8: Microsoft's current valuations lack sufficient upside margins Microsoft: Leading the AI Revolution\n\nSource: valueinvesting.io\n\nFurther, Microsoft might face more intense competition in its AI business from both large companies within the Magnificent Seven and smaller, emerging players. Although the tech company is perceived as an AI leader today, this may not hold true five or 10 years from now. Additionally, economic uncertainties persist, with inflation remaining high and the possibility of the Federal Reserve raising interest rates still on the table. Microsoft's substantial spending on building its cloud platform and AI tools could be viewed unfavorably by investors if the economy deteriorates.\n\nGiven these factors, I am not assigning a buy rating to Microsoft's shares at the current price. Therefore, I recommend a hold on the stock and will monitor the price action closely. Should there be any negative movements while the current fundamentals persist, it might swing my recommendation to a buy at a lower price.\n\nConclusion\n\nMicrosoft's impressive financial performance, strategic investments in AI and cloud computing and robust growth outlook underscore its potential for long-term success. However, given the current valuation and economic uncertainties, the stock lacks a sufficient margin of safety to justify a bullish rating at present.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

(NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n\"Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is experiencing a surge in profitability, reflected in significantly higher retail profit margins. Strategic cost reductions in headcount and fulfillment have materialized into financial gains. While the unexpected pandemic-driven demand surge necessitated a rapid expansion of fulfillment infrastructure, this initially impacted operating profits. However, current unit sales growth has effectively reached equilibrium with fulfillment capacity. This balance is leading to positive adjustments to both earnings and intrinsic value estimates.

        "title": "With 63% ownership of the shares, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is heavily dominated by institutional owners",
        "content": "Key Insights\n\nSignificantly high institutional ownership implies Amazon.com's stock price is sensitive to their trading actions The top 25 shareholders own 47% of the company 11% of Amazon.com is held by insiders\n\nTo get a sense of who is truly in control of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), it is important to understand the ownership structure of the business. The group holding the most number of shares in the company, around 63% to be precise, is institutions. In other words, the group stands to gain the most (or lose the most) from their investment into the company.\n\nSince institutional have access to huge amounts of capital, their market moves tend to receive a lot of scrutiny by retail or individual investors. Therefore, a good portion of institutional money invested in the company is usually a huge vote of confidence on its future.\n\nLet's take a closer look to see what the different types of shareholders can tell us about Amazon.com.\n\nView our latest analysis for Amazon.com  ownership-breakdown\n\nWhat Does The Institutional Ownership Tell Us About Amazon.com?\n\nInstitutional investors commonly compare their own returns to the returns of a commonly followed index. So they generally do consider buying larger companies that are included in the relevant benchmark index.\n\nAmazon.com already has institutions on the share registry. Indeed, they own a respectable stake in the company. This suggests some credibility amongst professional investors. But we can't rely on that fact alone since institutions make bad investments sometimes, just like everyone does. When multiple institutions own a stock, there's always a risk that they are in a 'crowded trade'. When such a trade goes wrong, multiple parties may compete to sell stock fast. This risk is higher in a company without a history of growth. You can see Amazon.com's historic earnings and revenue below, but keep in mind there's always more to the story. earnings-and-revenue-growth\n\nSince institutional investors own more than half the issued stock, the board will likely have to pay attention to their preferences. Amazon.com is not owned by hedge funds. Because actions speak louder than words, we consider it a good sign when insiders own a significant stake in a company. In Amazon.com's case, its Top Key Executive, Jeffrey Bezos, is the largest shareholder, holding 9.0% of shares outstanding. The Vanguard Group, Inc. is the second largest shareholder owning 7.6% of common stock, and BlackRock, Inc. holds about 6.1% of the company stock.\n\nOur studies suggest that the top 25 shareholders collectively control less than half of the company's shares, meaning that the company's shares are widely disseminated and there is no dominant shareholder.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile studying institutional ownership for a company can add value to your research, it is also a good practice to research analyst recommendations to get a deeper understand of a stock's expected performance. Quite a few analysts cover the stock, so you could look into forecast growth quite easily.\n\nInsider Ownership Of Amazon.com\n\nThe definition of company insiders can be subjective and does vary between jurisdictions. Our data reflects individual insiders, capturing board members at the very least. The company management answer to the board and the latter should represent the interests of shareholders. Notably, sometimes top-level managers are on the board themselves.\n\nMost consider insider ownership a positive because it can indicate the board is well aligned with other shareholders. However, on some occasions too much power is concentrated within this group.\n\nOur information suggests that insiders maintain a significant holding in Amazon.com, Inc.. Insiders own US$207b worth of shares in the US$1.9t company. That's quite meaningful. Most would say this shows a good degree of alignment with shareholders, especially in a company of this size. You can  click here to see if those insiders have been buying or selling.\n\nGeneral Public Ownership\n\nWith a 26% ownership, the general public, mostly comprising of individual investors, have some degree of sway over Amazon.com. This size of ownership, while considerable, may not be enough to change company policy if the decision is not in sync with other large shareholders.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nIt's always worth thinking about the different groups who own shares in a company. But to understand Amazon.com better, we need to consider many other factors.\n\nI always like to check for a history of revenue growth. You can too, by accessing this free chart of historic revenue and earnings in this detailed graph.\n\nBut ultimately  it is the future, not the past, that will determine how well the owners of this business will do. Therefore we think it advisable to take a look at this free report showing whether analysts are predicting a brighter future.\n\nNB: Figures in this article are calculated using data from the last twelve months, which refer to the 12-month period ending on the last date of the month the financial statement is dated.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Mega-cap technology stocks will see a \"material\" increase in expenditures in 2024 as they push to build out their artificial intelligence capabilities, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities.\n\nIn a note to clients on Monday, the analysts predicted that Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Facebook-parent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), and e-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) will see annual capital spending on servers and equipment jump by 43% compared to the prior year to $91 billion. Overall estimated expenditures will rise by 35% year on year to $145 billion, the analysts projected.\n\nOf the three companies, the BofA analysts said they expect Meta to spend the most as a percentage of revenue, adding that the investment \"should ensure [its] AI capabilities are best of breed.\" Investors will subsequently be keen to see if Meta can churn out any new products from its AI spending, the analysts noted.\n\nThey said markets should also be looking for employee reductions at these firms to help offset the impact of the higher expenditures, with the rate of workforce growth tipped to slow to an average yearly uptick of 3%. From 2016 to 2022, headcount grew by 26% on average.\n\nDespite forecasting the surge in spending, the analysts retained their positive view of the AI cycle for the tech industry, saying they anticipated that average free cash flow margins for Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon will be stable in 2024 and expand in 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMega-cap tech stocks to see steep jump in annual spending on AI equipment - BofA\n\nEU regulators to decide on Bunge and Viterra's $34 billion deal by July 18\n\nEarnings call: MSC Industrial Supply revises full-year outlook amid sales dip\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - Goldman Sachs has lifted its year-end target price on the benchmark S&P 500 index, citing strong earnings growth, particularly from the mega-cap tech stocks, and increased fair value.\n\nThe bank now sees the S&P 500 ending the year at 5600, up from its previous target of 5200, offering around 3% from Friday’s 5431.60 closing price.\n\nThe aggregate S&P 500 index has returned 15% since the start of the year, with five stocks accounting for 60% of the aggregate index’s year to date return - Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nThese stocks have collectively surged by 45% and now comprise 25% of the S&P 500 equity cap, according to analysts at Goldman Sachs, in a note dated June 14.\n\nThe drivers of the rally include upward revisions to consensus 2024 earnings estimates for these same tech companies, and valuation expansion stemming from increased investor enthusiasm about artificial intelligence.\n\nThe five companies listed above posted 1Q year/year EPS growth of 84% vs 5% for the typical S&P 500 stock, prompting analysts to raise their 2024 EPS forecasts by 38% for these five tech stocks. In contrast, the profit forecast for the other 495 stocks in the index have been reduced by 5%.\n\nConsensus 2024 forecasts imply a 31 percentage point gap between EPS growth for these five stocks and the median S&P 500 firm (37% vs. 6%), Goldman said, but this gap is expected to narrow to 8 percentage points in 2025 and 4 percentage points in 2026.\n\nThe bank now expects the current bottom-up consensus 2025 EPS estimate will be lowered by just 2% through year-end, half the average historical revision.\n\n“We expect revisions to consensus S&P 500 EPS estimates will continue to be milder-than-average through year-end given the upward revisions to mega-cap tech earnings that have already taken place this year,” the bank said.\n\n“However, we maintain our earnings forecasts for 2024, as we believe consensus margin estimates for next year remain too optimistic.”\n\nLooking ahead, the bank's valuation model suggests the S&P 500 P/E will be 20.4x by year-end, 3% below the current multiple of 21.1x. Strong consensus 2025 earnings growth and a roughly unchanged real yield imply a year-end 2024 fair value P/E multiple of 15x for the equal-weight S&P 500.\n\nThe election remains a key risk to the S&P 500 level and falls between our 3-month and year-end forecast horizons, the bank said.\n\nHistorically, during election years index volatility has increased before the election and the S&P 500 index has declined by 4% between late October and early November. Nevertheless, volatility typically subsides and the index rebounds to an even higher level following the election.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks edged higher; BOE meeting, inflation data due this week\n\nUBS sets aside $900 million to repay investors in collapsed Greensill funds\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Most Liberal State in the US",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Most Liberal States in the US and in this article, we will talk about 20 Most Liberal states in the US.\n\nOverview of Liberalism in the United States and Its Stronghold in Massachusetts\n\nThe United States has been a major proponent and defender of liberal values globally, although its commitment to upholding these values has fluctuated over time. Since the 1930s, modern liberalism in the US has been associated with support for a regulated market economy, expansion of civil and political rights, and government programs aimed at promoting social welfare and equality. Key achievements of this liberal tradition include the New Deal policies under Franklin D. Roosevelt, the Great Society programs under Lyndon B. Johnson, and landmark civil rights legislation like the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\n\nThe University of Richmond claims that political usage of the term \"liberalism\" dates back to the early 1800s. It first appeared in 1810–1811 when a group of Spanish Cortes dubbed themselves \"Liberales\" and promoted an open, tolerant society with less intervention. The phrase then made its way to France and Great Britain, where, by the 1840s, the Whigs had transformed into the Liberal Party.\n\nAccording to Pew Research Center research, conservatives want big homes in rural or small-town settings, preferably with other members of their own religious community. Liberals, on the other hand, want thriving urban environments with compact housing, pedestrian-friendly streets, and a diversified populace. According to the survey, 35% of consistently conservative people prefer small towns, while 41% of people prefer living in rural areas. On the other hand, 46% of consistently liberal people would rather live in the city. In both groups, about 20% prefer living in the suburbs.\n\nAs the most liberal state in the union, Massachusetts has always supported the Democratic Party in presidential elections since 1964, with 35% of its citizens identifying as liberal. Only 16% of Massachusetts lawmakers' votes in 2020 reflected conservative viewpoints on topics including corporate tax increases and abortion access, according to a report by the Center for Legislative Accountability, making them the most liberal in the country.\n\nMajor Liberal Companies\n\nCompanies like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE), and Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), among others, are known for their liberalism. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) supports LGBTQ+ rights and offers comprehensive benefits for transgender employees. In 2022, Amazon's global activities resulted in a total tax contribution of $77.99 billion across different regions. Amazon has invested over $530 billion in the U.S. over the past decade, creating 1.6 million indirect jobs. Small and medium businesses make up 60% of Amazon's product sales, creating an estimated 2.2 million jobs. In Q1 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s net sales increased 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion and AWS revenue growth accelerated to 17.2% year-over-year, up from 13.2% in Q4 2023. Their Advertising revenue grew over 23% year-over-year to $11.7 billion in the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nNIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE) has often been portrayed as a progressive and liberal company, particularly after its controversial ad campaign featuring Colin Kaepernick in 2018. In the 2018 election cycle, Nike employees and its PAC contributed $424,000 to Republicans compared to only $122,000 to Democrats. This means 78% of Nike's political contributions went to the Republican party. Over the past decade, NIKE, Inc. (NYSE:NKE)has consistently given a majority of its political donations to Republicans, ranging from 59% to 76% in various election cycles. In 2024, Nike Inc. spent $410,000 on lobbying efforts. Nike’s Greater China revenue grew 12% in Q1, with Nike Direct up 10% and Nike Stores up 12%.\n\nLast but not least, Google, the tech giant and subsidiary of Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG), has long been perceived as a liberal-leaning company, particularly due to its employees' political contributions favoring Democratic candidates and causes. In the 2022 election cycle, the Google Inc. PAC contributed $452,000 (52.83%) to Democratic candidates and $401,500 (46.93%) to Republicans. This trend has been observed in previous election cycles as well, with Google employees donating $207,650 to federal candidates in 2004, primarily favoring Democrats. In Q1 2024 Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG)'s total revenue was $80.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Their Google Services revenue was $70.4 billion, up 14% YoY, Google Cloud revenue was $9.6 billion, up 28% YoY, and YouTube Ads revenue was $8 billion, up 21%. YoY. The Most Liberal State in the US\n\nPixabay/Public domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we ranked the most liberal states based on their liberal-to-conservative ratios, using the percentages available from 2019 due to the absence of more recent data. For example, if a state has 35% of its population identifying as liberal and 21% as conservative, the ratio is calculated as 35/21, resulting in approximately 1.6. States with the highest ratios are considered the most liberal.\n\n1. Massachusetts\n\nLiberal-to-Conservative Ratio: 1.60\n\nMassachusetts tops the list for being the most liberal state in the US. 35% of the state's population identifies as liberals which is the highest in the country. In contrast, only 21% identify as conservative. The state has liberal policies on abortion rights, with the procedure legal up to 24 weeks of pregnancy. It also has strict gun control laws, including an assault weapons ban and regulations on purchasing and licensing firearms. The state is largely known for its robust social safety net, including universal healthcare coverage through its healthcare reform law that served as a model for the Affordable Care Act. Both U.S. Senators from Massachusetts are Democrats (Elizabeth Warren and Ed Markey).\n\nTo learn about other most liberal states in the US, you can check out our detailed report 20 Most Liberal States in the US.

        "title": "6 Artficial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Worth Over $1 Trillion. Here Are the 2 Most Likely to Join the Club Next.",
        "content": "Take a look at a list of the largest companies in the world based on market cap, and you might notice a common thread for most of them: The biggest members of the group have bet heavily on artificial intelligence (AI). And those bets seem to be paying off.\n\nCurrently, six AI stocks are worth over $1 trillion. They could have company in the not-too-distant future. Here are the top six -- and the two AI stocks most likely to join the club next.\n\nThe $1 trillion six-pack\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are in a close race to be the world's biggest company. Both of their market caps hover around $3.3 trillion.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Apple could be left in the dust in the race to develop AI technology. Its Siri AI assistant seemed almost antiquated compared to new large language models (LLMs).\n\nHowever, Apple's recent launch of new generative AI capabilities has changed the narrative. Some think the new Apple Intelligence features might even spark an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nMicrosoft has benefited tremendously from its relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant's cloud business has especially grown thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind. The company's introduction of AI-powered Copilot+ PCs should also provide a nice boost to its operating system sales.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is nipping at Apple's and Microsoft's heels with a market cap of around $3.2 trillion. The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has been the poster child of the AI boom over the last 18 months. Nvidia's forthcoming rollout of its Blackwell GPU architecture could keep it at the top of the AI chip market.\n\nWe could say that Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are in the second tier of megacap AI stocks. Alphabet's market cap is around $2.2 trillion, while Amazon's is slightly under $2 trillion.\n\nBoth companies, like Microsoft, are cloud service providers. Generative AI could be the strongest growth driver for the cloud so far. Both Alphabet and Amazon are using AI to increase revenue in their core non-cloud businesses (search for Alphabet and e-commerce for Amazon). They're also hoping to be winners in self-driving car technology -- Alphabet with its Waymo unit and Amazon with Zoox.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) lags behind the other AI leaders with a market cap of close to $1.3 trillion. The company uses AI extensively throughout its social media apps, including Facebook and Instagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted in late 2023 that AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext in the club\n\nWhich AI companies are in the best position to join these six in the $1 trillion club? My votes go to Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nBroadcom's market cap now stands close to $780 billion. The stock surged last week after the semiconductor maker reported great fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. Revenue jumped 43% year over year, driven primarily by its acquisition of VMware and strong demand for its networking products in AI data centers.\n\nThe company also announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. Although this split won't impact Broadcom's underlying business, it could make the stock more attractive to retail investors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's market cap of around $740 billion isn't too far behind Broadcom's. The company makes chips for many of the top AI leaders, including Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom.\n\nAs its name indicates, the company is based in Taiwan. However, it expects to begin production at its first advanced chip fabrication facility in Arizona next year. It's also building another fab plant in that state, with plans for a third. These investments could cement the company's status as the go-to chipmaker for the world's best AI companies.\n\nAre Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor smart picks?\n\nWhile I predict Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor will be the next AI stocks with market caps of $1 trillion or more, I don't know how long they will take to reach that threshold. But I think both are smart stocks to buy right now for aggressive growth investors.\n\nIncome investors and value investors will probably want to look elsewhere. Neither stock is cheap. Although both pay dividends, their yields are only in the ballpark of 1.4% -- not enough to entice many income investors.\n\nIf you're looking for growth, though, and don't mind potential volatility, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could be great fits. I expect both stocks to continue to beat the market in the coming years as the adoption of AI increases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Could This Bull Market Buy Help You Become a Millionaire?",
        "content": "Shares in Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have soared more than 1,000% over the past decade, likely creating more than a few millionaires. The company's business exploded as its e-commerce site became the go-to for online shoppers in dozens of countries, and it has expanded to high-growth industries like cloud computing with its platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nWall Street has grown particularly bullish about the company since the start of 2023, with Amazon's stock up about 45% year over year. The company's growth has followed a trend prevalent throughout the market, as the S&P 500 is up 25% over the last 12 months after entering a bull market in 2022.\n\nMeanwhile, easing inflation and the emergence of budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) indicate that Amazon still has plenty of room left to run.\n\nSo, could this bull market buy help you become a millionaire? Let's find out.\n\nAmazon is heavily investing in the most profitable part of its business\n\nAmazon is best known for its online retail website, which accounts for more than 80% of its revenue. Its e-commerce business remains lucrative for the company, with sales in its North American and international segments rising 12% and 10% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. Meanwhile, operating income between the two segments hit a combined total of $6 billion after reporting losses of $349 million last year.\n\nHowever, despite stellar growth in retail, AWS remains Amazon's most lucrative division. The cloud platform posted revenue gains of 17% year over year in Q1 2024, with operating income climbing 84%. And although it earned the lowest portion of revenue between Amazon's three primary segments, AWS was responsible for more than 60% of its profit.\n\nAs a result, Amazon is investing heavily in expanding AWS. The company is opening new data centers around the world, with recent reports revealing it will invest billions over the next 15 years into building data centers in Taiwan. Taiwan is a crucial market for cloud and AI growth, with Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing producing AI chips for a large portion of the industry.\n\nThe announcement comes after AWS disclosed plans to spend nearly $13 billion by 2030 on data center infrastructure in India, another high-growth market.\n\nThe AI market is projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030. Meanwhile, AWS has massive potential in the industry as businesses increasingly turn to cloud services to boost productivity with the help of AI. AWS will likely continue to boost Amazon's business.\n\nStory continues\n\nA cash-rich company that is trading at a bargain right now\n\nAmazon's operating income has skyrocketed more than 1,300% since last June, while free cash flow has nearly doubled. The company's cash reserves are quickly expanding, making its stock one of the most reliable buys. More cash means Amazon is better equipped to overcome potential headwinds and keep expanding in lucrative markets like AI.\n\nAs a result, Amazon could be one of the best companies to invest in AI right now, with its leading market share in cloud computing and the funds to invest in its business while retaining dominance over competitors like Alphabet, Microsoft, and Apple. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, despite significant stock price growth over the last year, Amazon is potentially trading at a bargain. This chart shows the company has the lowest price-to-sales ratio and price/earnings-to-growth ratio among some of the most prominent names in the AI software market. The figures indicate Amazon's stock is offering the most value out of these four companies.\n\nGiven its booming retail business, a leading position in cloud computing, and the financial resources to go far in AI, Amazon's stock is a no-brainer, and could help you become a millionaire with the right investment.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "With its shares up 23% year to date, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has finally bounced back from its post-pandemic slump. The recovery hinged on streamlining its e-commerce business and pivoting to exciting new growth drivers like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nLet's explore how these dynamics can continue to unfold over the next three years.\n\nA leaner and meaner Amazon\n\nWhile layoffs and cost-cutting can invoke a feeling of dread for middle managers and other replaceable employees, they can be great news to investors who want a more streamlined and profitable company. For Amazon, these controversial efforts are delivering in a big way.\n\nThe company's first-quarter revenue increased by a modest 13% year over year to $143.3 billion, but operating income surged more than 200% to $15.3 billion. Many of these improvements came from unlocking efficiencies in North American and international e-commerce, which had previously suffered from weak margins because of pandemic-era overexpansion under Amazon's former CEO, Jeff Bezos.\n\nThe new CEO, Andy Jassy, is extensively cutting costs. He also isn't just chasing short-term profits.\n\nAnd Jassy is refocusing the company on what historically made it so successful in the first place: the customer experience. In the first quarter, Amazon achieved its fastest-ever delivery speeds, with nearly 60% of Prime members' orders arriving within two days in the country's 60 largest metro areas.\n\nAnd in major international cities including London, Tokyo, and Toronto, three out of four items arrived within two days.\n\nInvestors shouldn't expect the massive e-commerce business to be a big growth driver over the next three years. But the company can leverage its scale and operational efficiencies to maintain its dominant position, keeping customers satisfied while delivering reliable profits to investors.\n\nMedium-term growth drivers\n\nOver the next three years, the company's prospects will depend on how well it can monetize generative artificial intelligence (AI). It has developed a picks-and-shovels business model that provides the computing power and foundational models for its Amazon Web Services (AWS) clients to build consumer-facing applications. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nFirst-quarter AWS sales jumped 17% year over year to $25 billion. And the cloud computing segment continues to contribute an outsize share of Amazon's operating income, with $9.4 billion of the $15.3 billion (63%) generated in the period.\n\nNew AI-related services like Amazon Bedrock -- which allows AWS clients to build consumer-facing AI applications using the provided foundational models -- will help power continued growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is also integrating AI into other aspects of its business, including customer service; image generation for ads; and the Alexa virtual assistant, which it plans to update with AI features and re-release this year for a monthly subscription fee. None of these efforts will make a big impact alone, but they could create a flywheel effect, with many small wins compounding on one another to generate significant momentum.\n\nIs Amazon stock a buy?\n\nWith its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 40, Amazon stock is more expensive than the Nasdaq 100 average of 31, which is a large premium to pay for a mature company that is no longer rapidly scaling up its business.\n\nWith that said, Amazon's ongoing cost-cutting could lead to continued profitability improvements, even as growth in e-commerce sales slows. The company's cloud computing division, AWS, also remains an exciting opportunity for high-margin expansion. Thus, shares look capable of outperforming the market over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Top Stocks That Billionaires Are Buying",
        "content": "Following the stock picks of billionaire investors can be a good way to find winners in the stock market. After all, these investors achieved their wealth through a successful career of earning above-average returns for their clients.\n\nThree Motley Fool contributors have identified three promising stocks that some of the world's billionaire-level investors bought in the first quarter of 2024. Here's why Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Opendoor Technologies(NASDAQ: OPEN), and Sea Limited(NYSE: SE) could be attractive buys right now.\n\nArtificial intelligence is the next growth driver\n\nJennifer Saibil (Amazon): Amazon stock has generated incredible returns over the past three decades, but there's so much more still to come from this perennial winner. That's why it should come as no surprise that it's owned by several billionaire investors.\n\nSome examples are Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who owns 9.9 million shares as of the end of the first quarter, and Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors, who owns 6.6 million shares.\n\nAmazon is the second-largest U.S. company when measured by sales and the fifth-largest by market cap. But these billionaires know that there's a lot more coming.\n\nThe latest trend driving interest in Amazon stock is artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon announced major initiatives in generative AI last year, and it's working with top AI names like Nvidia and Anthropic to develop foundational models (GPT-4 is a famous example) and offer high-level generative AI services.\n\nMost of the talk about Amazon's generative AI tools is connected to Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's cloud computing business. These tools help AWS clients with a broad range of services that make it easier and faster to run their businesses, from building their own large language models (LLMs) to plug-in tools for the technology layman.\n\nAmazon is also using AI in its e-commerce segment -- in fact, it has been for decades. The tech titan has collected millions of data points about its shoppers' habits and can offer targeted product recommendations. It also uses AI throughout its delivery network to get orders packaged and fulfilled in the fastest and most cost-efficient way.\n\nAmazon deploys AI to offer similarly targeted results for advertisers, and third-party clients can use its advertising platform to reach customers who are already looking to buy their products. Amazon recently launched an ad-supported streaming tier for its Prime streaming viewers, and it's utilizing the power of AI to work with its advertising clients in video channels.\n\nStory continues\n\nThere is plenty of room for Amazon to run, and new ventures present massive high-growth opportunities for the incredibly profitable tech giant.\n\nCan this real estate stock make a comeback?\n\nJeremy Bowman (Opendoor Technologies): Opendoor Technologies has mostly been a disappointment since it went public in 2020 through a special purpose acquisition company. In fact, that's probably an understatement.\n\nOpendoor is now down 94% from its peak shortly after it went public as the housing market has ground to a halt in the years since, with mortgage rates soaring and homebuyers sitting on the sidelines waiting for prices and rates to come down.\n\nHowever, that deep discount might be one reason why billionaires have been eyeing the stock lately. A number of them scooped up shares of the home-flipper in the first quarter, including Steve Cohen's Point72 Asset Management, which bought 6.2 million shares of Opendoor, and Ken Griffin's Citadel Capital, which bought more than 5 million shares of the real estate stock.\n\nThose hedge fund managers may be responding to Opendoor's efforts to cut costs and rightsize the business, which has moved it much closer to profitability, or they could be betting that interest rates will soon come down.\n\nThose hopes seemed to take a blow on Wednesday after the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady and lowered its forecast for interest rate cuts this year to just one down from three in its previous \"dot plot\" in March. However, interest rates are likely to come down eventually, and when they do, Opendoor should be ready to take advantage, because it's a natural beneficiary of rising home prices. If the company continues to streamline its business in the meantime, the stock could move a lot higher once housing market conditions become more favorable.\n\nThis e-commerce stock is up 83% this year\n\nJohn Ballard (Sea Limited): Chase Coleman's Tiger Global Management delivered annualized returns of 21% through its first two decades, according to Forbes. Coleman's net worth is estimated at $5.7 billion, and in the first quarter, his firm was adding to its position in leading e-commerce and digital entertainment company Sea Limited.\n\nSingapore-based Sea Limited saw its revenue slow significantly in 2022 as competition intensified amid a challenging macroeconomic backdrop. But Sea's valuable logistics infrastructure and scale will allow the company to weather the storm and keep growing. Its digital entertainment properties, including its leading mobile title Free Fire, have a massive user base of 595 million.\n\nSea was growing revenue at triple-digit rates just a few years ago, and it's starting to turn the corner. The stock is up 83% year to date, supported by a strong first-quarter earnings report. Management expects its Shopee business to maintain market share in 2024 -- a sign that the competitive environment is stabilizing.\n\nThe average Wall Street analyst expects Sea's earnings per share to reach $5.67 in 2026. If the stock is still trading at the same price-to-earnings ratio, the shares would be worth roughly $210, implying upside of 183%.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Warren Buffett Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist and 1 to Avoid",
        "content": "Every investor has stars and duds in their portfolios. Even Warren Buffett is in the group. The good news is, in Buffett's own words, \"Over time, it takes just a few winners to work wonders.\"\n\nStill, it certainly helps to boost your returns if you gravitate toward the stars and stay away from the duds. This applies to stocks in Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway portfolio, too. Here are two Buffett stocks to buy hand over fist and one to avoid.\n\nBuy No. 1: Amazon\n\nIf I had to pick the most impressive company Buffett owns a stake in, it would probably be Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). The company has transformed how we shop and how businesses handle technology.\n\nBuffett hasn't bought additional shares of Amazon in quite a while. However, I view the stock as a great pick right now for two primary reasons.\n\nFirst, Amazon's profitability and free cash flow continue to rise significantly. When a company's earnings more than triple year over year, as Amazon's did in Q1, it's on the right track. Even better, Amazon's free cash flow went from negative $3.3 billion over the 12 months ending March 31, 2023 to positive $50.1 billion over the 12 months ending March 31, 2024.\n\nSecond, Amazon has a massive growth opportunity, thanks to the soaring use of artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest cloud services provider. Organizations should continue to migrate rapidly to the cloud to build and deploy AI apps. AWS stands to be one of the biggest beneficiaries of this trend.\n\nBuy No. 2: DaVita\n\nYou might be surprised that DaVita(NYSE: DVA) ranks as one of Buffett's biggest winners so far in 2024. Shares of the kidney dialysis services provider have soared around 36%.\n\nThis sizzling performance doesn't necessarily mean DaVita will keep the momentum going. However, I think it can.\n\nDespite the strong gains, DaVita still sports a reasonable valuation. Its shares trade at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of only 15.4. That's much lower than the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple of 21.3 and the healthcare sector's multiple of 18.9.\n\nDaVita also has a clear path to delivering further growth. In March, the company struck a deal with Fresenius Medical Care to buy its businesses in Brazil, Chile, Colombia, and Ecuador. These acquisitions will make DaVita the biggest dialysis services provider in Latin America.\n\nOne Buffett stock to avoid: Liberty Formula One\n\nBerkshire Hathaway owns several Liberty Media tracking stocks. I think investors will be better off avoiding one of them: Liberty Formula One(NASDAQ: FWON.A)(OTC: FWON.B)(NASDAQ: FWON.K). While Buffett's portfolio only includes the Series C shares that trade under the FWON.K ticker, investors should also stay on the sidelines with the Series A shares trading under the FWON.A ticker and the Series B shares trading over the counter under the FWON.B ticker.\n\nStory continues\n\nLiberty Formula One is the tracking stock for Liberty Media's interests in the Formula One Group. This group operates Formula 1 racing and Quint, which sells tickets to sporting and other events (including Formula 1 races).\n\nSure, Formula One Group's revenue jumped 54% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 to $587 million. The unit also hopes to close on its acquisition of MotoGP by the end of this year.\n\nHowever, the stock trades at a sky-high 48 times forward earnings. There's also less visibility into the underlying business than you'll find with most stocks Buffett owns.\n\nIndeed, Liberty Media acknowledged in its Q1 regulatory filing that the historical financial information of Formula One Group might not reflect the results if it were a separate company. I doubt Buffett would invest Berkshire's money in this stock if it were not part of Liberty Media.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Warren Buffett Has 41% of Berkshire Hathaway's $332 Billion Portfolio in 2 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "At one time, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett avoided technology stocks at all costs, reasoning that he had difficulty grasping complicated technology. The iconic investor was clear about his preferences for investing in \"simple businesses,\" saying, \"If there's lots of technology, we won't understand it.\"\n\nOver the years, however, that stance has changed. Today, more than 41% of Berkshire's equity portfolio is made up of two stocks poised to profit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple -- $135 billion\n\nInvestors who have followed Berkshire Hathaway for any period of time will know that the company's largest AI stock is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). While the initial stake in the iPhone maker was made by one of Buffett's money managers, the so-called \"Oracle of Omaha\" soon saw the attraction and began accumulating shares on his own. To close out the first quarter, Buffett's stake in Apple amounted to 789 million shares worth roughly $135 billion.\n\nWhile Apple has long been on the cutting edge of AI technology, the company kept its plans for generative AI close to the vest -- until recently. At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week, the company ripped the lid off its plans, introducing \"Apple Intelligence,\" a comprehensive strategy to integrate generative AI functionality into a broad cross-section of its products and services. This includes features across messages, photos, notes, and even notifications.\n\nThe most notable development is that Siri will be getting a long-awaited makeover. Not only will the digital assistant get a generative AI boost, but it will also be able to interact with apps on the iPhone and other devices, making it much more useful along the way.\n\nThe company was quick to point out that all this new functionality will come with Apple's characteristic privacy built-in, performing many of the AI processes on-device, helping to protect user information. Access to ChatGPT will be coming later this year, giving users the option to engage the chatbot for specific purposes.\n\nWall Street is almost universal in its delight at Apple's plans. The general consensus is that these improvements will spark an upgrade \"supercycle.\" As many as 270 million of Apple's 1.5 billion active iPhones are at least four years old, and this could be the catalyst behind the next iPhone buying spree.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts that Apple will sell between 225 million and 230 iPhones this year. At an average selling price of more than $900, the company could easily hit a new record for iPhone revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat would be good news for Buffett and thousands of other Apple investors.\n\n2. Amazon -- $1.8 billion\n\nBuffett has admitted that he \"always admired Jeff [Bezos],\" Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) former CEO. He also issued a mea culpa, saying he \"blew it,\" passing up two opportunities to invest in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader. He cited the \"miracle\" of the company's growth as putting him off because \"If I think something is going to be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\"\n\nAt the behest of one of Buffett's money managers, Berkshire Hathaway finally corrected that oversight and now holds a considerable stake in Amazon. The company holds 10 million shares in a stake currently valued at nearly $1.8 billion.\n\nAmazon has a long history of developing advanced algorithms to advance its business, creating tools to recommend products, map out delivery routes, and maintain accurate inventory levels to meet demand.\n\nCurrently, the company offers a suite of AI-powered products and services on its industry-leading cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This represents one of the company's largest opportunities, as infusing AWS with AI-powered features could be a catalyst for future cloud growth.\n\nIs it time to buy?\n\nInvestors were recently alarmed that Berkshire sold 13% of its Apple shares earlier this year. Some believed that Buffett had soured on Apple, but Buffett pushed back on the idea. He said the current corporate tax rate -- currently at 21% -- was historically low, compared to rates of 35% or 52% in recent memory.\n\n\"I would say that at the end of the year, I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett insisted. He went even further, saying that \"unless something really extraordinary happens,\" Berkshire will still hold a significant position in Apple \"when Greg takes over the place.\" Buffett was referring to his designated successor, Greg Abel. This suggests Apple will remain a foundational investor for Berkshire for the foreseeable future.\n\nApple's recent foray into generative AI, the pent-up demand, and the stickiness of its product portfolio suggest that the stock is still a buy.\n\nThe recent economic downturn and ongoing battle with inflation have weighed on Amazon, but the company is on the road to recovery. Its e-commerce business has returned to growth, and demand for its digital advertising and cloud services is on the upswing. Despite recent challenges, it remains the world's largest provider of e-commerce and cloud infrastructure services, which is why Amazon is also a buy.\n\nThe adoption of generative AI continues to accelerate, though no one knows for sure how high it will go. Estimates suggest that generative AI could have an economic impact of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nWith a windfall of that magnitude, Buffett's stake in these AI stocks could be about to get much more valuable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

Check out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nBuilding a Million-Dollar Roth IRA\n\nAccording to a survey by The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), individuals think they need at least $1.8 million to live a comfortable retirement. Based on the figure, it is safe to say that the average American, who has only $120,300 saved up for their retirement, is in for a bumpy ride if they don’t start saving up. Thankfully, there are quite a few ways through which an individual can stack up a million dollars in retirement. One such example is through a Roth IRA.\n\nA Roth IRA is a special type of Individual Retirement Account (IRA) in which an individual pays taxes on their contributions, and then receives all future withdrawals tax-free. Many individuals believe that contribution limits imposed by the IRS make it difficult to build up a fat nest egg for retirement through such accounts. However, that’s where they are wrong. This is because with consistency, and with the power of compounding, it is quite easy to be a retirement millionaire yourself.\n\nSo how is it possible to raise over a million dollars in your Roth IRA? More importantly, why is a million-dollar Roth IRA so attractive to retirees? The answer lies in its tax-free withdrawals. Since a Roth IRA requires after-tax contributions, an individual who has amassed over a million dollars in retirement will be able to enjoy it tax-free in their retirement years.  However, there are many things that can go wrong with a Roth IRA. For this reason, we have compiled a list of all the mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA. Before we move on to that, let’s get back to the question: how to build a million dollar Roth IRA account?\n\nWhich Stocks to Add to Your Retirement Portfolio\n\nWe at Insider Monkey recently compiled a list of the Best Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold in 2024. To compile the list of the top 5, we ranked the holdings of Vanguard Growth ETF by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q4 2023 and chose the top 5. These top stocks were chosen based on hedge fund sentiments, where the top consensus stock picks outperformed the S&P 500 Index by more than 140 percentage points over the last 10 years.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues\n\nBased on our list, the top five growth stocks to buy and hold on to are NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT). The top growth stock to buy and hold is Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), the world’s largest personal computing operating system provider. The company boasts strong financials and significant growth potential, with Azure, AI integration, and its diversified business model being the key drivers of the company’s revenues and profitability. Undoubtedly, the stock is a strong buy and hold, with shares having popped up 35% since May 2023. Posting its Q3 2024 earnings, the company’s revenue rose by 17% year-over-year to $62 billion, $1 billion higher than analyst expectations. One Major Mistake to Avoid with Your Roth IRA\n\nMethodology\n\nTo compile a list of mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, we consulted a number of sources such as The Charles Schwab Corporation (NYSE:SCHW), Bankrate, Investopedia, and District Capital Management, to name a few. A consensus approach was adopted to choose the top 11 mistakes to avoid with your Roth IRA, with one point awarded each time it was recommended by a source. Mistakes have been ranked in an ascending order based on the number of times recommended.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nHere are the 11 Mistakes to Avoid with Your Roth IRA:\n\n1. Failing to Invest Your Roth IRA Funds\n\nBased on our methodology, one major mistake to avoid with your Roth IRA is failing to invest your Roth IRA funds. A Roth IRA is an Individual Retirement Account where an individual contributes their after-tax dollars. However, many individuals believe contributing to a Roth IRA is an investment in itself when it is not. Just because an individual contributes to a Roth IRA doesn’t mean that the money is automatically invested. In fact, an individual must go into the account, select the investments, and then manage them. This is the best advice for a Roth IRA. Some popular investments for Roth IRAs are stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange-traded Funds (ETFs), Target-date Funds (TDFs), and Real estate investment trusts (REITs). However, it is not allowed to invest in collectibles in a Roth IRA. This includes automobiles, artwork, stamps, rugs, and other items.\n\nCheck out all the Major Mistakes to Avoid with your Roth IRA.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best places to retire to the best AI travel apps; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks. Currently, Artificial Intelligence (AI) technology stands out as one of the most promising fields.

        "content": "Retirement may feel distant, but it’s important to save up now. Accumulating more money will give you more choices when you are ready to retire. Even if you want to work forever, extra cash gives you more options about the type of work that you pursue.\n\nRetirement stocks can help investors reach their long-term financial goals sooner. Capital gains and dividends can lead to a higher net worth. Solid retirement stocks like the ones on this list can generate those results. These stocks have impressive records and have been around for a while. There’s a time and place for high-risk, high-reward investment opportunities, but retirement stocks tend to offer more stability.\n\nInvestors should look for companies with multiple decades of experience, rising revenue, and improving profit margins. These components are the foundation for many top-tier retirement stocks. The stock market offers many choices, but investors who want stability and have multi-decade time horizons may want to consider these picks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlphabet (GOOGL) GOOG stock: letters spelling out google\n\nSource: rvlsoft / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) combines value with growth. The tech giant trades at a 27.5x price-to-earnings ratio while offering a 0.45% yield for investors. Shares are up by 27% year to date and gained 226% over the past five years.\n\nWhile the company makes most of its revenue from advertising, Google Cloud has become a larger segment of the corporation’s business model. Google Cloud made up over 10% of the company’s revenue in the first quarter. The quarter also featured 15% revenue growth from a year ago and 57% net income growth.\n\nAlphabet’s net income should continue to exhibit an elevated growth rate as the company trims costs and becomes more efficient. Artificial intelligence can also lead to more revenue growth for the company. Gemini is Alphabet’s response to ChatGPT, and AI can also increase demand for cloud computing platforms. A potential acquisition of HubSpot (NYSE:HUBS) would expand Alphabet’s offerings and can help the company reach new heights.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website. Focus on top-center of phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdstrike’s (NASDAQ:CRWD) current valuation doesn’t resemble a retirement stock. The company trades at a P/E ratio north of 700x, but its 87x forward P/E ratio makes it look more reasonable.\n\nCrowdstrike continues to achieve impressive revenue growth while many competitors are struggling. Revenue increased by 33% year over year to reach $921 million in the first quarter of fiscal 2025. Annual recurring revenue grew at the same rate, reaching $3.65 billion. Crowdstrike’s annual recurring revenue gives it a good foundation to deliver compelling growth rates.\n\nStory continues\n\nNet income has been surging for the cybersecurity firm, and that can result in a more favorable P/E ratio for patient investors. Crowdstrike reported $500,000 in GAAP net income in Q1 2023. Meanwhile, GAAP net income came to $42.8 million in Q1 2024. Companies will have to invest more money to strengthen their digital defenses. Crowdstrike looks like a top beneficiary of this trend, and investors with a five- to 10-year horizon can be greatly rewarded.\n\nTexas Roadhouse (TXRH) An outside and closeup view of a Texas Roadhouse, Inc. (TXRH) sign\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nTexas Roadhouse (NYSE:TXRH) is a steakhouse restaurant chain with fast-food restaurants. The company presents “growth at a reasonable price,” as it trades at a P/E ratio of 34x. Other fast-growing restaurant stocks have much higher P/E ratios. Texas Roadhouse stock is up by 42% in 2024 and has more than tripled over the past five years. Investors receive a 1.4% yield while they wait for the stock price to rally.\n\nRecent financial results suggest Texas Roadhouse can continue with its growth streak. Revenue increased by 12.5% year over year in the first quarter while net income sprang up by 31.4% year over year. Texas Roadhouse commanded an 8.4% year-over-year increase in comparable restaurant sales at company-owned restaurants. Comparable franchise restaurant sales were up by 7.7% year over year.\n\nTexas Roadhouse currently has 753 total restaurants. The split comes to 644 company-owned restaurants and 109 franchise-owned restaurants. The restaurant chain opened 12 additional restaurants this quarter.\n\nChipotle (CMG) a pedestrian walks past a Chipotle, CMG stock\n\nSource: Northfoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you want to diversify into multiple fast-food restaurant stocks, you may also want to consider Chipotle (NYSE:CMG). The restaurant chain has healthier food options than most fast food giants. This distinction helped Chipotle set higher prices for its food without losing customers.\n\nThe company’s stock is up by 39% year-to-date leading to its 50-for-1 stock split that will take effect June 26. Shares also gained 322% over the past five years. Financials continue to be an area of strength for the chain. Revenue increased by 14.1% in the last year to $2.7 billion in the first quarter. Net income grew by 23.2% to $359.3 million. Chipotle closed the quarter with a 13.3% net profit margin, which is above average.\n\nChipotle remains on pace to open 285 to 315 new restaurants this year. Each time Chipotle opens that many restaurants, the company puts itself in a good financial position to open more in the following years. It’s feasible to see Chipotle open more than 1,000 new restaurants before 2030. That development should result in meaningful gains for long-term investors.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading credit and debit card issuer that charges a percentage of every transaction. These plastic cards are more convenient than cash and offer enticing rewards and enhanced security.\n\nDebit and credit cards will be used across multiple generations, and that should result in steady revenue growth for Visa. The fintech firm reported 10% year-over-year improvements to its revenue and net income in the second quarter . Visa’s leadership regularly rewards shareholders with dividends and stock buybacks. The company allocated $3.8 billion in the most recent quarter toward those initiatives.\n\nVisa only has a 0.7% yield, but it maintained an annualized 18% growth rate over the past decade. This high growth rate can result in significant cash flow by the time you are ready to retire. Visa stock is up by 6% year to date and gained 62% over the past five years. The firm regularly has net profit margins that exceed 50%.\n\nWalmart (WMT) Walmart (WMT) sign on front of Walmart store at sundown\n\nSource: fotomak / Shutterstock.com\n\nWalmart (NYSE:WMT) outperformed the S&P 500 with a 26% year-to-date gain. Shares of the global retailer are up by 84% over the past five years. While Walmart is a reliable resource for groceries and affordable prices, the company is dabbling in two verticals that can stimulate growth.\n\nE-commerce is the first exciting opportunity. While Walmart reported 6% year-over-year revenue growth in the first quarter of fiscal 2025, e-commerce was up by 21%. Walmart’s continued success in e-commerce can help it compete with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and it can gobble up market share from Target (NYSE:TGT).\n\nWalmart’s advertising segment is another area of strength, but it will take longer for advertising to meaningfully impact Walmart’s financials. Advertising increased by 24% year over year, including a 26% growth rate for Walmart Connect in the U.S. Investors with lengthy time horizons can see advertising impact Walmart’s profit margins meaningfully. Most of Walmart’s business model revolves around low-margin sales. Growth in Walmart’s advertising segment should translate into healthier profit margins.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) META stock logo is shown on a device screen. Meta is the new corporate name of Facebook.\n\nSource: Blue Planet Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has been a top online advertising stock for several years. While a poor 2022 resulted in a meaningful price cut, the company flipped the script last year and recently touched an all-time high. Shares are up by 45% year-to-date and gained 177% over the past five years.\n\nJust like Alphabet, Meta Platforms trades at a reasonable valuation. Meta Platforms has a P/E of 29x and offers a 0.4% yield. Recent financial results suggest that Meta Platforms can become more affordable for long-term investors.\n\nRevenue increased by 27% year over year while net income was up by 117%. Meta Platforms continues to trim its headcount, which is 10% lower now than it was last year. Meta Platforms also wrapped up the quarter with $58.12 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities. The social media giant has plenty of capital to invest in new ventures while generating healthy profit margins for its investors.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held long positions in GOOG, CRWD, and TXRH.

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market’s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI.  SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank’s CFO, who said the bank’s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a “break from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.”\n\nIn this backdrop it’s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what’s happening in the AI space.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can’t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the Biggest AI Story and Rating Update You Should Not Miss This Week\n\nchristian-wiediger-rymh7EZPqRs-unsplash\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nMorgan Stanley recently published a list of stocks that are poised to be “winners” by providing convenience to consumers in the current environment where spending is slowing. Morgan Stanley’s Michael J. Wilson believes allowing consumers to “save time and make their life easier is a valuable product.” Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is part of Morgan Stanley’s list.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) was also on investors’ radar as the company was holding Re:Inforce conference where it addressed key topics like generative AI, risks, compliance, data production, and much more.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential of AMZN, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Amazon Editors' Best Books of 2024 So Far (Graphic: Business Wire)\n\nThe Amazon Books Editors share their list of favorites from among the vast selection of books released so far this year on Amazon\n\nSEATTLE, June 14, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) today announced that the Amazon Books Editors have revealed the Best Books of the Year So Far, naming Percival Everett’s novel, James, as the top choice.

A knock-out.\" — Al Woodworth, Amazon editor The Women by Kristin Hannah\r\n\"Packing as much emotional punch as The Nightingale, The Women sings the praises of the unsung heroes of the Vietnam War—the combat nurses. It’s a story that serves as another stitch in a still open wound, one that can only help the healing process.\" — Erin Kodicek, Amazon editor All the Worst Humans: How I Made News for Dictators, Tycoons, and Politicians by Phil Elwood\r\n\"This wild, oh-my-God memoir will make your jaw drop. A public relations hit man dishes on all of his dirty deeds, and it's not only impossible to put down, it's impossible not to talk about—in other words, perfect summer nonfiction reading.\" — Al Woodworth, Amazon editor The Ministry of Time by Kaliane Bradley\r\n\"This genre-bending novel explores humanity in all its frailty and potential, and how love can alter the course of history. It’s a fantastical novel that’s funny, riveting, heartbreaking, and unputdownable.\" — Abby Abell, Amazon editor Martyr! by Kaveh Akbar\r\n\"Poet Kaveh Akbar makes his dazzling fiction debut with an unforgettable main character whose voice feels shot from a cannon, and reminded us of the charismatic and undeniably addictive hero of Demon Copperhead. Martyr! is both laugh-out-loud funny and deadly serious—a coming-of-age story and a portrait of a young Iranian-American wrestling with what it means to have a life of value.\" — Al Woodworth, Amazon editor Nuclear War: A Scenario by Annie Jacobsen\r\n\"This horrifying narrative—a minute-by-minute breakdown of what happens after a nuclear missile is launched at the U.S.—is visceral and cinematic, like the big budget blockbuster of Hollywood’s dreams. Even more terrifying: it’s nonfiction, pieced together through interviews and classified documents dug up by Pulitzer Prize-nominated author Annie Jacobsen.\" — Lindsay Powers, Amazon editor All the Colors of the Dark by Chris Whitaker\r\n\"This extraordinary novel with a dark mystery running through it begins with a beekeeper and a pirate, and a kidnapping that changes their lives. Chris Whitaker’s vivid storytelling makes the pages fly by in a tale of family, survival, devotion, and love so powerful it hurts.\" — Seira Wilson, Amazon editor Lies and Weddings by Kevin Kwan\r\n\"Kevin Kwan (Crazy Rich Asians) once again delights and entertains us with a couture-studded, globe-trotting tale of family, legacy, and finding our own happiness. A surprising confession overheard at an over-the-top island wedding is just the first of many secrets spilled, hearts broken, and plans foiled, in this hilarious rom-com of wealth, prestige, shocking twists, and silver linings.\" — Seira Wilson, Amazon editor Lost Man’s Lane by Scott Carson\r\n\"Lost Man's Lane is a horror-tinged coming-of-age tale: sublime and sharp, poignant, nostalgic, and unsettling, even funny when it needs to be. Carson’s portrait of a teenage boy is spookily spot-on, as is the way he takes the novel terrifyingly sideways.\" — Vannessa Cronin, Amazon editor This Could Be Us by Kennedy Ryan\r\n\"This book is so multi-dimensional, just as life is—Kennedy Ryan covers divorce, self-discovery, autism, raising kids, the power of friendships, and other huge life changes, but it is done in a way that is so real and relatable.\" — Kami Tei, Amazon editor\n\nAbout Amazon Books Editors\n\nThe Amazon Books Editors are a group of literary experts with extensive experience spanning publishing, journalism, and communications.

        "content": "MADRID (Reuters) - Microsoft plans to invest 6.69 billion euros ($7.16 billion) to develop new data centres in Spain's northeastern region of Aragon, which is becoming a major cloud computing hub within Europe.\n\nAragon's regional government said the U.S. tech giant had applied for a construction permit to build data centres at a site outside the city of Zaragoza, confirming a report by local newspaper El Heraldo.\n\nThe company's investment will be spread out over 10 years, the regional government said.\n\nMicrosoft, which recently announced a 2.1 billion euro investment in data centres in Madrid, declined to comment on the plans in Aragon.\n\nMicrosoft follows its main competitor Amazon's cloud computing unit AWS in setting eyes on Aragon. Amazon announced last month it would invest 15.7 billion euros over the next 10 years to build data centres in Aragon.\n\nAmazon said it would power its data centres fully with renewable energy.\n\nThe Aragon region has a large wind power capacity.\n\nZaragoza, Spain's fifth-largest city, has become a logistics and transportation hub, It is located halfway between Madrid and Barcelona, Spain's biggest urban areas, and in the middle of the main trade corridor connecting the Iberian Peninsula to France and the rest of Europe.\n\n($1 = 0.9340 euros)\n\n(Reporting by Inti Landauro; editing by David Latona and Jason Neely)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Only 7 Data Center Stocks Investors Need In Order to Capitalize on AI",
        "content": "It’s hard to argue against the notion that artificial intelligence (AI) is the biggest opportunity that most of us will ever see in our lifetimes. AI is already changing the way humans work and will continue to do so. AI is not only changing work, it is also changing all aspects of society. Name something humans do and AI is likely being applied to improve that process. That said, the current biggest opportunity appears to be in data centers, at least for stock investors.\n\nData centers account for the majority of demand for AI chips at this point. Thus, investors should simply follow the money in order to capture returns. These companies are investing heavily in AI and have tremendous opportunities to grow as AI matures.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,GOOGL) stock represents the parent company of Google. The two names are used synonymously but for the purpose of ease I’ll just use Google. Anyway, Google is one of the biggest data center stocks and represents a clear opportunity to capitalize massively on AI.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA report from a few months ago is very telling. It noted that Google is pouring billions into increasing its overall data center footprint. That investment includes several massive capital outlays for data centers across the United States. It also includes plans for substantial data center investments in Mexico, Malaysia, Thailand, New Zealand, Greece, Norway, Austria and Sweden.\n\nEssentially, Alphabet is rapidly investing to build out the infrastructure necessary for its AI aspirations. It is one of several important hyperscaler companies with the resources to capture a significant portion of the AI market.\n\nInvestors should expect Google to continue thriving throughout 2024, especially in light of its strong first-quarter results. Ad revenues are again strong and those results, along with the data center investment, imply that the stock is a strong buy at the moment\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is up nearly 20% in 2024. A lot of that strong performance is attributable to the company’s future opportunity in AI. The company is heavily promoting its recent investment in data centers, sending a strong signal to markets.\n\nAmazon is set to spend an average of $10 billion annually over the next 15 years to retain its dominant cloud position. The company announced the $150 billion bet in late March. The heavy capital infusion will go toward creating the necessary resources to handle an anticipated spike in AI application demand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon is unloading the majority of that capital infusion early on. The company has already announced well over $20 billion in data center project investments in 2024. The company is also directing some of that investment toward the creation of wind and solar farms. That is unsurprising as data center energy consumption is rapidly increasing. Companies like Amazon have also promised to reduce their carbon emissions. They will therefore rely on clean energy sources including solar and wind to power the increased data center footprint.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT)\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has capitalized on the AI boom as well as any company. The stock exploded upward in 2023, primarily as a result of its investment in OpenAI. Microsoft’s heavy connection to the ChatGPT creator gives the company a strong head start in AI over many of its competitors.\n\nWhile that shrewd investment sent shares skyrocketing in 2023, 2024 has been slower. Microsoft stock is up a very respectable 13% during the year, but that remains somewhat behind the growth of its peer group.\n\nData center investments may be the catalyst to propel it upward again with greater velocity. In April it was reported that Microsoft had more than 5 gigawatts (GW) of data center capacity at its disposal. Microsoft added 500 megawatts of that overall capacity since July of 2023. The company intends to add one additional gigawatt of capacity during the first half of 2024. In 2025, Microsoft intends to add an additional 1.5 gigawatts of data center capacity during H1.\n\nMicrosoft continues to gobble up the AI GPUs necessary for use in those data centers. It’s news to no one, but Microsoft continues to be an excellent AI stock.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors who have been paying attention know that Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) has also placed its bets on AI digital infrastructure this year. That’s an excellent reason to invest in the stock at this time.\n\nDuring the first quarter of 2024 it was reported that Meta Platforms expected to spend between $30 to $37 billion on digital infrastructure investments in 2024. That was an increase of $2 billion over previous expectations at the high end. When the company released first quarter earnings in late April, that range increased again to between $35 to $40 billion.\n\nIf AI is truly the next groundbreaking opportunity then it’s clear the infrastructure required to process the workloads is the current prime opportunity. If it weren’t, the Meta Platforms of the world wouldn’t be so rapidly increasing their data center investments.\n\nInvest in Meta Platforms because its ad business is again thriving but understand that the company is making massive headway in relation to AI. That investment promises to strengthen what is already one of the  strongest companies globally.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quickly become the most important AI stock. Investors are well aware that the company’s chips dominate AI and remain in high demand. However, those same investors may not realize how important data center opportunities are to Nvidia overall.\n\nThose investors who do dig a little bit deeper will quickly realize that data center revenues are far and away the primary driver for Nvidia. Company-wide revenues grew by 18% during the most recent quarter, reaching $26.0 billion. $22.6 billion of those revenues were attributable to data center sales. All of the aforementioned hyperscaler companies above continue to gobble up Nvidia’s chips for use in their data centers.\n\nNvidia’s gross margins continue to grow and are fast approaching 80% overall. Margins at that level suggest incredible economics at the company. Nvidia benefits from a clear competitive advantage that makes it highly investable even today With prices above $1,200 per share. Shares will trade for much less by the time you read this as the company will have affected a stock split that lowers the price. That promises to increase liquidity which should drive demand higher, sending prices higher in the process.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSuper Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is clearly the riskiest stock on this list of data center investments to capitalize on AI. Share prices have risen from $285 at the beginning of the year to a high of $1,200 mid-March. They have since retreated to $800 but there’s reason to believe that now is time to invest again.\n\nSuper Micro Computer leverages leading chip technology, integrating it into modular plug-and-play AI-enabled hardware currently in high demand. That includes Nvidia’s newest Blackwell GPU chips.\n\nSuper Micro Computer’s hardware like its AI SuperCluster will continue to be in high demand for data center applications. The company is one of the newer and more interesting generative AI plays available to investors.\n\nI would argue that now is an excellent time to pick up Super Micro Computer following Nvidia’s recent strong performance. Nvidia’s earnings report should have sent a wave of relief across the markets in relation to AI. I believe that relief will manifest as renewed demand in companies like Super Micro Computer moving forward.\n\nCisco Systems (CSCO) the cisco (CSCO) logo on a wall\n\nSource: Valeriya Zankovych / Shutterstock.com\n\nFor the more risk-averse investor looking to capitalize on data center AI, Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO)  is an excellent stock choice. The company sells Internet Protocol (IP) networking equipment and touches heavily on data center products overall.\n\nIt is one of the first investments to consider for those seeking income from the tech sector. Cisco Systems includes a healthy dividend yielding nearly 3.5%. So, investors should consider it for the combination of stable income and strong data center/AI exposure.\n\nMeanwhile, Cisco Systems also recently launched a $1 billion dollar AI fund aiming to take stakes in upstart AI companies. That investment exposes Cisco Systems to Greater future growth potential which could in turn increase the income its stock provides.Furthermore, Cisco Systems is working hand in hand with Nvidia to simplify the deployment of generative AI applications.\n\nCSCO shares continue to represent an excellent and safe investment in AI growth that won’t keep you up at night while also exposing you to secular growth across AI.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Target's renewed private-label push fails to stem market share drop",
        "content": "By Siddharth Cavale\n\nNEW YORK (Reuters) - \"Target is my backup option,\" said Chloe Guss, a shopper at the retail chain for nearly 20 years whose reservations about some of its products may spell trouble for the business.\n\nThe New Yorker, 38, mostly shops at Target through her Instacart app for a few groceries and mainly diapers and formula for her children. But for clothing and furniture, Guss says she seeks out better quality elsewhere.\n\nTarget - jokingly pronounced \"Tar-zhay\" in faux French by fans and critics of its \"cheap chic\" offerings - is expanding its own brands as trendy, affordable designer home goods, cookware and clothing are no longer enough to keep its customers loyal.\n\nThe Minneapolis-based retailer has more than 45 private labels, including Good & Gather and Favorite Day food brands, which generate more than $30 billion in sales each year.\n\nHowever, its total U.S. retail market share, including online and store sales, has shrunk in categories that generate over 60% of its revenue, data from market research firm GlobalData shows. Target lost share in food and household goods, clothing, electronics, home wares and furniture in the first quarter, gaining only in beauty products.\n\nPurchase rates and average spending per shopper have dropped, data provided by online shopping tracker PriceSpider shows.\n\nTarget declined to comment, noting that CEO Brian Cornell said in May that Target was focused on sales growth, which it expects to begin in the current quarter.\n\nWhile major rivals said first-quarter sales rose from growing market share, Target posted weaker comparable sales for the quarter ended May 4, its fourth straight drop. Target cited macroeconomic factors such as delayed purchases and increased spending on activities outside the home, without mentioning market share losses.\n\nInvestors worry about Target losing ground to warehouse-club chain Costco, Walmart and Amazon.com.\n\nTarget's stock is up just 1.6% over the year, compared to jumps of 27% for Walmart, 28% for Costco and 21% for Amazon. It trades at 16.36 times its forward earnings, compared to Walmart's 27.31 and Costco's 49.75.\n\nTarget and Costco appeal primarily to Millennial and Gen X urban white women with annual household incomes of $40,000 to $125,000, data from market research firm Numerator shows. Gap and Dick's Sporting Goods cater to similar customers.\n\nCostco's Kirkland Signature brand has grown more popular, with significantly more households choosing it in early 2024, Numerator said. Costco on an earnings call noted market share gains in big ticket items like electronics and furniture.\n\nStory continues\n\nGap and Dick's Sporting Goods also increased their pieces of the pie with trendier merchandise and boosted sales of footwear, athletic apparel and sporting equipment, the retailers said.\n\nClothing sales in Target's fiscal first quarter, however, fell at a low single-digit rate from the year-ago period, but rose from the prior quarter.\n\nTarget's Good & Gather food and Up & Up household essentials brands, which compete with Kirkland Signature by Costco, lost household penetration share in the first calendar quarter, Numerator's data showed.\n\nDEALWORTHY\n\nTo fight back, Target in January launched its 'dealworthy' brand with nearly 400 items including iPhone chargers and toiletries below $10. This summer, it is cutting prices on 5,000 frequently bought grocery items and adding 125 more food items to its Good & Gather and Favorite Day brands.\n\nMembers of its Target Circle free rewards program get exclusive deals on electronics.\n\n\"This is a good start at remedying the growing issue of value, but we wonder whether it will be enough to stem the tide of customer erosion,\" GlobalData Managing Director Neil Saunders said.\n\nFrom January through March, Target.com's weakest average orders were in electronics, toys and cleaning products, PriceSpider noted.\n\nAverage order values for items like kitchen appliances and TVs dropped nearly a third, while essentials like detergents and toilet paper fell by 25%.\n\nSpending declines at Walmart.com and Amazon.com were less pronounced, down 9.3% for electronics at Walmart and 0.55% at Amazon in the period.\n\nOverall, Target's purchase rate dropped 16%, and its average order value fell 28%, while Amazon's purchase rate grew nearly 8% and Walmart's remained stable during the first quarter versus the year-ago period.\n\nTarget's stores contributed about 80% of its $105.8 billion in sales last year, with the rest mainly coming from online channels. Amazon's retail business is predominantly online, while Walmart generated $100 billion in e-commerce sales in 2023.\n\n'REASONABLE' VALUATION\n\nA broad consumer spending slowdown is partly to blame for Target's troubles, said Burt Flickinger, managing director of retail consultancy SRG Insights. The U.S. Census Bureau reported lower sales of electronics, appliances, home furnishings and garden products over the past four months.\n\nTarget expects second-quarter sales to range from flat to a 2% increase, but analysts noted that a 5.4% drop in 2023 makes these targets easier to achieve.\n\nSome shareholders are optimistic that Target will recover through its private-label expansion and price cuts.\n\n\"That is exactly what they should be doing in this environment,\" said Charles Sizemore of Sizemore Capital Management, which owns 5,000 Target shares.\n\n(Reporting by Siddharth Cavale in New York; Editing by Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Even if you’ve been out of the loop for the better part of the past couple of years, you’re aware of generative AI and its sweeping role. AI stocks have been front and center, reshaping industries while driving the stock market to record gains last year.\n\nWe’ve witnessed the pervasive impact of AI during the first-quarter (Q1) earnings season, with several tech companies comfortably outperforming analyst estimates. AI stocks drove the stock market to a 10.2% gain in Q1, marking its best performance since 2019. Additionally, the AI-driven Q1 earnings season marked the fifth consecutive quarter surpassing expectations.\n\nThat said, investors must back it as the top contender in the AI race to emerge victorious. The first stock to bet on is virtually the face of AI in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which recently saw its market cap surge past the $3 trillion mark. Then there’s Big Data player Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR), which has seen a healthy uptick in its AI Platform (AIP) users. Finally, you have tech behemoth Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which started slow but is now investing a boatload in its AI capabilities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background.

It controls roughly 75% of the AI chip market, positioning itself at the forefront of the ongoing AI-led tech disruption. This is shown in its robust financial performance lately, with Q1 sales soaring more than 262% (YOY) to $26 billion and profits skyrocketing by over 600%.\r\nLooking ahead, Nvidia’s upcoming Blackwell GPUs will likely add new layers to its illustrious growth story.\n\nBlackwell GPUs will significantly boost the firm’s generative AI and large-scale computing capabilities. These game-changing GPUs can handle trillion-parameter AI models and deliver up to 30 times the performance of their predecessors.\n\nMoreover, in recent news, NVDA stock continues to rise, with its market cap briefly pushing past the $3 trillion barrier. Also, following a strategic 10-for-1 stock split, Nvidia has made its shares more accessible, pointing to robust gains ahead.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo seen on billboard, known as Palantir is a public American company that specializes in big data analytics.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies isn’t just raising the AI hype wave; it’s delivering impressive tangible results. Its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) has been a blow-out success, driving its recent headline-worthy operating results.\n\nAIP integrates large language models with existing AI tech to significantly enhance decision-making and operational efficiency. Its superb utility has led to incredible client conversion, playing a critical role in Palantir’s robust operating results. Its most recent quarter marked the sixth consecutive profitable stretch, with a standout net income of $105 million. Additionally, sales were up 21% to $634.3 billion, led by a whopping 69% increase in U.S. commercial customers.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite the outperformance in its commercial segment, its government contracts continue to expand. It recently secured a massive $480 million fixed-price contract with the U.S. Department of Defense for its Maven AI system, extending until 2029. Hence, its dynamic push in both commercial and government sectors highlights its fantastic growth trajectory.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

The tech giant is ramping up investments in AI to effectively reshape the business landscape and add more customer value.\r\nEarlier in the year, it invested a hefty $100 million in developing the AWS Generative AI Innovation Center and a $4 billion investment in AI firm Anthropic. The strategic partnership with Anthropic primes AWS to host the renowned Claude AI models.\n\nSpeaking of AWS, Amazon’s cloud computing behemoth has AI written all over it. AI has been a key growth driver for Amazon’s business in recent years, and the AI boost will supercharge its trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, the use of Amazon’s specialized AI chips, Inferentia and Trainium, will significantly enhance AWS’s operational capabilities. Moreover, analysts remain bullish over AWS’s accelerated growth, particularly in cloud AI sales, which continue to add to Amazon’s impressive bull case.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "content": "In the latest market close, Amazon (AMZN) reached $183.83, with a -1.64% movement compared to the previous day. The stock's performance was behind the S&P 500's daily gain of 0.23%. Elsewhere, the Dow lost 0.17%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.34%.\n\nHeading into today, shares of the online retailer had gained 0.48% over the past month, lagging the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.79% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.96% in that time.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Amazon in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.02, showcasing a 61.9% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $148.54 billion, showing a 10.54% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nIn terms of the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates predict earnings of $4.58 per share and a revenue of $638.24 billion, indicating changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively, from the former year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Amazon. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nBased on our research, we believe these estimate revisions are directly related to near-team stock moves. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has witnessed a 0.96% increase. Right now, Amazon possesses a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nValuation is also important, so investors should note that Amazon has a Forward P/E ratio of 40.79 right now. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 18.1.\n\nAlso, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.38. Comparable to the widely accepted P/E ratio, the PEG ratio also accounts for the company's projected earnings growth. As of the close of trade yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry held an average PEG ratio of 0.96.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 70, this industry ranks in the top 28% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe strength of our individual industry groups is measured by the Zacks Industry Rank, which is calculated based on the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within these groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nKeep in mind to rely on Zacks.com to watch all these stock-impacting metrics, and more, in the succeeding trading sessions.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Stock",
        "content": "In this article, I will outline three of the reasons why I hold a bullish position on Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) stock. These reasons are tailwinds in advertising spending, cloud potential, and the stock’s reasonable valuation.\n\nAlphabet has performed relatively well in 2024, delivering nearly twice the return you would have received by investing in the S&P 500 Index (SPX). This performance aligns with the company’s growth expectations, particularly in its key markets, such as advertising, where AI innovations in Google Search are being incorporated.\n\nNonetheless, I believe that certain segments, such as the cloud, are overlooked by the market when assessing Alphabet’s future potential. This might be why the stock is traded at reasonably valued multiples compared to other major tech companies.\n\nPoised to Benefit from Tailwinds in Advertising Spending\n\nAlphabet currently holds the title of the most dominant advertising company globally, and the digital advertising sector is poised for significant growth in the years ahead.\n\nAccording to projections, digital advertising spending worldwide is expected to surge from $679 billion in 2023 (with 40% specifically in search advertising) to $965 billion by 2028, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of approximately 7%. With Alphabet leading the pack in digital advertising, it stands to reap substantial benefits from this upward trajectory.\n\nDigital advertising offers distinct advantages over traditional linear advertising. It enables more precise measurement of results and facilitates targeted advertising to specific audiences, rendering it a more appealing option with significantly higher returns from both business and marketing perspectives.\n\nGoogle Search, with its commanding market share in the search engine sector, and YouTube, boasting over 2.7 billion monthly active users, are pivotal assets bolstering Alphabet’s competitive edge. The incorporation of generative AI features, such as products leveraging LLMs (large language models) to match ads to relevant searches, enables users to find answers to more complex queries and increases usage and satisfaction with the results.\n\nGoogle Cloud Potential\n\nAccording to Alphabet’s management, the Google Cloud segment and YouTube are anticipated to achieve a combined annual run rate of over $100 billion by 2024.\n\nIn pursuit of this goal, the company has committed to investing in infrastructure, especially servers, nearly doubling its capital expenditures to $12 billion in Q1 2024 compared to Q1 2023. Despite the Google Cloud segment operating at a loss in recent years due to reinvesting all profits into growth, Alphabet’s cloud computing business remains in a growth stage.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough the segment reported an operating margin of 9% and generated $900 million in operating income in Q1 2024 (see below), this likely has not yet translated into free cash flow, in my opinion (Alphabet doesn’t disclose the segment’s free cash flow figures). Source: Alphabet’s Q1-2024 Report\n\nFor comparison, Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS boasts an operating margin of around 37%. As Alphabet strives to enhance the efficiency of Google Cloud through its investments, achieving margins akin to AWS could result in the company generating billions in annual operating income from this segment. This would represent a significant source of profit beyond its core search business.\n\nA Fairly Priced Big Tech Stock\n\nDespite a 26% increase in its stock price year-to-date, Alphabet maintains a relatively inexpensive valuation compared to its main big tech peers.\n\nConsidering a consensus that implies roughly 30% EPS growth for Alphabet this year, the stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 23x, which is the lowest among its “Magnificent 7” peers. This includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), which trades at 25x and is much more discounted than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), the member of this group that’s trading at the highest multiple of 67x.\n\nWhen considering cash flows, Alphabet’s price-to-cash flow (P/CF) ratio over the trailing 12 months stands at 20x, slightly above Amazon’s 19x and Meta’s 16x, based on its $2.19 trillion market cap. Despite this, I still find this valuation reasonably justified. Alphabet continues to invest significantly in growth opportunities, which should drive future expansion. However, these investments negatively impact short-term cash flows, resulting in a higher P/CF multiple.\n\nRegardless, Alphabet has strong net profit margins (nearly 26%), an effective monopoly in its core search business, and a pristine balance sheet within an industry approaching a trillion dollars in value and continuing to grow. These factors would typically justify a higher valuation multiple, but that is not necessarily the case for Alphabet right now.\n\nIs GOOGL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts are extremely bullish about the future of Alphabet stock, with the consensus rating being a Strong Buy, and 32 out of 37 analysts recommending buying GOOGL. The average GOOGL stock price target is $197.67, implying upside potential of 12.2%.\n\nAmong the bulls, Tigress Financial analyst Ivan Feinseth asserts that GOOGL deserves a Buy rating due to confidence in the company’s ability to enhance its products with generative AI technology. This enhancement is anticipated to significantly boost revenues, supported by the company’s ability to invest in key growth initiatives and strategic acquisitions, thanks to its strong balance sheet and healthy cash flows.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nThere are numerous reasons to maintain a bullish stance on Alphabet that extend beyond just three factors. Still, to reiterate, I firmly believe that the company’s dominant position and its ongoing investment efforts in search will yield significant returns as the industry continues to experience robust growth.\n\nFurthermore, I find that other segments, such as cloud computing, are still undervalued by the market, and there is substantial potential for value creation as investments lead to even stronger cash flows in the future.\n\nWhen considering these factors alongside the company’s attractive valuation compared to other big tech firms, I maintain a highly bullish position on Alphabet stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "It’s not every day when a stock generates triple-digit returns. Some investors dig through hundreds of stocks to discover which ones have the potential to deliver triple-digit returns. It takes a lot of research to find stocks with that type of potential, but even then, not all of them live up to expectations.\n\nInvestors should look for several characteristics when they analyze growth stocks. Rising revenue is a must. If a company isn’t growing, there’s no reason to expect its stock price to magically grow. Rising profit margins is another key element. Some corporations deliver exceptional sales growth but burn through a lot of money. Unprofitable companies are unsustainable in the long run and need to become profitable in the near future.\n\nFinally, investors should assess each company’s growth opportunities. Was a strong quarter from last year a fluke, or is the company for real? These factors, combined with peeking at the company’s valuation, can increase the likelihood of finding stocks poised for triple-digit returns. These picks look promising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nConsolidated Water Co. (CWCO) A photo of water being poured into a glass that's sitting on a table.\n\nSource: HQuality/ShutterStock.com\n\nConsolidated Water Co. (NASDAQ:CWCO) is a leading designer, builder and operator of advanced water supply and treatment plants. The company has had several quarters of impressive revenue growth and continued that trend in the first quarter. Total revenue increased by 21% year-over-year (YOY) to reach $39.7 million while net income came in at $6.9 million. That’s a 68.3% YOY improvement from the $4.1 million in GAAP net income in Q1 of 2023.\n\nThe profitable utility company trades at a 12.5 P/E ratio and offers a 1.50% yield. In addition, the company has a solid dividend growth rate. Consolidated Water Co. raised its dividend by 11.8% in Q4 of 2023. A high dividend growth is a good sign that indicates the company is doing just fine with sustainable growth. Currently, the quarterly dividend stands at $0.095 per share.\n\nAlthough shares are down by almost 30% year-to-date (YTD), CWCO stock is up by 85% over the past five years. The firm only has a $400 million market cap and remains a hidden gem. Profit margins are comfortably in the double-digits.\n\nComfort Systems USA (FIX) Group of colleagues discuss something in an office conference room. commercial real estate\n\nSource: GaudiLab / Shutterstock\n\nComfort Systems USA (NYSE:FIX) helps commercial and industrial clients with heating, ventilation and air conditioning installations. Also, the company offers repair and maintenance services as needed.\n\nFIX only has an $11 billion market cap and trades at a 30 P/E ratio. It also has a 0.39% yield and an impressive dividend growth rate. The company usually raises its dividend twice per year and recently hiked its quarterly dividend by 20%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWondering how Comfort Systems USA maintains a high dividend growth rate? It comes down to impressive financials. Revenue increased by 31% YOY in Q1 of 2024 to reach $1.54 billion. Net income came in at $96.3 million which represents a 68.3% YOY increase. A $5.91 billion backlog suggests that the gains should keep on rolling, and the stock has certainly been doing well. Shares are up by 52% YTD and have soared by 528% over the past five years.\n\nCrowdstrike (CRWD) Mobile phone with website of American software company CrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) Inc. on screen in front of website.

The company boasts $3.65 billion in annual recurring revenue and grew its revenue by 33% YOY in Q1 of 2025.\n\nThis growth comes amid a general slowdown in the cybersecurity industry. Investors should take note of this, since over-performance with headwinds suggests meaningful growth when headwinds exit.\n\nAlso, net income has been a bright spot for the company. Crowdstrike’s $42.8 million in GAAP net income is a big jump from the $0.5 million GAAP net income in Q1 of 2024. Crowdstrike has partnerships with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and other leading tech companies.\n\nThe stock’s market cap is just shy of $100 billion, but recent momentum suggests Crowdstrike will break that barrier soon enough.

        "content": "Growth investing has been incredibly rewarding for investors who punched their ticket well ahead of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AI hype is giving yet another shot in the arm to the tech sector. After an incredible Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) hosted by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the sector found itself up close to 10% in the two trading days that followed.\n\nSurely, AAPL stock’s blistering rally crowned Apple as the world’s largest company, at least before Fed chair Jerome Powell gave his speech.\n\nAfter the Fed commentary, Apple began slipping off its peak, falling just a hair below Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the market cap race. As these two titans, along with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), continue to soar, the rules of growth investing may be changing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs momentum in some of the AI-savviest companies picks up again, investors should look beyond The Big Three. Let’s explore three that could also power higher as the “Magnificent Three” lead the way.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs powerful but compact AI models find themselves in our pockets, top public cloud firm and e-commerce disruptor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may have enough AI-induced wind at its back to help it join the company of the Magnificent Three in the $3 trillion market cap club.\n\nWith a market cap just shy of $2 trillion, AMZN stock has to gain around 57% to qualify. It may be just a matter of time before Amazon becomes a $3 trillion club member. And if Amazon has more AI in store for the next year, it will be unsurprising if it does so by next summer.\n\nAs a Magnificent Seven firm that only recently broke out to new all-time highs by only around 2%, AMZN stock stands out. It’s a great play for growth investors seeking a company that may still have untapped AI upside.\n\nMoreover, Amazon has its Titan foundation models, Bedrock service for firms to build generative AI models, and a very impressive Q Developer for AI-assisted coding. However, there’s still more in the Amazon AI pipeline that could excite. Specifically, the Olympus large language model (LLM), under development, could be a game-changer with parameters that are measured in the trillions.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another AI beneficiary that seems unstoppable of late. Recently, the stock reported its Q2 earnings, adding more fuel to one of the hottest AI semi-stock stories outside of Nvidia. The company didn’t just post strong earnings. It also raised its annual AI chip sales forecast by 10% and announced a stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe result? AVGO stock is up more than 14% in the after-hours session.\n\nIn many ways, Broadcom’s ascent seems to rhyme with that of Nvidia’s. Many investors and analysts underestimated AI’s potential to power growth. And those left sitting on the sidelines are probably wondering if it’s too late to jump in now that AVGO stock is up close to 50% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAt this pace, perhaps Broadcom will crack a $1 trillion valuation sooner than most think. Either way, Broadcom still isn’t the priciest AI chip stock. It may even be a relative value play given the 1.4% dividend yield and price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple that still seems grounded in reality.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been off to the races as well, despite reporting a lukewarm quarter that fell short on the bottom line. The cloud high-flyer has AI to thank. On Wednesday, ORCL stock shot up more than 13% as investors applauded deals made with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud in addition to Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nIndeed, Oracle is joining forces with some heavy hitters on AI. No wonder investors are forgiving the sub-par earnings report.\n\nMoving ahead, ORCL stands out as an AI cloud winner poised to continue winning as it helps do its part to meet blistering demand for AI compute. In many ways, teaming up with OpenAI seems to be the magic formula for getting investors to hit that buy button.\n\nAs Oracle builds data centers that are cheaper than many of its big-name peers, it will be interesting to see how much gas ORCL stock has left in the tank after its latest melt-up. Perhaps a $500 billion market cap may not be far off as the growth bar is raised.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon, Alphabet (Class C), Apple, and Microsoft.

        "content": "Movement to improve workplace safety covers nearly 2.9 million employees worldwide; grant recipients to help advance musculoskeletal disorder research and innovation\n\nWASHINGTON, June 13, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- Musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs, are the most common workplace injury and the second leading cause in shortening people's working years in the U.S. They also cost businesses in the private sector nearly $17 billion each year. Recognizing the impact these injuries have on workers and employers, the National Safety Council launched the MSD Pledge in June 2022 and the MSD Pledge 2.0 in October 2023 to spur a global movement to transform workplace safety and improve the lives of millions of workers. Today, more than 200 of the world's leading organizations – representing nearly 2.9 million employees – have joined this effort to reduce MSD risk and enhance the physical and psychological wellbeing of all workers. The National Safety Council is dedicated to eliminating the leading causes of preventable death and injury focusing our efforts on the workplace, roadway and impairment. (PRNewsfoto/National Safety Council)\n\nTo commemorate this milestone, the MSD Solutions Lab, a groundbreaking NSC initiative established in 2021 with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to solve workplace MSDs, today hosted its third annual Workplace Safety Summit: Harnessing Innovation and Collaboration. During the event, a keynote address was given by Julia Abate, executive director for the Ergonomics Center at North Carolina State University, and a panel discussion was held with MSD Pledge members Schneider Electric and Superior Tube Products, in addition to 2023-2024 Research to Solutions (R2S) grant recipient Rutgers University. NSC also proudly awarded nearly $265,000 through the 2024-2025 R2S and MSD Solutions Pilot Grant programs to help nine leading organizations uncover promising new safety solutions to prevent work-related MSDs. As a key initiative of the MSD Solutions Lab, a total of $540,000 has now been committed in grants over the past two years.\n\n\"At NSC, we believe every employee deserves to work in an environment where their safety is valued, and risks and injuries are minimized. The MSD Solutions Lab addresses the critical toll MSDs take on people and businesses, and I'm incredibly proud of the progress we have made in just three years,\" said Lorraine Martin, NSC president and CEO. \"Between growing the MSD Pledge to more than 200 committed organizations and awarding grants to some of the nation's top innovators, we are one step closer to helping workers everywhere lead healthier, fuller, MSD-free lives.\"\n\n\"We value our NSC partnership because of our shared commitment to reducing MSDs through engaging key stakeholders, conducting research, identifying new technology, innovating solutions and scaling the results,\" said Sarah Rhoads, Vice President of Global Workplace Health and Safety at Amazon. \"We're proud to see how far this important initiative has come and look forward to even more organizations joining us as MSD Pledge members.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the 2024-2025 grant cycle, NSC called upon R2S applicants to support one or more key research areas, including emerging technologies, solutions to jobs or tasks known to have high MSD risk, MSD management systems, and total worker wellbeing. This year's R2S grant recipients include the following organizations:\n\nVirginia Tech (Blacksburg, Virginia), awarded $50,000 to examine responsible machine learning and artificial intelligence-based biomechanical exposure assessments across diverse worker groups. North Carolina State University (Raleigh, North Carolina), awarded $50,000 to evaluate an augmented reality-based visualization and optimization tool on work zones to assess real-time object placement. Oregon State University(Corvallis, Oregon), awarded $50,000 to develop a non-invasive lower back injury risk assessment using a smartphone motion capture system with machine learning and musculoskeletal modeling. Wichita State University(Wichita, Kansas), awarded $48,500 to assess the feasibility of utilizing arm support exoskeletons for overhead construction tasks and evaluating the impact on musculoskeletal health.\n\nThis year's MSD Solutions Pilot Grant, which is designed to help organizations prevent MSDs caused by upper-extremity work, provides MSD Pledge members with the opportunity to partner with six leading technology providers to trial emerging solutions in real-life applications. Pledge members selected for the 2024-2025 MSD Solutions Pilot Grant include:\n\nOcean Spray Cranberries and the City of Tacoma, awarded $20,000, will work with Feraru Dynamics LTD to mitigate hand-arm vibration measures and exposure among 20 power tool operators across the food manufacturing and public utilities industries in Tacoma, Washington. PepsiCo Global Concentrates Solutions, awarded $18,000, will team with LifeBooster to collect and analyze ergonomic risk data and identify upper-extremity mitigation strategies. Wonderbrands, awarded $18,000, will partner with LifeBooster to identify and address ergonomic risks caused by upper-extremity work and heavy lifting, in addition to evaluating in-house capabilities for digitized risk assessments to help reduce injuries. Superior Tube Products, awarded $10,000, will use 3motionAI's video motion capture technology to quantify the impact of existing safety programs and create an enterprise evaluation of risk and actionable data to drive ergonomic solutions for all employees.\n\nThis year's grant recipients will have an opportunity to present their safety findings at the 2025 NSC Safety Congress & Expo or another event next year. The inaugural recipients will share their key learnings and research at this year's NSC Safety Congress & Expo in Orlando, Florida taking place September 16-18.\n\nThe MSD Pledge and R2S and MSD Solutions Pilot Grant programs are among several initiatives supported by the MSD Solutions Lab to achieve its goal of reducing MSDs.

        "title": "Amazon commits additional $1.4B to affordable housing fund",
        "content": "Smartphone displaying Amazon logo. Photo by Christian Wiediger via Unsplash.\n\nOnline retail giant Amazon announced this week that it is committing an additional $1.4 billion to its Housing Equity Fund that will go toward the creation and preservation of roughly 14,000 affordable housing units across three major metropolitan areas in which it maintains a corporate presence.\n\nThe funds — to be invested in the metro areas of Seattle, Nashville and Arlington, Virginia — will bring the total investment fund to $3.6 billion and 35,000 housing units since its inception in 2021, the company said in an announcement.\n\n“We created the Amazon Housing Equity Fund to preserve and create homes that will remain affordable for the next century, ensuring families can stay in their communities for generations to come,” Amazon CEO Andy Jassy said in a statement. “We hope that our additional commitment — coupled with other public and private resources — will help make a meaningful difference for thousands more people and enable these regions to thrive.”\n\nLaunched in January 2021, the fund initially sought to create and preserve 20,000 affordable housing units in these three metros through an initial investment of $2 billion. This week, Amazon claimed it had surpassed that goal by reportedly providing $2.2 billion across 21,000 affordable units.\n\nIn measuring the local impact on the Puget Sound region of western Washington, The Seattle Times reported that while any investment in additional housing is beneficial, Amazon has also been slammed for contributing to the challenges the area is facing due to “high corporate salaries [contributing] to a skyrocketing cost of living.”\n\nIn a news conference this week, Jassy said that the company knows that housing “is a really big challenge for a lot of people, especially in and around expensive metro areas. We feel strongly we can help give back to our communities by helping preserve and create thousands of affordable homes.”\n\nThe funding is targeted. Amazon said it primarily aims to provide the money via a mix of loans and grants to “households that earn 30% to 80% of the area median income.” The company said this population often includes “first responders, teachers, health care workers, and others who may not typically qualify for subsidies but whose wages haven’t kept pace with escalating rents.”\n\nIn King County, where Seattle sits, that usually translates to income levels of $28,800 to $70,650 for an individual, or $41,100 to $100,900 for a family of four, based on 2023 data from the King County Housing Authority that was cited by the Seattle Times.\n\nThe announcement also added some new details to a previously announced partnership with the National Housing Trust, saying that the Seattle effort on that initiative will start with a pilot project of 83 homes that could eventually grow to 800.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AWS Announces $230 Million Commitment for Generative AI Startups",
        "content": "Funds will help the next generation of startups turbocharge development of new generative AI applications and bring innovations to market faster\n\nAWS Generative AI Accelerator program will add another 80 early-stage startups from around the world that are using generative AI to solve complex challenges\n\nSEATTLE, June 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Amazon Web Services, Inc. (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced a $230 million commitment for startups around the world to accelerate the creation of generative AI applications. This will provide startups, especially early-stage companies, with AWS credits, mentorship, and education to further their use of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) technologies. Part of the new commitment will fund the second cohort of the AWS Generative AI Accelerator, a program that provides hands-on expertise and up to $1 million in credits to each of the top 80 early-stage startups that are using generative AI to solve complex challenges. Applications for the AWS Generative AI Accelerator open today and will be accepted until July 19. Startups can apply here.\n\n\"For more than 18 years, AWS has helped more startups to build, launch, and scale their business than any other cloud provider—it’s no coincidence that 96% of all AI/ML unicorns run on AWS,\" said Matt Wood, vice president, Artificial Intelligence Products at AWS. \"With this new effort, we will help startups launch and scale world-class businesses, providing the building blocks they need to unleash new AI applications that will impact all facets of how the world learns, connects, and does business.\"\n\nInterested startups can learn more about how to access these funds here. Startups can use AWS credits to access AWS compute, storage, and database technologies, as well as AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia2, energy-efficient AI chips that offer high performance at the lowest cost. These credits can also be used on Amazon SageMaker, a fully managed service that helps companies build and train their own FMs, as well as to access models and tools to easily and securely build generative AI applications through Amazon Bedrock.\n\nAWS Generative AI Accelerator continues to launch successful startups\n\nThe AWS Generative AI Accelerator identifies top early-stage startups that are using generative AI to solve complex challenges in areas such as financial services, healthcare and life sciences, media and entertainment, business, and climate change, among others. Participants will access sessions on ML performance enhancement, stack optimization, and go-to-market strategies. The 10-week program will match participants with both business and technical mentors based on industry vertical. Startups will receive up to $1 million each in AWS credits to help them build, train, test, and launch their generative AI solutions. They will also have access to industry experts, technology, and technical sessions from NVIDIA, the program’s presenting partner, and be invited to join the NVIDIA Inception program, designed to nurture cutting-edge startups.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS will announce selected startups for the second cohort on September 10, and the program will kick off on October 1 with in-person sessions at Amazon’s Seattle campus. All 80 participating startups will be invited to attend and showcase their solutions to potential investors, customers, partners, and AWS leaders in December at re:Invent 2024 in Las Vegas.\n\n\"AWS has been instrumental in enabling us to scale our generative AI platform to meet the rapidly growing demand from our global user community. Their robust generative AI infrastructure helped us reduce inferencing costs by 60% and accelerate our language model inference speeds by up to 35%,\" said Jachin Bhasme, co-founder and COO of Leonardo.AI, a powerful suite of generative AI tools for creators and one of the 21 startups to participate in the first cohort of the program. \"The accelerator was also an incredible experience for us. The business and technical mentorship we received and the connections we made played a crucial role in shaping our product and strategy.\"\n\n\"AWS has the right combination of technology, network of partners, and potential customers in the life sciences space that made it the best fit to support our vision of building the next generation of AI models for drug discovery,\" said Nima Alidoust, Ph.D., CEO and co-founder of Vevo Therapeutics, an AI-driven biotechnology startup building the world’s first platform to generate high-resolution, single-cell in vivo data in living organisms at scale. \"Participating in the AWS Generative AI Accelerator program provided us with valuable opportunities to tap into this community and to leverage AWS's infrastructure and expertise in scaling model training and development.\"\n\nTo learn more about the opportunities for generative AI startups choosing AWS, and the application process for the AWS Generative AI Accelerator, visit startups.aws.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses.  To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control.  A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\n\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”\n\nThe FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,  13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\n\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Billionaire Israel Englander's Top Stock Pick for 2024?\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander’s Stake Value:$1,779,205,187\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is becoming an AI power house thanks to its AWS business, which saw operating margins cross 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) skeptics believe the stock has run too much as its valuation is high. For value-conscious investors the market is indeed teeming with other opportunities. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as AMZN but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) replaced MSFT to take the spot of the most popular stock among the over 900 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. A total of 302 hedge funds reported owning stakes in Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "By Krystal Hu\n\n(Reuters) - Amazon said it is investing $230 million in the form of Amazon Web Service (AWS) credits in artificial intelligence startups, the latest example of cloud providers trying to capture AI clients from nascent stages.\n\nThe credits will provide early-stage generative AI startups free access to computing power, a variety of AI models, and infrastructure, if they build their companies on AWS.\n\nAmazon says it already offers $1 billion in cloud credits every year to startups, with this new commitment focusing on supporting generative AI startups.\n\n\"They'll be able to iterate very quickly and pivot very quickly as necessary. Then ultimately, when they hit on that home run, they'll be able to double down and get to the scale with security, responsibility and consistency,\" said Matt Wood, vice president of AI Products at AWS.\n\nPart of the credits will also support 80 early-stage companies globally through the AWS Generative AI Accelerator program, the company said. Each startup admitted to the accelerator could receive up to $1 million in AWS credits.\n\nIt's common for cloud providers, from Microsoft Azure to Google Cloud, to offer credits to lure enterprises to use their services, as cloud costs can pile up for a company as their usage increases.\n\nEarlier this year, Amazon has expanded its cloud credits to cover the use of models from providers such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral AI, and Cohere, as the company aims to boost the market share of its AI platform.\n\nAI demand has driven up the usage of cloud services, contributing to the accelerated growth of cloud providers. For instance, AWS's revenue rose by 17% to $9.42 billion in the first quarter, surpassing analyst expectations. The investment by tech giants in AI startups have also attracted attention from regulators over antitrust concerns.\n\nHoward Wright, global head of Startups at AWS who managed startups relationships, recently left the company, according to people familiar with the move. Amazon declined to comment on the move.\n\n(Reporting by Krystal Hu in New York; Editing by Lincoln Feast.)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Many investors can’t figure out how to invest in penny stocks because they don’t know what to look for. Some penny stocks are companies in beginning phases that have yet to scale up operations. These companies’ financials are still in the process of improving. Other penny stocks may continue to trade at penny stock prices until there is a breakthrough –such is common in the biotech industry– that grows the company’s market share and stock price accordingly.\n\nRegardless, these share prices present a unique opportunity for investors for massive returns with such low share prices. Conversely, such low share prices make these stocks subject to market manipulation, making penny stocks volatile investments. You can find good penny stock picks by looking for improving financials, or analyzing public sentiment around a company’s developments.\n\nPrevious penny stock successes include Amazon (NYSE:AMZN), AMD (NYSE:AMD) and Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA). If you are wondering how to invest in penny stocks, here are three penny stocks that I’ve identified as penny stock opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNerdy (NRDY) Image of a young girl raising her hand in front of a laptop.\n\nSource: MIA Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nNerdy (NYSE:NRDY) is an online learning platform utilizing novel technology applications, such as Artificial Intelligence for Human Interaction (AI for HI), to improve customer experiences. Yahoo! Finance reports 9 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on NRDY between $3.75 and $6, with a mean of $4.64.\n\nNerdy has shown excellent financial promise for Q1 of 2024. The company has beaten both revenue and EPS earnings for Q1 of 2024. While profitability has been a weakness for Nerdy, a growing net profit margin and free cash flow indicates a positive future. By growing net income 60.61% year-over-year (YOY), management had a crucial role in improving profitability.\n\nThe company’s flagship business of Varsity Tutors has positioned itself well for growth by establishing service partnerships with school districts in Illinois, Texas and Michigan. These programs are all funded by grants or offered at no costs to these districts, allowing for Nerdy to serve these communities while strategically growing its customer base. To prospective investors wondering how to invest in penny stocks, look no further than Nerdy.\n\nTaysha Gene Therapies (TSHA) OLK Stock. Modern Medical Research Laboratory: Two Scientists Wearing Face Masks use Microscope, Analyse Sample in Petri Dish, Talk. Advanced Scientific Lab for Medicine, Biotechnology. Blue Color. KZR stock. RSLS stock. Best Biotech Stocks to Buy\n\nSource: Gorodenkoff / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaysha Gene Therapies (NASDAQ:THSA) focuses on clinical-stage research specifically for central nervous system (CNS) diseases. Yahoo! Finance reports 10 analysts predicting a 1-year price range on TSHA between $5 and $9, with a mean of $6.75.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs with most penny stock biotechnology companies, TSHA has not presented robust financials for Q1 of 2024. Operating expenses were $27.74 million, marking a 30.45% YOY increase. But this percentage is not unfounded. These expenditures have gone toward “Good Manufacturing Practice” activities, allowing TSHA to commercialize TSHA-102 –a treatment for a CNS disease called Rett syndrome– that has currently garnered Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval.\n\nWith the global Rett Syndrome market expected to grow at a 13.8% CAGR to $800 million by 2032, a lack of a cure or highly effective therapies position Taysha Gene Therapies to gain majority of the market share.\n\nGeron (GERN) Pipette adding fluid to one of several test tubes; biotech NVTA Stock\n\nSource: motorolka / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeron (NASDAQ:GERN) specializes in developing and commercializing cancer therapies. Yahoo! Finance reports seven analysts predicting a 1-year price range on TSHA between $4.50 and $10, with a mean of $6.07.\n\nGERN financials have improved as of Q1 of 2024. The company’s revenue is up 1,347% YOY and net profit margin is up 89.96% YOY. While GERN has shown substantial improvement with financials, these metrics are less impressive when you put these numbers in context. Net income for Q1 of 2024 was -$55.39 million, and the company is not yet profitable. However, I don’t recommend GERN because of its financial performance.\n\nGeron gained FDA approval for RYTELO, which helps treat adult patients with myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS), a form of onset leukemia. This FDA approval makes RYTELO the “first-in-class” treatment inhibiting telomerase growth, an enzyme that allows cancer cells to multiply. The potential for this type of treatment is widespread across different cancers, creating a lot of hype around this stock right now.\n\nGeron also has seven other treatments in development. Some include the further inhibition of telomerase although in other clinical applications. With multiple cutting edge developments that can potentially create massive upside, Geron is a highly recommended penny stock.\n\nOn Penny Stocks and Low-Volume Stocks: With only the rarest exceptions, InvestorPlace does not publish commentary about companies that have a market cap of less than $100 million or trade less than 100,000 shares each day. That’s because these “penny stocks” are frequently the playground for scam artists and market manipulators. If we ever do publish commentary on a low-volume stock that may be affected by our commentary, we demand that InvestorPlace.com’s writers disclose this fact and warn readers of the risks.\n\nRead More: Penny Stocks — How to Profit Without Getting Scammed\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Rodrigues did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nEarlier this week Nvidia (NVDA) completed a 10-for-1 stock split, following its original announcement in May. This means the company's share price is now trading around its lowest level since late 2022.\n\nThe artificial intelligence (AI) firm is the sixth member of the S&P 500 (^GSPC) to announce a stock split just this year, up from four in 2023.\n\nAnalysts believe this is a sign of more to come in the technology sector.\n\nThey have pointed to Meta Platforms Inc (META) as one of next companies to possibly announce a stock split. The tech conglomerate, which owns and operates Facebook, Instagram, Threads, and WhatsApp is the only firm in the “Magnificent Seven” that has not yet split shares.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nTrading at over $500 a share, Meta is considered “ripe for a split,” Ken Mahoney, president of Mahoney Asset Management, said.\n\nMeta’s stock has surged more than 450% from its 2022 low, driven by AI interest, buybacks, and a new dividend.\n\nRead more: How to invest in the Indian stock market\n\nWhat is a stock split?\n\nA stock split is a decision by a company's board of directors to increase the number of shares outstanding by issuing more shares to current shareholders (without diluting the value of their stakes).\n\nThe number of outstanding shares rises and the price per share decreases proportionally, while the market capitalisation and value of the company stays the same.\n\nFor example, in a 2-for-1 stock split, a shareholder receives an additional share for each share held. So, if a company had 1 million shares outstanding before the split, it would have 2 million shares outstanding after a 2-for-1 split.\n\nIn Nvidia's case, the company split its shares on a 10-for-1 basis based on the closing share price on Friday 7 June of $1,210. Shareholders were awarded 10 shares for each of their existing shares, and the stock was trading at around $120 per share on Monday 10 June.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, reverse stock splits happen when a company reduces the number of shares outstanding, thereby raising the market price of each share.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy do they happen?\n\nStock splits often result in a share price increase as small investors and employees perceive the stock as more affordable. Retail traders in particular find this appealing as they may only be able to buy shares in full on their trading platforms or within ISAs, with limits on buying fractional shares.\n\nCompanies often perform stock splits to make their stock more accessible to a wider range of investors,” explains Sam North, market analyst at investment platform eToro. “A stock split can reduce the price per share, making it more affordable for individual investors to buy.\"\n\nLower share prices are also useful to companies when it comes to remunerating staff members with share options. The move also brings a company's share price to a similar range to others in the same sector.\n\nRead more: What are share repurchases?\n\nStock splits can often improve trading liquidity, effectively boosting demand for the stock and driving up prices.\n\nAnother possible reason for the price increase is that a stock split provides a signal to the market that the company's share price has been increasing over time — people may assume this growth will continue in the future. This further lifts demand and prices.\n\nReverse stock splits often happen when a company wants to meet the minimum requirements to remain listed on an exchange. Firms can get ousted off an exchange if their price drops too far, so the move can help a company survive and recover from a rough patch.\n\nRecent stock splits\n\nSeveral high-profile stock splits have taken place this year including Walmart (WMT), Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG), Lam Research (LRCX), Sony Group (SONY), Amphenol Corporation (APH), and Cintas (CTAS).\n\nRetailer Walmart announced a 3-for-1 stock split on 30 January, and completed its first split in 25 years after the market closed on February 23, while Chipotle Mexican Grill approved a 50-for-1 split on March 19, which will take effect after the closing bell on 25 June.\n\nCorporate identity uniforms company Cintas approved a 4-for-1 stock split on 2 May 2and shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis after the market close on 11 September.\n\nSony's board greenlit a 5-for-1 stock split last month, which goes into effect on 8 October, while electronic components firm Amphenol revealed a 2-for-1 forward split on 20 May, which was completed on 11 June.\n\nWafer fabrication equipment company Lam Research also approved a 10-for-1 stock split, which will become effective after closing bell on 2 October.\n\nRead more: The stock market rally has been all about large caps\n\nIt comes as Amazon (AMZN) has so far split its stock three times in its history. The latest one was announced in March 2022 on a 20:1 basis.\n\nOther big-tech names such as Apple (AAPL) and Tesla (TSLA) have also carried out stock splits in the past.\n\nWhat does the future hold?\n\nInvestors should weigh up stock splits on a case-by-case basis. Overall, historical stats indicate that they tend to outperform the S&P 500 index over the next 12 months, but of course it can all be subject to change.\n\nHowever, stock splits like Nvidia, and now potentially Meta, can make them more attractive candidates for the price-weighted Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI). Currently, no stock in the Dow index trades above $500 a share.\n\nThe Bank of America (BoA) (BAC) has already predicted more splits in the tech sector, including the likes of Broadcom Inc (AVGO), Super Micro Computer Inc (SMCI), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Netflix Inc (NFLX).\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Here Are My Top 2 Magnificent Seven Stocks to Buy Hand Over Fist",
        "content": "Earlier this year, the S&P 500 confirmed its presence in a bull market as it soared to records, and a handful of stocks led the gains. I'm talking about a group known as \"The Magnificent Seven,\" a reference to the 1960 Western. In this case, though, these stars aren't on the silver screen and, instead, are companies specializing in some form of technology. They are Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Apple, Alphabet, Meta Platforms, Microsoft, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), and Tesla.\n\nThese companies also are big names in artificial intelligence (AI), one of today's hottest growth areas, and that helped their shares climb last year. Each of these players still makes a solid long-term buy -- even a stock like Tesla that's recently slipped.\n\nBut two Magnificent Seven stocks -- both key players in the world of AI -- stand out as ones to buy right now, hand over fist. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nNvidia dominates the AI chip market, holding 80% share, as it sells the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs) around. These high-performance chips fuel the crucial AI tasks of training and inferencing large language models (LLMs) so that the LLMs can go on to solve complex problems and more. Nvidia also sells a wide variety of products and services to help companies execute and maintain their AI projects -- and customers can find all of these offerings conveniently on any public cloud.\n\nAll of this has translated into triple-digit earnings growth in recent quarters for this technology giant. Why am I optimistic this will continue? For two reasons.\n\nFirst, the general AI growth story is in its early days right now, with companies' AI needs in their early stages. Analysts predict the AI market will reach beyond $1 trillion by 2030. This suggests demand for Nvidia's products and services could continue at the current rate or even significantly pick up over time.\n\nSecond, Nvidia is taking the necessary steps to stay ahead of rivals, putting its focus on innovation. The company has pledged to increase the power of its GPUs on an annual basis. Since Nvidia already is in the lead, it's likely to maintain its dominance if it can keep this promise.\n\nAll of this makes the stock look like a reasonable buy today at 44x forward earnings estimates.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon is benefiting from AI in two ways. The e-commerce giant uses AI to help improve efficiency across its business. For example, it uses the technology to streamline the fulfillment process and choose the best delivery routes, which eventually saves the company time and money. Amazon also uses AI to help you, the customer, find what you're looking for -- something that may keep you coming back.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut the area where Amazon may score the biggest AI win is in cloud computing. Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's biggest cloud provider and also drives Amazon's overall profit. So success here is critical for the company.\n\nAWS has gone all in on AI, offering services that suit just about any AI customer. It sells premium chips, like those from Nvidia, along with its own less-expensive chips for the cost-conscious customer. It also offers a fully managed service that gives customers access to a range of LLMs. AWS also builds applications such as a coding assistant for developers.\n\nThese efforts already are delivering results, with AWS announcing a $100 billion annual revenue run rate this year. Amazon isn't only investing in AI -- more importantly, it's in the process of monetizing it.\n\nToday, at 41x forward earnings estimates, Amazon is far from being the cheapest Magnificent Seven stock, but that's OK. The company's solid earnings track record, leadership in the growth businesses of e-commerce and cloud computing, and its approach to AI make it well worth the price.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

(Photo: Business Wire)\n\nVrio companies DIRECTV Latin America and Sky Brasil will use Amazon’s satellite broadband network to make internet connectivity available for unserved and underserved communities\n\nSEATTLE & BUENOS AIRES, Argentina, June 13, 2024--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Today Vrio Corporation, parent company of DIRECTV Latin America and Sky Brasil, and Project Kuiper, Amazon’s low Earth orbit satellite broadband network, announced a distribution agreement to offer fast, affordable internet connectivity in seven countries in South America.\n\nVrio plans to use Project Kuiper’s network to provide connectivity services to residential customers in Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia through DIRECTV Latin America and Sky Brasil, in accordance with local regulations. This agreement will bring new affordable, high-speed internet connectivity options to an area with a total population of approximately 383 million people, including approximately 200 million people the World Bank estimates are still not connected to the internet.\n\nDIRECTV and Sky will use Project Kuiper's low-latency, high-bandwidth satellite network to bring the benefits of fast and reliable internet to areas that would otherwise be both challenging and prohibitively expensive to serve. With Project Kuiper, the companies will offer nationwide coverage in each country—something that is not practical with traditional connectivity options like fiber optics or fixed wireless that require extensive infrastructure.\n\nDarío Werthein, president of Vrio Corp., stated: \"This collaboration with Project Kuiper is in line with our strategy of extending our services throughout South America and continues to define us as a regional leader in information, digital entertainment, connectivity and innovation promotion. We are concerned with bridging the technology gap and even more so the digital divide for our future generations. And the time is now. Our commitment translates into action. Providing internet access across the region ensures the development of communities; and that is a commitment for our company.\" He added, \"We look forward to bringing the benefits of affordable internet access and connectivity to more communities to reach further with a service that will revolutionize the way people connect.\"\n\n\"Project Kuiper is a powerful opportunity to make a difference in people’s lives,\" said Panos Panay, Amazon’s senior vice president for devices and services. \"There are hundreds of millions of households around the world that don’t have access to reliable broadband internet, which means they can’t take part in things that we can take for granted, like being able to learn online, run a business online, shop, or enjoy streaming entertainment. Working with Vrio to bring affordable access to broadband means we can enable so many more people to create, connect, and learn in new ways.\"\n\nStory continues\n\n\"Project Kuiper’s mission is to deliver fast, affordable broadband to areas that have traditionally been difficult to reach,\" said Rajeev Badyal, vice president of technology and head of Project Kuiper at Amazon. \"Our network has the capacity and flexibility to serve tens of millions of customers around the world, and this distribution agreement with Vrio is part of our commitment to working with regional providers who share that vision. We look forward to working with Vrio to serve customers across South America.\"\n\nProject Kuiper recently tested two prototype satellites as part of its successful Protoflight mission. It expects to begin deploying its satellite constellation in the coming months, and to start service demonstrations with Vrio and other select customers later this year.\n\nFor more information on Project Kuiper, visit https://www.aboutamazon.com/projectkuiper.\n\nAbout Vrio Corp.\n\nVrio Corp. is a leading American media and technology company in Latin America and the Caribbean in digital entertainment services, content production, information and connectivity with more than 40 million viewers in 11 countries.

        "title": "Seeking a 20%+ Dividend Yield? Check Out the FEPI ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI)",
        "content": "Even in a world where interest rates are higher than they were a few years ago, a yield of over 20% still stands out no matter what type of environment we are in, and that’s exactly what the REX FANG & Innovation Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:FEPI) offers investors.\n\nI’m bullish on this newer, still under-the-radar dividend ETF from REX Shares based on its gargantuan yield, attractive monthly payout schedule, and portfolio of highly-rated tech stocks.\n\nWhat Is the FEPI ETF’s Strategy?\n\nFEPI’s strategy is to own large-cap tech stocks (the 15 stocks in the Solactive FANG Innovation Index) and write covered calls against these holdings in order to create enhanced income potential.\n\nIt’s a strategy that has grown in popularity in recent years, as similar funds like the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) and the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) have grown into some of the market’s most popular ETFs.\n\nEssentially, FEPI sells covered calls against its holdings and uses the options premiums it receives from selling these calls in order to pay its holders a monthly distribution. This can be a great strategy for generating steady and above-average income, as evidenced by FEPI’s frequent payouts and large yield. These large-cap tech stocks drive considerable investor interest and feature plenty of volatility, so they are particularly well-suited for generating attractive options premiums.\n\nThe downside of this strategy is that FEPI holders potentially sacrifice upside from capital appreciation because if its holdings climb above the strike price for the calls it is selling, FEPI holders miss out on this additional upside.\n\nFor example, FEPI’s top holding is Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). This is a theoretical example, but let’s say FEPI sells one contract of June 21 Nvidia calls with a strike price of $130 for a $120 premium. In this hypothetical example, the fund benefits by receiving a premium of ~$120 from the buyer of the options for selling these calls, which it can distribute to its holders.\n\nHowever, if the shares of Nvidia rise above $130 on the closing date, to $150 for example, the fund is contractually obligated to sell these shares to the buyer of the call for the contracted price of $130, meaning that it didn’t benefit from any of the appreciation of $20 per share past the strike price.\n\nHowever, if the shares of Nvidia stay below the strike price, the fund managers can sell new calls against them and repeat the process all over again to continually generate consistent income.\n\nAs long as investors understand these potential tradeoffs and accept the fact that they will likely miss out on some upside from price appreciation from time to time, this can be an attractive and effective strategy for generating considerable income on a monthly basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nMassive Yield\n\nIt’s important to note that the level of FEPI’s monthly payout is not set in stone, and the fund doesn’t guarantee that it will make a monthly payout.\n\nThat being said, since launching in October 2023, the fund has been remarkably consistent so far, making a payout each month — the smallest of these was $1.09 in April. We covered FEPI shortly after it launched last year, writing that it had the potential for significant payouts, and this has largely played out.\n\nMany websites will list FEPI’s yield as 14.9% — which is still incredibly attractive — but that doesn’t tell the whole story. This is its yield on a trailing 12-month basis, and the fund only launched late last year, so it has only made seven months of payments thus far.\n\nLooking at the yield on a forward basis paints a clearer, though imperfect, picture. Using the fund’s most recent payout of $1.16 in May as the monthly payout going forward, the fund boasts a massive distribution yield of 25.2%. Even if payouts decrease slightly from May’s level and fluctuate, this yield will still be very high.\n\nIt’s hard to understate just how outsized this yield is. The S&P 500 (SPX) yields just a meager 1.4%, while 10-year treasury bonds yield a risk-free 4.4%. Even FEPI’s aforementioned peers, like JEPI and JEPQ, yield 7.7% and 9.8%, respectively, on a forward basis (using the same methodology as above).\n\nConcentrated Holdings\n\nFEPI owns 15 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 67.8% of its portfolio. FEPI is not very diversified and is highly concentrated, but diversification is not the fund’s goal.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of FEPI’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you can see, FEPI’s portfolio consists largely of the highly-rated large-cap technology stocks that have powered the market higher in recent years, such as Nvidia and its fellow magnificent-seven stocks, fellow chipmakers Micron (NASDAQ:MU) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and a handful of other tech names.\n\nThese holdings are highly rated by TipRanks’ proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Eight of FEPI’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores, and three, Broadcom, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), feature “Perfect 10” Smart Scores.\n\nFEPI boasts an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8.\n\nHow Much Does FEPI Charge?\n\nOne downside of FEPI is that its expense ratio of 0.65% is fairly pricey. An investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay $65 in fees annually. However, this is an actively managed fund with a fairly complex strategy, so the higher expense ratio is not necessarily surprising. If the fund can continue to deliver monthly payments to holders and maintain such a high yield, then few investors will complain about the expense ratio. However, if FEPI falters, then more investors will begin to question its expense ratio.\n\nNot Without Risks\n\nAs discussed above, investors in the fund are potentially forgoing some upside from price appreciation in exchange for this large yield.\n\nBeyond that, this is a fairly new fund and strategy, so it remains to be seen if its strategy will pan out over time or if it will be able to continue paying out this much over the long term.\n\nLastly, the fact that the fund is highly concentrated and heavily exposed to just one part of the market, large-cap tech, exposes investors to considerable risk if this segment of the market suffers.\n\nIs FEPI Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FEPI earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 13 Buys, four Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average analyst FEPI stock price target of $59.89 implies 8.7% upside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway: A Standout Investment for Income Investors\n\nEven in a world of higher yields, FEPI’s yield of over 20% stands out. I’m bullish on the ETF based on this massive yield and its monthly payout schedule, as well as its highly-rated portfolio.\n\nAs long as investors understand and are comfortable with the fact that this big-time yield comes with the tradeoff of potentially leaving a portion of potential upside from capital appreciation on the table, then FEPI can be a good option for generating monthly income. For this reason, I wouldn’t necessarily allocate my whole portfolio toward FEPI, but I believe it can be a useful tool for generating income within a diversified portfolio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Amazon blew Alexa’s shot to dominate AI, according to more than a dozen employees who worked on it",
        "content": "“Alexa, let’s chat.”\n\nWith that phrase, David Limp, at the time Amazon’s head of devices and services, showed off a new generative AI-powered version of the company’s signature Alexa voice assistant in September 2023.\n\nAt a packed event at the Seattle-based tech giant’s lavish second headquarters in the Washington DC suburbs, Limp demonstrated the new Alexa for a room full of reporters and cheering employees. He showed how in response to the new trigger phrase, “Alexa, let’s chat,” the digital assistant responded in a far more natural and conversational voice than the friendly-but-robotic one that hundreds of millions have become accustomed to communicating with for weather updates, reminders, timers and music requests. Limp asked Alexa how his favorite football team—Vanderbilt University—was doing. Alexa showed how it could respond in a joyful voice, and how it could write a message to his friends to remind them to watch the upcoming Vanderbilt football game and send it to his phone.\n\nThe new Alexa LLM, the company said, would soon be available as a free preview on Alexa-powered devices in the US. Rohit Prasad, Amazon’s SVP and Alexa leader said the news marked a “massive transformation of the assistant we love,” and called the new Alexa a “super agent.” It was clear the company wanted to refute perceptions that the existing Alexa lacked smarts. (Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella reportedly called it “dumb as a rock” in March 2023 as OpenAI’s ChatGPT rocketed to fame).\n\nBut after the event, there was radio silence—or digital assistant silence, as the case may be. The traditional Alexa voice never changed on the half-a-billion devices that have been sold globally, and little news emerged over the coming months about the new generative AI Alexa, other than recent reports about a potential launch later this year that could include a subscription charge.\n\nThe reason, according to interviews with more than a dozen former employees who worked on AI for Alexa, is an organization beset by structural dysfunction and technological challenges that have repeatedly delayed shipment of the new generative AI-powered Alexa. Overall, the former employees paint a picture of a company desperately behind its Big Tech rivals Google, Microsoft, and Meta in the race to launch AI chatbots and agents, and floundering in its efforts to catch up.\n\nThe September 2023 demo, the former employees emphasize, was just that—a demo. The new Alexa was not ready for a prime time rollout, and still isn’t. The Alexa large language model (LLM), that sits at the heart of the new Alexa, and which Amazon positioned as taking on OpenAI’s ChatGPT, is, according to former employees, far from state-of-the-art. Research scientists who worked on the LLM said Amazon does not have enough data or access to the specialized computer chips needed to run LLMs to compete with rival efforts at companies like OpenAI. Amazon has also, former employees say, repeatedly deprioritized the new Alexa in favor of building generative AI for Amazon’s cloud computing unit, AWS. And while Amazon has built a partnership and invested $4 billion in AI startup Anthropic, whose LLM model Claude is considered competitive with OpenAI’s models, it has been unable to capitalize on that relationship to build a better Alexa. Privacy concerns have kept Alexa’s teams from using Anthropic’s Claude model, former employees say—but so too have Amazon’s ego-driven internal politics.\n\nStory continues\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said details provided by the former research scientists for this story were \"dated\" —even though many of these sources left the company in the past six months—and did not reflect the current state of the Alexa LLM. She added that the company has access to hundreds of thousands of GPUs and other AI-specific chips. She also disputed the idea that Alexa has been deprioritized or that Anthropic’s Claude has been off-limits due to privacy concerns, but she declined to provide evidence of how Claude is being used in the new Alexa.\n\nWhile aspects of Amazon’s struggle to update Alexa are unique, the company’s challenges give an indication of how difficult it is for companies to revamp digital assistants built on older technologies to incorporate generative AI. Apple, too, has faced similar struggles to integrate AI into its products, including its digital assistant Siri. Siri and Alexa share a similar technological pedigree—in fact, Siri debuted three years prior to Alexa, in October 2011. And like Amazon, Apple underinvested in the kind of AI expertise needed to build the massive language models that underpin today’s generative AI, and in the vast clusters of graphics processing units (GPUs), the specialized computer chips such models require. Apple too, like Amazon, has launched a determined, but belated, effort to catch up.

Photographer: David Paul Morris/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nApple took some big steps towards regaining lost ground in the generative AI race with a set of highly-anticipated announcements at its WWDC conference earlier this week. The debut included a big upgrade for Siri, including a more natural-sounding voice and the potential for “on-screen awareness,” which will eventually allow Siri to take more agent-like actions across apps. Apple also announced a Siri integration with ChatGPT. Apple’s announcements only up the pressure on Amazon to deliver the new Alexa.\n\nUnfortunately, there’s growing evidence that Amazon is ill-prepared for this renewed battle of the digital assistants—even though many assumed the company would have been perfectly positioned to take Alexa into the generative AI age. Yesterday, Mihail Eric, a former senior machine learning scientist at Alexa AI, took to X (formerly Twitter) to say just that: In a post titled “How Alexa dropped the ball on being the top conversational system on the planet,” Eric, who left Amazon in July 2021, pointed out that Alexa had sold over 500 million devices, “which is a mind-boggling user data moat,” and that “we had all the resources, talent, and momentum to become the unequivocal market leader in conversational AI.” But most of that tech never saw the light of day, he said, because Alexa AI “was riddled with technical and bureaucratic problems.” The dozen former employees Fortune spoke to over the past month echo Eric’s account and add further details to the story of how the Everything Company has failed to do this one thing. The former employees spoke anonymously to avoid violating non-disclosure agreements or non-disparagement clauses they had signed.\n\nAmazon Alexa was caught flat-footed by ChatGPT\n\nWell before ChatGPT wowed the world in November 2022, there was Amazon’s Alexa. The digital assistant was launched in 2014 alongside the Echo smart speaker that served as its hardware interface. The digital assistant, Amazon said, had been inspired by the all-knowing computer featured on Star Trek (Amazon founder Jeff Bezos is a big Star Trek fan). The product quickly became a hit with consumers, selling over 20 million devices by 2017. But Alexa was not built on the same AI models and methods that made ChatGPT groundbreaking. Instead, it was a collection of small machine learning models and thousands of hand-crafted and hard-coded rules that turned a user’s utterances into the actions Alexa performed.\n\nAmazon had been experimenting with some early large language models—all of them much smaller than GPT-3 and GPT-4, the two models OpenAI would use to power ChatGPT—but these were nowhere near ready for deployment in a product. The company was caught flat-footed by the generative AI boom that followed ChatGPT’s late November 2022 launch, former employees say. A frantic, frenetic few months followed as Amazon’s Alexa organization struggled to coalesce around a vision to take the digital assistant from a stilted command-action bot to a truly conversational, helpful agent. Non-generative AI projects were deprioritized overnight, and throughout the 2022 Christmas period executives urged Amazon’s scientists, engineers and product managers to figure out how to ensure Amazon had generative AI products to offer customers. One former Alexa AI project manager described the atmosphere at the company as “a bit panicked.”\n\nAmazon’s response almost immediately ran into trouble, as various teams within Alexa and AWS failed to coalesce around a unified plan. Many employees were still working remotely following the Covid pandemic, leading to people being endlessly “huddled on conference calls debating the minutiae of strategic PRFAQs” (Amazon-speak for ​​a written document used when proposing a product idea in its early stages), the Alexa AI project manager said. The company struggled, he said, to “shift from peacetime to wartime mode.”\n\nOne senior Alexa data scientist said this was especially frustrating because he had tried to sound the alarm on the coming wave of generative AI as far back as mid-2022, gathering data to show his director-level leadership, but he said he could not convince them that the company needed to change its AI strategy. Only after ChatGPT launched did the company swing into action, he explained.

Fallon / AFP) (Photo by PATRICK T. FALLON/AFP via Getty Images)\n\nThe problem is, as hundreds of millions are aware from their stilted discourse with Alexa, the assistant was not built for, and has never been primarily used for, back-and-forth conversations. Instead, it always focused on what the Alexa organization calls “utterances” — the questions and commands like “what’s the weather?” or “turn on the lights” that people bark at Alexa.\n\nIn the first months after ChatGPT launched, it was not clear LLMs would be able to trigger these real-world actions from a natural conversation, one Ph.D. research scientist who interned on the Alexa team during this period said. “The idea that an LLM could ‘switch on the lights’ when you said ‘I can’t see, turn it all on’ was not proven yet,” he said. “So the leaders internally clearly had big plans, but they didn't really know what they were getting into.” (It is now widely accepted that LLMs can, at least in theory, be coupled with other technology to control digital tools.)\n\nInstead, teams were figuring out how to implement generative AI on the fly. That included creating synthetic datasets —in this case, collections of computer-generated dialogues with a chatbot—that they could use to train an LLM. Those building AI models often use synthetic data when there isn’t enough real-world data to improve AI accuracy, or when privacy protection is needed— and remember, most of what the Alexa team had were simple, declarative “utterances.”\n\n“[Customers were] talking in Alexa language,” one former Amazon machine learning scientist said. “So now imagine you want to encourage people to talk in language that has never happened—so where are you going to get the data from to train the model? You have to create it, but that comes with a whole lot of hurdles because there’s a gazillion ways people can say the same thing.”\n\nAlso, while Alexa has been integrated with thousands of third-party devices and services, it turns out that LLMs are not terribly good at handling such integrations. According to a former Alexa machine learning manager, who worked on Alexa’s smart home capabilities, even OpenAI’s latest GPT 4o model, or the newest Google Gemini model—which both are able to use voice, rather than just text—struggle to go from spoken dialogue to performing a task using other software. That requires what is known as an API call and LLMs don’t do this well yet.\n\n“It’s not consistent enough, it hallucinates, gets things wrong, it’s hard to build an experience when you’re connecting to many different devices,” the former machine learning scientist said.\n\nAs spring gave way to the summer of 2023, many in Alexa’s rank and file remained in the dark about how the digital assistant would meet the generative AI moment. The project lacked vision, former employees said. “I remember my team and myself complaining a lot to our superiors that it wasn't transparent what the vision looks like—it wasn't transparent what exactly we're trying to launch,” one said. Another former manager said the new Alexa LLM was talked about in the months prior to the September demo, but it wasn’t clear what it would mean. “We were just hearing things like, ‘Oh yeah, this is coming,’” he said. “But we had no idea what it was or what it would look like.” WASHINGTON, DC - MARCH 12: Amazon Echo devices are seen displayed at the new Amazon Books store in Georgetown during a soft opening on Monday March 12, 2018 in Washington, DC. (Photo by Matt McClain/The Washington Post via Getty Images)\n\nAlexa LLM demo did not meet ‘go/no-go’ criteria\n\nThe September 2023 Alexa demo made it seem like a widespread rollout of the new Alexa LLM was imminent. But the new language model-based Alexa ultimately “didn't meet the go/no-go criteria,” one former employee said. LLMs are known for producing hallucinations and sometimes toxic content, and Amazon’s was no different, making broad release risky.\n\nThis, former employees say, is the reason Alexa’s “Let’s Chat” feature has never made it into wide release. “It's very hard to make AI safe enough and test all aspects of that black box in order to release it,” a former manager said.\n\nThe September 2023 demo, he pointed out, involved different functionality than what Alexa was best known for— that is, taking a command and executing it. Ensuring Alexa could still perform these old functions while also enabling the conversational dialogue the new Alexa promised would be no easy task. The manager said it was increasingly clear to him that the organization would, at least temporarily, need to maintain two completely different technology stacks—one supporting Alexa’s old features and another the new ones. But managers did not want to entertain that idea, he said. Instead, the message at the company at the time he was laid off in November 2023 was still “we need to basically burn the bridge with the old Alexa AI model and pivot to only working on the new one.”\n\nEven as the new Alexa LLM rollout floundered, Amazon executives set ever more lofty generative AI goals. Right before the demo, Prasad, the Amazon SVP who had served as Alexa’s head scientist, was promoted to a new role designed to bring the company’s disparate research teams under a single umbrella, with a goal to develop human-level artificial general intelligence, or AGI. The move put Amazon in direct competition with companies like OpenAI, Google DeepMind, and Anthropic, which have the creation of AGI as their founding mission. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg has also recently said that creating AGI is his company’s mission too.\n\nBy November 2023, there was word that Amazon was investing millions in training an AI model, codenamed Olympus, that would have 2 trillion parameters—or tunable variables. Parameters are a rough approximation of a model’s size and complexity. And Olympus’s reported parameter count would make it double the reported size of OpenAI’s most capable model, GPT-4.\n\nThe former research scientist working on the Alexa LLM said Project Olympus is “a joke,” adding that the largest model in progress is 470 billion parameters. He also emphasized that the current Alexa LLM version is unchanged from the 100 billion-parameter model that was used for the September 2023 demo, but has had more pretraining and fine tuning done on it to improve it. (To be sure, 100 billion parameters is still a relatively powerful model. Meta’s Llama 3, as a comparison, weighs in at 70 billion parameters).\n\nA lack of data made it tough to 'get some magic' out of the LLM\n\nIn the months following the September 2023 demo, a former research scientist who worked on building the new Alexa LLM recalled how Alexa leadership, including Amazon’s generative AI leader Rohit Prasad, pushed the team to work harder and harder. The message was to \"get some magic\" out of the LLM, the research scientist said. But the magic never happened. A lack of adequate data was one of the main reasons why, former employees said.\n\nMeta’s Llama 3 was pre-trained on 15 trillion tokens, the smallest unit of data that an LLM processes. The Alexa LLM has only been trained on 3 trillion. (Unlike parameters, which are the number of tunable settings that a model has, a token is the small unit of data - such as a word - that the model processes during training). Meanwhile, “fine-tuning” an AI model—which takes a pre-trained model and further hones it for specific tasks—also benefits from larger datasets than what Amazon has at the ready. Meta’s Llama 3 model was fine-tuned on 10 million data points. The LLM built by Amazon’s AGI organization has so far accumulated only around 1 million, with only 500,000 high-quality data points, the former Alexa LLM research scientist said.

Amazon.com Inc. previewed a push into generative artificial intelligence with new features for its Alexa voice assistant. Photographer: Al Drago/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nOne of the many reasons for that, he explained, is that Amazon insists on using its own data annotators (people responsible for labeling data so that AI models can recognize patterns) and that organization is very slow. \"So we can never never get high quality data from them after several rounds, even after one year of developing the model,” he said.\n\nBeyond a paucity of data, the Alexa team also lacks access to the vast quantities of the latest Nvidia GPUs, the specialized chips used to train and run AI models, that the teams at OpenAI, Meta, and Google have, two sources told Fortune. \"Most of the GPUs are still A100, not H100,\" the former Alexa LLM research scientist added, referring to the most powerful GPU Nvidia currently has available.\n\nAt times, building the new Alexa has taken a backseat to other generative AI priorities at Amazon, they said. Amazon’s main focus after ChatGPT launched was to roll out Bedrock, a new AWS cloud computing service that allowed customers to build generative AI chatbots and other applications in the cloud—which was announced in April 2023 and made generally available in September. AWS is a critical profit-driver for Amazon.\n\nAlexa, on the other hand, is a cost center—the division reportedly loses billions each year—and is mostly viewed as a way to keep customers engaged with Amazon and as a way to gather data that can help Amazon and its partners better target advertising. The LLM that Amazon scientists are building (a version of which will also power Alexa) is also first being rolled out to AWS’ business-focused generative AI assistant Amazon Q, said a former Alexa LLM scientist who left within the past few months, because the model is now considered good enough for specific enterprise use cases. Amazon Q also taps Anthropic’s Claude AI model. But Alexa’s LLM team has not been allowed to use Claude due to concerns about data privacy.\n\nAmazon’s spokesperson said the assertion about Claude and privacy is false, and disputed other details about Amazon’s LLM effort that Fortune heard from multiple sources. “It's simply inaccurate to state Amazon Q is a higher priority than Alexa. It’s also incorrect to state that we’re using the same LLM for Q and Alexa.”\n\nBureaucracy and infrastructure issues slowed down Alexa’s gen AI efforts\n\nOne former Alexa AI employee who has hired several employees who had been working on the new Alexa LLM said that most have mentioned “feeling exhausted” by the constant pressure to ready the model for a launch that is repeatedly postponed—and frustrated because other work is on hold until in the meantime. A few have also conveyed a growing skepticism as to whether the overall design of the LLM-based Alexa even makes sense, he added.\n\n\"One story I heard was that early in the project, there was a big push from senior executives who had become overconfident after experimenting with ChatGPT, and that this overconfidence has persisted among some senior leaders who continue to drive toward an unrealistic-feeling goal,” he said. Another former Alexa LLM scientist said managers set unachievable deadlines. “Every time the managers assigned us a task related to [the] LLM, they requested us to complete it within a very short period of time (e.g., 2 days, one week), which is impossible,” he said. “It seems the leadership doesn't know anything about LLMs—they don't know how many people they need and what should be the expected time to complete each task for building a successful product like ChatGPT.” Pedestrians walks past Amazon.com Inc. headquarters in the financial district of Toronto, Ontario, Canada, on Friday, Feb. 21, 2020.

However, investors flocking to safe havens such as gold offset the sell-off in Canada's stock market. Photographer: Stephanie Foden/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nAlexa never aligned with Jeff Bezos’ idea of “two-pizza teams”—that is, that teams should ideally be small enough that you could cater a full team meeting with just two pizzas. Bezos thought smaller teams drove effective decision-making and collaboration. Instead, Alexa has historically been—and remains, for the most part—a giant division. Prior to the most recent layoffs, it had 10,000 employees. And while it has fewer now, it is still organized into large, siloed domains such as Alexa Home, Alexa Entertainment, Alexa Music and Alexa Shopping, each with hundreds of employees, along with directors and a VP at the top.\n\nAs pressure grew for each domain to work with the new Alexa LLM to craft generative AI features, each of which required accuracy benchmarks, the domains came into conflict, with sometimes counterproductive results, sources said.\n\nFor instance, a machine learning scientist working on Alexa Home recalled that while his domain was working on ways for Alexa to help users control their lights or the thermostat, the Music domain was busy working on how to get Alexa to understand very specific requests like  “play Rihanna, then Tupac, and then pause 30 minutes and then play DMX.”\n\nEach domain team had to build its own relationship with the central Alexa LLM team. “We spent months working with those LLM guys just to understand their structure and what data we could give them to fine-tune the model to make it work.” Each team wanted to fine-tune the AI model for its own domain goals.\n\nBut as it turned out, if the Home team tried to fine-tuned the Alexa LLM to make it more capable for Home questions, and then the Music team came along and fine-tuned it using their own data for Music, the model would wind up performing worse. “Catastrophic forgetting,” where what a model learns later in training degrades its ability to perform well on tasks it encountered earlier in training is a problem with all deep learning models.  “As it gets better in Music, [the model] can get less smart at Home,” the machine learning scientist said. “So finding the sweet spot where you’re trying to fine tune for 12 domains is almost a lottery.” These days, he added, LLM scientists know that fine tuning may not be the best technique for creating a model with both rich capabilities and flexibility—there are others, like prompt engineering, that can do better. But by then, many months had gone by with little progress to show for it.\n\nEach Alexa domain, with its own leadership, wanted to protect and expand its fiefdom, one former product manager said. \"This organization has just turned out into something like a mafia,” she said. “Let's say, if I work for you, I'm just taking orders because it is in my best interest to agree with you. It is my best interest to not get chopped off in the next layoff—it's quite ruthless. It's in my best interest because you're going to help me build my empire.”\n\nAmazon says it stands by its commitment to Alexa\n\nAmazon insists it is fully committed to delivering a generative AI Alexa, adding that its vision remains to build the “world’s best personal assistant.” An Amazon representative pointed out that over half a billion Alexa-enabled devices have been sold, and customers interact with Alexa tens of millions of times every hour.

(Photo by Phillip Faraone/Getty Images for WIRED25 )\n\nShe added that the implementation of generative AI comes with “huge responsibility—the details really matter” with a technical implementation of this scale, on a device that millions of customers have welcomed into their home. While the Alexa LLM “Let’s chat” feature has not been rolled out to the general public, it has been tested on small groups of customers “on an ongoing basis.”\n\nBut many of the employees Fortune spoke to said they left in part because they despaired that the new Alexa would ever be ready—or that by the time it is, it will have been overtaken by products launched by nimbler competitors, such as OpenAI. Those companies don’t have to navigate an existing tech stack and defend an existing feature set. The former employee who has hired several who left the Alexa organization over the past year said many were pessimistic about the Alexa LLM launch. “They just didn't see that it was actually going to happen,” he said.\n\nIt’s possible, say some of the employees Fortune interviewed, that Amazon will finally launch an LLM-based Alexa — and that it will be an improvement to today’s Alexa. After all, there are hundreds of millions of Alexa users out there in the world who would certainly be happy if the device sitting on their desk or kitchen counter could do more than execute simple commands.\n\nBut given the challenges weighing down the Alexa LLM effort, and the gap separating it from the offerings of generative AI leaders like OpenAI and Google, none of the sources Fortune spoke with believe Alexa is close to accomplishing Amazon’s mission of being “the world’s best personal assistant,” let alone Amazon founder Jeff Bezos’ vision of creating a real-life version of the helpful Star Trek computer. Instead, Amazon’s Alexa runs the risk of becoming a digital relic with a cautionary tale— that of a potentially game-changing technology that got stuck playing the wrong game.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Thirty years after its founding, Amazon has grown into one of the largest employers in the world and the second-largest corporation in the U.S. by staff size, trailing only Walmart. It’s also one of the most admired.\n\nAlong the way, the company has invested in programs for its massive, 1.5-million-employee workforce—spread across warehouses and offices around the world—to provide regular feedback on their work experience, including a daily survey tool known as Connections.\n\nWhile the results from Connections surveys are meant to identify problem areas (or problem managers) and seek solutions—“Our goal is to help develop leaders who earn trust, remove barriers to excellence, and make Amazon an inspiring place to work”—Amazon has also utilized Connections data when combating public reports of dissatisfied employees.\n\nAnd when it does, employees have for years been known to reach out to this reporter with a suggestion: Be skeptical of the data.\n\nMost recently, Amazon cited its employee survey results in response to a Fortune article documenting the challenges and fears facing Amazon’s customer service employees. Amazon founder Jeff Bezos also cited Connections data from warehouse staff when he addressed unionization efforts in his final annual shareholder letter as CEO.\n\nTo be clear, many Amazon employees note that Connections appears well-intentioned, and some who’ve worked on the program have lauded it as one of the first large-scale experiments involving a company creating a daily employee survey.\n\nStill, many Amazon employees question the accuracy of the feedback—and thus the data Amazon cites—because they say many workers don’t answer Connections questions honestly.\n\nThe reasons for this are numerous, employees have said. Chief among employee concerns is that the anonymity of their responses is not as bulletproof as the company would like to suggest. On small teams for example, employees are concerned that their manager can deduce who responded in what way based on the overall manager-employee relationship. Amazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said employee responses are confidential and that managers see aggregated results only when a team has at least four employees. For smaller teams, survey responses are not visible to managers nor other leaders. But even team sizes of four or more can leave little cover for who answered how, employees argue.\n\nAnd some managers go so far as to put a thumb on the scale, employees say, by coaching their direct reports on how to answer certain questions or stressing to them that negative feedback can negatively impact the manager’s standing.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Rather than self-reflection on why her scores are low,” one Amazon employee told Fortune of a manager, “she regularly bullies us to give better scores.”\n\nAmazon’s Callahan said it’s against company policy for managers to attempt to influence employee responses, and that employees can always choose not to answer Connections questions if they prefer.\n\n“We’re constantly working to improve the experience of our employees, and that’s why we collect feedback daily through Connections,” she noted in a statement to Fortune. “Employees can choose whether to answer or not, their responses are always confidential and aggregated, and the feedback that leaders receive help them build stronger organizations. We hear from the vast majority of our team that it’s a useful tool, and the anecdotes that were shared with us for this story don’t reflect most people’s experiences.”\n\nCallahan added that the daily frequency of the surveying allows managers to filter results for various time frames and view trends for several questions that the tool asks regularly over a period of time. In its ideal implementation, the data allows managers to alleviate problems more quickly than if the company only polled workers monthly or annually.\n\nOn the other side of the equation, some employees have said they don’t give candid feedback because they fear a manager whom they like or respect will be penalized for employee concerns that are outside of the manager’s control.\n\nEither way, the next time Amazon cites survey data to paint a picture of its work environment, it’s worth at least noting what many employees believe: that the picture is far from complete.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Reasons Why Earnings Season Matters",
        "content": "Imagine that, once every few months, you must release information detailing your current financial standing. The public can see where you’ve spent money, made money, or even how much you’ve saved.\n\nSounds intimidating, right?\n\nThat’s just a different way of describing what earnings season is.\n\nThe period is undoubtedly hectic for market participants, with companies finally revealing what’s transpired behind closed doors.\n\nAnd on top of being hectic, it’s impossible to understate the importance of the period. For those wondering why it’s so critical, let’s look at three reasons that help explain its significance.\n\nEarnings Season Gives Critical Business Updates\n\nEarnings reports provide market participants with a plethora of information, including revenues, expenses, and profits, just to provide a few simple examples. It’s critical for investors to receive this information, as it gives a deeper view into the business and allows them to see any potential red flags.\n\nTake, for example, Arista Networks ANET, which recently upped its current year (FY24) revenue growth guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. Arista Networks has communicated that it’s been enjoying healthy demand, reflected by the guidance upgrade.\n\nArista Networks is a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), with earnings expectations moving higher across the board. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nQuarterly Reports Impact Share Prices\n\nA company’s quarterly earnings report commonly impacts its stock price, a theme market participants have undoubtedly noticed. Typically, we’ll see bullish share movement post-earnings from companies that surprise positively or raise their guidance, reflecting healthy business.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty ELF saw its shares soar post-earnings following its latest release. Concerning headline figures, earnings grew 15% alongside a 71% sales bump. Below is a chart illustrating the favorable reaction post-earnings that e.l.f. Beauty enjoyed. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nIt’s worth noting that implementing a stop-loss at a comfortable threshold will help limit spooky post-earnings price swings, preserving precious capital.\n\nEarnings Season Highlights Current Trends\n\nEarnings season can also provide a big-picture view of overall trends within the economy or industries. For example, if many companies report solid quarterly results, it likely indicates that the economy is performing well and that the stock market could benefit in response.\n\nConversely, if many companies report weaker-than-expected earnings, it may signal that the economy is slowing, which could negatively impact stocks overall.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt also provides insight into current business trends within industries, allowing investors to position themselves appropriately. For example, Amazon AMZN has posted robust AWS results as of late, reflecting an uptick in demand for cloud computing services amid the AI boom.\n\nAnalysts have become notably bullish for Amazon’s current fiscal year, with the current $4.58 Zacks Consensus EPS estimate up 93% over the last year. Below is a chart illustrating the favorable revisions trend for Amazon. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nWhile earnings season is undeniably hectic for everyone involved, that’s just the nature of the period.\n\nIt’s important for investors to understand why it matters for many reasons, including providing investors with an updated financial standing, the volatile price swings sometimes seen post-earnings, and the overall picture it provides on market and industry trends.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation",
        "content": "Oracle's Cloud Efforts Receive A Much-Needed Validation\n\nOn Tuesday, Oracle Corporation (NYSE: ORCL) posted its fiscal fourth-quarter earnings that were below estimates. But, known for its database software, Oracle went all in to expand its cloud infrastructure unit to compete with Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). Therefore, to shift the focus away from weaker than anticipated financials, management emphasized new partnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud, along with discussing the growth avenue created by the AI hype. Oracle CTO Larry Ellison also noted that Oracle's cloud infrastructure and data centers are also being used by Nvidia Corporation (NASDAQ: NVDA) and xAI, an AI company founded by Tesla Inc (NASDAQ: TSLA) CEO, Elon Musk.\n\nFiscal Fourth Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 31st, total revenue grew 3.3% to $14.29 billion, which was below LSEG’s estimate of $14.55 billion. Cloud infrastructure alone brought in $2 billion, as renting of computing power and storage increased 42%. Although it remains much smaller compared to Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Service, Oracle’s cloud unit is growing faster. The cloud services and license support segment grew 9%, generating revenue of $10.23 billion. Cloud and on-premises licenses business contracted 15% as it brought in revenue of $1.84 billion.\n\nAdjusted profit was $1.63 per share, also short of LSEG’s estimate of $1.65. Net income amounted to $3.14 billion, or $1.11 per share.\n\nPartnership with Microsoft, OpenAI and Google Cloud show undeniable cloud momentum\n\nThe aim of the partnership with Microsoft and Open AI is to extend Azure Al to Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) in order to provide additional capacity for OpenAl. Oracle also unveiled a new agreement to make its namesake database available on Google’s cloud infrastructure. As of November, organizations will be able to freely deploy workloads in Google and Oracle cloud data center regions without data-transfer charges. Along with a similar deal with Microsoft which was announced in September last year, these partnerships are expected to turbocharge Oracle’s cloud database growth.\n\nOutlook Shaped By The AI Hype\n\nFor the fiscal first quarter, Oracle guided for earnings in the range between $1.31 and $1.35 per share, with revenue growing between 5% and 7%.\n\nOracle CEO Safra Catz expects the current momentum to continue with pipeline growing even faster than bookings, with fiscal 2025 cloud infrastructure services growing even faster compared to the just-ended fiscal 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor the current fiscal year ending in May 2025, Catz expects revenue to grow in double digits, fueled by strong demand for AI workloads, adding that each successive quarter should grow faster than the previous one due to built up capacity to meet demand.\n\nShifting focus away from weak Q4 financials.\n\nMeanwhile, Oracle will be exiting its advertising business, which generated only $300 million in the fiscal year that ended on May 31st. Overall, Oracle reported weak results but its booking growth on AI demand has been evaluated as impressive by analysts, along with cloud infrastructure deals with Microsoft and Google that are a good sign, with over 30 AI sales contracts in the fourth quarter worth more than $12.5 billion in bookings. But given the expectations for increased capital spending on top of the weaker than expected results, Jefferies analysts noted some concerns that Oracle's short-term AI gains may only take it so far. With Google and Microsoft being the likely long-term AI winners, Oracle could be in for merely short-time benefits as the above partnerships won’t last forever.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "3 AI Stocks That Have Turned $25,000 Into $1 Million in 15 Years",
        "content": "It has been 15 years since the Great Recession ended. The markets have been fairly bullish since then, and investing in tech stocks over the years, especially those focused on artificial intelligence (AI), has proven to be an excellent move.\n\nBack then, it would have been difficult to predict the future of AI, but if you invested in some promising tech companies, you would be up big today. Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), and Super Micro Computer(NASDAQ: SMCI) have all been phenomenal investments during that time.\n\nHere's how much a $25,000 investment back at the end of the Great Recession in these three high-powered tech stocks would be worth right now.\n\nNvidia: $10.7 million\n\nNvidia's gains in just the past few years alone have been amazing. The stock has been red-hot, as its name has become synonymous with AI and the opportunities related to developing chatbots and next-gen technologies. Companies are falling over themselves to partner with Nvidia in the hopes of cashing in on not just opportunities, but the hype that comes along with saying that you're doing business with Nvidia.\n\nInvesting just $25,000 in Nvidia at the end of the Great Recession would have made you more than a millionaire, as your investment would be worth nearly $11 million. And at this rate, it may eclipse that mark before the end of the year.\n\nEven though the stock isn't cheap, trading at 70 times its trailing earnings, investors remain bullish. Shares of Nvidia are up over 140% this year. The business has been tripling its revenue, and investors and analysts still see much more future growth on the horizon. Predicting how much higher this already scorching-hot stock can go is no easy task.\n\nIt's hard to go wrong with Nvidia, with its leadership in the AI chip market and the need for its data center products, but investors should start to consider tempering their expectations, given the stock's mammoth $3 trillion valuation.\n\nAmazon: $1.1 million\n\nAmazon might be the original AI stock, back when investing in AI stocks wasn't really even a thing. The tech company has been using AI to revolutionize its logistics business for years, including using robots to help move packages and create efficiencies in its warehouses. More recently, it has also gotten into the chatbot wars with its $4 billion investment into Anthropic, the AI company behind Claude 3, a rival to ChatGPT.\n\nHow it all plays out is still anyone's guess, but it's fair to say AI will remain a big part of Amazon's world. One example of the potential is its partnership with UVeye, where the two companies are using AI to help automate vehicle inspections. Amazon is also planning to monetize an AI-powered version of its Alexa assistant. There are many growth opportunities still out for this near-$2 trillion business to become more valuable in the future.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvesting $25,000 into Amazon 15 years ago would have made you a millionaire today. Still, at an earnings multiple of more than 50 and without its sales skyrocketing (Amazon's revenue rose by 13% year-over-year in the first quarter),this is another tech stock investors should tread carefully with. Given its inflated valuation, it may be worth taking a bit of a wait-and-see approach with Amazon stock.\n\nSuper Micro: $2.5 million\n\nSuper Micro, also known as just Supermicro, had not outperformed Amazon over the past 15 years until recently. It wasn't until the recent hype in AI and chatbots that ignited a flame under this tech stock. But now, this fast-growing business is among the hottest AI stocks to own.\n\nThe company provides many solutions for AI, including servers, which has been a massive growth opportunity for the business. During the first three months of the year, Supermicro has reported $3.9 billion in net sales -- three times the $1.3 billion it reported a year earlier. Its profits also look fantastic, jumping from $85.8 million in the prior-year period to $402.5 million this past quarter.\n\nSupermicro is technically the cheapest stock on this list, with a price-to-earnings multiple of just 43. And its market cap of $45 billion is by far the lightest. Based on those metrics, this is the stock that may have the most upside, given its strong growth prospects to help provide companies with AI solutions and servers. So if you're going to buy an AI stock, Supermicro may be one of the better options to add to your portfolio right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have gained 23.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry’s return of 17%. The company is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nAWS has been benefiting from its strengthening generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nThe solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided AWS with a breakthrough in the generative AI space, is a major positive. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nAWS also offers Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to provide generative AI-powered customized code suggestions.\r\n\r\nThe company’s recent collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter’s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\r\n\r\nAWS’s growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market, which, per a report from Allied Market Research, is anticipated to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nStrong Clientele Aids Growth\n\nStrong generative AI capabilities, coupled with AWS’s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of infrastructure regions and Availability Zones, are bolstering its customer base.\r\n\r\nThis is evident from the latest partnership between Formula 1 (F1) and AWS. Per the terms, the former intends to introduce a generative AI-designed F1 trophy for the Canadian Grand Prix with the support of AWS.\r\n\r\nSAP’s SAP recent collaboration with AWS is also noteworthy. SAP intends to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning applications with the help of AWS.\r\n\r\nSAP will integrate generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core.\r\n\r\nNinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning chips Trainium and Inferentia2.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike and BlackBerry are other notable customers, which are using Amazon Bedrock to accelerate their business innovation. Brightcove is another customer leveraging Amazon Q Business on AWS.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS will drive the Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company’s overall performance. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, implying a year-over-year rise of 57.9%. The EPS estimate has moved north by 1.1% over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS Clientele Growth Aids Competitive Position\n\nExpanding clientele will continue to help AWS sustain its dominant position in the global cloud market and gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nAmazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon is riding on AWS’s expanding clientele and strong partner base. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus that is helping it maintain its dominant cloud position. In addition to the cloud, strong capabilities, especially in grocery and pharmacy retail, coupled with ultrafast delivery services, are boosting its e-commerce prospects. The growing footprint in the video streaming space with Prime Video is another positive.\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "From 'Whole Paycheck' To Whole New Strategy: Whole Foods Founder Hails Bezos As 'Retail Genius'",
        "content": "From 'Whole Paycheck' To Whole New Strategy: Whole Foods Founder Hails Bezos As 'Retail Genius'\n\nWhole Foods founder John Mackey has praised Amazon founder Jeff Bezos for his strategy, making the supermarket chain even more successful. He has also called him a \"retail genius.\" Here's what went down.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nAre you rich? Here’s what Americans think you need to be considered wealthy. Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nBefore Bezos and Amazon acquired the business in 2017, the supermarket chain Whole Foods was battling financially. With the rise of competition, it was becoming more difficult for the company to compete at a profit. Whole Foods was founded in 1980 by John Mackey with a small staff of 19 employees. Whole Foods revolutionized the grocery industry by offering consumers organic and natural food. The chain was well-known for its high prices, and despite Mackey's best efforts, the issues with affordability and increased competition meant that in 2006 Whole Foods' stock dropped by almost 40%. With the rise of grocery chains like Safeway and Kroger stocking organic food at much cheaper prices, Whole Foods was in trouble. Investors were pulling out and selling stocks and the management of the business saw several changes in new board members.\n\nAccording to Jon Springer, an editor from the trade publication Winsight Grocery Business, the problem with Whole Foods was that \"Consumers no longer had to go to Whole Foods to get what you could find in Whole Foods.\" Amazon's purchase of the organic grocery chain was Whole Foods' saving grace, as Mackey has expressed.\n\nTrending:Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US. Investing in its booming real estate market has never been more accessible.\n\nAmazon bought the supermarket chain in 2017 for a staggering $13.7 billion, marking the online e-commerce giant's entrance into the grocery industry. At the time, many people were worried about what this meant for other supermarket chains. Springer revealed that the sale of Whole Foods felt like a blow to the industry. \"Stock of all the conventional supermarkets and the Walmarts of the world just got devastated by this one announcement.\"\n\nThis acquisition also brought some positive changes for the business. Mackey has admitted that it's only thanks to Bezos that Whole Foods' prices have become more accessible to consumers. In an interview with Fortune, Mackey revealed, \"Amazon let us drop our prices four times.\" Mackey added, \"Jeff's a brilliant man; he’s a genius. What I like about Jeff the most, besides he's creative and entrepreneurial, is he thinks really long term.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nThis move to cut Whole Foods' prices could not have come at a better time, considering the country is battling high inflation, pushing food prices up by 21% since January 2021.\n\nTrending:82% of Americans aren’t using this government secured 5% passive income stream, are you one of them?\n\nIn addition to helping the business attract more consumers who are shopping on a budget, Bezos gave employees a pay rise and helped shed the supermarket chain's reputation for being a \"whole check\" store due to its previous high prices. Mackey explains gratefully, \"I hardly ever hear the ‘whole paycheck' narrative any longer — that's due to Amazon.\"\n\nAmazon did this by slashing prices, which hurt revenue in the short term but has paid off in the long run. By offering savings to Prime members and hosting Prime Day discounts, consumers could save up to 50% on certain items.\n\nDespite all the changes the e-commerce giant has made, including a new CEO, Jason Buechel, Mackey has emphasized that Amazon never tried to force its culture on the supermarket chain. \"They didn’t try to change Whole Foods\" despite this being common in the business world. Amazon still has bigger plans for Whole Foods, as Buechel revealed at a Milken Institute Global Conference in May that they plan to open around 30 stores a year and have already opened 60 new locations.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today?

        "title": "3 Unshakeable Stocks to Buy for Slowing U.S. Growth",
        "content": "The U.S. economy is certainly showing some signs of slowing, raising questions about which stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth. According to the household survey of the May employment report, the number of people with jobs dropped by 408,000 last month. Further, the unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022 and the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.2 of a percentage point. Also in May, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) came in at 48.7.\n\nPMI readings below 50 indicate that the sector being measured is contracting. And as I pointed out in a previous article, the housing sector, which is an important sector of the U.S. economy, appears to be poised to contract. Also importantly, consumers are reducing the amount that they spend on goods, while lower-end consumers are generally in bad shape, USA Todayreported on June 10. For investors who want to protect their portfolios from the impact of the decelerating economy, here are three stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth.\n\nEaton (ETN)\n\nBank of Americarecently named electrical-components maker Eaton (NYSE:ETN) as one of the top 19 beneficiaries of the electrification of the economy. Among the trends that will create large increases in the demand for electricity are the proliferation of AI and data centers, the bank noted. Given the huge cash reserves of many firms driving the latter trends, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) these developments are unlikely to falter from slowing economic growth. Moreover, very few people cut back a great deal on electricity usage during economic downturns, so the utilities that buy Eaton’s equipment will not curtail their spending plans if economic growth slows a great deal. The imperviousness of Eaton’s customers to economic slowdowns makes it one of the best stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso importantly, the firm is benefiting significantly from high government spending on infrastructure, along with various tax breaks and chip-manufacturing subsidies implemented by Washington in recent years.\n\nIn the first quarter, Eaton’s operating cash flow soared 42% versus the same period a year earlier to $475 million. Also impressively, the backlog of its electrical business jumped 27% year-over-year as of the end of Q1, while it raised its revenue growth guidance, excluding the impact of acquisitions, to 7%-9% from 6.5%-8.5%.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nLike Eaton, NextEra (NYSE:NEE) seems very well-positioned to benefit from large increases in electricity demand going forward. NextEra owns the nation’s largest electric utility and sells large amounts of renewable energy.\n\nStory continues\n\nUtilities are widely expected to get a sizeable boost from the electrification of the economy. Moreover, many data center owners rely primarily on renewable energy.\n\nLikely because of these strong, positive catalysts, NextEra is one of eightutility stocks upon which Goldman Sachs has bestowed “buy” ratings. Like me, Goldman views utilities as having “Defensive” characteristics and believes that the utility sector is an effective play on the proliferation of AI.\n\nInvestor’s Business Daily gives NEE stock a very high Composite Rating of 92, along with an Accumulation/Distribution grade of A. The latter rating indicates that many large institutional investors have been buying significant amounts of NEE stock over the last 13 weeks.\n\nNEE stock has a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 22 times.\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nI believe that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be rather resilient to slowing economic growth. That’s because Netflix is a very cheap form of entertainment, and a recession would likely accelerate the cord-cutting trend. The latter development, in turn, would cause the growth of Netflix’s subscriber base and ad revenue to meaningfully accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, after conducting a survey of Netflix users late last month, investment bank Evercore ISIwrote that the satisfaction levels of the company’s users have increased by five percentage points versus the previous quarter to 61%. And well-known Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney, who met with the company’s management, believes that “Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally and competitively that we have ever seen.” The bank reiterated an “outperform” rating on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that Netflix can benefit financially from its inclusion in multi-channel bundles. Recently, for example, Comcast (NYSE:CMCSA) included the company in a bundle with Peacock and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Well, it's official: Another company has surpassed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap. Last week, Nvidia became the second-largest U.S. company, trailing only Microsoft.\n\nIt was another blow to Apple, whose revenue remains stuck in neutral. And it's facing a federal antitrust lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, given Apple's struggles and the impressive growth of some of its fellow tech megacaps, several more companies will likely surpass Apple's market value over the next decade. I expect Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will be among them.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, trailing Apple by \"only\" $900 billion.\n\nAt first blush, that gap might seem insurmountable, but for a megacap, it's entirely feasible. Nvidia, for instance, closed a recent gap of $1.8 trillion with Apple in less than six months.\n\nAnd Alphabet is up by about 26% year to date, while Apple is up just 6%. That means the former has shrunk the lead of the latter by about $275 billion so far this year. If that trend continues, Alphabet will surpass Apple in size within a couple of years.\n\nThat might turn out to be too much to expect, but over the long term, I do think Alphabet will catch up. First and foremost, Apple is a hardware company. It designs and sells computers, tablets, watches, and smartphones. Alphabet, on the other hand, is a software company. Its signature business is internet search through Google. It makes most of its money by selling digital ads. Crucially, digital advertising is cheap and easy to scale; mass production of physical electronics is not.\n\nWhat's more, Apple has put its signature product, the iPhone, into the hands of almost every human being who might want one. With an estimated 1.4 billion iPhones in use today, there's little room for it to grow its share of that key market.\n\nConversely, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% in the first quarter. The company relies on digital ad revenue (from its Google search business and YouTube), subscription revenue (YouTube, Google Fiber), and data center revenue from its Google Cloud segment. Those diversified revenue streams will help keep its growth humming along well into the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nE-commerce and cloud services leader Amazon has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, which trails Apple by about $1.2 trillion.\n\nBut like Alphabet, Amazon has narrowed the gap this year. Amazon shares have rallied by 22% year to date, with the company's market cap increasing by about $300 billion, while Apple has gained around $150 billion. If Amazon keeps closing the gap at that rate, it could catch Apple in around four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn't out of the question. Amazon's annual revenue is almost $600 billion -- roughly the same size as Sweden's entire economy in 2022. Moreover, the company is growing sales by 13% year over year, with its expansive e-commerce business and its industry-leading cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nMoreover, the pace and size of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could further accelerate that growth. AWS is a key driver for Amazon's profits, and that segment is in position to capitalize on this revolution. AI-powered apps require enormous computing power, the sort that can only be provided by high-performance data centers, many of which are run by AWS.\n\nAmazon is a tech juggernaut that is likely to continue growing -- and growing faster than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Jim Cramer Says Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Has More Upside",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nJim Cramer in a latest program talked about the effect of inflation on US consumers and discussed how it’s impacting the Haves and the Have Nots. Cramer said while everyone is feeling the “pinch of inflation,” the Have Nots are feeling a “heck of a lot more” than the Haves.  Cramer said that the difference between these two classes of consumers is very important for investment portfolios. He complained that many retailers don’t even know their consumers and that’s why they have a totally different reading of the current economic situation and its effects on consumers. Cramer criticized those who aren’t careful about the differences between consumers and use “the consumer” as a blanket term.\n\nCramer talked about several retail companies and how they are directly feeling the effects of inflation as consumers cut back on spending. The CNBC host said that Americans are making tough choices because of rising prices but we usually don’t talk about it.\n\nJim Cramer said that many strategists demand several rate cuts because “they want stocks higher.”\n\n“I want higher stock prices too but if we get multiple rate cuts and inflation comes roaring back, it’s the Have Nots that will get hurt.”\n\nJay Powell Is Worried About Tens of Millions of People With Almost Nothing in the Bank, Cramer Says\n\nJim Cramer said that while many people won’t be happy to see a strong jobs report (because that decreases the chances of rate cuts), they should keep in mind the tough situation the Federal Reserve is in.\n\n“Jay Powell isn’t worried about those of us with big portfolios. He’s worried about the tens of millions of people with almost nothing in the bank.”\n\nFor this article we watched several latest programs of Jim Cramer aired recently and picked 10 stocks he’s bullish about and recommending investors to buy or hold. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Jim Cramer Recommending Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) Stock in June?\n\nAmazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 302\n\nIn a recent program, Jim Cramer said that he thinks Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) has a “lot of room to go higher.” Cramer is bullish on Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) advertising business. He also praised the company’s AWS business and said Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) is “back with a great growth number.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is indeed growing rapidly. AWS operating margins crossed 37% during the first quarter. AWS operating margins have now came in more than 30% for the past five straight quarters. Amazon.com Inc’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue in the first quarter jumped 12.5% YoY and its adjusted EPS more than tripled. Revenue in North America and International segments grew as well. Analysts believe digital ads is another strong revenue stream for Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), with revenue from the segment increasing 24% YoY to $11.8 billion in the first quarter.\n\nBaron Fifth Avenue Growth Fund stated the following regarding Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).”\n\nOverall, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 1st on Insider Monkey’s list of Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June. You can visit Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "3 Top Artificial Intelligence Stocks to Buy in June",
        "content": "To say that artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the tech world by storm would be an understatement. Although AI technology has been around for decades, the popularity of OpenAI's ChatGPT and other generative AI tools has catapulted the technology into the mainstream.\n\nWith AI's newfound popularity, companies are rushing to capitalize and spending billions to ensure they're not left behind in what some think will be the biggest technological development since the introduction of the internet. For investors who are interested in getting exposure to this exploding trend, the following three companies are great options.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) is one of a handful of companies that have seen their valuation explode along with the AI hype. With a market capitalization of over $3.1 trillion, Microsoft is the world's most valuable public company.\n\nThe tech giant has invested billions in OpenAI and formed a strategic partnership that benefits both parties. Azure, Microsoft's cloud platform, is OpenAI's computing platform and infrastructure, giving it the supercomputing capabilities it needs to train and deploy its models.\n\nIn return, Microsoft gets exclusive licenses to OpenAI's large language models (LLMs). With access to OpenAI's LLMs (arguably some of the best available), Microsoft can integrate these powerful AI models into its own ecosystem of products and services. From Azure to Office products to Dynamic 365, adding advanced AI capabilities will enhance performance, improve the user experience, and bolster Microsoft's offerings.\n\nRegarding Azure, AI could fuel a growth machine that's already Microsoft's fastest-growing segment. In the third quarter of its fiscal 2024, Microsoft's revenue grew 17% year over year to $61.9 billion, driven by the 31% revenue growth of Azure and other cloud services. MSFT Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nEven without recent AI developments, Microsoft's products and services were staples in the global business world. With this new component, the company is positioned to be a driving force of technology.\n\n2. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nWhile AI is generally associated with software, there are vital hardware components that shouldn't be overlooked. That's where Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM) (TSMC) comes into the picture. TSMC is the world's largest semiconductor producer, creating chips that are the cornerstone of the AI pipeline.\n\nTSMC's chips are used in data centers, graphics processing units (GPUs), AI accelerators, and other products that allow for faster, more efficient data processing vital to AI application training, deployment, and operation. Without TSMC's chips, you could argue that AI advancements would be significantly slowed, making it indispensable in the AI supply chain.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe high performance of TSMC's chips has made them the choice of some of the world's top tech companies. Microsoft and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) use them for their data centers, Nvidia uses them for its GPUs, Apple uses them for smartphones, and dozens of other companies rely on them for their products. It's worked wonders for TSMC's financials, too.\n\nIn the first quarter, TSMC generated close to $18.9 billion in revenue, up close to 13% over the prior year. High-Performance Computing (HPC), which includes AI and data center applications, accounted for 46% of it and is TSMC's largest revenue segment. Smartphones, which were 38% of revenue, continue to be a pain point for TSMC with slow sales, but that shouldn't negate its long-term growth potential.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nAmazon has been using AI for a while now, whether it be for product recommendations, optimizing its supply chain, or assisting customers with chatbots. Even so, it's still in the earlier stages of fully incorporating AI into its vast ecosystem of products and services.\n\nAmazon is one of the leaders in machine learning, having invested heavily in the technology. Amazon's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), is one of the most comprehensive platforms on the market. It offers SageMaker -- which simplifies the process of building, training, and deploying machine learning models -- advanced data processing tools, and AI-powered analytics.\n\nAWS is the world's leading cloud platform, with a 31% market share as of the first quarter. While Azure has a 25% market share and has been gaining ground in recent years, AWS should continue to be Amazon's bread-and-butter profit generator. Although AWS generated only around 17% of Amazon's first-quarter revenue, it accounted for over 61% of its operating income (profit from its core business operations). AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nAs an extension of its wildly successful e-commerce business, Amazon's introduction of Supply Chain by Amazon stands to gain a lot from AI developments. Supply Chain by Amazon is a one-stop shop for businesses looking to streamline their logistics, and Amazon's AI developments should enhance these capabilities even further.\n\nWith its extensive AI integration and expansion of AWS, Amazon is well-positioned to continue its market-beating growth and return great shareholder value.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Taiwan Semiconductor's European Subsidiary To Hire 2K Employees In Semiconductor Push\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) plans to hire nearly 2,000 employees from Germany and other European countries through its subsidiary, European Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (ESMC), according to ESMC president Christian Koitzsch, the Taipei Times reports.\n\nIn 2024, the tech sector surpassed 2023’s layoff figures, with over 42,324 workers losing their jobs. This follows nearly 263,000 tech layoffs in 2023, continuing the industry’s trend of job cuts. Major companies, including Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), announced significant layoffs.\n\nThe rapid advancement in AI technology requires substantial investments in new technologies, prompting companies to reallocate resources and reduce their workforce.\n\nIn August 2023, TSMC announced a joint venture with Robert Bosch GmbH, Infineon Technologies AG, and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI) to establish ESMC, with TSMC holding a 70% stake.\n\nThe joint venture plans to begin construction of a 12-inch wafer fab in Dresden in the second half of 2024, aiming for mass production by the end of 2027. The facility will use TSMC’s 12nm, 16nm, 22nm, and 28nm processes to produce automotive electronics and specialty industrial devices.\n\nKoitzsch, who previously held roles at Bosch, will lead ESMC and oversee the training of employees in Taiwan.\n\nThe clean room will span about 45,000 square meters, and the plant will implement green technologies to reduce water and power consumption.\n\nThe key Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) supplier outperformed its Chinese counterpart, Semiconductor Manufacturing International, forcing Chinese AI chip firms to downgrade designs to fulfill the U.S. embargo.\n\nTSMC clocked a 30% sales growth, reaching $7.1 billion in May.\n\nTSMC led with a 62% market share in the first quarter.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock gained 55% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "7 Trending Stocks With Momentum on Their Side",
        "content": "Traders and other investors looking to take short positions in trending stocks with momentum on their side should consider this list. It covers seven equities that have maintained positive trajectories over the past month and in many cases, the entirety of this year and beyond.\n\nThere are also many ways to measure momentum. Stock market momentum is much like the momentum we learned about in sciences classes. Everything depends on the principle that objects, or stocks in this case, tend to continue in the same direction once momentum has started.\n\nBearing that in mind, let’s look at seven stocks that are trending at the moment and why investors should decide to ride that momentum higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) continues to impress investors from Wall Street to Main Street. Share price broke out again following the release of first quarter earnings on May 22.\n\nThe $26 billion in revenues Nvidia reported represented massive growth on a year-over-year basis. And the AI data center opportunity continues to be massive and very apparent, accounting for $22.6 billion of those $26 billion in overall revenues.\n\nThe question becomes how much higher can Nvidia run given the fact that it has quickly jumped from under $1,000 to above $1,200. Now it appears that $1,400 is very much a possibility. What objective means can we use to substantiate such an assertion?\n\nI think the answer is gross margin percentage. Generally speaking, gross margin percentage is an indication of emerging durable competitive advantage. That metric rose from 65% to 78% in the last 12 months. It indicates that Nvidia’s pricing power is strengthening, which in turn indicates improving economics within the company.\n\nIt’s all another way of stating the fact that Nvidia produces the most in demand chips for AI applications and holds a massive pricing advantage because of that fact. Time will tell how durable that competitive advantage is, but for now it should be enough to keep momentum in Nvidia’s favor.\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir Logo. Palantir Technologies (PLTR) is a publicly traded American company that focuses on the specialized field of big data analytics.\n\nSource: Iljanaresvara Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir (NYSE:PLTR) continues to grow and do better than many had expected. In the process, it has become one of the more notable enterprise AI stocks to consider.\n\nMost investors know the story of Palantir by now. It started out as the anti-Silicon Valley analytics firm with a heavy predisposition toward government and defense sector revenue generation. A lot of vested interests wanted the company to fail. It didn’t.\n\nStory continues\n\nInstead, Palantir reached profitability much quicker than anticipated. Today, it’s a company that boasts six consecutive quarters of GAAP profitability. What’s particularly interesting is that while government side revenues continue to account for the majority of sales, Palantir’s commercial side revenues are growing much faster, at 27% vs. 16%.\n\nThat strong commercial growth is both an indication of, and testament to, Palantir’s enterprise AI capabilities. Other enterprise AI competitors including C3.ai (NYSE:AI) have not lived up to their billing. Meanwhile, Palantir continues to quietly establish itself as an emerging force in the AI space. Enterprise AI will continue to account for the majority of AI spending and that simple fact is a strong reason to assume that PLTR stock will continue to rise.\n\nSynopsys (SNPS) Person holding mobile phone with logo of American technology company Synopsys Inc. (SNPS) on screen in front of web page. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSynopsys (NASDAQ:SNPS) is a critical player within the semiconductor industry that arguably doesn’t get as much attention as it should. While this article isn’t about underappreciated stocks, it is another factor to consider about Synopsys as it trends positively.\n\nThe company provides the software used to design some of the most complex AI chips in high demand today. Synopsys’ customer base includes Nvidia, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), AdvancedMicro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) among others. The company is a critical link in the AI chip supply chain overall.\n\nInvestors who look at the stock chart of Synopsys in 2024 will see two distinct trend lines. The second of which began In mid-April. Synopsys could continue to rise higher after raising guidance two weeks ago following a better than expected earnings report. The company expects further growth from the AI chip design software sector which is why the company currently has momentum on its side.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) has significant momentum on its side. The stock has risen by more than 28% in 2024, and 11% in the last month alone.\n\nDo a bit of research into Costco Wholesale and it becomes evident that shares are overpriced. The company’s current P/E ratio of 52.21 is near all-time highs and well above the 10-year average.\n\nMomentum raises prices so the high P/E ratio shouldn’t be particularly surprising. However, it should raise the question of why investors should continue to believe in Costco at these prices.\n\nThe answer has to do with its position as one of the best retail defensive stocks available. It represents a strong play for those who believe that the AI narrative is overblown and have pivoted out as a result. It’s also an excellent choice for those investors who continue to worry whether rate cuts will happen in 2024 at all. So, despite share prices, Costco continues to be a strong choice because of economic uncertainty, not to mention strong growth in the business itself.\n\nMercadoLibre (MELI) MercadoLibre (MELI) homepage on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nLet’s begin our discussion of MercadoLibre (NASDAQ:MELI) the stock’s with P/E ratio.\n\nMercadoLibre’s P/E ratio is higher than 89% of industry competitors, very similar to Costco. At those levels the question becomes whether or not such evaluation is warranted. I think the answer is yes in the case of MercadoLibre.\n\nLet me present two ideas that I would use to substantiate that assertion. The first is simply that MercadoLibre is the leading fintech company serving the Latin American market. There are substantial opportunities to continue to serve the region’s unbanked population. The astounding growth of MercadoLibre’s payment volume is a strong indication that the company is addressing that opportunity.\n\nThe second piece of evidence I would use to suggest MercadoLibre’s current valuation is accurate is gross margin. It has consistently stayed above 40% over the last decade. That level of sustained gross margin indicates MercadoLibre has a sustainable competitive advantage. Simply put, MercadoLibre is a dominant force that will continue to thrive.\n\nMcKesson Corporation (MCK) McKesson headquarters in Irving, TX\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nMcKesson Corporation (NYSE:MCK) stock has trended sharply upward over the past few weeks despite the fact that the company disappointed when it released earnings on May 8. The earnings miss was attributed to a slump in demand for branded specialty and generic drugs the distributor sells.\n\nThe media hasn’t reported much on the spike in demand for McKesson stock over the last few weeks but I can posit a few theories. Actually, one big theory which I think accounts for the stock’s strong momentum despite weak earnings.\n\nMcKesson is one of the three largest drug wholesale distributors in the U.S. that collectively distributes more than 90% of all U.S. prescriptions.\n\nI think the strong performance has to do with the emergence of GLP-1 inhibitors, or weight loss drugs. The company has a golden opportunity to capitalize on the rapid emergence of FDA approved weight loss drugs.\n\nA lot of steam has run out of drug maker stocks like Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Novo Nordisk (NYSE:NVO) which is why distributors are one of the next logical places to look for GLP-1 opportunities.\n\nMicrostrategy (MSTR) In this photo illustration, the MicroStrategy (MSTR) Incorporated logo is displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrostrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is an enterprise analytics stock but a company that everyone knows primarily because of its position in Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nMomentum is currently on Microstrategy’s side as Bitcoin prices rise above $70,000 again. The company held 214,000 Bitcoin as of April 26. The company bought those Bitcoins for a total purchase price of $7.54 billion, or an average of $35,180. Yet, the company missed on earnings due to an accounting technicality which is well explained in this video.\n\nMicrostrategy stock continues to be an interesting investment solely because of its Bitcoin strategy. The company markets itself as an enterprise AI software firm but it isn’t doing well in that regard. Revenues fell by 5% which indicates that it isn’t a particularly competitive analytics software firm. Anyway, the point here is Microstrategy rises and falls with Bitcoin’s price. Bitcoin is strong again and that shifts momentum in Microstrategy’s favor.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Growth Stocks BlackRock Is Buying (and You Should Too)",
        "content": "Impressively, BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) was founded in 1988 in New York. So, this iconic company is likely younger than many people reading this article. However, impressively, BlackRock’s total assets under management crossed $10 trillion back in 2021. This number has stayed relatively stable since. But this sort of growth has caused many to envision BlackRock as some sort of enigmatic entity that controls everything.\n\nThat’s generally a far-fetched view of the company, but I do think BlackRock’s buying activity is important for other reasons. For retail investors, it may be worth considering which stocks this company is buying. Doing so may allow certain investors to replicate parts of BlackRock’s broader investing strategy.\n\nLarger institutional investors tend to have a significant resource advantage, and BlackRock has certainly advanced this idea. The company has been behind many notable changes in the stock market, such as ESG investing. As such, following in BlackRock’s footsteps could lead to outsized gains relative to those investing in passive index funds, if you believe the institutional money manager’s process works.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nHere are seven growth stocks to consider I think fits the bill. That’s because each of these seven companies are ones Blackrock bought more of in the first quarter.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Image of corporate building with Microsoft logo above the entrance.\n\nSource: NYCStock / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) doesn’t really need an introduction. I believe Microsoft’s strong Q3 results highlight why it remains one of the most compelling long-term investments in the tech sector, if not the best. The company reported record revenue of $61.86 billion this past quarter, up an impressive 17% year-over-year. These results were driven by the continued strength of its Microsoft Cloud platform, which surpassed $35 billion in sales.\n\nMicrosoft is firing on all cylinders. Its Azure cloud infrastructure is taking market share, and the company is making significant strides in advancing the artificial intelligence revolution via partnerships with OpenAI and others.\n\nThe white-collar sector already can’t get enough of Microsoft’s productivity products, and with Microsoft Copilot adding more appeal, I expect these AI tailwinds to further propel Microsoft’s growth. While the stock isn’t cheap at 32-times forward earnings, Microsoft’s indispensable role in the global economy and its fortress-like competitive advantages make it a core holding for any growth portfolio. It’s no surprise that BlackRock is betting big on Microsoft’s long-term potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nConfluent (CFLT) An image of different overlaid data charts\n\nSource: solarseven/Shutterstock\n\nConfluent (NASDAQ:CFLT) provides a data streaming platform based on Apache Kafka. The company is riding powerful secular growth tailwinds in the real-time data processing, cloud adoption, and digital transformation areas of the economy, which should continue to see strong demand for years to come. While currently unprofitable, Confluent’s Q1 results show investors that this is a company that’s rapidly moving towards sustained profitability.\n\nConfluent reported 25% revenue growth this past quarter, or a top line number of $217 million. This number beat estimates, with the company’s high-growth Confluent Cloud product now comprising the majority of its sales. Analysts now expect around 20%-25% top-line growth to continue for the foreseeable future. Importantly, Confluent also posted an impressive improvement in its operating margins to 22%, the fourth straight quarter of such gains. Analysts expect full-year 2024 profitability with accelerating earnings growth ahead.\n\nWith elite institutions like BlackRock buying the stock, Confluent appears well-positioned to emerge as one of the most dominant software players of this decade. This positioning has many analysts seeing juicy upside for CFLT stock. Confluent upside\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nNutanix (NTNX)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNutanix (NASDAQ:NTNX) provides cloud computing software for businesses to manage their data centers and IT infrastructure. The company is also riding several powerful mega trends that could propel the stock significantly higher in the years ahead. In its latest quarter, Nutanix grew revenue 16.9% year-over-year to $525 million, while annual recurring revenue (ARR) surged 24% to $1.82 billion. Management highlighted steady demand as organizations prioritize digital transformation and infrastructure modernization to optimize costs. I’m of the view NTNX stock is owns that should recover alongside its improving earnings per share numbers. Nutanix EPS\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nRecently, Nutanix scored a major win with a Fortune 50 financials company looking to automate its database deployment using Nutanix’s cloud platform. Another Fortune 500 consumer goods provider decided to standardize its back-end on Nutanix’s software stack and swap out a competitor’s footprint.\n\nI believe Nutanix’s best-in-class platform positions the company at the center of the hybrid multi-cloud and data center automation revolutions. With shares already up 81.5% over the past year, I wouldn’t be surprised to see this momentum continue as more large enterprises turn to Nutanix to maximize their IT efficiency in this digital age.\n\nPure Storage (PSTG) A photo of a storage facility hallway.\n\nSource: Kostsov / Shutterstock.com\n\nNotice a trend here? I definitely do. Blackrock is betting massively on data center companies. Pure Storage (NYSE:PSTG) provides data storage hardware and software solutions. The company is also among those on this list that delivered strong Q1 results, with revenue growing 17.7% year-over-year to $693 million, beating estimates by $13 million. Pure Storage is seeing early success in capturing AI-related opportunities across high-performance computing, enterprise inference engines and upgrading enterprise storage to eliminate data silos. I believe the hyper-growth upside AI provides is a major tailwind that could propel PSTG stock much higher. And notably, subscriptions have been driving most of the growth here: Pure Storage subscriptions revenue\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe company’s management team recently highlighted a key platform win with a managed service provider specializing in AI infrastructure, demonstrating Pure Storage’s differentiated offerings. The company’s unified Purity platform simplifies data management across on-premises and cloud environments, which is crucial for enterprises looking to use AI. As more companies jump aboard, and the company continues to diversify its client base, investors stand to benefit from increased cash flow stability.\n\nWith PSTG shares already up 83% over the past year, some may think this rally may be overdone. However, I think this is a stock that could see its momentum continue, as long as the company sustains its robust growth trajectory.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) dominates the high-growth e-commerce and cloud computing sectors. I believe this tech titan is morphing into an AI and data powerhouse, resulting in a stock that continues to make new highs. In Q1, Amazon delivered an impressive 13% revenue growth (ex-FX) to $143.3 billion. The company’s operating income also skyrocketed 221% to $15.3 billion, as Amazon’s efficiency efforts are clearly paying off.\n\nIn the world of mega-cap cloud players, AWS remains the undisputed leader. Amazon Cloud Services now provide the lion’s share of Amazon’s profits. And with generative AI tools already used by over 100,000 sellers, Amazon is harnessing cutting-edge tech to enhance its ecosystem.\n\nI expect key tailwinds like the continued shift to online shopping, AWS’s dominance, and emerging AI innovations to provide long-term capital appreciation to patient investors. While consumers are cautious (trading down in this uncertain economy), Amazon’s everyday low prices and ultra-fast delivery are clearly resonating with a loyal clientele.\n\nAs long as the macro picture improves (or at least cooperates), I believe Amazon will command a premium valuation – maybe even a higher multiple. In my view, this is an evergreen stock to buy and hold long-term.\n\nPinterest (PINS) the pinterest (PINS stock) logo on a mobile phone held by a woman\n\nSource: Nopparat Khokthong / Shutterstock.com\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) operates a visual discovery engine for finding ideas like recipes, home and style inspiration, and more. While some may consider Pinterest a fading social media platform, the company’s latest results paint a different picture. In Q1, Pinterest achieved its highest user and revenue growth since 2021, with global monthly active users (MAUs) surpassing 500 million for the first time. Specifically, this metric grew to 518 million monthly users, up 12% year-over-year. Revenue also impressed, growing 23% to $740 million, nearly doubling the growth rate from the previous quarter.\n\nI believe several mega trends could propel Pinterest higher in the coming years. The continued shift to digital advertising plays to Pinterest’s strengths, as its visual format and user intent make it an attractive platform for brands. The company’s focus on AI-driven improvements to content relevance and curation is deepening user engagement. And with Pinterest’s earnings per share and revenue expected to double over the next five years, Pinterest’s growth story seems far from over.\n\nWhile primarily popular with women, Pinterest’s expanding user base and reaccelerating ad revenue suggest it may be an under-appreciated growth opportunity that’s just hitting its stride. BlackRock is in, and I am too.\n\nHealthpeak Properties (DOC) healthcare stocks: doctors posing. retirement stocks. Healthcare stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nHealthpeak Properties (NYSE:DOC) is a healthcare REIT that owns and develops real estate serving the healthcare industry. While the stock has struggled to regain its 2013 peak, I believe there are compelling reasons BlackRock is still interested in this company. In Q1, Healthpeak delivered revenue of $600.81 million, beating estimates and translating into impressive 15.65% year-over-year growth. Management also raised full-year 2024 earnings guidance by 2 cents at its midpoint.\n\nHealthpeak’s recent merger seems to be a major positive catalyst, with the integration exceeding expectations. Healthpeak has already successfully internalized its property management business, acquiring 17 million square feet of profitable real estate to add to its growing portfolio. With plans to pursue additional deals, I believe significant growth is certainly possible from here. Over the next year, the company’s EBIT should inflect higher, pushing DOC stock up. Helathpeak EPS estimates\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnd while investors wait for DOC stock to recover, Healthpeak’s 6.2% dividend yield should provide more than enough incentive to keep holding. I don’t think this is a real estate company that’s posted to slash its dividend anytime soon, as the company’s payout ratio and dividend yield metrics are reasonable (and have stabilized quite a bit). DOC dividends\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nAnalysts also expect robust 22.4% sales growth this year and 5%-plus annual earnings per share growth starting next year. Along with the other names on this list, I can see why BlackRock likes this name.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Nvidia and Buying This Stock Instead",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is the poster stock for the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, but it's been a market-crushing stock for much longer than the current hype might suggest.\n\nIt's made a stunning leap over the past year, up more than 200% and jumping past Alphabet and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) to reach the third-largest market cap on the stock market at nearly $3 trillion.\n\nIs this the end of the road? Almost definitely not. Nvidia is still the main producer of chips for generative AI, and it has many other products that drive progress in the tech industry.\n\nHowever, some investors think their dollars will work better right now in other stocks. Several billionaire investors sold off shares of Nvidia in the 2024 first quarter, including Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne, who sold 441,551 shares; Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors, who sold 2,462,716 shares; Israel Englander of Millennium Management, who sold 720,004 shares; and John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma, who sold 420,801 shares.\n\nInstead, many billionaire investors are buying another trillion-dollar market cap stock: Amazon. Englander of Millennium Management bought 2,390,755 shares in the first quarter, while Citadel's Griffin bought 6,577,909 shares. Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management bought 785,018 shares, and other billionaires bought shares as well.\n\nShould you buy Amazon stock too?\n\nThe generative AI revolution\n\nAs with Nvidia, many of Amazon's opportunities are tied to AI. Amazon has emerged as a leader in AI technology, and it's using it throughout its empire of businesses.\n\nFirst and foremost is Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business. Amazon is the top cloud computing company in the world, with 31% of overall market share.\n\nAmazon has developed a competitive set of groundbreaking generative AI services to appeal to any kind of business client. It has three tiers, starting from tools for developers to create their own large language models (LLMs), moving to semi-custom solutions with Amazon's own LLMs, and finishing with turnkey programs that any layman can use. For example, it recently launched a new service for third-party vendors to input a URL to a webpage, and the tool automatically creates product descriptions on Amazon. More than 100,000 clients have already used AWS' generative AI services.\n\nAWS is gaining momentum and accelerating again after clients began to cut budgets in the inflationary environment. Sales increased 16% year over year in the 2024 first quarter, and Amazon signed several deals, as usual, with high-profile clients. AWS is a profit machine; operating income increased 84% year over year in the first quarter to $9.4 billion and accounted for 61% of the total.\n\nStory continues\n\nCEO Andy Jassy said, \"I think there are really unbelievable growth opportunities in front of us.\" He explained that 85% of IT (information technology) spend is still not on the cloud, but that's going to switch and create a tremendous growth opportunity for cloud computing companies.\n\nE-commerce is on the rise\n\nLet's not forget e-commerce, which is almost synonymous with Amazon. Amazon accounts for 38% of overall U.S. e-commerce sales, with Walmart in second place at only 6%. This is a chasm too wide for any challenger to narrow anytime in the near future, and Amazon consistently improves its processes to maintain or widen the gap.\n\nThe company recently restructured its delivery infrastructure to eight regional warehouses instead of a national strategy, and that has already produced strong results. It's getting more packages to more customers within two days, and since there are fewer miles to travel on average, it costs Amazon less. What's probably an even more important benefit is that as customers get more products faster, they rely on Amazon for more of their everyday shopping, leading to greater loyalty that should produce long-term positive effects.\n\nE-commerce is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 9.5% over the next five years, according to Statista. That's straight up organic growth for Amazon.\n\nWhat Amazon is coming for next\n\nAmazon is no slouch in streaming, which is included in a Prime subscription, although that's been changed to the ad-supported tier. It has moved to the two-tier system like its competition and now charges more for members to watch without ads.\n\nIt has a premier film studio since its acquisition of MGM Studios, and the combined Amazon-MGM effort is already creating popular and highly watched content. It also sells its own streaming devices in addition to its smart device lineup.\n\nOne of The company's new breakout businesses is advertising. It uses the power of AI to show shoppers the products they're already shopping for and it's bringing its advertising prowess to the ad-supported streaming tier. Advertising is Amazon's fastest-growing segment, up 24% year over year in the first quarter, and there's lots of momentum here.\n\nIt's not surprising that billionaires recognize the opportunity in owing Amazon stock, and it's a great candidate for retail investors as well.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TW:2330) will be a \"beneficiary\" of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s plans to enhance to its artificial intelligence capabilities, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts said that the world's leading contract chipmaker will see increased demand from Apple for its semiconductors, many of which are used in AI applications. Apple is TSMC's biggest client, accounting for roughly a fourth of its revenue.\n\n\"We believe the semi[conductor] demand upside from Apple can get bigger with its widening AI service, from a relatively low base. TSMC is Apple’s supplier for the A- and M-series semiconductors and is well poised to benefit from multi-year growth,\" the BofA analysts said.\n\nThey reiterated their \"Buy\" rating of TSMC's stock and lifted their estimates for the firm's 2024 to 2026 earnings by 1% to 3%.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI that will see the iPhone-maker fold ChatGPT into its products. The agreement, which was revealed at Apple's annual developers conference on Monday, comes as the tech giant looks to enhance its AI offerings following an intensifying surge in enthusiasm around the nascent technology.\n\nPrior to the event investors were speculating if Apple would roll out new generative AI features, particularly as it looks to address a growing feeling that it was lagging behind its Big Tech rivals like e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Chief Executive Tim Cook lauded the new \"Apple Intelligence\" system, which aims to use AI to improve its Siri voice assistant and deliver more personalized offerings, as the company's \"next big step.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSMC poised to \"benefit\" from Apple's AI push - Bank of America\n\nJefferies dissects Apple's 7% surge higher\n\nPetMed Express shares slump premarket after Q4 loss widens\n\nView comments",

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge in 2019, and as part of that commitment, the company is on a path to match all of the electricity used by its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. Amazon has been named the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy for the last four years — a position it’s held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has more than 500 renewable energy projects globally. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world’s most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "content": "(Reuters) - Thousands of Amazon.com Flex drivers filed arbitration claims on Tuesday, alleging they were misclassified as independent contractors rather than employees, the lawyer representing the drivers told Reuters.\n\nAbout 15,800 drivers have submitted arbitration claims with the American Arbitration Association, seeking compensation from Amazon for unpaid wages, overtime and work-related expenses such as mileage and cellphone use, the lawyer said. Other 453 similar cases are already being litigated.\n\nAmazon does not provide Flex drivers with 10-minute rest breaks when their shift lasts longer than 3.5 hours, one of the drivers said in its arbitration claims.\n\nA claim said that Amazon does not provide 30-minute meal breaks for drivers who work more than five hours a day, whereas another claim alleged that Amazon fails to provide itemized wage statements required by California law.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"The Amazon Flex program gives individuals the opportunity to set their own schedule and be their own boss, while earning competitive pay,\" an Amazon spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nAmazon Flex, which works like on-demand ride-hailing service Uber, handles speedy deliveries of common household goods to customers through programs such as Prime Now and Amazon Fresh.\n\n(Reporting by Nilutpal Timsina in Bengaluru; additional reporting by Angela Christy; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "title": "Americans are flocking to Temu, but they trust Amazon so much more",
        "content": "One factor, above all else, helps explain the sensational rise of the online shopping marketplace Temu since its founding in 2022: ultralow prices. As a result, nearly six out of 10 U.S. online shoppers have made a purchase through the shopping marketplace in the past year, according to a recent survey commissioned by e-commerce marketing firm Omnisend.\n\nBut if Temu’s going to continue to win the wallets of U.S. shoppers in the years to come, it’s going to have to build something that its giant competitor Amazon has in spades: customer trust. Only 6% of Americans surveyed said they trust Temu more than Amazon.\n\nThose results, based on a survey of 1,000 online shoppers in the U.S., crystallize both the remarkable ascent of Temu, which launched in the U.S. less than two years ago, as well as the steep climb it still faces in building enough trust to keep U.S. customers coming back again and again for years to come.\n\nBacked by its Chinese e-commerce parent company, PDD Holdings, Temu has won the wallets of U.S. shoppers through a combination of ultralow prices, massive ad spending, and prolific use of coupons and gamification tactics. This strategy has enabled the app to continue to grow in the U.S. despite long delivery times, questionable product quality, and relentless marketing that can border on spamming.\n\nUnder a PDD subsidiary legally known as WhaleCo, Temu claims a Boston office as its global headquarters. But as Fortune reported exclusively in April, Temu employs few employees there and counts on large product and technology teams based in China to operate.\n\nThat strong China connection—coupled with questions about whether any of its merchants use forced labor as well as its dependence on a century-old trade rule that eliminates duties on many shipments to U.S. shoppers—has led to increased scrutiny from U.S. lawmakers and agencies alike. The U.S. House Select Committee on the Chinese Communist Party and some Senate Republicans have been pushing for probes into Temu.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security has also recently said it will step up scrutiny of packages that fall under the “de minimis” trade program that is favored by overseas e-commerce giants such as Temu and Shein, as well as some U.S. merchants who utilize overseas suppliers and manufacturers. (Proponents of the trade rule say it helps keep prices low for U.S. consumers.)\n\nAs a result of scrutiny in the U.S., Temu is increasingly eyeing new geographies for future growth, the Wall Street Journal reported recently. Much of this might be welcome news inside Amazon, the dominant online retailer in the U.S. with about 40% market share. Company leaders have been paying increasing attention to Temu as well as its fast-fashion rival Shein. Though Amazon has cut some merchant listing fees for lower-priced apparel to help attract sellers that may sell through these low-priced marketplaces, the tech giant is also doubling down on the advantages it believes it already has: rapid delivery speed and strong brand awareness and consumer trust.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd based on these survey results, that looks like a smart bet.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Walmart is winning over investors, but its growth story relies on three key e-commerce initiatives",
        "content": "Walmart (WMT) is winning over Wall Street, but the shopping giant will need results from its e-commerce business to maintain its position as a retail darling.\n\n\"E-commerce sales surpassed $100 billion dollars globally\" last year, CEO Doug McMillon said at the company's annual associates meeting last week.\n\n\"We're now in a position to grow sales because we can serve customers and members how they want to be served, to grow profit faster than sales, while delivering low prices and investing in you at the same time,\" he added.\n\nThe company plans to use artificial intelligence, advertising, and its giant collection of stores to turn its long-running e-commerce business profitable in the next year or two, its executives told Yahoo Finance.\n\nWalmart shares are up 26% this year, roughly double that of the S&P 500's (^GSPC) gain. The stock, trading near record highs, strikes \"a strong balance of defense and offense on both the top and bottom lines\" in a softening consumer backdrop, JPMorgan analyst Christopher Horvers said in a client note.\n\nWith a looming election and reduced expectations of Fed rate cuts, Walmart's consistent performance may become increasingly appealing amid the volatility. In recent years, the retailer has benefitted from shoppers looking for cheaper groceries, which make up 60% of its US sales.\n\nBut the e-commerce landscape is not getting any easier, with Amazon (AMZN) still leading the race and rivals like Target (TGT) ramping up their efforts.\n\nAfter explosive growth during pandemic shutdowns and a subsequent slowdown, Walmart is making gains again online. Last quarter, the company's US e-commerce sales jumped 22%, led by store-fulfilled pickup and delivery and its online marketplace.\n\nCatching up on AI\n\nAmazon's secret sauce has long been its extensive investments in AI and machine learning, allowing it to make accurate product recommendations and gain insights into shoppers' patterns.\n\nIts ability to predict demand — say, Seattle customers like to buy umbrellas in March — allows it to dispatch inventory to the right warehouses, enabling its vaunted two-day delivery system.\n\nWalmart CTO Suresh Kumar said the company is also investing in generative AI and machine learning. Earlier this year, it announced plans to use GenAI to add personalized search, a popular feature on Amazon.\n\nFor example, if you search for \"birthday party,\" a slew of items like candles, decorations, and cards show up.\n\nJoe Feldman of Telsey Advisory Group says Walmart has taken a leap forward in terms of applying data to its operations and harnessing valuable insights.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's using data to optimize its supply chain operations, creating efficient routes for transportation and distribution and making sure it delivers the right products on time, per Feldman.\n\nKumar, a former Amazon executive, said \"Walmart is in the best position\" when it comes to training models due to the vast amount of data it collects online and in-store.\n\nLeveraging its legacy business\n\n\"What we've learned in the US and in other markets that we operate in is that omni actually is the preferred offer for customers. They like being able to go to a physical [store] and interact with people, and they want the convenience of e-commerce,\" CEO McMillon told Yahoo Finance.\n\nAround 90% of Americans live within 10 miles of one of Walmart's 4,700 stores, a leg up compared to Target (1,963 stores) and Costco (605). Its extensive footprint allows it to offer speedy delivery directly from the stores.\n\nFor items in stock, shoppers can get express one-hour delivery for $10, while three-hour delivery will cost $5.\n\nOver the past year, Walmart delivered 4.4 billion items with same-day or next-day delivery, 20% of which were delivered in less than three hours, according to its US CEO John Furner.\n\nExpanding its Walmart+ membership will be key to serving consumers' preference to shop both online and in-store, per Kumar.\n\nThe membership model, which launched in 2020, includes benefits like free same-day grocery delivery from store ($35 order minimum), free shipping on general merchandise from Walmart, and savings on fuel.\n\nHaving a physical network that enables fast delivery can be particularly advantageous for the online grocery business, Horvers pointed out.\n\nFeldman said Walmart+ has \"relatively low penetration\" so far, but the adoption rate has \"increased significantly in the past year.\"\n\nWhile it remains to be seen how the members behave differently, paid members typically shop more, like at Costco and Walmart's Sam's Club (where the US e-commerce business is profitable).\n\nBut the company's biggest obstacle in e-commerce remains overall awareness. \"It's getting people to not think of Amazon first. It's getting people to think Walmart first,\" said Feldman.\n\nExpanding its fledgling advertising segment\n\nLast quarter, sales from its US retail media business, Walmart Connect, jumped 26%.\n\nIts biggest product is paid search, which allows companies to pay for sponsored ads placed above the search results, according to Walmart Connect's SVP of sales Ryan Mayward.\n\nThe platform also offers other ads (think banners in product pages), offsite ads (like on TikTok and Disney+), and in-store ads, which got a boost as part of the company's $9 billion store makeovers.\n\nIt has improved client access, building a self-service model that allows advertisers to check the marketing performance themselves instead of relying on reports from Walmart. A renovated Walmart Supercenter in Secaucus, N.J., featuring digital touchpoints and advertisements throughout the store. (Yahoo Finance/Brooke DiPalma).\n\nMayward touted Walmart's scale as an edge for attracting third-party sellers to its online marketplace. Then, as more customers shop on its marketplace, it becomes more important for sellers to use advertising to stand out from the competition.\n\nIn February, Walmart announced plans to acquire connected TV maker Vizio for $2.3 billion, or $11.50 per share. The move is expected to accelerate growth for its ad business.\n\n\"[Advertising] is a fast-growing high-margin part of our business,\" Walmart CFO John David Rainey told Yahoo Finance following the announcement. \"And what this deal with Vizio does — it’s very complementary to what we’re doing organically.\" A customer walks past televisions, including the Vizio brand, on display in a Walmart Supercenter on Feb. 20, 2024, in Hallandale Beach, Fla. (Joe Raedle/Getty Images) (Joe Raedle via Getty Images)\n\nBut the company has a long way to go to compete with Amazon, which brought in $47 billion in advertising revenue in 2023, compared to Walmart's $3.4 billion.\n\n\"I expect Walmart’s ad business to continue growing from here, but I don’t expect it to rival the size of Amazon’s ad business anytime soon,\" Morningstar analyst Noah Rohr told Yahoo Finance.\n\nHe added that while Walmart's e-commerce business still lags far behind Amazon's, \"Walmart is better positioned here than most competing brick-and-mortar retailers.\"\n\n—\n\nBrooke DiPalma is a senior reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Exit Now! 3 AI Stocks to Sell in June 2024",
        "content": "AI is the hottest thing in stocks right now. Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) historic bull run, thanks to its AI-friendly business, is proof of this.\n\nAs a result, many companies are looking to dabble in AI to capitalize off the phenomenon. However, not every such company is having such uninterrupted success as the graphic chips maker. That makes some of these companies AI stocks to sell this June.\n\nWhen a company’s stock starts going downhill, you need time to watch how it unfolds — preferably from a distance. That’s because it’s hard to tell when such a stock bounces back. It could be months or even years. Sometimes, it’s better to exit your position and put your money in a stock that’s actually promising.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWe identified three underperforming companies that could be AI stocks to sell so you can free up your capital for positions with better potential.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) is a company that supports businesses with AI tools and applications. Some of the world’s biggest organizations, such as Shell (NYSE:SHEL) Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Koch Industries and the U.S. Air Force have integrated its product.\n\nThe company’s financials look fine on paper — 20% growth year-over-year (YOY) in the first quarter, free cash flow of $18.8 million and no debt. However, C3.ai is lacking in one thing: profitability.\n\nIn its Q1 report, the company’s CEO Thomas M. Siebel said it’s foregoing profitability for now to focus on “lead generation, branding, market awareness and customer success,” which he believes presents a “market opportunity.” Siebel said he doesn’t expect the company to be profitable in 2024.\n\nThat is all fine and dandy for the company — but not for investors — if its price pattern this year is anything to go by. Besides the occasional price spike, C3.ai stock price has largely been treading water.\n\nAnalysts aren’t sold on it either, with MarketWatch giving it an average hold rating. If you have C3.ai in your portfolio and are looking for AI stocks to sell, you might want to consider letting it go.\n\nDell Technologies (DELL) Dell (DELL) Technologies Display and Logo\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nDell Technologies (NYSE:DELL) is one of the few companies manufacturing powerful AI servers. Big corporations experimenting with AI need these servers to train and operate sophisticated AI models and applications.\n\nAs a result, Dell’s share value has been on an upward momentum in the last two years because investors see the hardware manufacturer poised to profit from AI’s rise.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut those hopes were dashed last month after the company’s Q1 report showed flat YOY revenues for its AI servers business. Dell shares have been down 22% since then and show no signs of improving, which raises the question of whether it’s an AI stock to sell after all.\n\nBernsteinFinancial Services analyst Toni Sacconaghi raised the alarm about Dell’s AI servers “being sold at near-zero margins,” with Bloomberg analyst Woo Jin saying Dell’s current figures “cast some doubt on near-term competitiveness.”\n\nIf you have a position in Dell, now is a good time to consider if it’s worth it, at least in the short term.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShares of Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) slid 19% on May 8, the day of its first-quarter earnings release, and haven’t recovered since. The drop was the largest in one day for the Ottawa-based online retailer since it went public nine years ago.\n\nInvestors fled after the company reported a net loss of $273 million and issued low guidance for the second quarter. While Shopify’s YOY revenue growth has fallen between the low-to-mid 20s in the past six quarters, the company is now forecasting revenue growth in the high teens in the second quarter.\n\nShopify’s slump is due to an increasingly competitive niche. E-commerce giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT), as well as lesser-known companies Temu and Shein, are all vying for market share. The company is also grappling with a lull in online shopping post-pandemic.\n\nFollowing Shopify’s Q1 report, Third Bridge analyst Charlie Miner raised concerns about its profitability trajectory, noting it “sound[ed] the alarm bell for investors.”\n\nWhile a turnaround is still possible for Shopify, its current challenges make it one of the AI stocks to sell in June.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Chinese Retailer Temu Gains Edge Over eBay In US Market\n\nChinese e-commerce newcomer Temu, a division of PDD Holdings Inc (NASDAQ:PDD), has swiftly outpaced veteran eBay Inc. (NASDAQ:EBAY) in terms of attracting repeat U.S. customers, despite eBay’s nearly three decades of operation.\n\nA recent survey conducted by Omnisend revealed that 34% of consumers shop on Temu monthly, surpassing eBay’s 29%, reported Bloomberg.\n\nThis surge in customer engagement for Temu comes as the company invests heavily in marketing and promotional discounts.\n\nNotably, Temu’s advertisements, including two Super Bowl commercials, have effectively drawn customers to its platform, where they typically wait a week or more for items shipped directly from China.\n\nTemu’s aggressive advertising strategies and social media presence, encapsulated by their “Shop like a billionaire” campaign, have hugely contributed to their rapid growth in the competitive U.S. market.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Strengthens India Presence With MX Player Asset Acquisition: Report\n\nThe pandemic-induced price surge has altered consumer behaviors significantly, with only 40% of U.S. shopping journeys starting on Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) last year, down from over half in 2022.\n\nTemu's rise reflects a broader trend of consumers increasingly starting their shopping journeys on search engines like Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), seeking better deals across various platforms.\n\nWhile Temu’s pricing attracts consumers, the company faces challenges with product quality and delivery speeds, areas where competitors like Amazon excel with their vast array of fast and reliable services.\n\nDespite these hurdles, Temu’s model of direct-from-factory sales continues to gain traction among price-conscious shoppers.\n\nPrice Action: PDD shares are trading lower by 0.79% at $147.31 at the last check on Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nRead Next: Amazon Inks ‘Largest Technology Investment’ In Spain, Pours $17B Into Cloud Infrastructure\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock.\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nAMAZON.COM (AMZN): Free Stock Analysis Report EBAY (EBAY): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Chinese Retailer Temu Gains Edge Over eBay In US Market originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "EV stocks are grappling with lower sales and dwindling profit margins, which has left investors wary of the sector’s long-term outlook. However, the high-end EV market lull offers an excellent opportunity to scoop up some undervalued EV stocks. Though the industry is up against major challenges, denying the sector’s incredible long-term potential is tough.\n\nThese three EV stocks are some of the best picks to bank on amidst the industry’s weakness. The first is the Chinese EV juggernaut BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), which knocked Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) off its perch and made it the top EV company globally. Next, we have Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN), who’s on the comeback trail through superior management and superb operational performance. Finally, Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) boasts a robust cash buffer and industry-leading bottom-line metrics.\n\nHence, investors keen on diversifying within the EV space should wager on these EV stocks for healthy gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD is the global frontrunner in the EV market, beating Tesla last year to become the largest EV car seller by market share. Its breakout success has plenty to do with its vertically integrated business, which covers everything from the production of its computer chips to owning lithium mines that are critical for battery production.\n\nDespite the industry headwinds, BYD continues to grow rapidly. Its most recent update announced a 38.1% surge in new energy vehicle sales for May, totaling 331,817 units. This boost was led by a 54.1% increase in plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) and a 22.4% increase in battery electric vehicle (BEVs) sales.\n\nMoreover, its attractive product lineup lays the foundation for sustained growth. It continues to innovate, as seen with the introduction of its ‘Shark’ pickup truck, a potent challenger to Tesla’s Cybertruck and its budget-friendly EV in ‘Seagull.’ These advancements highlight the firm’s dynamic market positioning, poised for continuous and robust growth.\n\nRivian (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) logo is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, Inc. is an electric vehicle automaker.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian is another interesting EV play, following a steep price drop in the past year. RIVN stock is down more than 50% year-to-date (YTD) and over 90% from its peak. However, its terrible stock price performance has had little effect on its strong operational performance.\n\nOver the past four consecutive quarters, Rivian has consistently demonstrated strong sales growth, surpassing analyst estimates. Despite some concerns about its margins, the company’s over $10 billion cash reserves provide a strong financial cushion, mitigating the risk of bankruptcy. Furthermore, the company’s projected improvement in loss-per-share from $3.98 this year to $ 2.44 in 2025 is a positive sign for its future financial performance.\n\nStory continues\n\nFurthermore, its future looks promising, bolstered by its partnerships and significant volume of preorders. Notably, eCommerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) plans to deploy 100,000 Rivian EVs by the end of the current decade, underscoring its confidence in Rivian’s long-term potential. Also, the EV upstart plans to launch its latest models, the R2, R3 and R3X, all priced competitively to break into the mass market.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto (Li Xiang) brand logo and electric car in store. A Chinese EV(electric vehicle) company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nLi Auto is another attractive EV pick that’s been hammered by the stock market in the past 12 months. Unlike its peers, Li Auto is taking a measured approach to expansion, concentrating on the burgeoning Chinese market while steadily growing its retail network. This focused strategy has proven remarkably effective for its business, with its bottom-line margins above its domestic competition.\n\nMoreover, it boasts robust financial flexibility, with a whopping $13.7 billion in its cash reserve as of the first quarter (Q1). Such wiggle room will come in handy as competition heats up in the EV price battles.\n\nIt introduced the Li Mega in March, followed by the start of Li L6 deliveries in April, which was a major success. The company delivered 774,571 units, including over 15,000 of the newly launched Li L6s, underscoring its commitment to growth and innovation in the EV space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Amazon.com, Inc. (AMZN) Is a Trending Stock: Facts to Know Before Betting on It",
        "content": "Amazon (AMZN) has been one of the most searched-for stocks on Zacks.com lately. So, you might want to look at some of the facts that could shape the stock's performance in the near term.\n\nOver the past month, shares of this online retailer have returned +0.3%, compared to the Zacks S&P 500 composite's +2.9% change. During this period, the Zacks Internet - Commerce industry, which Amazon falls in, has lost 0.6%. The key question now is: What could be the stock's future direction?\n\nAlthough media reports or rumors about a significant change in a company's business prospects usually cause its stock to trend and lead to an immediate price change, there are always certain fundamental factors that ultimately drive the buy-and-hold decision.\n\nRevisions to Earnings Estimates\n\nRather than focusing on anything else, we at Zacks prioritize evaluating the change in a company's earnings projection. This is because we believe the fair value for its stock is determined by the present value of its future stream of earnings.\n\nWe essentially look at how sell-side analysts covering the stock are revising their earnings estimates to reflect the impact of the latest business trends. And if earnings estimates go up for a company, the fair value for its stock goes up. A higher fair value than the current market price drives investors' interest in buying the stock, leading to its price moving higher. This is why empirical research shows a strong correlation between trends in earnings estimate revisions and near-term stock price movements.\n\nAmazon is expected to post earnings of $1.02 per share for the current quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +61.9%. Over the last 30 days, the Zacks Consensus Estimate has changed +0.7%.\n\nThe consensus earnings estimate of $4.58 for the current fiscal year indicates a year-over-year change of +57.9%. This estimate has changed +1% over the last 30 days.\n\nFor the next fiscal year, the consensus earnings estimate of $5.80 indicates a change of +26.6% from what Amazon is expected to report a year ago. Over the past month, the estimate has changed +0.5%.\n\nWith an impressive externally audited track record, our proprietary stock rating tool -- the Zacks Rank -- is a more conclusive indicator of a stock's near-term price performance, as it effectively harnesses the power of earnings estimate revisions. The size of the recent change in the consensus estimate, along with three other factors related to earnings estimates, has resulted in a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) for Amazon.\n\nThe chart below shows the evolution of the company's forward 12-month consensus EPS estimate:\n\nStory continues\n\n12 Month EPS 12-month consensus EPS estimate for AMZN _12MonthEPSChartUrl\n\nRevenue Growth Forecast\n\nWhile earnings growth is arguably the most superior indicator of a company's financial health, nothing happens as such if a business isn't able to grow its revenues. After all, it's nearly impossible for a company to increase its earnings for an extended period without increasing its revenues. So, it's important to know a company's potential revenue growth.\n\nIn the case of Amazon, the consensus sales estimate of $148.54 billion for the current quarter points to a year-over-year change of +10.5%. The $638.24 billion and $709.87 billion estimates for the current and next fiscal years indicate changes of +11% and +11.2%, respectively.\n\nLast Reported Results and Surprise History\n\nAmazon reported revenues of $143.31 billion in the last reported quarter, representing a year-over-year change of +12.5%. EPS of $1.13 for the same period compares with $0.31 a year ago.\n\nCompared to the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $142.53 billion, the reported revenues represent a surprise of +0.55%. The EPS surprise was +36.14%.\n\nThe company beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters. The company topped consensus revenue estimates each time over this period.\n\nValuation\n\nNo investment decision can be efficient without considering a stock's valuation. Whether a stock's current price rightly reflects the intrinsic value of the underlying business and the company's growth prospects is an essential determinant of its future price performance.\n\nWhile comparing the current values of a company's valuation multiples, such as price-to-earnings (P/E), price-to-sales (P/S) and price-to-cash flow (P/CF), with its own historical values helps determine whether its stock is fairly valued, overvalued, or undervalued, comparing the company relative to its peers on these parameters gives a good sense of the reasonability of the stock's price.\n\nAs part of the Zacks Style Scores system, the Zacks Value Style Score (which evaluates both traditional and unconventional valuation metrics) organizes stocks into five groups ranging from A to F (A is better than B; B is better than C; and so on), making it helpful in identifying whether a stock is overvalued, rightly valued, or temporarily undervalued.\n\nAmazon is graded B on this front, indicating that it is trading at a discount to its peers. Click here to see the values of some of the valuation metrics that have driven this grade.\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe facts discussed here and much other information on Zacks.com might help determine whether or not it's worthwhile paying attention to the market buzz about Amazon. However, its Zacks Rank #3 does suggest that it may perform in line with the broader market in the near term.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Key Insights\n\nAmazon.com's estimated fair value is US$313 based on 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity Amazon.com's US$187 share price signals that it might be 40% undervalued The US$218 analyst price target for AMZN is 30% less than our estimate of fair value\n\nIn this article we are going to estimate the intrinsic value of Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by estimating the company's future cash flows and discounting them to their present value. We will take advantage of the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model for this purpose. Don't get put off by the jargon, the math behind it is actually quite straightforward.\n\nWe would caution that there are many ways of valuing a company and, like the DCF, each technique has advantages and disadvantages in certain scenarios. For those who are keen learners of equity analysis, the Simply Wall St analysis model here may be something of interest to you.\n\nSee our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nWhat's The Estimated Valuation?\n\nWe are going to use a two-stage DCF model, which, as the name states, takes into account two stages of growth. The first stage is generally a higher growth period which levels off heading towards the terminal value, captured in the second 'steady growth' period. To begin with, we have to get estimates of the next ten years of cash flows. Where possible we use analyst estimates, but when these aren't available we extrapolate the previous free cash flow (FCF) from the last estimate or reported value. We assume companies with shrinking free cash flow will slow their rate of shrinkage, and that companies with growing free cash flow will see their growth rate slow, over this period. We do this to reflect that growth tends to slow more in the early years than it does in later years.\n\nA DCF is all about the idea that a dollar in the future is less valuable than a dollar today, so we discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:\n\n10-year free cash flow (FCF) forecast\n\n2024 2025 2026 2027 2028 2029 2030 2031 2032 2033 Levered FCF ($, Millions)  US$62.1b US$78.3b US$102.3b US$117.3b US$142.3b US$161.0b US$176.9b US$190.4b US$201.9b US$212.0b Growth Rate Estimate Source Analyst x16 Analyst x18 Analyst x9 Analyst x5 Analyst x4 Est @ 13.10% Est @ 9.89% Est @ 7.63% Est @ 6.06% Est @ 4.95% Present Value ($, Millions) Discounted @ 7.1%  US$58.0k US$68.3k US$83.3k US$89.2k US$101.0k US$106.7k US$109.5k US$110.0k US$109.0k US$106.8k\n\n(\"Est\" = FCF growth rate estimated by Simply Wall St)\r\nPresent Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF) = US$942b\n\nStory continues\n\nThe second stage is also known as Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. For a number of reasons a very conservative growth rate is used that cannot exceed that of a country's GDP growth. In this case we have used the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield (2.4%) to estimate future growth. In the same way as with the 10-year 'growth' period, we discount future cash flows to today's value, using a cost of equity of 7.1%.\n\nTerminal Value (TV)= FCF2033 × (1 + g) ÷ (r – g) = US$212b× (1 + 2.4%) ÷ (7.1%– 2.4%) = US$4.6t\n\nPresent Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)= TV / (1 + r)10= US$4.6t÷ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$2.3t\n\nThe total value is the sum of cash flows for the next ten years plus the discounted terminal value, which results in the Total Equity Value, which in this case is US$3.3t. To get the intrinsic value per share, we divide this by the total number of shares outstanding. Compared to the current share price of US$187, the company appears quite undervalued at a 40% discount to where the stock price trades currently. Valuations are imprecise instruments though, rather like a telescope - move a few degrees and end up in a different galaxy. Do keep this in mind. dcf\n\nImportant Assumptions\n\nNow the most important inputs to a discounted cash flow are the discount rate, and of course, the actual cash flows. You don't have to agree with these inputs, I recommend redoing the calculations yourself and playing with them. The DCF also does not consider the possible cyclicality of an industry, or a company's future capital requirements, so it does not give a full picture of a company's potential performance. Given that we are looking at Amazon.com as potential shareholders, the cost of equity is used as the discount rate, rather than the cost of capital (or weighted average cost of capital, WACC) which accounts for debt. In this calculation we've used 7.1%, which is based on a levered beta of 1.025. Beta is a measure of a stock's volatility, compared to the market as a whole. We get our beta from the industry average beta of globally comparable companies, with an imposed limit between 0.8 and 2.0, which is a reasonable range for a stable business.\n\nSWOT Analysis for Amazon.com\n\nStrength\n\nEarnings growth over the past year exceeded the industry.\n\nDebt is not viewed as a risk.\n\nWeakness\n\nNo major weaknesses identified for AMZN.\n\nOpportunity\n\nAnnual earnings are forecast to grow faster than the American market.\n\nTrading below our estimate of fair value by more than 20%.\n\nThreat\n\nRevenue is forecast to grow slower than 20% per year.\n\nNext Steps:\n\nAlthough the valuation of a company is important, it shouldn't be the only metric you look at when researching a company. DCF models are not the be-all and end-all of investment valuation. Rather it should be seen as a guide to \"what assumptions need to be true for this stock to be under/overvalued?\" If a company grows at a different rate, or if its cost of equity or risk free rate changes sharply, the output can look very different. Why is the intrinsic value higher than the current share price?

        "title": "3 Growth Stock Picks That Will Add Prestige to Your Portfolio",
        "content": "Market momentum continues to carry equities higher. On June 6, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed at another record high, led by technology stocks. With rates backing off, growth stock picks will continue to rally.\n\nThere is a strong case for growth over value. Notably, growth outperformed value since the 2007-2008 financial crisis. Due to low rates near zero, investors were willing to pay for growth. Although rates have risen sharply, we are still in the sweet spot for growth.\n\nEconomic data is robust, with the U.S. economy adding 272,000 jobs in May, exceeding expectations. Another highlight was the June 7 Atalanta GDPNow model projecting 3.1% real GDP growth in the second quarter. As long as there is economic growth, corporate earnings will be healthy and in support of growth stocks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe following growth stock picks have material upside due to their industry-leading earnings-per-share growth. At first glance, they look overvalued on a price-to-earnings basis. However, when assessed on the best metric for growth stocks – price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) – they are cheap.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Chinese new year lanterns in china town\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThis Chinese e-commerce giant is one of the top growth stock picks. Despite the naysayers, PDD Holdings (NYSE:PDD) is advancing its reach beyond China with tremendous success. A successful entry into Europe and the U.S. will turbocharge the stock higher.\n\nThe e-commerce retailer launched Temu in the U.S. in 2022, to much fanfare. After an aggressive marketing blitz on sites like TikTok and Instagram, it’s winning over American shoppers. Analysts at Goldman Sachs point to the $1.2 billion it splashed on ads on Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) sites in 2023. It also ramped up ads on other channels, with its Super Bowl ads drawing keen interest.\n\nData suggests the aggressive campaign is working and Temu is taking share from some competitors. Indeed, analysts noted that it has emerged as a threat to discounters like Dollar General (NYSE:DG) and Dollar Tree (NASDAQ:DLTR).\n\nTo be sure, PDD Holdings is reaping the rewards of its low-priced products and viral marketing approach. Revenues soared, with Q1 revenues increasing by 124% year-over-year. Adjusted earnings per American depositary share growth was also off the charts at 199%. At a forward PEG non-GAAP ratio of 0.33, PDD stock is one of the best bargain growth stock picks to buy.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) stack of Amazon (AMZN) delivery boxes at a front door\n\nSource: Julie Clopper / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn this bull market, one of the best growth stocks to buy is economic bellwether Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). This retail and tech giant extends its reach to key sectors of the economy. It’s the largest e-commerce retailer and its cloud computing division, Amazon Web Services, leads the industry by market share. Furthermore, its digital advertising business is the third-largest by market share, bringing in $49 billion in revenues on a trailing twelve-month basis.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith this firepower, Amazon will continue to compound for decades. After all, it has two massive tailwinds pushing the stock higher: e-commerce penetration and adoption of cloud computing. These multi-year tailwinds make it one of my favorite growth stock picks.\n\nAnother catalyst for the stock is a downshift in capital expenditures and management efforts in cost efficiencies. Its retail division is coming off a peak investment cycle and moved to a regional fulfillment network that has lowered costs to serve. Besides, management plans to increase cost efficiencies by integrating automation and artificial intelligence.\n\nRiding on the back of these initiatives, Amazon will see substantial earnings growth. Wall Street analysts expect 56% and 26% earnings growth in 2024 and 2025, respectively. In parallel with this view, analysts are very bullish, with a median price target of $221.\n\nShift4 Payments (FOUR) The word \"INSIDER\" displayed in a blue and green ticker tape.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nOne of the most bullish signals for a stock is massive insider buying. That’s exactly what Shift4 Payments (NYSE:FOUR) CEO Jared Isaacman has been doing. Over the past year, he has executed several purchases with no sales.\n\nCurrently, this is one of the top growth stock picks based on management’s guidance for 39% EBITDA growth in 2024. Over the years, Shift4 Payments adopted a roll-up strategy acquiring point-of-sales systems and payment processors. With these attractively priced acquisitions, it has expanded geographically.\n\nShift4 Payments has shown impressive growth across all verticals. In Q1 2024, its SkyTab point-of-sale system saw remarkable growth due to increased awareness and its value proposition. Installs grew 38% quarter-over-quarter, with 9,400 installs in the quarter. As a result, end-to-end payment volume rose by 50%.\n\nDue to the value proposition offered by the SkyTab product suit, it continues to add restaurant customers. Another significant boost has been entering new verticals, particularly sports and entertainment. It recently announced deals with sports franchises like the Kansas City Chiefs and the Chicago White Sox.\n\nLastly, Shift4 is implementing the same playbook in Europe, where it’s massively underpenetrated. Notable wins in Q1 included Leonardo hotels with hundreds of locations in the U.K. and Europe and the FC Barcelona stadium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi had a long position in FOUR but did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in other securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nCharles Munyi has extensive writing experience in various industries, including personal finance, insurance, technology, wealth management and stock investing.

Only with an understanding of the financial health, strategic resource management, and innovative position created in the marketplace can careful identification of such opportunities be made.\n\nWe spotlight seven stocks to buy that have epitomized such traits over the years. These firms must have good financials, use capital efficiently, and strategically move ahead with technology. They reflect how calculated moves, effective resource management, and innovative solutions spur business success.\n\nAll these stocks became unique market leaders, with record-breaking net income growth and strategic investments in technology and innovation.

That’s why there are seven stealthy stocks to buy and set up to take over the market.\n\nBTCS (BTCS) An image of the blockchain, distributing digital crypto from a phone through the web to another tablet\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nBTCS (NASDAQ:BTCS) is a blockchain tech company focusing on cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems. In the first quarter of 2024, the company delivered a record net income, exhibiting remarkable profitability and financial success. There was a massive 148% year-over-year (YOY) growth and a 13% quarterly gain, demonstrating the company’s fundamental capacity to improve its bottom line continuously.\n\nMoreover, this substantial increase in net income results from BTCS’s effective capital allocation, revenue optimization tactics, and generally favorable market circumstances. Thus, with such remarkable profit growth, BTCS attracts potential partners and investors as a profitable investment option.\n\nFurther, the solid rise in BTCS’s cash and cryptocurrency worth indicates the company’s sound financial standing and liquidity. The 91% YOY increase shows significant asset accumulation that may be used for research projects, strategic investments, and possible acquisitions.\n\nOverall, BTCS’s strong cash and cryptocurrency reserves allow it to adapt to market swings, take advantage of expansion possibilities, and weather unanticipated difficulties. Hence, these fundamentals make the company an ideal addition to the stocks to buy list.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelestica (CLS)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nCelestica (NYSE:CLS) provides design, manufacturing, hardware platform, and supply chain solutions. In Q1 2024, it was $0.86, a solid boost from $0.47 in Q1 2023. Compared to 17.9% in Q1 2023, the adjusted ROIC for Q1 2024 was 24.8%, a significant improvement. Celestica can produce increased profits per share and efficiently use its capital to create returns, reflected in the solid growth in adjusted EPS and ROIC. Indeed, this financial stability supports the company’s growth trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, adjusted free cash flow for Celestica increased significantly from $9.2 million in Q1 2023 to $65.2 million in Q1 2024. With $900 million in cash and borrowing capacity, the company was able to retain a solid lead (in terms of liquidity). Celestica can make strategic investments, initiate acquisitions, and operational expansions. Indeed, this is because of its strong cash flow generation and liquidity position.\n\nOverall, generating substantial free cash flow indicates efficient operations and skillful working capital management, cementing its place on the stocks to buy list.\n\nBeamr (BMR) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nBeamr (NASDAQ:BMR) is competitive in the video optimization business because of its sharp focus on technological innovation and distinction. In February 2024, the debut of the Beamr Cloud SaaS service marked an important turning point. This service will make large-scale, high-quality video processing affordable.\n\nAdditionally, the system provides advanced features, including faster adoption of new standards and upgrading video standards (from AVC to HEVC). The firm may have an edge after it includes visual AI processes into Beamr Cloud in Q2 2024. This indicates that it is adaptable to market demands and can use cutting-edge technology to improve its products.\n\nMoreover, Beamr’s 2023 performance marks enhanced financial stability and liquidity. Even though the company lost$0.7 million on the net, this was still a major improvement over its $1.2 million loss in 2022. Overall, Beamr’s efforts to improve cost efficiency and streamline operations have decreased net loss, making it a compelling addition to the stocks to buy list.\n\nZenvia (ZENV) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe success that Zenvia (NASDAQ:ZENV) has had in its software-as-a-service (SaaS) and communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) divisions marks the increasing acceptance of the company’s product and market penetration. Strong recovery and growth were seen in the CPaaS market, fueled by increased SMS volumes among major organizations. SaaS and CPaaS’s many income sources offer a balanced growth engine that lessens reliance on a particular market niche and demonstrates resilience and adaptability to changing market needs.\n\nFurther, SaaS Active users climbed from 6,231 to 7,127, a 14.4% increase. CPaaS active clients dropped from 7,505 to 6,263 (16.5%). The increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and SaaS active customers suggests this market is expanding strongly, especially among small and medium businesses. A strategy change towards higher-value interactions with larger organizations is reflected in the drop in CPaaS active clients. This might lead to fewer but more substantial customer partnerships.\n\nOverall, expansion in ARR, market penetration, and customer base more than offsets any potential churn or downselling in bigger customers, as indicated by the decline in the Net Revenue Expansion rate. Therefore, these fundamental developments place the company under stocks to buy class.\n\nRingCentral (RNG) The RingCentral (RNG) mobile app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign/Shutterstock.com\n\nRingCentral (NYSE:RNG) provides businesses with cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions. In Q1 the company’s stock-based compensation fell 15.6% of total sales, a 340 basis point YOY decline.\n\nAdditionally, RingCentral maintained its strict policy on stock issues, anticipating that fresh grants in 2024 would be around half of those in 2023. The reduction in share-based compensation (SBC) exemplifies RingCentral’s attempts to match executive remuneration with business success and shareholder interests. Further, the firm hopes to increase profitability and support expansion efforts more effectively by reducing SBC expenditures.\n\nMoreover, RingCentral maintained its alliances with over 15,000 channel partners, important original equipment manufacturer partners like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, and international service providers. The firm announced a new agreement with Optus, the second-largest telecommunications operator in Australia, expanding its partnership network.\n\nHence, by leveraging partnerships, the business can expand its audience, increase brand awareness, and capitalize on synergies to drive sales growth, securing its place on the stocks to buy list.\n\nJamf (JAMF) An Apple MacBook Air laptop sitting under bright purple lights.\n\nSource: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) specializes in device management of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. It provides device deployment, security, and management solutions for enterprises, schools, and other organizations.\n\nSecurity is a priority for the company, as seen by the 31% YOY rise in security ARR to $138 million, or 23% of total ARR. This expansion highlights the rising need for reliable security solutions. Jamf focuses on meeting changing client demands and regulatory standards, which is reflected in the launch of new compliance-focused capabilities, such as tools for compliance editors and configurable compliance dashboards.\n\nFurthermore, Jamf’s sharp focus on creativity and flexibility reflects its support for cutting-edge technologies like watchOS management and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. Expanding its product offerings beyond standard device management to include identity management, security, and compliance solutions increases Jamf’s competitiveness and market relevance. Thus, gaining contracts with Middle Eastern and Indian government organizations demonstrates Jamf’s success in expanding internationally and its capacity to meet various customer demands.\n\nLightspeed (LSPD) The Lightspeed Commerce logo on a smartphone representing LSPD stock.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nLightspeed (NYSE:LSPD)offers cloud-based point of sale (POS) and e-commerce software solutions for retail, restaurant, and hospitality businesses. Examples of the company’s focus on enabling current clients to expand include Tribal Sportswear, Analogue October Records, and Mildreds. The net retention rate shows strong client retention and growth within the current customer base, around 110%. Lightspeed is still investing in new product development, using AI to automate processes and give merchants useful information.\n\nAdditionally, subscription revenue gross margins increased to 77% due to initiatives to streamline cloud suppliers and boost general productivity. The business undertook cost-cutting measures. These include a 10% decrease in personnel and carefully examining vendor contracts and worldwide facilities. Analysts predict adjusted operating expenses will increase in the low-to-mid single-digit range in fiscal 2025. With that, there is a focus on cost containment and investments in research, product innovation, and sales.\n\nOverall, adjusted EBITDA margins are anticipated to increase significantly in fiscal 2025 and 2026, demonstrating a sharp focus on profitability and solidifying its position on the stocks to buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

When will the Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) effect kick in, if at all? Indeed, Nvidia’s massive growth numbers probably will not be topped by any AI-leveraging software company.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThough AI’s boost could accelerate, it’s important to maintain realistic expectations and not just compare anything AI-related to the likes of Nvidia.\n\nThe good news is that some ultra-cheap cloud stocks already have far less in the way of expectations, with some notable cloud heavyweights forecasting softer outlooks, while pointing out that AI may be more of a longer-term driver.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is an enterprise firm that’s as innovative as it’s ever been, with CEO Satya Nadella at the helm, a man who helped steer MSFT stock to exceptional results during the transition to the cloud. The largest company on Earth is also off to a running head-start in the AI race.\n\nWith Azure and AI combined, Microsoft remains a force to be reckoned with in the public cloud, with a realistic shot of overtaking Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS, perhaps in as little as two years.\n\nMicrosoft has been quite active in developing its own next-generation language models. From the edge-appropriate small language models, or SLMs, including Phi-3 Mini, with less than 4 billion parameters, to massive 500-billion-parameter large language models like MAI-1, it seems like Microsoft may not depend so heavily on OpenAI and ChatGPT as previously thought.\n\nIn due time, Microsoft may wind up being the LLM we all use for specific use cases. Either way, MSFT stock is the cloud and an AI stock that you just have to own at 37.11 times trailing price-to-earnings.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) is one of the cloud kings that investors should have at the top of their watchlists, right next to the Magnificent Seven companies.\n\nNow, ORCL stock is up more than 8% in the past year, thanks in part to some stellar AI-powered quarters. Specifically, cloud revenue soared 25% to $5.1 billion in the latest fiscal 2024 third quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Oracle’s cloud infrastructure business gains traction, and demand for Gen2 Cloud infrastructure stays hot, Oracle stands out as a cloud and AI company that’s still going for way too cheap, even with ORCL stock just shy of its all-time high.\n\nCurrently, ORCL stock goes for just 32.85 times trailing P/E, making it a relative bargain compared to other cloud and AI juggernauts like Microsoft. With AI enhancements recently rolled into Oracle’s Fusion Cloud Customer Experience platform, it will be interesting to see how future quarters stack up, as Oracle bolsters its position in the AI race.\n\nIBM (IBM) Photo of IBM (IBM) building as seen through the canopy of a tree. IBM logo is in large letters on side of building.\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/LCV\n\nInternational Business Machines (NYSE:IBM) is a great investment idea for investors seeking the perfect mix of income, as it shares boast a near-4% dividend yield and has AI-driven growth. The stock recently corrected, now down 14% from its 52-week high following a quarter that saw revenues rise by a minuscule 1% year over year.\n\nLooking ahead, I’d look for the company’s AI platform to gain more traction with customers, as it narrows in on certain high-demand use cases.\n\nSpecifically, AI governance with watsonx.governance and cybersecurity via IBM X-Force Red Testing Services could put IBM on what it views as “the next frontier of AI innovation.”\n\nLike most other firms improving their software services with advanced AI, it’s going to take some time before the sales growth really starts to explode. As the firm moves forward with its hybrid AI strategy, while keeping an ear open to potential M&A opportunities in the AI scene, IBM stands out as a seriously compelling buy on recent weakness.\n\nIBM stock goes for 19.3 times trailing P/E, making it one of the best value ideas for investors seeking to bet big on AI’s future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Microsoft.

        "title": "Michael Burry Has 26% of His Portfolio Invested in These 3 Stocks",
        "content": "Michal Burry stocks have a certain cache. Most people know Burry as the investor who correctly saw the housing market crash of 2007 to 2008. He understood that the government’s subprime mortgage policies would collapse the housing market. Scion Capital profited nearly $1 billion by betting against the housing market.\n\nThe events were chronicled in the book, “The Big Short,” which was subsequently made into a movie of the same name that spread Burry’s fame even wider.\n\nBut Burry is a smart investor beyond his housing market call. His investment in GameStop (NYSE:GME) in 2019 unwittingly led to the meme stock frenzy surrounding the video game retailer.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough he was not an “ape” who held on for dear life during its momentous ride in 2021, he reportedly made $250 million on his original $14 million investment.\n\nWhile he closed Scion Capital in 2008, he now runs Scion Asset Management, a hedge fund that has over $103 million in assets under management.\n\nAlthough subprime mortgages are making a comeback today under a new name, Burry isn’t betting against housing today, at least not yet. Instead, 26% of Scion’s portfolio is invested in the three Michael Burry stocks below. Let’s see if they should be in your portfolio, too.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen everyone was fleeing Chinese stocks due to geopolitical tensions, Burry was rushing in. Beginning in the third quarter of 2023, as shares of JD.com (NASDAQ:JD) began their descent from $41 per share, Burry began buying them, scooping up 125,000 shares.\n\nHe added another 75,000 shares in the fourth quarter and bought 160,000 more in the first quarter of 2024, for a total of 360,000 shares.\n\nWhile JD.com stock would end up falling as low as $22 a stub in mid-January, they soon began marching higher and hit $35 last month.\n\nThey’ve since fallen back to around $29 a share, which is in line with Burry’s average buy-in price of $29.53, putting him essentially at break-even.\n\nJD.com is Burry’s biggest holding, accounting for 9.5% of Scion’s portfolio.\n\nThe Chinese e-commerce platform is in turnaround mode. JD.com was caught flat-footed by a sluggish economy and not focusing on its online retail business while upstarts like PDD Holdings‘ (NASDAQ:PDD) Temu took share with deep discount pricing.\n\nJD responded with its own aggressive pricing and by dropping minimum order requirements for free delivery. The moves paid off. Its fourth-quarter earnings report easily beat analyst expectations as it drove tremendous traffic to its site again.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe e-commerce site also kicked off its annual 618 shopping extravaganza on May 31 with a theme of “quality and affordability.” It is the equivalent of Amazon‘s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Prime Day event but on steroids.\n\nAnalysts estimate JD sold around $60 billion worth of merchandise last year. Look for JD stock to rebound going forward.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) Alibaba (BABA) logo on the side of a glass-walled building.\n\nSource: testing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com’s peer Alibaba (NYSE:BABA) is Burry’s second largest holding at $9 million, or 8.7% of Scion’s portfolio. It is clear the hedge fund operator sees a lot of opportunity from China’s biggest retailers.\n\nBurry began buying BABA stock at the same time he picked up shares of its rival and he now owns 125,000 shares worth $9 million.\n\nThe stock has undergone a similar journey to JD.com and Burry’s average buy price is $80. Alibaba currently trades around $78 per share.\n\nFor many of the same reasons as JD.com, the outlook for Alibaba stock is just as bright. The Chinese government is supporting both consumers with new stimulus programs and companies by acting as a buyer of last resort for their stock.\n\nBecause China’s stock market doesn’t have circuit breakers like U.S. markets to minimize volatility, the government will step in and buy shares if they fall too hard too fast. It provides a floor of sorts for the stock, not that they can’t fall through it though.\n\nAlibaba’s improved operations while also focusing again on its core e-commerce business, provides plenty of runway for future growth.\n\nHCA Healthcare (HCA) a hand holding an iPhon with an HCA logo on the screen\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nHCA Healthcare (NYSE:HCA) is one of the largest hospital chains in the U.S., with facilities all across the country, but with a special focus on New York and Florida.\n\nRevenue and profits are moving higher for the hospital operator. First-quarter revenue jumped 11% to $17.3 billion while profits of $1.6 billion or $5.93 per share, were 22% higher. ​​\n\nSame facility admissions increased 6.2% while same facility equivalent admissions increased 5.2%. Equally important, revenue per equivalent admissions was up 4% from the year ago period. Emergency room visits were 7% higher.\n\nBurry established a new position in HCA Healthcare in the fourth quarter last year buying 20,000 shares and adding 5,000 more in the first quarter. The 25,000 total is worth $8.3 million, making it Burry’s third-largest holding at 8.1% of the portfolio’s total.\n\nHis average buy-in price is $267 per share, giving Burry gains of 26% on HCA Healthcare’s current price of $337 per share. There is no reason it can’t go higher as health care, especially hospital care, remains an essential service few will go without.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 No-Brainer Billionaire-Owned Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Investors love to follow Warren Buffett's stock picks to get investing inspiration. But while Buffett is an investing legend who freely gives sound advice, he's not the only billionaire investor.\n\nOthers might be lesser known, but they have also been responsible for incredible wealth creation, and you might want to get to know them and their stock picks better. Chipotle Mexican Grill(NYSE: CMG), Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST), and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are three fantastic billionaire-owned stock that average retail investors might want to add to their portfolios right now.\n\n1. Chipotle Mexican Grill\n\nChipotle is the original fast-casual restaurant chain, and it has become a powerhouse company and incredible stock. It still has tons of potential in feeding burritos to its upscale clientele, and it's a favorite of Pershing Square Capital's Bill Ackman. It has been a mainstay of Pershing Square for years, making up 20% of the total portfolio, which has only seven different stocks.\n\nChipotle has 3,500 restaurants, and it sees the opportunity to reach 7,000 company-owned restaurants in North America alone. It has expanded internationally as well and is just getting started in global locations. It signed its first franchise agreement for restaurants in the Middle East and has already opened its first one in Kuwait.\n\nThe company sees many opportunities to grow comparable-restaurant sales as well. It continues to improve its processes and release new menu items, resulting in efficiencies and higher consumer interest. Management was able to successfully raise prices to combat inflation, and its performance has been outstanding despite the challenging economy.\n\nThe company announced a 50-for-1 stock split in March to go through at the end of June, and that's just another reason to be confident about this reliable, no-brainer stock.\n\n2. Costco\n\nCostco is also a no-brainer stock for reliable growth. It operates a membership model that breeds loyalty and sales growth, and it's resilient under pressure. That's why the chain continues to report strong growth in both revenue and comparable-store sales despite inflation.\n\nThe company began to feel some pressure last year from a combination of trying to build on unprecedented growth during the height of the pandemic and customers holding back on expensive purchases. Now it's back to accelerating growth that's still outdoing pre-pandemic rates. Sales increased 9.1% in the 2024 third fiscal quarter (ended May 12) driven by a 6.6% increase in comps.\n\nThe membership fees go straight to the bottom line, and with an increase in those fees and high renewal rates, Costco has been reporting high profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company still has plenty of opportunity to open new stores, too, and plans to add about 25 to 30 stores annually, which is a low rate for retail chains. Each one of Costco's huge warehouses is another incredible growth driver, and this well of new sales won't dry up anytime soon.\n\nBillionaires like Ken Fisher of Fisher Investments and Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors own Costco stock. It's been reliable for decades, and there is every reason to believe that it can continue to deliver long-term gains.\n\n3. Amazon\n\nLastly, many billionaires own shares of the final stock I'll recommend today, Amazon, starting with Warren Buffett. He only bought shares for Berkshire Hathaway's portfolio in 2019, while other billionaires have owned it for much longer.\n\nAmazon is the second-largest company in the U.S. by sales and still has a multitude of growth opportunities. Its largest businesses are in two fast-growing industries, e-commerce and cloud computing, and it dominates both of them, with an unbeatable market share of 38% of all U.S. e-commerce and 31% of global cloud spending.\n\nThe company is ramping up its generative artificial intelligence (AI) investments and is one of the world's key players. It uses AI throughout its operations in e-commerce, Amazon Web Services (AWS), and more. Management has developed a broad advertising business that has become its fastest-growing segment, and it's building up other new segments like healthcare, streaming, and physical retail.\n\nAmazon has been one of the highest-gaining stocks ever, and it doesn't look like its story is ending anytime soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Chipotle Mexican Grill right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Chipotle Mexican Grill, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Chipotle Mexican Grill wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The stock market rally has been all about large caps",
        "content": "Large-cap stocks have been the clear leader in the 2024 stock market rally.\n\nBespoke Investment Group recently broke the S&P 500's year-to-date performance (^GSPC) into 10 baskets of 50 stocks, organized by market cap size. The top decile of the 50 largest stocks in the index was the only subsector to have outperformed the broader S&P 500 this year.\n\nTo Bespoke, this shows the recent trend in markets has generally been \"the smaller the stock, the weaker the returns.\"\n\nThe move into large-cap stocks comes as investors have scaled back bets on interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve this year amid sticky inflation reports.\n\nThe larger stocks have shown more resilience to higher interest rates in an environment where many expect rates to be held high for longer than initially expected.\n\nThat's partly because large caps have continued to post robust earnings growth. In the first quarter, research from Deutsche Bank chief global strategist Binky Chadha showed earnings for a basket of stocks labeled \"Mega-Cap Growth and Tech\" — which includes the \"Magnificent Seven\" tech stocks, among a few other big names like Netflix (NFLX), Visa (V), and Adobe (ADBE) — grew 39% compared to the S&P 500's 5.9% year-over-year growth. The NVIDIA logo and the Apple logo are pictured in Hangzhou city, Zhejiang province, China, June 6, 2024. (CFOTO/Future Publishing via Getty Images) (CFOTO via Getty Images)\n\nThis fundamental case has supported large caps when the outlook for interest rates and the trajectory for economic growth have become less certain. Meanwhile, small caps have continued to underperform no matter how interest rates move. Morgan Stanley chief investment officer Mike Wilson wrote in a weekly note to clients on Sunday night that this recent market action has him skeptical there will be a strong case for small-cap outperformance anytime soon.\n\n\"We view higher rates as a clear headwind to small caps, but we're skeptical that lower rates offer a comparable benefit — a key reason we remain overweight large caps,\" Wilson wrote.\n\nHe added, \"The economy is still expanding and trailing S&P 500 earnings growth is finally reaccelerating again led by large cap, high quality stocks.\"\n\nThe top-heavy AI trade\n\nBigger stocks are also winning the AI trade. Bespoke analyzed a group of AI ETFs to identify nearly 200 stocks that are frequently in indexes related to the AI trade.\n\nThe team found that within those indexes, stocks with a market cap over $1 trillion have returned a combined average of 41% this year, while those with market caps under $1 trillion have gained just 0.42% year to date.\n\nNotably, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) are the only US stocks with market caps above $1 trillion.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"The early days of the AI boom were pretty broad, but recently it has been the mega-caps, driven primarily by NVIDIA (NVDA), that has been the only game in town,\" Bespoke's team wrote in its Monday note.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "NBA wants 'many more' media partners amid shifting sports landscape, league executive says",
        "content": "The NBA has a straightforward plan when it comes to the complicated world of sports media rights: It wants to be seen everywhere and by everyone.\n\n\"Our fans are consuming the NBA in diversified ways, so our goal as a sports league is to try to make sure that no matter where the fan is, no matter how they're consuming content, and in particular sports content, that we're there,\" Mark Tatum, deputy commissioner of the NBA, told Yahoo Finance in aninterview on Monday.\n\nTatum's comments come as the NBA remains in deep negotiations for its next media rights package that could fetch up to a reported $76 billion.\n\nThe league's current contract with Warner Bros.' TNT Network (WBD) and Disney's ESPN (DIS) expires at the end of next season, and rumors have swirled in recent weeks that WBD, which shells out a reported $1.2 billion annually, could lose the media rights to its portion of games to Comcast's NBCUniversal (CMCSA). Amazon (AMZN) is also in talks for an exclusive streaming deal through Prime Video.\n\n\"There are more choices than there ever have been in the media landscape,\" Tatum said. \"So that requires going out and having partnerships with many more people in that space, whether it's social and digital media partners, streaming partners, and traditional media partners as well.\" P.J. Washington (25) of the Dallas Mavericks and Derrick White (9) and Jaylen Brown (7) of the Boston Celtics during Game 2 of the NBA Finals, June 9, 2024, in Boston. (AP Photo/Steven Senne) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nTatum declined to comment on the status of the rights negotiations. He did, however, note that \"sports consumption has been defined by an increase in optionality for the fan and ultra personalization.\" The league will adopt a \"more hybrid\" approach when it comes to visibility as a result.\n\n\"There's still very much a role for traditional television. We very much like the fact that our finals are on traditional network television,\" he said. \"But we also understand that a new generation of fans are consuming content through streaming platforms. And so we want to make sure that we have that availability of programming and content across all different channels.\"\n\nSports content is highly desired by media companies looking to gain access to massive audiences of loyal viewers. That allows sports leagues to bid up the price of rights in negotiations.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, NBCUniversal submitted a bid worth around $2.5 billion — more than double what WBD currently pays. The network is close to a deal with the league to show about 100 games per season, with half airing exclusively on its streaming service, Peacock.\n\nDisney, the NBA's other major broadcast partner, would retain its share of the league's media rights after reportedly agreeing to increase its payment of $1.5 billion a year to $2.6 billion in order to renew the deal, according to the report. The company will carry fewer games compared to its current package, although it will be able to stream games on its upcoming ESPN streaming platform, set to launch in fall 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon (AMZN) is close to securing a streaming rights package through its Prime Video service for a reported $1.8 billion. The Journal said the package includes both regular season and playoff games, plus the league's play-in tournament and a share of conference finals, which would rotate between the media partners.\n\nNotably, WBD has the ability to match third-party offers before the NBA enters into any official agreements.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Amazon vs. Costco",
        "content": "Chances are, if you're an American, you have a membership to either Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST), or both. Each retailer has generated tremendous long-term gains for its shareholders, with Amazon dominating the online marketplace and Costco thriving with its network of wholesale warehouses.\n\nBut which stock is the better buy right now? Let's dive into their latest financial results, balance sheets, and future growth opportunities to find out.\n\nThe top and bottom lines\n\nFor the first category, let's look at two essential financial metrics for any company: net sales and free cash flow.\n\nAmazon generated $143.3 billion in net sales for the first quarter of 2024, compared to $127.4 billion in the year-ago period, an increase of 12.5%. Looking ahead at Amazon's second quarter of 2024, management guided for net sales between $144 billion and $149 billion, or an increase between 7% and 11%.\n\nComparatively, Costco recently reported net sales of $57.4 billion during its fiscal third quarter of 2024, which represented a year-over-year increase of 9.1%. It's important to note that sales were positively affected by a shift in the company's fiscal calendar by approximately 0.5% to 1%. While Costco's management doesn't have forward-looking revenue guidance, the company does release its monthly net sales results ahead of earnings reports, which totaled $19.64 billion for the retail month of May, a year-over-year increase of 8.1% from $18.16 billion. AMZN Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nTurning our attention to each company's profitability, Amazon generated $46.1 billion in free cash flow over the trailing 12 months, a significant improvement from -$10.1 billion for the trailing 12 months ended March 31, 2023. For comparison, Costco generated $7.4 billion in free cash over the trailing 12 months, a 10% improvement compared to the trailing 12 months ended May 7, 2023. AMZN Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nOverall, Costco's recent financials are solid and stable; however, Amazon wins in this category as the stock's revenue and profitability growth are more impressive.\n\nFinancial health and returning capital to shareholders\n\nA company's balance sheet is a crucial snapshot illustrating its financial health. Both Amazon's and Costco's balance sheets demonstrate financial stability free of debt. Specifically, Amazon has $27.4 billion in net cash (cash and cash equivalents minus total debt) compared to Costco's $4.6 billion in net cash.\n\nAt a time when interest rates are relatively high, both Amazon and Costco can avoid snowballing debt due to high interest expenses. Instead, the companies can operate from a position of strength and, for Costco, return capital to shareholders through dividends, which allows shareholders to either reinvest their money into the company or collect cash for themselves.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco currently pays a regular quarterly dividend of $1.16 per share, equating to an annual yield of 0.6%, which may not impress income-seeking investors on the surface. However, the company is known for paying a frequent special cash dividend -- five over the past 11 years -- with the most recent coming in January 2024.\n\nAmazon does not currently pay a dividend and is unlikely to follow other tech giants like Alphabet and Meta Platforms, which recently announced its plans to issue dividends for the first time. During Amazon's most recent earnings call, CFO Brian Olsavsky stated that the company had no news to share regarding dividends. He emphasized that management's top priority is to invest in growth opportunities and long-term initiatives. These investments focus on generative artificial intelligence (AI), expected to drive capital investments in 2024 higher than the previous year's $48.4 billion.\n\nSo, despite Amazon's slightly stronger cash position, this category goes to Costco due to its consistent track record of returning capital to shareholders and the high likelihood that it will continue to do so. AMZN Net Financial Debt (Quarterly) data by YCharts\n\nGrowth opportunities\n\nWhile both stocks have long outperformed, prospective buyers should focus more on each company's future growth opportunities.\n\nAs hinted, Amazon sees its next growth phase in generative AI, with plans to implement it across nearly every sector of the company. One division already benefiting is Amazon Web Services (AWS), which helps businesses build AI products and services. As a result, AWS' growth rate is \"accelerating\" to a projected $100 billion annual revenue run rate, up from $90.8 billion in 2023.\n\nWhile the AI market is in its infancy, Statista, a global data and business intelligence platform, predicts exponential growth. Specifically, Statista puts the AI market at $184 billion in 2024, with an expected annual growth rate of 28.5%, resulting in a market volume of $827 billion by 2030.\n\nComparatively, Costco has two major growth drivers: international expansion and increasing membership fees. At the end of fiscal Q3 2024, the company had 876 locations, with 752 in North America. Management aims to open 25 to 30 net new locations each year, with the most potential for expansion in China. Since opening its first Chinese warehouse in 2019, Costco's membership levels have soared to roughly 200,000 as of its fiscal second quarter of 2024 and it recently opened a seventh location. Notably, Amazon shuttered its online marketplace in China in 2019 and has yet to return.\n\nSecond, Costco has a history of raising membership fees approximately every five years, with the last increase in 2017. With a base of 74.5 million members contributing around $4.8 billion in high-margin revenue, even a $5 membership fee hike could bring in an additional $372 million annually.\n\nWhen asked about raising membership prices during the company's latest earnings call, Costco CFO Gary Millerchip stated it \"is still a case of when we increase the fee rather than if we increase the fee.\"\n\nOverall, both companies are well positioned for future growth, and each is taking a different approach. Costco wants to grow slowly and steadily, while Amazon looks to expand at a breakneck speed. Given Costco's safer growth, this category is a close call, but let's award Amazon for the higher growth potential.\n\nIs Amazon or Costco the better buy?\n\nAmazon and Costco are exceptionally well-managed companies poised for long-term success and worthy of every investor's portfolio. That said, at this moment, Amazon appears to be the better buy, especially when considering the valuation. Amazon trades at 42.8 times free cash flow, lower than its 10-year median of 62.9. For comparison, Costco currently trades at 50.5 times free cash flow and its 10-year median is 31.1 times free cash flow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia stock rises after 10-for-1 stock split",
        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the shares' Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The stock closed up nearly 1% in its first day following the split.\n\nThe split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform, called Blackwell Ultra, is coming in 2025 as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Nvidia shares are up about 27% since the company announced its split on May 22.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "content": "Small-cap stocks are currently drawing considerable attention from numerous investors, including myself. Generally, these smaller companies boast more attractive valuations compared to their large-cap peers, presenting an opportunity for the significant returns that investors often pursue.\n\nThe previous year was marked by a notable narrowness in market performance, dominated by the “Magnificent Seven,” which drove nearly all the gains seen in the S&P 500 and Nasdaq indices. This year, however, could be the beginning of a signal or turning point for small-cap stocks, which may rebound from their underperformance, particularly as many of the larger and mega-cap stocks are now perceived as overvalued by many market participants.\n\nTo leverage this segment’s full potential, here are three small-cap stocks currently overlooked by the market that have the potential to generate substantial returns. Although these companies are risky, they may appeal more to some than penny stocks or cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD), offering a blended risk-to-return ratio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) stands out with its robust performance in the latest quarter, marking it as a strong contender among small-cap stocks. As of March 31, 2024, Palantir reported a revenue of $2.33 billion year-to-date, a gross profit of $1.5 billion, and an earnings per share (EPS) of $0.12.\r\n\r\nThe company has recently secured a $178 million contract with the U.S. Army to develop a next-generation intelligence ground station​ (GovCon Wire)​. Additionally, Palantir raised $500 million in a new funding round.\n\nThe company’s profit margin reached 12.8%, indicating efficient operations and its return on equity stood at 9.13%. Notably, its quarterly revenue growth year-over-year was 20.8%.\n\nDespite its compelling fundamentals, the market gives mixed signals about Palantir’s valuation, with a high Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio of 22.54 and an even steeper EV to EBITDA ratio of 170.56. Yet, the significant quarterly earnings growth of over 4% year-over-year and a bullish forecast that anticipates revenue to soar to $5.99 billion by 2028 underscore a potentially lucrative growth path.\n\nPlug Power (PLUG) Mobile phone with logo of American hydrogen fuel cell company Plug Power Inc. in front of business website. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. PLUG stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nPlug Power (NASDAQ:PLUG) presents a mixed investment picture in its latest financial and operational performances. As of the first quarter of 2024, the company reported revenues of 120 million but struggled with significant operational losses, reflected in an EBITDA of negative $1.34 billion year-to-date. The company’s EPS stood at a concerning -$2.41.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite these financial setbacks, the company’s strategic initiatives in the hydrogen fuel cell sector might offer a bullish case for long-term growth. Analysts’ opinions are varied, with a majority recommending a hold, which might reflect uncertainty about the company’s immediate financial health versus its long-term potential. The company’s stock has experienced volatility, currently trading significantly below its 52-week high.\n\nHowever, the company recently announced a major deal involving the sale of its largest backup power system yet to a provider in California’s wine country. This marks an important expansion from their traditional smaller-scale projects into larger utility-scale applications. This means it could be on a promising path to profitability.\n\nPinterest (PINS) Hand holding Apple Iphone6 gold color with Pinterest app on the screen.

PINS stock.\n\nSource: photobyphotoboy / Shutterstock\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS) is a relic from the Web 2.0 era that has managed to carve out a competitive niche for itself as an image-sharing software and social media network. Pinterest primarily targets the U.S. and international markets from its San Francisco headquarters.\n\nRecent financial metrics reflect a company on the rise: it reported robust quarterly revenue, translating into a gross profit of $2.49 billion year-to-date, with modest EPS of $0.22. The company’s latest quarterly results also show healthy revenue growth of 12.80% year-over-year.\n\nEncouragingly, Pinterest’s strategic focus seems to be on an upward trajectory. Analysts maintain a largely optimistic outlook dominated by ‘Buy’ ratings. The target price of $45.92 suggests a potential upside.\n\nSome growth drivers for PINS include its partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) as an advertising partner, which could shore up additional earnings. This makes PINS truly one of those David-like stocks, able to compete with some of the largest social media stocks.\n\nUpwork (UPWK) The logo for Upwork (UPWK) is displayed on a cellphone.\n\nSource: Funstock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUpwork (NASDAQ:UPWK) exemplifies a small-cap contender poised for substantial growth. As an online talent marketplace, Upwork has demonstrated solid performance in its latest quarterly results, with revenue of $190.94 million. This includes a robust profit margin of 6.7% year-to-date. These figures highlight quarterly revenue growth year-over-year of 18.7%. Moreover, the company has reported an EBITDA of $63.47 million a year to date, with earnings per share EPS at $0.34, reflecting consistent profitability.\n\nUPWK has strategically pivoted towards AI, using it internally, teaching AI skills to its users, and connecting AI experts with those seeking their expertise. Despite initial concerns that AI would replace freelancers, Upwork’s embrace of AI has led to strong revenue growth, improved profitability and reduced costs. This is a strong trend that will continue.\n\nAnalysts remain optimistic, with a majority recommending ‘Buy’ and a target price of $18.3, underpinning a bullish thesis. Furthermore, projected revenue growth with a CAGR of approximately 17.5% until 2027 and an anticipated improvement in EPS from negative figures to $1.75 mean there’s a few things to look forward to.\n\nRoku (ROKU) The entrance sign at Roku San Jose campus. Roku produces a variety of digital media players that allow customers to access internet streamed video or audio services.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU), a prominent player in the TV streaming platform industry, demonstrates both potential and challenges in its recent performance.\n\nDespite a striking 19% year-over-year revenue growth in its latest quarter, Roku faces considerable financial strains, evidenced by a $3.98 loss per share and a negative EBITDA of $223.64 million year-to-date. The company’s operating margins and profitability metrics highlight ongoing struggles, with a 15.6% profit margin and a -23.1% return on equity.\r\n\r\nAnalyst sentiment, while mixed, also leans towards optimism, with more buys than sells. A target price of $75.75 underpins potential upside.\n\nRoku’s Q1 2024 operational highlights include reaching 81.6 million active accounts (up 1.6 million from the previous quarter), increasing streaming hours to 30.8 billion (from 29.1 million in Q4 2023), generating $754.9 million in platform revenue and $126.5 million in device sales.\n\nROKU has strong momentum, and I believe it’s undervalued relative to its growth potential and recent performance.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) strongly marks its presence in the fintech sector. The company’s latest quarterly results from March 2024 show promising metrics. Despite a modest profit margin of 1.68%, the operating margin and return on equity indicate effective operational management with values at 4.19% and 1.94%, respectively — the earnings per share EPS stand firm at $0.60.\n\nAnalysts hold a favorable view, as reflected in their ratings — 35 out of 47 recommend a buy or strong buy, with an analyst target price pegged at $91.09. Given the current trading around the $72 mark, this represents a potential upside. The robust revenue growth year-over-year of 19.4% and a recent quarterly earnings growth of 3.25% showcase a resilient expansion trajectory.\r\n\r\nSQ has recently been criticized over concerns that it may have processed transactions linked to terrorist groups or in violation of economic sanctions. The probe follows allegations from a former employee who claimed several lapses in compliance practices at Block.\r\n\r\nHowever, these kinds of scandals are relatively common for fintech companies, and the company’s recent share sell-off last month represents a one-time rather than structural weakness.\n\nTeladoc Health (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeladoc Health (NYSE:TDOC) is a growing player in the virtual healthcare sector, with significant potential despite prevailing financial challenges. With a market capitalization of approximately $1.8 billion and a substantial share base of nearly 169.6 million, Teladoc extends its services globally.\n\nHowever, the company grapples with profitability issues, evidenced by negative earnings per share EPS of $1.41 and a net profit margin of -8.9%. These figures suggest a disconnect between revenue growth and bottom-line results, exacerbated by an operating margin of -11.9%.\n\nIn saying this, Investors should note Teladoc’s significant revenue growth projections, with forecasts suggesting a leap to $3.24 billion by 2028. This expected surge points to a bullish outlook on Teladoc’s ability to scale operations and capitalize on the growing demand for telehealth solutions.\n\nTDOC, like other hot pandemic stocks that were all the rage in the 2020s, has returned to Earth again, but I believe that remote healthcare is a field that will come under renewed enthusiasm, making it one of those best small-cap stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "We recently published a list of 9 Best Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire George Soros. Since Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) ranks 2nd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire George Soros has been one of the most active and divisive figures in the Wall Street. Often a right-wing target, the billionaire handed over the control of his $25 billion empire to his son Alexander Soros last year. The 93 year-old Hungarian American is known as the philosopher investor in the Wall Street, mainly due to his contributions to philosophy and his deep desire to leave his mark in the world of philosophy, which many believe he fulfilled thanks to his General Theory of Reflexivity for capital markets.\n\nGeorge Soros founded Soros Fund Management in 1970. Since its inception through 2010, the fund posted on average a 20% annual rate of return. A Wall Street Journal report earlier this year said that Soros Fund Management has posted a compound annual return of 13.5% over the past three years through June 30, 2023.\n\nREAD NEXT: Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones’ Top Dividend Picks and Analysts Are Upgrading These AI Stocks\n\nGeorge Soros in his book The New Paradigm of Financial Markets wrote a chapter titled “Autobiography of a Failed Philosopher” in which he talked in detail about how many, including his son and his biographer, started accepting the idea that Soros was a failed philosopher.  Soros talks in detail about his childhood, his relationship with his father who at one point, according to Soros, lost all ambition in life and did not amass any wealth. A Jew by birth, Soros decided to come to the UK after the Nazi occupation of Hungary. Soros’ first interactions with philosophy started when he was impressed by the works of Karl Popper. But Soros’ dreams of creating a career in philosophy could not realize for several reasons, some of which he talks about in his book:\n\n“I would have preferred to stay within the safe walls of academe—I even had a teaching assistant job prospect at the University of Michigan in Kalamazoo, but my grades were not good enough, and I was forced to go out into the real world. After several false starts, I ended up working as an arbitrage trader, first in London and then in New York.* At first I had to forget everything I had learned as a student in order to hold down my job, but eventually my college education came in very useful. In particular, I could apply my theory of reflexivity to establish a disequilibrium scenario or boom-bust pattern for financial markets. The rewarding part came when markets entered what I called far-from-equilibrium territory because that is when the generally accepted equilibrium models broke down.”\n\nStory continues\n\nFor this article we scanned Billionaire Soros’s Soros Fund Management’s Q1 portfolio and chose its top 9 stock picks.

        "title": "This Ridiculously Cheap Warren Buffett Stock Could Make You Richer",
        "content": "Investors tend to follow the companies in which Warren Buffett invests. After all, he's considered by many to be the greatest investor of all time, so naturally, it's fascinating to see what he buys and sells. Did you know U.S. e-commerce giant Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a Buffett stock?\n\nIt's a position you don't hear much about because it's not very big in Buffett's portfolio. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, allocates just 0.5% of its holdings to Amazon, a position Buffett didn't add until 2019.\n\nBut don't let Buffett's relatively modest stake in Amazon prevent you from capitalizing on an opportunity sitting in plain sight. Amazon is cheap today, even after shares have risen over 50% this past year.\n\nHere's how Amazon is poised to make long-term investors richer over the coming years.\n\nThe great pandemic-era investment spree\n\nAny investor reading this is likely familiar with Amazon's e-commerce business. Over 200 million households worldwide subscribe to Amazon Prime, and the company has a whopping 38% market share of all online retail sales in the United States.\n\nAmazon has invested a lot of time and money into building the network of distribution centers, vehicles, planes, and other logistics infrastructure needed to have just about anything in stock and quickly delivered anywhere in the country. Yet, the company was still caught off guard by COVID-19's boost to online shopping. Amazon responded with a monstrous hike in capital expenditures: AMZN Capital Expenditures (TTM) Chart\n\nThese investments helped take Amazon's logistics business to a new level. Late last year, Amazon surpassed dedicated logistics companies UPS and FedEx to become the country's largest delivery company. That mind-blowing size and scale illustrate Amazon's competitive edge against other online retailers.\n\nAndy Jassy on Amazon's next potential opportunity\n\nRetail in America is an ocean of opportunity. It's such a large market, which has helped explain how Amazon has grown seemingly endlessly over the years and generated such blistering investment returns. But Amazon's not done growing.\n\nCEO Andy Jassy hinted at a potential long-term opportunity in his annual shareholder letter in April. Notably, Jassy underlined the potential demand for same-day delivery services. He discussed how Amazon's 58 same-day fulfillment facilities have cut time-to-ship readiness for its top 100,000 products to as little as 11 minutes. The success has inclined Amazon to invest in growing its same-day facilities.\n\nJassy also noted the potential markets that same-day services could help it penetrate, including pharmacy and grocery. Groceries caught my interest because it's currently a $900 billion-plus opportunity in the U.S. that Amazon has virtually no share in -- just about 1%.\n\nStory continues\n\nSame-day facilities and the eventual spread of delivery drones (Prime Air) could unlock a whole new segment of U.S. retail for a company that has already invested in logistics like Amazon has.\n\nWhy shares are still cheap while at all-time highs\n\nGrocery is just one of several needle-moving initiatives Amazon has in the works, meaning earnings growth could continue for years despite Amazon already having a nearly $2 trillion market cap. Shares look pricey, sitting at all-time highs, but I don't think Amazon is as expensive as some might fear.\n\nHere is why.\n\nFew companies continually invest back into their business as much as Amazon does. The company is always planting seeds for future growth. Capital investments can skew earnings and make it hard to get a good read on the stock's valuation.\n\nSo, consider Amazon's price versus its operating cash flow instead of looking at earnings. The business generates these cash profits before reinvesting into the company. As you can see below, Amazon's stock is arguably the cheapest it's been in years when looking through this lens: AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nAmazon is really good at getting value from the investments it makes in its business. Its return on invested capital is an impressive 10% on average. The company's ballooning investments in recent years could result in years of strong earnings growth, especially if it once again finds a new industry to dominate in grocery.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "National Safety Council Releases New Report on Diversity, Equity and Inclusion and Workplace Injury Prevention",
        "content": "Research paper examines why diversity, equity and inclusion should be a foundational element of musculoskeletal disorder prevention and provides equitable solutions to minimize worker risks\n\nWASHINGTON, June 10, 2024 /PRNewswire/ -- While efforts have been made in recent years to increase workplace safety through regulations, innovative technologies, hazard assessments and other methods, research shows workers of color face more work-related injuries and illnesses, according to data compiled by the Bureau of Labor Statistics and the U.S. Census Bureau. Recognizing this disparity and that musculoskeletal disorders, or MSDs, are the most common workplace injury, the National Safety Council released a new report, The Intersection of DEI and MSDs: Ensuring Equitable Outcomes. The National Safety Council is dedicated to eliminating the leading causes of preventable death and injury focusing our efforts on the workplace, roadway and impairment. (PRNewsfoto/National Safety Council)\n\n\"At the National Safety Council, we believe fostering diversity, equity and inclusion is not only a moral imperative but also essential for creating safer and healthier work environments for all,\" said Lorraine Martin, NSC president and CEO. \"This report, which analyzes the impact of diversity, equity and inclusion on the largest category of workplace injuries, underscores our commitment to advancing equitable outcomes within the occupational safety landscape.\"\n\nPublished through the MSD Solutions Lab, a groundbreaking NSC initiative established in 2021 with funding from Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) to solve work-related MSDs, the research paper identifies workplace factors that can lead to inequitable MSD outcomes and provides solutions for mitigation. Specifically, the report references more than 100 academic publications and sources and examines the impact of diversity, equity and inclusion on work organization, workplace and equipment design, safety culture, psychological safety, and psychosocial risk factors. Key findings center on:\n\nWork organization: Shift work, long hours and part-time employee status can impact the prevalence of MSDs among workers. Demanding work schedules can increase the risk of MSDs due to less time for adequate sleep and recovery from work, longer exposure to hazards and demands at work, and less time to attend to non-work responsibilities. Other workplace factors highly associated with MSD risk and prevalence are the type of job and the pace at which work is done. Workplace and equipment design:  An employee who uses a wheelchair or an employee smaller than a fifth percentile female may have difficulty accessing the full range of their workstation depending on its design. PPE has also traditionally been designed to fit the average White male and, as a result, females in the workforce are often not provided with properly fitting gear. One survey found that only 19% of women, non-binary and transgender construction workers received appropriately sized gloves and safety gear. Safety culture: Creating a strong safety culture is an important factor in making sure workplaces are inclusive and safe from MSD risks. Workplaces that do not offer benefits such as paid sick leave and long-term disability may create an unsafe culture in which employees feel insecure about taking necessary time off when they have suffered a workplace injury. Clear and accessible policies and procedures are vital to ensuring organizations are equitably protecting all workers from safety risks. Psychological safety: Employee wellbeing at work is significantly influenced by a sense of belonging to the organization or team, with managers showing appreciation for their employees and involving them in decision-making. Voice suppression can prove particularly harmful to employees of color, as they may already perceive their voices and opinions as less valued than the majority group. As a result of this disparity, Black and Hispanic workers report the most unease about reporting unsafe work conditions when compared to other racial and ethnic groups. Psychosocial risk factors: Common psychosocial risk factors are job stress, lack of job control or autonomy, job dissatisfaction, time pressure and poor organizational, supervisor or coworker support. Occupational stress has shown to increase MSDs, with role conflict and lack of job control leading to wrist, hand, shoulder and lower back issues. Further, psychosocial risks are more pervasive in jobs and industries commonly employing workers of color and female workers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition to examining the impact of workplace factors on MSDs, the report also outlines potential solutions to address inequities and risks based on the hierarchy of controls, including:\n\nElimination: Be mindful of jobs that demand high exertions, awkward or sustained postures, and a fast pace and eliminate them when able. Substitution: Adapt workplace design to those with different sizes and abilities and provide ergonomic accommodations for employees with medical conditions or disabilities. Engineering: Provide adjustable assistive devices and technology – including lifts, ramps, hoists, cobots, carts, counterbalances, turntables and conveyors – to minimize strain and repetitive motions and incorporate designs respecting different cultural norms and practices. Administrative: Utilize policies and procedures to ensure accessibility for all workers, an open and anonymous reporting system, and promote diverse representation in safety leadership and training materials. Further, it is essential to seek and include feedback on job tasks and risk factors from a diverse group of employees to source solutions that are helpful for everyone. PPE: Routinely check in with employees to confirm PPE needs are being appropriately met, including those with different body types, abilities and cultural preferences.\n\nPioneering research is one of several initiatives supported by the MSD Solutions Lab to achieve its goal of preventing MSDs. To learn more about these efforts and the risks associated with MSDs, visit nsc.org/msd.\n\nAbout the National Safety Council\r\nThe National Safety Council is America's leading nonprofit safety advocate – and has been for 110 years. As a mission-based organization, we work to eliminate the leading causes of preventable death and injury, focusing our efforts on the workplace and roadways.

The unexpected and dismal results only hours before meme-stock influencer Keith Gill, better known under an alias “Roaring Kitty”, held its first livestream in three years after helping ignite a meme stock rally, to which more than half a million viewers tuned in. But even Roaring Kitty's return couldn't help GameStop's game with its stock plunging 40%.\n\nDismal first quarter results\n\nFor the period ended on May 4th, GameStop reported net sales dropped 29% to $881.8 million, while FactSet estimates were between $900 million and $1.09 billion. But GameStop did narrow its loss to $32.3 million after losing $50.5 million in last year’s comparable quarter. An adjusted loss of $0.12 per share was also worse than Wall Street’s estimate of $0.09.\n\nGameStop has scary competitors.\n\nBeing a one-stop-shop for video games, consumer electronics, and gaming merchandise places the videogame retailer against the mighty Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), eBay Inc (NASDAQ: EBAY), Walmart (NYSE: WMT), Nintendo Co Ltd (OTC: NTDOY) and Best Buy Co Inc (NYSE: BBY). Amazon has an extensive delivery network and gets delivery orders quickly. Unsurprisingly, Amazon reported its revenue more than tripled over the past five years while GameStop’s was halved. When it comes to online game sales, even with its efforts to shorten delivery times, GameStop can hardly catch up to Amazon.\n\nAlthough Sony is GameStop’s B2B partner, it is also its B2C competitor as it sells video games directly to consumers. Back in May, Sony forecasted lower sales of its PlayStation 5 console that is in its fifth year. Moreover, Sony guided for lower overall revenue at its gaming unit, but hoping greater user engagement and more efficient cost control could fuel the segment’s profitability. Along with Microsoft, who is also both a partner and competitor to GameStop, Sony announced layoffs across its gaming business. Overall, Microsoft is fine but mostly thanks to its Activision Blizzard acquisition with which it ensured its leadership position in the gaming arena. On Sunday, Microsoft will hold its annual video-game showcase with Xbox Game Pass taking center stage. Reuters reported that the software giant prepares to roll out the latest installment in its best-selling \"Call of Duty\" franchise on the subscription service in response to heavy competition from Sony and its consoles. With this move, Microsoft expects to boost the growth of its subscription service. Back in February, Microsoft reported its subscription service had 34 million subscribers.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat is certain is that even the video game industry is changing.\n\nBut the video game industry that blends the tech and media industries is seeing sales going down with lowered usage and layoffs increasing in response to the looming AI automation. Back in 2021, GameStop was a struggling video game retailer in an environment where digital downloads quickly started replacing discs. Three years later, it’s seeing lower sales for hardware, accessories, software and collectibles, again being a struggling brick and mortar video game retailer.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential",
        "content": "Ulta Beauty Inc. (NASDAQ:ULTA) has been a disappointment for shareholders over the past three months. Its share price dropped from $567 in the middle of March to $376 in the middle of May, then rebounded to $395 at the time of writing. The three-month return was -27.70%.\n\nHowever, looking from a broader timeline, Ulta Beauty has delivered nice gains for shareholders. Over the past 16 years, its share price has managed to grow by more than 2,800%, with a compounded annual gain of 23%. Let's take a closer look to determine whether Ulta Beauty is a good stock for long-term investors now.\n\nSteady growth in a challenging business environment\n\nFor the first quarter, Ulta Beauty reported steady growth in a tough market environment, with net sales up 3.50% to $2.72 billion and comparable sales up 1.60%. The company outperformed the Wall Street's forecasts of $2.72 billion. It also recored strong earnings of $6.47 per share versus estimates of $6.25. The operating profit margin reached 14.70% of sales. Notably, fragrance and skincare saw double-digit and mid-digit growth and makeup sales declined in the mid-single-digit range.\n\nThe current industry environment and increased competition led Ulta Beauty to revise its full-year forecast. The company currently expects fiscal 2024 net sales of $11.50 billion to $11.60 billion, down from $11.70 billion to $11.80 billion previously. The comp sales growth would stay in the range of 2% to 3%. Diluted earnings per share are expected to be between $25.20 and $26, versus $26.20 to $27 from earlier projections. These adjustments reflect anticipated continued pressures in the beauty category in addition to increased competition from rivals like Sephora and Amazon's (NASDAQ:AMZN) push into high-quality beauty brands.\n\nCEO Dave Kimbell attributed the forecast adjustment to the dynamics in the first quarter and cited several strategic initiatives designed to solidify Ulta Beauty's market position. He said:\n\nWe are confident in our model and our ability to gain share and drive significant sustainable value over the long-term. The actions we have taken and investments we have made over the past few years have fortified our operating foundation and we are a stronger, more profitable company today than we were just a few years ago.\n\nUlta Beauty is implementing several key initiatives, including enhancing product range and digital experience, accelerating social relevance, leveraging the loyalty program and evolving promotional strategies. The company is also working to maintain its gross margin, which dropped to 39.20% in the first quarter due to lower merchandise margins and higher inventory shrink. It is launching new marketing technology later this year that will allow for more personalization and top-line growth.\n\nStory continues\n\nPlans to continue repurchasing shares\n\nUlta Beauty has a history of repurchasing shares on the open market, reducing its share count over the years. The company has spent over $5.86 billion on stock buybacks since 2013. As a result, total shares outstanding dropped by over 23% from 64.46 million in 2013 to 49.6 million in 2023. As of the first quarter, the share count stood at around 48.38 million. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nFurther, the company plans to repurchase $1 billion worth of stock within the year. If $1 billion is used to buy back shares at around $400 per share, Ulta Beauty could buy back up to 2.50 million additional shares, yielding more than 5.20% for its shareholders.\n\nDebt-free balance sheet\n\nWhat I like about Ulta Beauty is the debt-free balance sheet. As of May 2024, it had $2.30 billion in total stockholders' equity. The cash on hand came in at nearly $525 million. While the company has no interest-bearing debt, it does have operating lease liabilities. The total operating lease liabilities, both short and long term, were $1.89 billion. Although the total amount of operating leases seems to be a lot, the lease payment spread out over many years. The lease payment which the company has to pay within one year are only around $351,500. The total lease payments in the next three to five years amount to nearly $545,900. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nSource: Ulta Beauty's 10-K filing\n\nAs its operating cash flow has stayed in the range of $810.3 million to $1.48 billion in the past five years, Ulta Beauty could settle operating lease payment quite easily.\n\nPotential upside\n\nUlta Beauty has expanded its free cash flow from $101 million in 2013 to $1.04 billion in 2023, posting compounded annual growth of 26.20%. Since the company has been generating growing free cash flow quite consistently over the past decade, we can use discounted free cash flow method to value the business.\n\nAssuming the retailer's free cash flow growth would reduce a bit to 20% per year in the next 10 years, then the terminal growth would be 2% afterwards. With a 10% discount rate, the company's enterprise value would be around $46 billion. Adjusting the current net cash of $525 million, its market capitalization should be worth $45.56 billion. If Ulta Beauty commits all $1 billion in share repurchase within this year, the total share count would be reduced to 45.88 million. This translates to an intrinsic value per share of $993, nearly 150% upside from the current trading price. Ulta Beauty: A Debt-Free, Growing Business With Upside Potential\n\nSource: Author's calculation\n\nKey takeaway\n\nUlta Beauty remains a resilient long-term investment despite recent volatility and a downward adjustment of its fiscal outlook. Its strategic initiatives, a robust share repurchase program and debt-free balance sheet underscore its sound fundamentals and focus on shareholder value. Our recent DCF valuation shows the stock is quite cheap with a potential 150% upside for investors. Therefore, Ulta Beauty fits well in portfolios of long-term investors who are looking for a growth stock with a solid financial foundation.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Autonomous Driving Stocks That Are Better Bets Than Tesla",
        "content": "Very quietly, self-driving vehicles are on the verge of becoming mainstream. In China, robotaxis have become so popular that their makers are nearly breaking even financially and will probably become profitable in 2025. In the U.S., Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) robotaxis are being tested in three cities: San Francisco, Las Vegas, and Seattle, while two more, Miami and Austin, will soon be added to the list.\n\nMoreover, after conducting many years of testing in Texas, 20 new self-driving trucks could soon be carrying goods between Dallas and Houston. And I have little doubt that the self-driving vehicle business and autonomous driving stocks will eventually be very lucrative. That’s because, given widespread shortages of drivers and the large amounts of money that they must be paid, companies will be willing to hand over a great deal for automated vehicles.\n\nWhile Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) has made major strides in the autonomous-driving race, it already has a very large valuation, along with major regulatory issues in the U.S., and is suffering market share losses in both America and China. Therefore, I view these autonomous driving stocks as better bets than Tesla.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAurora Innovation (AUR) UBER Stock. Uber Layoffs. Self-driving truck stocks: a self-driving truck on the road\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock\n\nIncreasing my confidence in Aurora Innovation (NASDAQ:AUR), two major entities in recent quarters significantly increased their investments in the firm.\n\nHedge fund Dimensional Advisorsincreased its ownership of AUR stock by 42% to 7.57 million in Q4 2023. As of the end of last year, the fund, which offers many ETFs, had a huge $677 billion of assets under management. And last July, Uber Technologies (NYSE:UBER) bought $75 million more of Aurora’s shares. Uber purchased the stock for $2.70-$3, versus Aurora’s current price of around $2.30.\n\nBy the end of the year, Aurora expects its autonomous trucks to be hauling freight in Texas for several huge companies, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Uber Freight, and Werner. The company expects to expand rapidly in the coming years, with plans to deploy “thousands” of trucks in only three years. The firm intends to eventually sell trucks equipped with its software and hardware to other firms.\n\nGiven the company’s impressive customer list and ambitious plans, along with the substantial purchases of AUR stock, I view the name as one of the best autonomous driving stocks to buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) A rendered image of a self-driving car driving down a tree-lined street, with green radar sensors surrounding the front of the car; AI powering self-driving\n\nChina-based Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) is the first company that I’ve seen to disclose that its self-driving vehicles are on the verge of becoming profitable. The company’s recent announcement that its Apollo Go robotaxi business is close to breaking even and will probably break into the black next year is quite momentous and bodes very well for BIDU stock. According to IOT World Today, if Baidu achieves the milestone, it will become “the world’s first profitable autonomous ride-hailing platform.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd illustrating Baidu’s huge commitment to Apollo Go, the firm reportedly intends to deploy 1,000 of its new robotaxis in just one city – Wuhan. Further, indicating that the robotaxi business will indeed be very lucrative for Baidu, the new vehicles cost less than $28,000.\n\nAlso importantly, analysts, on average, expect Baidu’s earnings per share to advance to $12.10 next year from $11.40 in 2024. Despite the expected, substantial increase in its profitability and the huge, longer-term potential of its robotaxi business, BIDU stock is changing hands at a very low price-earnings ratio of 9.65 times.\n\nRivian (RIVN) The front of a Rivian (RIVN) storefront is seen lined up with Rivian R1T and R1S model trucks out in front.\n\nSource: Michael Berlfein / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) reports that all of its EVs come equipped with software called Driver+. According to the company, Driver+ offers “true hands-free driving with a suite of active safety and driving assistance features — capable of automatically steering and adjusting the speed on your command.”\n\nMoreover, two recent developments indicate that the automaker stands well-positioned to vastly improve its self-driving features over the longer term.\n\nFirst, the new version of the automaker’s R1EVs include “a new in-house developed autonomy system,” Seeking Alpha reported. Reportedly significantly more advanced than the previous version, the new offering now includes “11 cameras, five radars, and AI prediction technology.”\n\nAnd speaking of AI, in a recent note to investors, well-known Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote that “Rivian is ‘uniquely positioned within autos (other than Tesla) on scaling a fully integrated software stack critical to unlocking the AI opportunity.'” Given Jonas’ assertion, I expect Rivian to greatly improve its self-driving technology over the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held long positions in AUR, RIVN, and AMZN.

        "title": "Teradata Stock Analysis: Don’t Let the Amazon News Fool You Into Buying Now",
        "content": "Are you on the hunt for hot tech stocks? Are you bullish about cloud computing and artificial intelligence? That’s understandable, and Teradata (NYSE:TDC) certainly fits into these technology sectors. However, even though Teradata stock is down in 2024 so far, the right strategy is to just watch and wait for more information.\n\nI’m not saying that there’s a lack of information about Teradata; as we’ll see, there’s plenty of data to study. The problem is that, even after a share-price drawdown, Teradata could still be overvalued.\n\nBesides, the company isn’t demonstrating growth in several key financial areas. I’ll delve into the details of that, but first let’s start off with some good news concerning Teradata.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTeradata’s Crucial Connection With Amazon\n\nTeradata describes itself as offering the “most complete cloud analytics and data platform for AI.” Furthermore, the company helps business clients to “enable more confident decision-making” as they navigate the complex world of AI-enhanced cloud computing.\n\nWhile I’m not bullish about Teradata stock right now, I must admit that the company’s business model is timely in the 2020s. Without a doubt, plenty of companies will need assistance with integrating AI-cloud applications and workloads.\n\nOn that topic, Teradata has an arrangement withAmazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) cloud-computing platform, Amazon Web Services. Specifically, Teradata will help AWS to “support customers as they migrate to the cloud, accelerate the modernization of their data analytic ecosystems and maximize the value of artificial intelligence opportunities.”\n\nI’d assess this collaboration as a huge win-win for both companies, and especially for Teradata. After all, it’s hard for a company to lose when it’s working with the almighty Amazon. But wait — don’t buy Teradata stock yet, as there’s data to pore over and some of it isn’t particularly encouraging.\n\nTeradata: Rich Valuation but No Revenue Growth\n\nFirst and foremost, I must address Teradata’s relatively high valuation. On a trailing 12-month basis, Teradata has a price-to-earnings ratio of 76.51x. For comparison’s sake, the sector median P/E ratio is 30.73x.\n\nThis is a textbook example of how a stock can be down year-to-date but this doesn’t mean that it’s a bargain. Moreover, it would be difficult to argue that Teradata is a screaming bargain if the company isn’t showing top-line or bottom-line improvement.\n\nTo analyze this topic, we can look at Teradata’s first-quarter 2024 financial results. Teradata’s total revenue declined 2% year over year to $465 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn addition, the company’s GAAP-measured diluted earnings decreased from 39 cents per share in the year-earlier quarter to 20 cents per share in Q1 of 2024.\n\nIt’s also troubling that Teradata’s free cash flow retreated from $105 million in the year-earlier quarter to just $21 million in this year’s first quarter. The data just doesn’t bode well for Teradata.\n\nTeradata Stock: The Waiting Is the Hardest Part\n\nIt may be tempting to invest in Teradata today after you’ve learned about the company’s arrangement with Amazon. Yet, Teradata’s first-quarter financial stats indicate that the company isn’t improving in certain key areas.\n\nHopefully, Teradata’s next quarterly financial report will show progress in these areas. That remains to be seen, though. For now, Teradata appears to be fully valued, at least when using the company’s trailing P/E ratio as a gauge.\n\nThus, the risk-to-reward proposition isn’t great for prospective Teradata investors right now. The prudent move, then, is to just wait. If the company clearly demonstrates financial progress during the next quarter or two, then it will be time to consider buying Teradata stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, David Moadel did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Nvidia begins trading Monday after 10-for-1 stock split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) shares began trading Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock from its Friday closing price of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock held as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each one share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nStock splits make owning shares of a stock more affordable by lowering the price of individual shares without diluting the value of existing shareholders' total holdings. CEO Jensen Huang walks onstage before the keynote address of Nvidia GTC in San Jose, Calif., Monday, March 18, 2024. (AP Photo/Eric Risberg) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"The stock split is going to make Nvidia a lot more reachable for a lot of these retail traders,\" Option Research & Technology Services' Matt Amberson told Yahoo Finance last Thursday. \"Now, you rarely see a stock over $1,000 with a 50% implied volatility, so the prices of the options are extraordinarily high, so options traders are really looking forward to the split.\"\n\nNvidia's split comes after the company's total market valuation briefly eclipsed $3 trillion on Wednesday, pushing the chip firm past Apple to become the second-most-valuable publicly traded US company.\n\nShares of Nvidia have skyrocketed thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022. Since then, hyperscalers like Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG, GOOGL), and Microsoft (MSFT) have been battling to get their hands on Nvidia's hardware to power their own generative AI platforms.\n\nThat's sent Nvidia's revenue through the roof. In the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nAnd Nvidia continues to develop new hardware to keep customers coming back for more. On June 3, CEO Jensen Huang announced an upgraded version of its Blackwell AI platform called Blackwell Ultra is coming in 2025, as well as an entirely new platform called Rubin set for 2026. And in 2027, the company will release an Ultra version of the Rubin hardware.\n\nStock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.\n\nNvidia's stock split comes as AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are giving chase, announcing their own AI hardware and laying out their future product roadmaps as alternatives to Nvidia's. Nvidia's customers are also developing their own AI chips to train and run AI models to help mitigate the cost of purchasing new Nvidia products.\n\nIt's not just hyperscalers, though. Meta (META), Tesla (TSLA), and a slew of other major tech and automotive companies are angling to grab Nvidia's chips to train and deploy AI models for everything from recommendation engines to autonomous driving software.\n\nWhat's more, Nvidia says it has a growing total addressable market beyond tech companies, including government organizations, research institutions, and more, meaning it might have a lot more runway to go.\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "How Nvidia Could Help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft Stocks Soar Even More",
        "content": "It's been a great time to own shares of Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT). All three stocks delivered strong gains last year and are up by double-digit percentages so far in 2024.\n\nBut it's been a spectacular time to own shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). The chip stock skyrocketed nearly 240% in 2023 and has vaulted more than 140% higher year to date.\n\nYou've probably heard the adage that \"success begets success.\" I think we'll see this proved in a convincing manner, with one company's success translating to success for others. Here's how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft stocks soar even more.\n\nCloud power\n\nTo understand how Nvidia could help Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft, we first need to know something important about the three companies. Their cloud units are key growth drivers.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Alphabet's Google Cloud revenue jumped 28.4% year over year. This business generated nearly 20% of the company's total revenue growth despite making up less than 12% of total revenue.\n\nIt was a similar story for Amazon. Revenue for the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) unit increased 17% year over year in the first quarter, almost 39% of total revenue growth. AWS was an even bigger driver of Amazon's earnings growth.\n\nWhat about Microsoft? Its cloud business delivered revenue growth in the fiscal second quarter (which ended March 31) of 23% -- roughly 73% of total revenue growth.\n\nHow Nvidia is driving migration to the cloud\n\nAnything that drives more customers to the cloud will directly help sales and earnings growth for Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft. And over the long term, that should translate to increasing stock prices for each company.\n\nThis is where Nvidia comes into the picture. Its technology is helping all three giant cloud service providers to attract more customers and more business from existing customers.\n\nNvidia chief financial officer Colette Kress explained how the company is helping cloud service providers grow in its first-quarter earnings call. She said that organizations that use Nvidia's GPUs are able to train their large language models (LLMs) more quickly and more cost-effectively than with other chips. They can also deploy those models at the lowest cost with Nvidia's GPUs, Kress said.\n\nAlphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft enjoy exceptional returns on investment when they use Nvidia's AI technology. Kress said that cloud providers can earn $5 in hosting revenue with Nvidia's GPUs over four years for every $1 invested in the company's AI infrastructure.\n\nStory continues\n\nThese big cloud service providers also have ample motivation to adopt new technology introduced by Nvidia. In his company's first-quarter call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang emphasized the importance of organizations being able to train AI models quickly.\n\nFor example, the company's forthcoming Blackwell GPU architecture enables training that is four times faster than with its wildly popular H100 GPUs. The new platform supports 30 times faster AI inference. It's not surprising that Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft are among the early buyers of Blackwell -- even before it ships later this year.\n\nA symbiotic relationship\n\nHaven't Alphabet, Amazon, and Microsoft developed their own AI chips? Could Nvidia's top customers become its rivals over time? Yes and yes.\n\nHuang was asked about this by an analyst in the first-quarter call. He responded by pointing out how Nvidia's technology differs from the custom chips the big cloud service providers offer. He believes that the scope, versatility, and low total cost of ownership of Nvidia's accelerated computing architecture; its pervasiveness across all types of computers, and the company's AI factories stand out as key competitive advantages.\n\nFor now, Nvidia and its big cloud customers enjoy a symbiotic relationship. Nvidia's sales grow as it launches new and improved AI technology. Alphabet's, Amazon's, and Microsoft's sales grow as they use Nvidia's latest products to attract customers. It's a win-win proposition for all four companies -- and their investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Most Festive City in the US",
        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the most festive city in the US. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 25 Most Festive Cities in the US.\n\nThe holiday season in the United States is a time for family, friends, and of course, festive cheer. However, the festive experience isn't the same across the country. While some of the most festive cities such as New York City, New York, or Chicago, Illinois offer a classic winter wonderland view and bustling Christmas markets, others such as Honolulu, Hawaii offer a sunny getaway.\n\nThe festive spirit also leads to a significant economic boost, with the National Retail Federation (NRF) reporting that holiday spending in the US reached a record-breaking $964.4 billion in 2023. This massive spending occurred despite economic pressures created by inflation and rising interest rates. The 2023 holiday season spending reflected a 3.8% increase from 2022 and met NRF’s forecasted figures.\n\nMeanwhile, according to preliminary data from MasterCard, online spending during the holiday season rose by 6.3%, compared to 2022. This outpaced in-store spending, which only saw a 2.2% rise, highlighting the faster growth rate of online holiday shopping.\n\nBeyond the winter holidays, other festivals also witness significant spending increases. Valentine's Day, for instance, saw Americans spending an estimated $25.9 billion in 2024, with candy, jewelry, and flowers being popular purchases. Thanksgiving and Black Friday shopping are also major seasonal events. Consumers reportedly spent about $38 billion on items such as furniture, electronics, and toys during the Thanksgiving weekend in 2023.\n\nMajor retailers like Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart particularly benefit from these festive seasons. For instance, last year's holiday shopping season significantly boosted Amazon.com, Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) revenue growth for the quarter ending in December 2023. The company recorded a quarterly revenue of $170 billion, exceeding analysts’ expectations and reflecting a 14% increase year-over-year (YoY).\n\nMaintaining the growth trajectory, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) posted strong financial results in Q1 2024 as well. The company recorded $143 billion in revenue, reflecting a 13% increase over the last year, excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates. Operating income reached over $15 billion, a 221% rise YoY. Furthermore, the company achieved $48.8 billion in trailing 12-month free cash flow, marking a $53.2 billion YoY improvement.\n\nHere's what Baron Funds said about Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\nStory continues\n\n“Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the world’s largest retailer and cloud services provider. Shares increased 18.7% on quarterly results that exceeded consensus expectations, with revenue growth of 13% year-over-year and operating margins of 7.8% (up from 1.8% a year ago). We believe that Amazon is well positioned in the short to medium term to continue improving its core North American margins, which have reached 6.1% in the fourth quarter, the seventh straight quarter of margin improvement and an overall improvement of 800bps. Amazon has been rearchitecting its fulfillment network, improving efficiency, reducing cost-to-serve and accelerating delivery speeds thanks to initiatives such as regionalization, with the number of items delivered during the same day or overnight increasing by nearly 70% year-over-year. Reducing the cost to serve also enables Amazon to sell lower priced items and expand its addressable market to everyday purchases. Additionally, Amazon continues to benefit from its fast-growing, margin-accretive advertising business winning market share in digital advertising thanks to its structural advantages of a closed loop system, which enables a deterministic calculation of Return on Ad Spending. We also believe that e-commerce still has long duration growth ahead as it still accounts for less than 15% of retail. Similarly, Amazon’s cloud service, AWS, remains relatively early in its S-curve with cloud representing around 13% of worldwide IT spending13 incremental tailwinds across the three layers of the GenAI stack – infrastructure with NVIDIA’s own AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) as well as with its offering of NVIDIA chips, platform (Bedrock), and applications (first and third party).” The Most Festive City in the US\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 25 most festive cities in the US, we used a consensus methodology. We referred to various sources such as Business Insider, Thumbtack, Realtor, Kiplinger, and Reddit threads to gain information regarding the festive spirit across different cities in the US. We collected information on various festive attractions these cities offer throughout the year, such as decoration shops, holiday markets, shopping options, and music venues.\n\nFollowing the shortlisting of the cities, we assigned a score to each city based on the number of times it appeared across our sources. In the case of cities having the same score, tiebreaking was done on the basis of which city was outranking the other in our sources. The most festive cities in the US have been ranked in ascending order of their scores.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nThe Most Festive City in the US\n\nLas Vegas, NV\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 4\n\nLas Vegas is the largest city in Nevada and the county seat of Clark County. The city is known for its extravagant holiday displays and experiences created by casinos, restaurants, bars, and other attractions.\n\nIn 2023, tourism in Las Vegas rose, achieving new post-pandemic records in March. Vegas welcomed 40.8 million visitors, surpassing the 40 million mark for the first time since 2019. Clark County saw gaming revenue reach $13.5 billion in 2023, marking a second consecutive year of setting market records.\n\nFurthermore, the Las Vegas Strip saw hotel occupancy rates climb to 90.5% in 2023. The development of more entertainment venues has played a key role in driving the success of the Las Vegas economy and making it the most festive city in the US.\n\nTo check out more cities, visit the 25 Most Festive Cities in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most festive cities in the US to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "The Largest Food Company in the World by Market Cap",
        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the Largest Food Company in the World by Market Cap. We have also compiled a full free list of the 15 Largest Food Companies in the World by Market Cap.\n\nThe food industry is one of the most crucial markets globally because no matter what, humans must eat, regardless of the circumstances. So, who is behind all of this? Behind every grocery store, behind every little packaged snack, there is a group of people and advanced machines and booming businesses that make it happen.\n\nThe significance of the food industry can further be seen from the fact that the food service segment hit a whopping $2.4 trillion mark in 2022, and is expected to continue to grow and reach $5.4 trillion by 2030 - this is a growth marked by a CAGR of staggering 10.79%, according to Fortune Business Insights!\n\nAccording to the United Nations Organization, the growing global population, expected to reach 9.7 billion by 2050, is one of the key drivers of the food industry. As the population increases, the demand for food products also rises, creating opportunities for companies in the food industry. The growth of Asia’s economies, especially China and India, is creating enormous new consumer markets. By 2030, PwC predicts that the purchasing power of the E7 economies will overtake that of the G7.\n\nWhile the current output is already unsustainable, the growing population signals increasing challenges in years to come. In light of increasing prosperity and people, agricultural production will need to increase by 70% to feed the world’s people by 2050, according to PwC. Companies and governments have been trying every trick under their belt to secure additional resources like energy, land, and water to feed their growing populations. For this reason, these entities have been relying on new technologies, corporate acquisitions, and even diplomatic relations.\n\nWhile these shifts have led to companies expanding globally, in search of low-cost suppliers and bigger markets, it has also come with its own challenges. Globalization is increasing food safety and quality risks and is making traceability and control over supply chains more challenging. With the regulations now stricter than ever, food companies are having to spend millions of dollars on the integration of their supply chains to improve safety and traceability. At the same time, governments are issuing policy and strategic announcements to encourage the integration of supply chains to assist in making improvements.\n\nWith the growing intricacies, companies have been coming up with innovative ideas to capture this expanding market. Two such companies are Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). In April 2024, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) announced a game-changing delivery subscription through which customers will be able to order unlimited grocery deliveries on orders over $35, at a monthly payment of just $9.99, according to Reuters. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also offers a lower-value version of this subscription for an even lower price of $4.99 per month without premium membership. This might be a direct competition for Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) which already has a similar program known as Plus membership, which is available to users at $12.95 a month, or $98 per year. To respond to the competition, Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) has also added new perks to its membership in the last month, like up to five free months of Apple Music, up to four free months of Apple Fitness Plus, and two free months of Xbox Game Pass.\n\nStory continues\n\nMethodology\n\nFor the purpose of this ranking, we scoured through the food industry and picked 15 companies with the largest market caps.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

        "title": "Wall Street praises Spotify price hikes — and notes other audio streamers should follow suit",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) shares have surged as Wall Street bulls continue to praise the company's outlook on the heels of fresh price hikes for its premium US subscription plans. The stock is up about 70% since the start of the year.\n\nThe upcoming price hikes, which begin in July and are between $1 and $3, depending on the plan, follow previous hikes of certain plans implemented last summer. Analysts say the move could mean more increases for other music streamers — much to the chagrin of consumers.\n\n\"Given the size of these Spotify increases (9% to 18%) and the frequency (second time in less than a year), we believe other [streamers] should follow suit,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note published earlier this week. Still, competitors \"may not have the same pricing power as Spotify and may be more reluctant broadly.\"\n\nSpotify's family plan will rise to $19.99 per month from $16.99. Duo plans, which allow two users to share an account, will increase by $2 to $16.99. Spotify Premium subscriptions will now cost $11.99 a month, an increase of $1.\n\nSwinburne, who boasts a $370 price target and Overweight rating on shares, said the upcoming hikes \"are larger and earlier than forecasted.\" This suggests potential upside to average revenue per user and revenue growth in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We believe Spotify's strong engagement levels and industry low churn should allow it to execute these increases and still deliver on net adds expectations,\" he said.\n\nTo compare, Apple Music's (AAPL) individual plan costs $10.99 a month, while its family plan sits at $16.99. It's only raised prices once, in October 2022. Meanwhile, YouTube Music (GOOGL, GOOG) boasts the same costs for its respective plans, although it's also an included option for customers who subscribe to YouTube Premium, which carries a monthly cost of $13.99.\n\nSimilarly, Amazon Music (AMZN) is free with a $14.99 Prime membership but Prime members who want access to the Amazon Music Unlimited plan will have to pay an additional $9.99 a month. The individual plan costs $10.99 for non-Prime members, while the monthly family plan clocks in at $14.99.\n\nSpotify 'has pricing power'\n\nSpotify turned a profit in the first quarter and beat on most of its key metrics. It also guided to higher revenue and operating income for the current quarter.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to price increases in addition to multiple rounds of layoffs and other initiatives to improve profitability. The company said it would be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the company's first quarter earnings call in April, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek hinted at plans to raise prices again after last year's hikes \"had minimal impacts on growth.\" He also confirmed the platform will offer various subscription tiers to attract as many users as possible, including a music-only tier and an audiobook-only tier.\n\n\"The more value we create, the more ability we will have to then capture some of that value by price increases,\" Ek said at the time. The Spotify logo hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange with American and Swiss flags as the company lists its stock with a direct listing in New York, April 3, 2018. (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who reiterated his Overweight rating on shares and boosted his price target to $375 from $365, said he believes the price increases will result in \"favorable unit economics for Spotify.\"\n\n\"Spotify cited churn in-line with expectations & better than expected gross adds following 2023 price increases, suggesting the company has pricing power,\" Anmuth wrote on Monday. \"Spotify’s deep data & strong content curation, personalization, discovery, & ubiquity are best-in-class & hard to replicate, making it unappealing for consumers to switch platforms.\"\n\nAccording to market research firm Antenna, fewer than 1.5% of Spotify subscribers canceled their subscription plans in April. Its average churn rate has hovered around 2% since the start of the year.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect a more normalized cadence of price increases across the music streaming industry,\" Anmuth said. \"We believe that Spotify maintains longterm pricing power given the company’s reach (615M monthly active users, 239M Premium Subscribers), leading market share, & ability to improve & expand its product offering.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Warren Buffett has been outperforming the stock market for many decades. He’s shared many insights along his journey that have captivated investors as they try to pinpoint corporations with the potential to outpace the market.\n\nWhile investors can do their research and predict which stocks will outperform, they can also look at Warren Buffett’s portfolio for some answers. The famed investor has done well for many years, and knowing what’s in his portfolio may help you beat the stock market. These are some of the most undervalued Warren Buffett stocks worth considering.\n\nAmerican Express (AXP) an American Express (AXP) credit card sticking out of someone's pocket\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) is a top-tier credit and debit card issuer that trades at a 19 P/E ratio and offers a 1.2% yield. Buffett has been investing in AXP stock for decades. He’s been rewarded with a 25% year-to-date gain on his position and a 5-year gain of 92%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe fintech firm is attracting younger generations. More than 60% of the new account openings in Q1 2024 came from Millennials and Gen Z consumers. American Express also reported 11% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth and 34% YOY net income growth in the quarter.\n\nAmerican Express has maintained an impressive annualized dividend growth rate of 10.51% over the past decade. Rising profit margins support additional dividend hikes and can make the stock’s valuation even more attractive for long-term investors.\n\nInvestors should be excited about the company’s multi-year growth plans. Leadership plans to achieve revenue growth of 9% to 11% beyond 2026 while having an EPS growth rate in the mid-teens.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWarren Buffett doesn’t have many tech stocks, which is jarring for someone who has outperformed the stock market for so long, but he has plenty of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) shares. This member of the Magnificent Seven is up 22% year-to-date and has doubled over the past five years.\n\nThe company posted solid top and bottom line results to start 2024. Q1 2024 net income more than tripled YOY while net sales were up 13% YOY. Domestic and international sales both maintained double-digit growth rates while Amazon Web Services’ growth accelerated.\n\nAmazon’s cloud computing segment should exhibit more growth moving forward as corporations rush to use artificial intelligence. The company’s streaming, advertising and grocery segments also propelled the stock higher.\n\nEven though Amazon is expanding across numerous verticals, online marketplace sales remain the company’s dominant revenue source. Amazon has masterfully reinvested its capital into other areas and has rewarded shareholders as a result.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoody’s (MCO) A Moody's Corporation (MCO) sign in silver.\n\nSource: Daniel J. Macy / Shutterstock.com\n\nMoody’s (NYSE:MCO) is another fintech company that made it to the list of undervalued Warren Buffett stocks. The Oracle of Omaha’s portfolio is filled with finance companies that have generated long-term returns for its investors.\n\nMoody’s is a risk assessment firm that offers software for various businesses. The firm has delivered a meager 5% year-to-date return but has more than doubled over the past five years. Shares trade at a 44 P/E ratio and offer a 0.84% yield. Moody’s has maintained an annualized dividend growth rate of 12.42% over the past decade.\n\nThe company’s profit margin was once again above 30% in the latest quarter. Moody’s reported 21% YOY revenue growth in Q1 2024. Diluted EPS increased 16% YOY to reach $3.15. The firm projects diluted EPS to range from $9.55 to $10.15 per share in fiscal 2024. Moody’s Investors Service revenue was one of the bright spots that grew by 35% YOY.\n\nOn this date of publication, Marc Guberti held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Cathie Wood stocks may not have as many fans today as when Wood’s Ark Invest funds were putting the markets to absolute shame back in 2020. Undoubtedly, Wood may be a seasoned investor with intriguing viewpoints on disruptive innovation and the markets as a whole.\n\nThere’s no arguing that Ark Investment Management found itself in the right place at the right time in 2020. The Federal Reserve slashed rates while many people were couped up at home during lockdown, thinking Covid-19 would keep us homebound for the long haul. But as the economy reopened and investors anticipated higher rates, disruptive innovation went out of style about as quickly as it came into fashion.\n\nUntil now, the Cathie Wood stocks haven’t gained much ground since the market bottomed out around a year ago. But what about once investors get pumped up about the rate cuts to come?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCould we be in for 2020-21 all over again? It’s tough to tell. Either way, the following Cathie Wood stocks seem too cheap to pass up, given the potential catalysts ahead.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A stack of bitcoin tokens ahead of the Coinbase logo.\n\nSource: Useacoin / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) is the new captain of the flagship ARK Innovation Fund (NYSEARCA:ARKK) after doing more than its fair share of the heavy lifting in the past year.\n\nThe popular crypto exchange platform has really been enjoying higher Bitcoin (BTC-USD) and renewed interest in other crypto assets. At writing, COIN stock is up a jarring 345% in the past year. That explosive momentum tops even the great Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) for performance over the past year.\n\nAs the page turns on the first half of 2024, the blistering performance could certainly reverse course. A cooldown period is definitely needed after such a scorching run. Fortunately, I don’t view COIN stock as insanely overvalued at 36.3 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). It’s not even at all-time highs yet!\n\nCoinbase will likely over earn in “crypto spring and summer,” and underearn in “crypto winter.” However, I continue to view COIN stock as a superior long-term investment to Bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency itself — especially as crypto summer stands to heat up in time for real summer.\n\nFurther, Coinbase isn’t just a beneficiary of increased crypto trading; the company is building the blockchain infrastructure of the future. Given this, I’d argue that Coinbase should garner interest in the crypto asset class, not the other way around.\n\nRoku (ROKU) ROKU Stock Will Continue Benefitting From the TCL Partnership\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoku (NASDAQ:ROKU) remains a fairly sizeable holding in the flagship ARKK ETF, even after dragging in recent quarters. Over the past two years, ROKU is down more than 37%. At this juncture, the streaming underdog seems destined to stay in the doghouse for longer, especially as the firm struggles to push into sustained profitability.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Roku’s financials may not be glimmering, perhaps most investors aren’t viewing the firm in the same light as Cathie Wood. The company behind popular streaming sticks could benefit greatly as interest rates begin to fall. This would reduce the weight of debts and trim borrowing costs, allowing Roku to spend more to regain an edge in the streaming world.\n\nAs streamers look to live sports as an arena to attract viewers, I think Roku has a chance to swing for a grand slam. Just last month, Roku began streaming MLB matches exclusively on its platform via The Roku Channel for free. Indeed, offering free sports will not only help fire back at streaming rivals, it could deliver a gut-punch to cable TV while it’s already on the ropes.\n\nI think free sports will be a home run among viewers. As more consumers cut costs, perhaps it makes more sense to ditch subscriptions and tune into the Roku Channel, especially if you’re a casual baseball fan.\n\nTeledoc (TDOC) The Teladoc logo through a magnifying glass.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nTeledoc (NASDAQ:TDOC) isn’t just a pandemic bubble that many investors have long forgotten about. Though Ark Invest has reduced its stake considerably (by 399,982 shares in May) in recent months, Wood and company remain large investors in the firm, and I don’t see that changing anytime soon.\n\nThe medium-term outlook has been cloudier following the departure of CEO Jason Gorevic a few months ago. As the hunt for a permanent new top boss continues, questions linger about the fate of upper management amid what can only be described as a horrid rough patch for the firm.\n\nEven if digital doctor visits won’t eclipse lockdown-era levels, Teledoc remains one of the most undervalued top dogs in the telemedicine industry. At just 0.7 price-to-sales (P/S) and 0.82 price-to-book (P/B), Teledoc shares are basically going for bargain-basement prices.\n\nMoving forward, Teledoc could have an opportunity to really jolt its offering as it teams up with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to bring its services to Alexa. Perhaps a furthering of its collaboration with the AI-savvy Magnificent Seven firm could help TDOC stock rise out of its rut.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of AMZN.

That said, there are some stocks that you can buy and hold for the next decade that could make a notable difference in the growth of your nest egg.\n\nHere are two such names. Consider investing $10,000 into each of these stocks, and they could help you retire a millionaire.\n\nAmazon will continue enjoying e-commerce and cloud tailwinds\n\nWhat a business Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is. The company started by selling books online in the mid-1990s and is today's dominant e-commerce retailer, with a roughly 38% market share in the United States. Perhaps even more impressive is that Amazon followed up this whopper of an opening act with Amazon Web Services, which has become the world's largest cloud infrastructure platform with a 31% global market share.\n\nThe company has been a very successful long-term investment. A $10,000 investment into Amazon stock in its early days would be worth over $18 million now. Of course, Amazon is now worth nearly $2 trillion, so there's just no room in the global economy for it to increase in size and value by that magnitude again. However, the company does still have enough upside to justify a $10,000 investment today. Amazon's bread-and-butter segments, e-commerce and cloud computing, have plenty of room to grow. E-commerce is still just 16% of retail in America. Meanwhile, the surge in artificial intelligence investments worldwide should mean big things for Amazon and other cloud platforms. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nA massive company like Amazon must also be trading at the right valuation in order to have the potential to generate additional big returns. Let's check that box off. If you value Amazon based on its operating cash flow -- in other words, the cash it generates from its normal business activities before investing in itself in pursuit of future growth -- shares are about as cheap as they've been in the past decade (as the chart above shows). This winner is poised to keep winning, so don't shy away from including it in your long-term investment plans.\n\nNetflix has proven itself in the growing streaming industry\n\nIt's not easy breaking new ground or creating new industries. Companies that try to are often beset by a lot of doubters, and Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) has definitely had its share of them over the years. However, the streaming pioneer is the global king of streaming today, with over 270 million paid subscriptions as of the end of the first quarter. Memberships grew 16% year over year in Q1, which shows there is still plenty of room for it to grow as people worldwide steadily shift from cable television to streaming.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnd when a company becomes as large as Netflix has, there are plenty of tricks it can use to squeeze earnings growth out of the business. In addition to simply growing its subscriber base, Netflix can raise prices, crack down on password sharing (which has been hugely successful), and branch out into new content and media formats. The company has steadily waded into live sports content and is testing out video games now that technology has advanced enough for it to stream games through the cloud. NFLX EPS LT Growth Estimates Chart\n\nNetflix shares have handily outperformed the broader market for the past decade. But the company seems poised to deliver more years of strong earnings growth. Shares trade at 35 times earnings today, but analysts believe that its profits will grow at an annualized rate of more than 28% for the next three to five years. That should make the stock attractive for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Cheapest Country To Live Under $1000/month",
        "content": "We recently prepared a comprehensive report of 15 Cheapest Countries to Live Under $1000/Month. In this free report, we have discussed each country in detail.\n\nIn this article, we list and discuss the top cheapest country to live in under $1000/month.\n\nAccording to the Census Bureau, between 2021 and 2022, inflation rose by 7.8% in the United States, which was the largest annual increase in the cost of living ever recorded since 1981. While the post-COVID wave of inflation is finally settling down in the country, affordable living is still out of the question for many Americans across the country. According to the Census Household Pulse Survey (HPS), 36.2% or over 79.4 million adults in the US find difficulty paying for the usual household expenses.\n\nWhile the US has the strongest economy in the world, citizens of the country are experiencing a rise in the costs of many necessities, like food, housing, and education, making it difficult to attain economic security. Moreover, the United States has the most expensive healthcare in the world, with per capita spending of $12,553 on healthcare topped with no Universal health coverage (UHC). Subsequently, it ranks lowest among the leading industrialized and high-income countries, according to a report published by the Commonwealth Fund.\n\nFurthermore, the US has the most expensive education system in the world, where the average student pays an annual tuition fee of $27,091. The country also has one of the most complicated tax systems worldwide, where US taxpayers spend an average of 13 hours and $240 just to prepare their tax returns, as stated by Senator Elizabeth Warren. Although the tax rate system in the United States is not as bad as other OECD countries, many American households still live in harder financial conditions and rely on credit card debt, which reached $17.5 trillion in 2023.\n\nGiven this backdrop, it's not unexpected that a survey conducted by Monmouth University between February 8, 2024, and February 12, 2024, found that 34% of the participants wanted to settle in another country, which is an increase of 24% from 1974. Despite the growing desire to move out of the US, a cost-effective lifestyle, the American quality of life, and opportunities present within the US are not guaranteed in countries with relatively cheaper costs of living. Therefore, many citizens decide to move out during their retirement instead — 5 million retirees have already done so. Additionally, according to a survey by Aegon published in 2021, living abroad is a retirement ambition for 12% of Americans.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven so, digital nomads do stand a chance to make the move early on if they wish to do so, thanks to the growing freelance industry and remote work culture. Speaking of remote work and freelancing, Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK), an American freelancing platform that connects businesses with independent workers, reported that there were 64 million Americans, or 38% of the total US workforce, that worked as freelancers in 2023, which is an increase of 4 million freelancers from 2022. Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) is playing a significant role in helping individuals earn in US dollars while they work from anywhere in the world as long as they have an Internet connection. As of 2024, Upwork Inc (NASDAQ:UPWK) study finds data analytics and machine learning as the most in-demand skills.\n\nMeanwhile, remote jobs have also been on the rise since COVID, as many people have now grown accustomed to a WFH lifestyle, and understand its pros. Moreover, some of the leading companies in the US like American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) and Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) have employees all over the globe, which helps facilitate the dreams of many people to work with more flexibility, from anywhere in the world.\n\nAmerican Express Company (NYSE:AXP), the key player in the credit card industry, has operations across 110 countries and over 60,000 employees working full and part-time. Before COVID, approximately 20% of the US workforce in American Express Company (NYSE:AXP) were already working virtually. In 2022, the company officially launched Amex Flex, offering flexibility for employees to work for up to 4 calendar weeks from anywhere in the world each year.\n\nOn the other hand, Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), a leading American technology and e-commerce corporation, has over 1 million employees across the globe. Andy Jassy, the CEO of Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN) CEO, is pressing on the company's return-to-office policy, requiring corporate employees to work on-site for three days a week. However, there are some fully remote roles where employees can work full-time from anywhere around the world.\n\nOverall, all three of these companies enable not just digital nomads to work from anywhere in the world and live where they want to, but they also allow retirees to return to work on their own terms if they wish to. Below, we list the cheapest countries to live in with a monthly cost of living below $1000.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our list of the 15 Cheapest Countries to Live under $1000/Month, we utilized various sources across the web, including blogs, Quora, Reddit, YouTube, and two of our own previous articles (20 Countries With The Cheapest Cost Of Living For US Citizens and 25 Cheapest Countries in the World) to compile a pool of 50 most affordable countries to live in for US citizens. We then utilized 2 more sources (1,2), to find the cost of living in these countries for one individual who wishes to attain a comfortable lifestyle on a budget. To get more accurate with our data, we aggregated these cost of living figures and then shortlisted the top 15. The list is in ascending order of monthly living costs in USD for each country. Living costs include the average monthly rent for a studio apartment in the city center, groceries, gym memberships, bills, utilities, healthcare, and all other basic necessities to afford a comfortable American lifestyle in these countries.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Pakistan is home to the second-highest mountain, K2, as well as the three highest mountain ranges in the world: Hindukush, Karakoram, and Himalayas.

        "title": "The 7 Most Undervalued Under-$50 Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "For many investors, especially those who are just building a portfolio, undervalued stocks under $50 hold significant appeal. Investors can start a significant position, in terms of shares owned, for a small investment. But as every investor knows, price and value aren’t the same thing.\n\nWhen many investors think about undervalued stocks, they look for specific metrics. Some investors may examine technical signals, for example, like a stock trading near its 52-week low. Others may search for a favorable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. However, there are times when stocks that appear to be overvalued may actually be undervalued.\n\nThis article looks at seven undervalued stocks under $50 that are undervalued either by conventional metrics or simply because they still have significant upside potential.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDigitalBridge Group (DBRG) Picture of a highway system with business statistics on top of it. Infrastructure stocks.\n\nSource: ekapol sirachainan / Shutterstock\n\nIn a digital world, there’s a strong case to be made for DigitalBridge Group (NYSE:DBRG). The global alternative asset manager focuses on investing in digital infrastructure. In 2024, that includes data centers which will house the artificial intelligence (AI) applications that will lead this next technology revolution.\n\nIn fact, DigitalBridge Group has the third largest independent global data center footprint. And, that footprint is about to get significantly larger. The company plans to build five times the number of data centers than its’s built in the last 30 years to keep up with demand.\n\nBut is the stock undervalued at 53x forward earnings? It may be. And that’s based on the company’s business model that focuses on fee related earnings. These contracted revenue streams provide the company predictable, growing revenue.\n\nIn the company’s Investor Day presentation in March, the company noted that its fee related earnings jumped 141% year-over-year (YOY). Plus, the company reported a 36% YOY compound annual growth rate (CAGR) in its fee earning equity under management (FEEUM).\n\nCentral Garden & Pet (CENT) Abstract blurred hardware store aisle with garden goods as background\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCentral Garden & Pet (NASDAQ:CENT) is another company that, at first glance, might not seem to belong on a list of undervalued stocks under $50. CENT stock is up 76% in the last 12 months and 31% through the first five months of 2024.\n\nAs its name says, the company focuses on two key segments – Pets and Lawn & Garden. Despite challenges in both sectors, both are evergreen categories that contribute to the company’s revenue.\n\nHowever, the story at the moment has less to do with revenue, which was down slightly YOY in its March earnings report. Yet, the company showed strength in every other key segment related to profitability and is taking steps to streamline the business, which should add to the bottom line in coming years. Also, it reaffirmed its guidance for the full year. Plus, the stock trades at about 18x forward earnings, which is a slight discount in the consumer discretionary sector.\n\nStory continues\n\nClean Energy Fuels (CLNE) CLNE stock: Image of a Metro Local public transportation bus on Hollywood Blvd.\n\nSource: ZikG / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs the world continues to transition away from fossil fuels, many investors are learning that clean energy goes well beyond wind and solar. Clean Energy Fuels (NASDAQ:CLNE) is one of the world’s leading suppliers of renewable natural gas (RNG). The company has tremendous relevance as businesses strive to meet the federal government’s carbon emission goals.\n\nSpecifically, Clean Energy Fuels supplies RNG as well as liquified natural gas (LNG) and compressed natural gas (CNG) for medium and heavy-duty vehicles. Its customer base includes names such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), FedEx (NYSE:FDX) and Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO). The company has a network of over 600 natural gas fueling stations across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nWhat investors take away from the company’s recent earnings reports is that RNG is likely to face the same supply-demand variables as conventional gasoline. That may provide some short-term headwinds. Also, investors have to be comfortable with the fact that Clean Energy Fuels is not yet profitable and won’t be anytime soon.\n\nBut this is, potentially, a large addressable market. And analysts are firmly behind CLNE stock. Seven out of eight analysts give it a strong buy rating and it has a consensus price target of $7.31 which gives the stock 142% upside.\n\nUranium Energy (UEC) CCJ Stock: Hand in long yellow glove holding a chunk of uranium material\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/RHJPhtotoandilustration\n\nSticking with the clean energy theme, we come to Uranium Energy (NYSEAMERICAN:UEC). The company wasn’t supposed to be undervalued at this point in 2024. Many analysts expected an explosion in uranium prices as the year started. But that rally has reversed, and like oil prices, uranium prices have disappointed.\n\nThat’s likely to change after the Biden administration’s decision to ban Russian uranium imports. In the long term, central governments are becoming more intentional about delivering clean energy solutions, nuclear energy stands out as the only truly clean energy solution.\n\nNevertheless, this is a highly regulated business and growth won’t move in a straight line. This is evident in Uranium Energy’s financials. Revenue is down sharply YOY which shows that the market is well supplied. Analysts are also forecasting a 75% decline in earnings per share in the next 12 months.\n\nHowever, that’s not dampening analyst sentiment for now. All five analysts that have issued ratings for UEC stock give it a strong buy rating with a consensus price target of over $10 that implies an improvement of over 67%.\n\nRevolution Medicines (RVMD) Photo of test tubes and droplet with purple and reddish-orange sunset visual effect, representing biotech\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Romix Image\n\nIf you’re a swing for the fences kind of investor, Revolution Medicines (NASDAQ:RVMD) may be just what you’re looking for. The clinical-stage company is focused on developing cancer treatments specific to RAS(ON) proteins. This an area that has been resistant to current oncology drug treatments. The company’s drug candidates directly inhibit these proteins from getting into their active state. This drives the “formation of a novel tri-complex and blocking oncogenic signaling.”\n\nRVMD stock plunged sharply after it had a setback with some clinical trial data in October 2023. But the company is amply funded after its acquisition of EQRx and has a deep pipeline. This is one you’ll have to wait on as the clinical trial process is expensive and can’t be rushed.\n\nAs a company that’s not yet profitable and has limited revenue coming through the door, valuations can be tricky. Nevertheless, analysts remain bullish on RVMD stock with 12 out of 13 analysts giving the stock a strong buy rating.\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (BMY) Bristol-Myers Squib (BMY) logo displayed on a phone screen\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nBristol-Myers Squibb (NYSE:BMY) is a more conventional biopharmaceutical company on this list of undervalued stocks under $50. The company has a massive pipeline of existing and clinical-stage oncology drugs. However, investors are a little sour on BMY stock due to concern over expiring patents.\n\nHowever, this is where size makes a difference. As a large-cap company, Bristol-Myers has the ability to acquire companies and that’s exactly what it’s been doing. However, that’s come with a short-term hit to the company’s earnings. That is one reason to explain the post-earnings dip in BMY stock.\n\nThe bottom line should improve as the company bring more drugs to market. Plus, the company has an initiative that will help make drugs more accessible in low- and middle-income countries.\n\nIn the short term, BMY stock is trading at a five-year low which simply seems like an overreaction. Analysts have a consensus Hold rating on the stock, but a bullish price target suggests that this is a dip you’ll want to buy, particularly when you get a dividend with a yield of 5.8% while you wait.\n\nFive9 (FIVN) photo illustration of the Five9 logo seen displayed on a smartphone\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nFive9 (NASDAQ:FIVN) is an under-the-radar AI stock to consider before other investors catch on. The company provides cloud contact center software. Unlike traditional call centers, contact center software gives companies a tool to manage customer interactions across a variety of channels (e.g. social media, emails, chatbots, etc.). This is a market that is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.1% between now and 2030.\n\nThat’s a nice opportunity being fueled by generative AI, but it is coming at a cost. Five9 is not profitable, in large part due to its AI investments. However, the company continues to deliver year-over-year (YOY) increases in new and annual recurring (ARR) revenue.\n\nThat trend will have to continue if the company is going to become profitable. In the meantime, it’s important to note that 96% of FIVN stock is owned by institutions. That should help keep volatility down while still offering plenty of upside for one of the undervalued stocks under $50.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Utility Stocks That Are Even Hotter AI Plays Than Nvidia",
        "content": "Utility stocks weren’t the best investment in 2023. Despite reporting decent earnings and offering solid dividend increases, the utility sector lost about 10% last year compared to a 26% gain in the S&P 500.\n\nIn fact, if it wasn’t for dividends, utilities would have gone nowhere for the past two years. The payouts were the sector’s saving grace, underscoring why income investors repeatedly turn to these stocks. Dividends are why utilities have long been considered widows-and-orphans investments. You can always count on their income stream.\n\nBut 2024 is shaping up as a far different story. Utilities are one of the hottest plays around and are even outperforming the broad market index. This year, the sector is only behind tech and telecom stocks as the leading investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the primary reason for the turnaround. Not only does AI require vast amounts of computing power, but it puts enormous demands on energy consumption. The Energy Information Administration says data centers are “one of the most energy-intensive building types, consuming 10 to 50 times the energy per floor space of a typical commercial office building.”\n\nUtilities are now using AI to reduce the very high energy demands it is causing. While AI chips from Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are a foundational basis for the technology, the AI trade is now moving far beyond those narrow confines. Investors should look to utility stocks to play the next leg higher in the AI industrial revolution.\n\nEntergy (ETR) 5 Utility Stocks to Buy for an Extra Durable Portfolio. undervalued utilities stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEntergy (NYSE:ETR) provides electricity to the Southeast. It is arguably one of the best-positioned utilities to capitalize on data center AI demands. Electricity costs are lower in the region than in much of the country. That’s key because the Electric Reliability Council of Texas recently said it expects a dramatic increase in electricity demand in the state over the next five years. The state’s electric grid could see some 152 gigawatts of demand by 2030, or double the level placed on it only four years ago.\n\nEntergy is investing billions of dollars to upgrade its infrastructure. In Louisiana, for example, the utility intends to invest $1.9 billion in the first phase of its grid there to make it more resilient. The plan includes 2,100 projects that will reinforce critical structures in its transmission and distribution systems. Entergy also spends $1.46 billion on its 754-gigawatt (GW) Legend Power Station in southeast Texas.\n\nOf course, Entergy faces one risk: storms in the Gulf Coast region. Hurricanes can cause billions of dollars in damage. Investors should consider if this risk is worth it. Entergy stock trades at 11 times trailing earnings and less than twice revenue. Look for ETR to be a unique AI stock to buy.\n\nStory continues\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) The NextEra Energy (NEE) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov/Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Entergy, NextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) is located in the Southeast and benefits from the region’s cost advantages. The utility stock has also invested heavily in renewable energy to become the world’s largest generator of wind and sun energy and a top-tier participant in battery storage.\n\nNextEra Energy is also building out its project portfolio despite having substantial assets already in play. The utility has 65 GW of energy capacity at its disposal, some 36 GW of which comes from renewable sources. NextEra continues to add to it each quarter. There is about 3.5 GW of data center capacity and another nearly 3.5 GW in its backlog. It also has a pipeline of 250 gigawatts of renewables and storage in various stages of development.\n\nThe Florida-based utility runs some of the same risks as Entergy concerning severe weather. Although its stock has already seen tremendous gains this year, up 26% in 2024 and 63% over the past 12 months, the growth in AI demand suggests this utility stock is only just getting started in lighting up its capital appreciation opportunity.\n\nSouthern (SO) the southern company logo displayed several times on a screen\n\nSource: 360b / Shutterstock.com\n\nSouthern (NYSE:SO) is the third utility stock investors should buy to capitalize on the AI boom. And if you’re sensing a trend about location here, you’re not wrong. Hyperscalers are flocking to the Southeast, so utilities here are primed to win investments.\n\nAlphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google is building ​​a $600 million data center in a former semiconductor manufacturing facility in Tennessee. Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) recently announced it was building a new $800 million data center campus in Montgomery, Alabama. The Midwest is also a focus of new data center construction, with Google, Meta, and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) building new facilities there.\n\nSouthern, though, is also investing in new projects to expand its generation capacity. However, it is focusing on nuclear energy. It put its Plant Vogtle Unit 3 into operation last July and just started up Unit 4 at the end of April.\n\nLike NextEra, Southern’s stock has been part of the utility group driving the sector higher. Shares are up 14% this year and 30% above their lows. With the data center construction explosion, expect the utility stock to brighten up your portfolio.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When times get tough, invest in resilient growth stocks. These are the companies with strong revenue and earnings growth. They’re the ones that are reinvesting their earnings for growth instead of distributing it as a dividend. In fact, when it comes to investing in growth stocks, investors aren’t typically after dividends. They just want exposure to exponential growth.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Stefon Walters noted, “Growth stocks are companies expected to outperform the U.S. stock market (generally using the S&P 500 as a proxy) because of their potential for high earnings growth. This growth potential is largely why growth stocks have been the darlings of the market for quite a while now. After all, why wouldn’t investors take a liking to companies that can produce market-beating returns?”\n\nHere are just a few of the most resilient growth stocks you may want to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the top growth stocks to buy and hold.\n\nSince bottoming out around $60 in late 2022, AMD hit a high of $227.30. Now consolidating at $166.77, I’d like to see AMD initially retest its prior high, especially with the artificial intelligence boom just starting to get hot.\n\nHelping, AMDjust unveiled its latest AI chips, intensifying its competition against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThat includes the Instinct MI325X accelerators, which are planned for availability in the fourth quarter. All as the “race to develop generative artificial intelligence programs has led to towering demand for the advanced chips used in AI data centers able to support these complex applications,” says Reuters.\n\nIn addition, the company introduced an upcoming series of chips titled MI350, which is expected to be available in 2025. AMD said the MI350 will likely perform 35 times better in inference, the process of computing generative AI responses.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors may also want to pay close attention to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), even with its countless issues. Down but not out, it could benefit from reaccelerating electric vehicle (EV) sales this year.\n\nFor 2024, EV industry sales are expected to increase anywhere from 20% to 30%. Plus, according to Michelle Krebs, executive auto analyst for Cox, “EV sales are increasing faster than any other segment in the industry.”\n\nBetter, TSLA sales could accelerate with the potential for newer, cheaper electric vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs noted in a first-quarter earnings report, “We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” the company added.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a no-brainer when it comes to resilient growth stocks to buy. Since bottoming out in early 2023 at around $220, MSFT is now up to $424.52 and could see higher highs. For one, the software company has evolved into a tech giant with its operating systems, cloud services, game consoles and artificial intelligence.\n\nTwo, the company is launching its first artificial intelligence personal computer product, the Surface model laptop with built-in AI capabilities.\n\nThree, as noted by Investorplace’s Louis Navallier:\n\n“The company may be just starting to monetize its AI technology within its customer-facing segment, but AI integration has already had a major impact on Azure’s fiscal performance. Last quarter, Azure revenue was up 31% because of this factor.”\n\nAll are serving as significant catalysts for future growth at Microsoft. Even better, analysts believe Microsoft could grow its EPS by about 13.8% a year over the next three to five years.\n\nSchwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) charles schwab sign outside of a building. SCHD stock\n\nSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also find resiliency with exchange-traded funds (ETF) like the Schwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHG). With an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF offers exposure to 249 holdings and tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEven better, if I wanted to buy 100 shares of the SCHG ETF, it would cost me $9,726, which is far less than buying just one of its 249 holdings. Not only does the ETF offer me solid diversification, it does so at a low price.\n\nEven better, since its inception, the ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) image of vanguard website to represent index funds to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot growth stock ETF to buy and hold is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index in an attempt to match the performance of the nation’s top 200 growth stocks. Some of its top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nSince bottoming out in early 2023 at around $210, the VUG ETF is now up to $361.50. From here, given the growing demand for growth stocks, I’d like to see the ETF closer to $400 this year. Even better, the VUG ETF is seeing massive inflows. According to BNK Invest, the VUG ETF recently saw an inflow of about $1.3 billion, a 1.1% increase from the prior week.\n\nIn addition, according to TipRanks, “The VUG ETF has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 200 stocks held, 173 have Buys and 27 have a Hold rating.”\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is another strong growth stock to buy on a recent dip.\n\nAfter running from about $410 to a high of $490, Mastercard slipped to $440. All of that happened after cutting guidance and better-than-expected earnings. However, MA did find strong double-bottom support at $440 and is starting to bounce, last trading at $448.68.\n\nFrom that price, I’d like to see Mastercard initially retest its prior high of $490.\n\nHelping, analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) just initiated an Overweight rating on MA. The firm cited MA’s “scale, hard-to-replicate networks, and fintech ecosystem partnerships, all tied to sustainable secular growth within digital payments.”\n\nThe firm added that “Mastercard should be able to boost revenue by 11% this year and by 12.7% in FY204, driven by 9.5%/13.5% payment network revenue growth and value-added services and solutions growth of 13.7%/11.5% in FY24/FY25.”\n\nWe also have to remember that more Americans are heavily dependent on credit cards these days. As noted by Fox Business, “35% of Americans said they have maxed out their credit cards in recent years. Of those who had maxed out their credit cards, 85% said they were pushed to use their cards to the limit because of price increases from inflation.”\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top resilient growth stocks to buy and hold is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).\n\nFor one, it’s a leader in zero trust and cloud cybersecurity trading at less than growth. Second, it just unveiled multiple innovations to its “AI Data Protection Platform that leverage the world’s largest security cloud and the power of AI,” as noted by the company.\n\nThat includes its Gen AI App Security, offering “context-rich user and risk correlation, providing insights into risky prompts, AI app usage and granular policy controls,” reported TechnologyMagazine. The feature is reportedly critical, as the “adoption of AI technologies continues to accelerate, presenting new security challenges.”\n\nTwo, recent earnings were solid. In its third quarter, earnings per share of 88 cents beat estimates by 23 cents. Revenue of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year over year, beat by $17.6 million. Moving forward, Zscaler forecasts revenue of $565 million to $567 million, a possible growth of $12.8 million at the mid-point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "When the rulebook of the game changes every second, a few companies are reimagining and bringing some radical products to market. These are not only changing the game for the industries they are venturing into but also turning out to be great long-term investment bets.\n\nThe electric vehicle (EV) market is redefining our lifestyle at a lightning pace. Companies leading the revolution are not just driving this broad-scope change but are also offering excellent investment opportunities. From pioneering leaps in luxury EVs to breakthroughs in electric adventure vehicles, these EV giants have set the stage for the future.\n\nAs they change the face of their respective industries, they offer a unique chance to get on board for growth and innovation. Here are three leading stocks that are not just revolutionizing the future but are also changing the game in your portfolio right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air car of Lucid Automotive (LCID) Manufacturer at the event, EV Lucid Car Showroom.\n\nSource: Khosro / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is a luxury electric vehicle maker best known for its flagship, the Lucid Air. While the vehicle has exceptional range and performance in the luxury EV segment, Lucid wants more. It aims to change the luxury EV market through cutting-edge technology and sustainable energy solutions.\n\nA steeply innovative approach and recent company expansions in its production capabilities put it on a high-growth trajectory. Its focus on increasing manufacturing efficiency and expanding its market reach, inclusive of new markets in Europe, creates further potential.\n\nLucid has a market cap of $6.54 billion and a price-to-book ratio of 1.52x, which is relatively undervalued when compared to the sector median of 2.16x. The company also booked revenues of $608 million in the last fiscal year. Yahoo Finance analysts have an average one-year price target of around $3.00, creating ample room to grow from current levels.\n\nThese numbers highlight an encouraging financial position. Coupled with the fact the company is trading cheaply, Lucid Group stock is an attractive investment opportunity.\n\nRivian (RIVN) A new Rivian R1T truck is seen at a Rivian service center in South San Francisco, California. Rivian Automotive, (RIVN) is an electric vehicle automaker. RIVN stock price predictions\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) is a company in the off-road electrification business. The company produces trucks and sport utility vehicles with its R1T and R1S being uniquely durable and capable.\n\nRivian is driven by its strategic partners and an enormous amount of preorders at its disposal. For example, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has preordered an avalanche of electric delivery vans. This kind of confidence in Rivian shows the long-term success of the company will most likely boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Rivian, a key financial data point is its price-to-book ratio of 1.41x compared to the sector median of 2.16x. Additionally, Rivian had $1.66 billion in reported revenue in the last fiscal year. Yahoo Finance analysts have an average one-year price target of around $16.00, far above the current price of $11.74. These metrics, part of a good growth trajectory, nicely marry to the status of the stock as undervalued and make it an appealing opportunity to an investor.\n\nNio (NIO) A large NIO store sign and Chinese brand name. NIO is a Chinese EV company\n\nSource: Robert Way / Shutterstock.com\n\nNio (NYSE:NIO) is the market leader for Chinese EVs with great name recognition. The EV maker’s main selling points are smart, connected electric vehicles with innovative battery technologies and autonomous driving features. The company’s popular models include the ES8, ES6 and EC6.\n\nNio has huge growth potential with constant innovation in battery-swapping technology and its foray into markets outside China. As the company gets bigger, it consistently increases its market share.\n\nIt is still a small company with a market cap of only $10.43 billion. Looking at its valuation, Nio has an enterprise value-to-sales ratio of 1.19x compared to the sector median of 1.27x. The company managed to report revenues amounting to $7.14 billion in the last fiscal year and this is expected to grow by over 23% year over year. All these metrics point toward ample upside potential in Nio stock.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nFor a brief and marvelous time, the latest and greatest consumer services the tech economy had to offer came on the cheap, with generous subsidies from the companies themselves.\n\nJeff Bezos picked up your shipping costs. Various VC benefactors chipped in to pay for your rides, short-term rentals, and food deliveries.\n\nOthers helped pick up the tab for your TV, movies, and music. All of which now streamed directly to your device(s).\n\nYou made a contribution, of course, but in the low-interest-rate environment of easy money in the 2010s, Big Tech helped you pay.\n\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, this era could not be more over.\n\nThis week, consumers were hit with more price hikes from Max and Spotify, which took their turn in what seems like a never-ending cycle of price hikes. Recently, Comcast announced price hikes for Peacock that coincide with the Paris Olympics.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Comcast, of course, are not quite the Big Tech names synonymous with losing money to gain market share. But while you were getting a deal on all your new digitally enabled habits, these companies were scrambling to copy the same playbook.\n\nThe biggest takeaway they copied was losing money. And the rush to raise prices today shows them running in the other direction.\n\nThis next development in the industry also comes with another catch: ads. The second prong in the fork of potential profitability.\n\nAs our Alexandra Canal notes, streamers are getting more interested in ad-tier platforms and are thus incentivizing participation away from their premium (read: ad-free, another “innovation” from a bygone era) offerings despite their higher prices.\n\nNow, cord-cutters who haven’t seen an ad in years will finally learn about Buffalo Wild Wings' BOGO Thursday boneless wings and McDonald’s $5 value meal.\n\nAnd just as excitement over a paradigm shift helped usher in cheap subscriptions for all over a decade ago, the ad-supported streaming model has the potential to generate a similar level of sentiment. Sentiment that analysts note could cause ad-tier subscription prices to decline if user eyeballs become more valuable than the literal dollars they bring to the table.\n\nAs Bank of America wrote in a note to clients Thursday, despite the sector’s headwinds and years of weakness, there’s “cautious optimism” in the near term and “disruption” in the long term as the potential of in-platform shopping and ad format innovation excites executives and investors alike.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf this works, maybe these companies can finally go back to making good content.\n\nUntil then, $16.99 will give you the entire Sopranos catalog.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "title": "2 Soaring Stocks I'd Buy Now With No Hesitation",
        "content": "The stock market surged over the last year, with the Nasdaq Composite up more than 27% since last June. The growth is a welcome development after the COVID-19 pandemic and an economic downturn in 2022, which saw the same index plunge 33% during the challenging year.\n\nInvestors have grown bullish as easing inflation and advances in budding markets like artificial intelligence (AI) could spell a lucrative future for many companies.\n\nAs leaders in the consumer market with billions of loyal users, Costco Wholesale(NASDAQ: COST) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) have promising outlooks. Their stocks are up 61% and 45% respectively over the last 12 months, yet seem nowhere near hitting their ceilings. Costco is expanding rapidly and has barely scratched the surface of its venture abroad. Meanwhile, Amazon's online retail business is booming alongside heavy investment in AI.\n\nSo, here are two soaring stocks I'd buy now with no hesitation.\n\n1. Costco\n\nCostco has come a long way since its founding 40 years ago, when it opened its first store in San Diego, California. The retail giant has won over consumers worldwide with its unique model of offering access to wholesale pricing for the cost of an annual membership. COST Chart\n\nThe company's success has made it one of the best retail investments of the last five years, outperforming rivals like Amazon, Walmart, and Target in stock growth. While past gains aren't always an indication of what's to come, recent earnings suggest a lucrative future for Costco.\n\nThe retail giant posted its earnings results for the fiscal third quarter of 2024 on May 30. Revenue for the period ended May 12 popped 9% year over year to $57 billion. International sales continued to be its biggest growth driver, with revenue from abroad rising close to 9% compared to 6% domestically.\n\nCostco memberships increased by 8% to more than 74 million in Q3, a promising achievement as its worldwide renewal rate is at 90%. The company boasts 878 locations across 14 countries and is adding more every year.\n\nCostco is on an exciting growth trajectory you won't want to miss. And with a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 1.4, the company's stock is an excellent value and one I'd buy with no hesitation.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon has created more than a few bulls over the last year, rallying investors with a booming e-commerce business and an expanding role in AI.\n\nMacroeconomic headwinds in 2022 caused steep declines in consumer spending, with Amazon's retail sales hit especially hard. However, an impressive recovery has proven the reliability of the company's business model and its worth as a long-term investment.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon reported its first-quarter 2024 earnings on April 30. Revenue for the quarter increased by 13% year over year, beating analysts' forecasts by $750 million. However, the most impressive growth came in the form of operating income, which soared 221% to more than $15 billion.\n\nThe retail company's profits skyrocketed over the last year thanks to positive growth in its retail segments and cost-cutting measures. For instance, Q1 2024 saw Amazon's international segment return to profitability by achieving $903 million in operating income, significantly improving on the $1 billion in losses it posted the year before. Meanwhile, North American operating income increased 454% year over year.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce segments are rapidly expanding and show no signs of slowing. However, the best reason to consider a long-term investment in Amazon is its highly profitable cloud business, Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform holds a leading market share in cloud computing, an industry with massive growth potential amid a boom in AI.\n\nIn Q1 2024, AWS was responsible for 62% of Amazon's operating income despite earning the smallest portion of revenue between its three segments. The cloud service gives the company a powerful role in tech and AI and will likely continue to boost earnings for years. MSFT PS Ratio Chart\n\nThis chart shows Amazon's P/S is lower than many of its biggest rivals, indicating its stock could be trading at a bargain. That fact, combined with a thriving retail business and a promising position in AI, makes Amazon a no-brainer right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Costco Wholesale right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Costco Wholesale, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Costco Wholesale wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy and Hold for Decades",
        "content": "Long-term investors must think differently when evaluating stocks. Looking decades ahead is as much about preventing unnecessary risks and losses as it is about maximizing upside. Ideally, these investors strike a compromise somewhere in the middle.\n\nFinding a middle ground is going to be your best bet when it comes to artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Are you looking to ride AI to big-time portfolio gains over the coming decades? Your search should focus on the best long-term AI stocks. The best choices in this sector could be a few obscure companies no one is discussing ... or they could be some obvious AI champions that have proven ability to be winners. It's all a matter of what went into creating your investing thesis.\n\nHere are three reasons why Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) could be the best long-term AI stocks money can buy.\n\n1. They own the cloud layer of the economy\n\nThere are huge technological challenges that go into developing and operating AI models. It takes manythousands of AI chips and it involves tremendous energy consumption. A single query on ChatGPT consumes an estimated 15 times more energy than a Google search.\n\nThat expense partly explains why ChatGPT developer OpenAI struck a partnership with Microsoft. While many companies can benefit from AI technology, only a few can afford to own and operate it. Most companies getting into this sector will ultimately pay to access AI technology instead of building it for themselves.\n\nAI overlaps perfectly with cloud computing, where a few companies own and operate most of the world's cloud resources. Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet own roughly 67% of the global cloud market. Today, most of the connected world runs on this infrastructure, which makes it perfect for distributing AI technology to the masses.\n\nYou're already seeing these giant cloud companies weave AI products and services into the cloud. It just makes too much sense. Cloud dominance is a tremendous hurdle for other companies to overcome, and these three companies may continue to dominate the cloud and AI for years to come because of it.\n\n2. Deep pockets gave them a massive head start in AI\n\nIt's almost like these companies won the metaphorical lottery to become these enormous and powerful corporations, and then won again as AI emerged as a perfect fit in their existing business models. Again, the vast majority of companies cannot compete with the deep pockets Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet possess.\n\nHow much cash do these companies create? As it is, these three combined for over $184 billion in free cash flow over the past year alone. That's discretionary cash profits these businesses have to spend as they please. Note that this includes capital expenditures and business investments like, for example, buying AI chips and building out data centers.\n\nStory continues\n\nBack out those investments by looking at operating cash flow. These companies combined for over $300 billion in just one year! MSFT Cash from Operations (TTM) Chart\n\nThese companies operate hundreds of data centers worldwide and can afford to build many more to support AI demand. It's an arms race that virtually nobody has a shot at coming in and winning from the outside. These companies are realistically competing only with each other.\n\n3. Nvidia is only part of the AI equation and can eventually be replaced\n\nInvestors can't forget about Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), which has quickly become a potential AI rival in terms of size and scale to these companies. I'm not saying that Nvidia won't be a fantastic investment and a significant player in AI over the coming decades.\n\nBut consider this food for thought: Chips are AI's building blocks, but not AI itself. The chips are only part of the equation. So far, Nvidia has done a stellar job establishing itself as the de facto go-to supplier of AI chips.\n\nStill, Nvidia depends on Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet to continue building their AI infrastructure using its chips. It's unclear whether that will continue forever. Again, it's easily possible that Nvidia will remain the leading player in AI chips for the foreseeable future. But it's at least worth pondering whether these cash-flush technology giants will forever fork over billions of dollars to Nvidia.\n\nThey don't have to switch to a competitor's AI chip, like Advanced Micro Devices. Instead, Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet could design custom chips for their internal use, helping diversify their chip supply away from Nvidia as the predominant source. Custom chips wouldn't be easy, but if any company can do it, it'd probably be these three.\n\nSo, do these big three cloud companies need Nvidia, or does Nvidia need them? This question has no clear answer today. However, the possibility of internal chip designs is enough to give Microsoft, Amazon, and Alphabet the nod as the top AI stock investors can hold decades into the future.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Amazon (AMZN) closed at $184.30, marking a -0.38% move from the previous day. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.11% loss on the day. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.22%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.23%.\n\nShares of the online retailer have depreciated by 2.37% over the course of the past month, underperforming the Retail-Wholesale sector's gain of 0.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.51%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Amazon will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.02, up 61.9% from the prior-year quarter. In the meantime, our current consensus estimate forecasts the revenue to be $148.54 billion, indicating a 10.54% growth compared to the corresponding quarter of the prior year.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $4.58 per share and revenue of $638.24 billion. These totals would mark changes of +57.93% and +11.04%, respectively, from last year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Amazon. Such recent modifications usually signify the changing landscape of near-term business trends. As a result, upbeat changes in estimates indicate analysts' favorable outlook on the company's business health and profitability.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, running from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), holds an admirable track record of superior performance, independently audited, with #1 stocks contributing an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate has shifted 0.96% upward. Currently, Amazon is carrying a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at its valuation, Amazon is holding a Forward P/E ratio of 40.38. This denotes a premium relative to the industry's average Forward P/E of 21.34.\n\nAlso, we should mention that AMZN has a PEG ratio of 1.36. The PEG ratio is akin to the commonly utilized P/E ratio, but this measure also incorporates the company's anticipated earnings growth rate. As the market closed yesterday, the Internet - Commerce industry was having an average PEG ratio of 0.95.\n\nThe Internet - Commerce industry is part of the Retail-Wholesale sector. With its current Zacks Industry Rank of 71, this industry ranks in the top 29% of all industries, numbering over 250.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank is ordered from best to worst in terms of the average Zacks Rank of the individual companies within each of these sectors. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Navigating the Tech Stock Jungle: 3 Picks for Massive Returns",
        "content": "If you’re trying to hone in on which tech stocks to buy this month, you’ve come to the right place. The technology sector continues to carry the stock market higher. In just six months, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tripled its market valuation to $3 trillion and replaced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable stock (it recently slipped back to third place).\n\nYet other tech stocks are performing just as good or better than the chipmaker. Software company Dave (NASDAQ:DAVE) has quadrupled in value this year, rising almost 400%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 170%, though that has more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bubbling up again.\n\nWhat it shows, though, is significant profit-making opportunities remain in the sector and the following three tech stocks to buy could be the next to explode higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year’s tech darling Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is growing slower this year – but not by much. After tacking on 250% gains in 2023, it is “only” 172% higher this time around. But that’s because SMCI stock slipped 37% below the all-time high it hit in March. Now is the time for the next leg up.\n\nSuper Micro reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat Wall Street’s top and bottom line estimates but didn’t offer blow-the-doors-off guidance for the rest of the year. The stock market sold off its shares because SMCI’s outlook for the fourth quarter said revenue would only triple from last year to as much as $5.8 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and workstations for data centers and other industries. The need for more capacity has hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building new data centers all over the country. There will be no lack of demand for Super Micro’s equipment.\n\nSMCI stock earnings are expected to grow a whopping 62% every year for the next five years yet it trades at a fraction of that growth rate. That makes Super Micro Computer a tech stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another discounted tech stock to buy because it also has no end in sight to its growth potential. Like death and taxes, hackers and cybercrime will always be with us in the connected computer age. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says “human-initiated digital attacks” are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palo Alto’s stock is only up 1% in 2024. The market is worried that billings growth is slowing. It rose just 3% in the fiscal third quarter to $2.3 billion. But that resulted from the cybersecurity outfit offering program bundling discounts to existing customers.\n\nIt is also benefiting from customers consolidating where they spend their money on security. Rather than numerous different vendors, they are buying more Palo Alto modules under its new, single-platform offering. Particularly with the growth of AI, the cybersecurity leader has new program packages that offer superior protection.\n\nPalo Alto Network’s lower price gives investors the chance to buy into this tech stock at a discount.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced wafer cleaning technologies and equipment (WFE) supplier ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another tech stock the market wrongly sold off. Shares are down 38% from its 52-week high though it remains 16% above where it started the year.\n\nPart of the reason for the pullback is ACM’s market is declining, but only through this year. Analysts at Gartner predict the WFE industry will fall 4% this year after a 10% decline in 2023. However, starting in 2025, it will reverse and see 10% growth with significant gains continuing through 2027. It is easy to see why.\n\nDemand for computer chips is growing, especially due to the needs of AI. ACM Research’s equipment is essential because it eliminates contaminants from wafer surfaces at the front end of the chip processing cycle. Chip manufacturers need pristine surfaces before they begin making the wafers.\n\nThe specialized nature of its equipment will be necessary as chip companies face secular growth trends. That should push ACMR stock to new heights in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Reliable Stocks That Deliver Come Rain or Shine",
        "content": "The stock market is unpredictable, and it is impossible to time it. Inflation, recession, low consumer spending and geopolitical issues can impact your investment portfolio. If you react to these market fluctuations, you could either buy too high or sell too low. This is when smart investors hold tight to the stocks that can deliver, no matter how the market moves. These are reliable stocks that do not fluctuate with every market movement.\n\nWhen you have a portfolio of stalwarts that keep delivering rain or shine, you never have to worry about your portfolio underperforming. Here are seven reliable stocks that can deliver in all market situations, and you will never regret owning them. With that in mind, let’s take a look at these stocks.\n\nColgate Palmolive (CL) Colgate toothpaste and mouthwash in a cup with a toothbrush\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne solid reason to add Colgate-Palmolive (NYSE:CL) to your portfolio is the massive range of products it owns. Many families tend to use the same consumer brands for years. This could be a preference or a habit, but Colgate Palmolive also benefits from this. It owns well-known brands, including Colgate toothpaste and other personal hygiene products.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith a dividend yield of 2.13%, Colgate-Palmolive is one of the most reliable stocks that will continue to perform regardless of market moves. Trading at $93, the stock is up 16% year-to-date and is moving towards the 52-week high of $95.\n\nThe stock has soared 24% in the past 12 months, and believe buying CL stock below $100 is a smart move. The company has increased dividends annually for over six decades and has enough liquidity to keep doing so.\n\nAfter beating analyst expectations in the first quarter, management raised the outlook for FY2024 and expects sales growth of 2% to 5%. It reported revenue of $5.07 billion and an EPS of 86 cents.\n\nPepsi (PEP) Pepsi (PEP) Factory in Samara, Russia. Pepsi logo on a blue warehouse.\n\nSource: FotograFFF / Shutterstock\n\nBeverage giant PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP) has existed for over 50 years and has seen several market ups and downs. As one of the most popular companies, PepsiCo has a global presence and is a dividend aristocrat.\n\nBesides being acclaimed as an ideal stock for passive income investors, PepsiCo has a diversified business with multiple brands, including Frito-Lay snacks and Aquafina under its umbrella. This ensures steady revenue growth over the years.\n\nTrading at $173, the stock has been up 29% in the past five years. It has a dividend yield of 3.13% and increased the dividend by 7% in the recent quarter, which is its 52nd consecutive increase.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile this may not be a huge surge compared to the tech stocks, PepsiCo offers stability and reliability. The company enjoys pricing power and has a robust cash flow that can reward patient investors. The stock has recently pulled back; this is your time to pounce. PepsiCo will provide a cushion in uncertain times.\n\nPost-earnings, Morgan Stanley called the valuation compressed and had an overweight rating for the stock with a price target of $190. The investment bank expects a rebound later in the year.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) is a strong business and a global brand. It is hard to imagine life without Alphabet’s products and services. The tech giant is known for its Google search engine and YouTube, which generates most business revenue.\n\nIt generated $8.1 billion in revenue from YouTube advertising and $9.6 billion in sales from Google Cloud. Alphabet has a wide umbrella of products that generate consistent revenue, and can generate free cash flow that has only increased over the years.\n\nTrading at $178, the stock is up 27% YTD and 45% in the past 12 months. Buying GOOG stock below $200 is smart and will reap significant gains. The company has solid free cash flow, which enables it to pay dividends.\n\nWhile it recently announced its first-ever dividend, Alphabet can sustain it. It ended the first quarter with a free cash flow of $16.8 billion and announced a dividend of $0.20 per share. Alphabet stock is the one to buy and hold for years, no matter the market situation.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nTech dinosaur Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has delivered in all market conditions and is leading with AI investments. Its timely investment in OpenAI has already started to pay off, and it has already integrated AI into its products and services. Trading at $424, the stock is up 14% YTD and over 200% in the past five years.\n\nMicrosoft is aggressively investing in AI and has recently committed to investing $3.2 billion in AI in Sweden. It recently launched the new Surface laptops, which the company claims to be the ultimate combination of Copilot+ and AI. Microsoft is a powerhouse that does not stop delivering, and with a strong presence across multiple industries and segments, Microsoft is here to stay.\n\nIt is expanding its cloud platform, which is also the biggest revenue driver. In the recent quarter, the segment generated $35.1 billion in revenue, up 23% year over year. The total revenue stood at $61.9 billion, up 17% year over year.\n\nIts advertising business is a gem that quietly continues to generate revenue, which increased 19% year over year. Microsoft does have competitors, but no company has been able to achieve the market domination that it has today. It also offers a dividend yield of 0.70%.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon (AMZN) prime label on a parcel\n\nSource: Claudio Divizia / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 23% YTD, Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is trading at $185 today and is close to the 52-week high. The e-commerce giant is making significant improvements in the business, which has helped reduce operating costs and improve the fundamentals.\n\nOne of the largest cloud computing service providers, Amazon Web Services (AWS), remains the largest contributor to revenue growth. The company reported a blow-out fourth quarter after the holiday season and followed it with another impressive first quarter.\n\nIn the first quarter, cloud computing revenue jumped 17% to $25 million, and operating income soared 200% to $15.3 billion, showing that its cost-cutting measures are working. Even the advertising segment saw a 24% revenue jump, and this segment could continue growing as Amazon emerges as one of the biggest players in the online advertising space.\n\nAmazon is only getting started and could soar to incredible highs in the coming years. Many investors believe that buying stocks when trading high isn’t a good idea, but with Amazon, if you choose to wait, you could end up waiting forever. Buy the stock below $200 while you can.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith over 4 billion cards in circulation, Visa (NYSE:V) holds the largest market share in the industry and works with more than 14,000 financial institutions worldwide. The company has nailed a business structure where it makes money as a processor. Whenever we use a card to make a payment, Visa earns a fee, which accounts for the majority of its revenue. Visa managed to thrive even in times of high inflation.\n\nThe stock is up 7% YTD and is exchanging hands for $277. It has soared 22% over the past 12 months and is one of the best fintech stocks. For the second quarter, it reported a 16% jump in the cross-border volume and an 8% jump in payments volume.\n\nThe company recently announced that it generated $40 billion in e-commerce revenue globally through its tokenization technology. This feat is impressive, and it has issued more than 10 billion tokens. This has led to an improvement in global payment approval rates and a reduction in fraud.\n\nVisa is a reliable industry player with little risk. It has survived several market uncertainties and continues to move forward. It also has a modest dividend yield of 0.75%.\n\nCostco (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nUp 29% YTD, Costco (NASDAQ:COST) is trading for $842 and has gained 64% in the last five years. The stock is steadily rallying upwards, with a dividend yield of 0.55%. While the yield is not very impressive, the stock’s upward rally is worth enjoying. I’d recommended the stock when it was trading at $743.\n\nIn the recent quarter, it reported a 9.1% YOY jump in revenue and a 20.7% YOY rise in its e-commerce sales. With growing revenue and profit, Costco has set a strong momentum for the second half of 2024.\n\nOne of the most reliable stocks, Costco is a high-quality business that benefits from consumer loyalty. It reported a 6.6% rise in same-store sales even in an inflationary period. Its membership model, with 74.5 million member households, ensures steady annual fee income. The company has not increased membership prices since 2017, which has worked in its favor.\n\nCostco enjoys a competitive advantage in the industry, and its stock has outperformed the market for years. The company has ample scope for expansion and could benefit as consumer spending improves. With a strong presence across the United States, Costco is ready to expand across Asia and Europe and aims to open 31 new locations by the end of the year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Vandita Jadeja did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Growth stocks have the potential to outperform the stock market. These corporations often exhibit high revenue and earnings growth for multiple years.\n\nWhile growth stocks tend to be more volatile than the average investment, individuals with lengthy time horizons can ride out the sharp price fluctuations. Buying and holding promising growth stocks with a 5-10-year horizon can lead to meaningful long-term returns. These top growth stocks can take your portfolio to new highs.\n\nVisa (V)\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a leading fintech firm specializing in credit and debit cards. The company makes revenue from each transaction and has generated solid returns for investors. Shares are up by 5% year-to-date and have gained 60% over the past five years.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe firm trades at a 33.5 P/E ratio and offers a 0.76% yield. High net profit margins have been a constant for this company, which reached 53% in Q2 FY24. Revenue and net income both increased by 10% year over year.\n\nVisa has been initiating many stock buybacks to reward long-term investors. Share repurchases and dividends came to $3.8 billion in the quarter. Growth in payments volume, especially cross-border volume, fueled the recent gains.\n\nWall Street is enthusiastic about the stock and rated it a Strong Buy.

MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a diversified portfolio. Through this stock, investors get exposure to gaming, social media, artificial intelligence, business software, cloud computing and other industries.\n\nMany of the company’s segments exhibit year-over-year revenue growth, but Microsoft Cloud is the main growth driver.

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 25 Richest Billionaires in Food and Beverage Industry and in this article, we will talk about the richest billionaire in food and beverage industry.\n\nFood and Beverage Market: An Outlook\n\nAccording to a report by The Business Research Company, the food and beverage industry is estimated to reach $7 trillion in 2024. The market is expected to follow an upward trajectory at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.9% and reach $8.8 trillion by 2028. The growth is driven by various factors including rising disposable income, subscription products, online grocery shopping, and digital payment options. On April 23, Reuters reported that Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has introduced a new grocery delivery subscription service in the United States, allowing subscribers to get unlimited grocery deliveries on orders over $35, at a monthly payment of $9.99. It will be available across the country in 3,500 cities and towns. The new service offered by Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) includes products from Amazon Fresh, Whole Foods Market, and other local retailers on its platform. It also provides a reduced fee for low-income citizens at a price of $4.99 per month without the premium membership. Other big retailers in the market including Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT) and Target Corporation (NYSE:TGT) also offer similar subscription programs. With the launch of this service, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) is expanding its fresh food business to compete with other retail giants in the market.\n\nOne of the major trends in the food market is companies adapting AI and data-driven approaches to optimize their operations. On May 25, Reuters reported that the leading supermarket company Koninklijke Ahold Delhaize N.V. (OTC:ADRNY) which owns grocery chains, Food Lion, Giant Food, The GIANT Company, Hannaford, and Stop & Shop in the US, plans to automize its back-end operations and grow its earnings by driving more customers to its digital applications. The company expects to achieve $5.41 billion in cumulative savings by employing AI and automation in its logistics, supply chain, store, and backend operations while directing loyal customers to digital applications.\n\nMajor Players in the Food and Beverage Market\n\nSome of the biggest companies in the food and beverage market include The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC), Mondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ), and Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY). Let's discuss them below in detail.\n\nThe Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) manufactures and markets food and beverage products in the US and worldwide. Its products range from everyday essentials to frozen products and refreshment beverages. Some of the popular brands of the company are Kraft, Oscar Mayer, Heinz, Kool-Aid, Jell-O, Heinz, and Lunchables, among others. The company is also working towards making plant-based food alternatives, capitalizing on the growing market demand. On March 12, the joint venture of The Kraft Heinz Company (NASDAQ:KHC) and the Not Company, The Kraft Heinz Not Company LLC launched its first-ever plant-based version of the company's KD mac and cheese brand. The company is continuously expanding its portfolio to meet the customer's demands, exemplified by its current offerings, KD NotMacandCheese and KD Gluten Free.\n\nStory continues\n\nMondelez International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MDLZ) is a leading manufacturer of snack food and beverages including biscuits, baked snacks, crackers, cakes, chocolates, and powdered beverages. Major brands of the company are Cadbury Dairy Milk, Tate's Bake Shop biscuits and baked snacks, Oreo, Toblerone, LU, and Ritz. On May 28, the company announced that it has invested $5 million in a new Regional Biscuit and Baked Snacks Lab and Innovation Kitchen in Singapore. The company has integrated its new facility which will focus on developing new and improved baked snacks and biscuits, while promoting mindful snacking and catering to the demand for premium snacks. This marks the expansion of the company's existing Singapore Technical Centre which was established in 2006 and later extended into a gum and candy category facility in 2018.\n\nAnother market leader in the food and beverage market, Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) is making strides in sustainable packaging solutions catering to customers' needs for responsible consumption. On April 12, the company announced that it would be converting its ready-to-drink portfolio, Nesquick to a recyclable shrink sleeve label, created with light-blocking print technology, making it easier to recycle the bottle. The label will be available on all of Nesqiuck's bottles starting this summer. Nestlé S.A. (OTC:NSRGY) aims to utilize the material with the plastic supply stream to convert it into another PET bottle. The new shrink sleeve and bottle will both be recyclable, allowing the customers to put the bottle into the recycling bin without having to remove the sleeve. All drinks under Nequick will be converted to the new sleeve by June 2024. This transition will allow the company to recycle an estimated 4,500 metric tons of PET plastic annually.

        "content": "Adobe ADBE is benefiting from strengthening generative AI capabilities. The solid momentum of its family of creative, generative AI models, Firefly, is a major positive.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver enhanced experiences to various enterprises and customers, the company is constantly making efforts to bolster its generative AI-backed offerings.\r\n\r\nThe latest move of making Adobe Experience Platform (“AEP”) AI Assistant generally available is a testament to the same.\r\n\r\nAEP AI Assistant is capable of answering technical questions, automating tasks, simulating outcomes, and generating new audiences seamlessly. It enables enterprises to boost their productivity through its conversational interface, which provides a deeper understanding of data and an ability to streamline workflows.\r\n\r\nIt also helps in generating entire marketing assets, such as emails and web pages with copy, design and images via Adobe Firefly.\r\n\r\nThe underlined AI assistant is integrated into Adobe Experience Cloud applications, such as Real-Time Customer Data Platform, Adobe Journey Optimizer and Customer Journey Analytics.\r\n\r\nHence, the latest move is expected to contribute to the Digital Experience segment performance and Experience Cloud subscriptions in the near term.\r\n\r\nIn first-quarter fiscal 2024, the segment generated revenues of $1.29 billion, up 10% on a year-over-year basis. Experience Cloud subscription revenues were $1.16 billion, rising 12% from the year-ago quarter.\r\n\r\nStrengthening the Digital Experience segment will, in turn, aid Adobe’s overall financial performance.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 total revenues is pegged at $21.42 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 10.4%. The same for fiscal 2024 earnings is pegged at $17.96 per share, implying a year-over-year rise of 11.8%.\n\nAdobe Inc. Price and Consensus Adobe Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAdobe Inc. price-consensus-chart | Adobe Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Solutions Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Grand View Research report, the generative AI market size is expected to witness a CAGR of 36.5% between 2024 and 2030.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company is well-poised to capitalize on this growth prospect on the back of its strengthening generative AI-powered portfolio of solutions. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nAdobe’s unveiling of the Firefly Image 2 Model, Firefly Vector Model and Firefly Design Model to mark a significant advancement in its creative generative AI model family, enhancing creative control, image quality and illustrator capabilities, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nThe company recently unveiled Generative Remove in Adobe Lightroom, which is a powerful Firefly-backed tool that helps remove unwanted objects from any photo in a single click in a non-destructive manner.\r\n\r\nThe launch of Adobe Express for Enterprise, which is powered by Firefly Image Model 3, is a positive. It offers features, namely Brand Controls, Bulk Create, Generate and Firefly Custom Models.\r\n\r\nThe company also launched Photoshop’s web version, which is available via Firefly-powered AI tools, generative expand and generative fill. The editing tool enables file collaboration through sharing links, even without subscriptions, and provides a web version with desktop tools like the contextual taskbar for workflow suggestions.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntensifying Competition: A Risk\n\nAdobe has lost 23.2% year to date against the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s growth of 16.8%. In the same time frame, the company has underperformed Amazon AMZN, Alphabet GOOGL and Meta Platforms META, from which it faces stiff competition in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nAmazon, which has gained 21.8% year to date, is benefiting significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nGrowing momentum in the Amazon Titan model is a plus. The addition of Meta’s Llama 2 to Amazon Bedrock as a new model remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s Google is capitalizing on the increasing demand for large language models (LLMs) with its most powerful AI model, Gemini. Solid momentum in Google’s Vertex AI, which enables developers to train, tune, augment and deploy applications using generative AI models, is another positive.\r\n\r\nAlphabet, which has rallied 26.6% year to date, is also gaining strong momentum across its second generation of image generator model, Imagen 2, which offers an improved image quality to help organizations create brand-specific images with enterprise-grade reliability and governance, ensuring customer satisfaction.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Meta Platforms, which has returned 39.6% year to date, recently introduced generative AI features to assist businesses in creating and editing new ad content, making the process quicker and more efficient.\r\n\r\nThese features include image and text generation capabilities, image variation, and the ability to create alternate iterations based on original creative, helping businesses reach their target audiences more effectively.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Cheap E-Commerce Stocks to Play a Bounce in Digital Spending",
        "content": "Various technology stocks are starting to become a tad on the expensive side. While many firms may grow into their expanded multiples soon, investors should be careful about paying too high a premium. Overestimating a firm’s growth prospects can have rather nasty consequences, especially if there’s already a great deal of momentum.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll look at three cheap e-commerce stocks that I find many may be at risk of underestimating. Indeed, digital spending is in a rather fragile state after the inflation sandstorm we’ve navigated of late.\n\nMoving ahead, though, I’d look for such spending to enjoy some form of bounce-back. In the early stages of a bull market, consumer spending could shift very suddenly. And when it comes to the following cheap e-commerce stocks, many may be caught by surprise once we hear the bull roar at its loudest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAmazon (AMZN) amazon (AMZN) sign with dark background\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the lone e-commerce company in the group known as the Magnificent Seven. Though AMZN stock hasn’t surged as quickly as rivals, a 23% year-to-date return is nothing to sneeze at! Just a few percentage points below all-time highs, I’d look for AI bets and increased consumer spending to jolt the cloud and e-commerce businesses.\n\nIn many ways, Amazon seems to be a slightly more cyclical Magnificent Seven company. When an economic slowdown hits and consumers put their wallets away, Amazon orders may be limited to necessities. Amazon shoppers may be in better shape to make better use of their Prime memberships once they see higher wages and savings, lower prices or, at the very least, slower price increases.\n\nEven if consumers don’t start doubling down on discretionary spending, Prime members are poised to keep getting spoiled. For example, a full-year subscription to food-delivery service Grubhub is now included with Prime.\n\nAs we go into the second half, I think AMZN stock could prove cheap relative to its growth and timely catalysts that could be in store.\n\neBay (EBAY) Indicators Say Stay on Sidelines When It Comes to eBay Stock\n\nSource: Mano Kors / Shutterstock.com\n\neBay (NASDAQ:EBAY) looks quite compelling for investors seeking deeper value. Currently, shares are going for just 10.58 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). The legendary internet auction site that boomed in the lead-up to the dot-com bust has been underwhelming and rather volatile.\n\nLowered second-quarter guidance and underrated AI investments could help sellers list more goods faster, potentially setting the stage for a nice surprise in the second half.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, eBay’s decision to stop acceptingAmerican Express (NYSE:AXP) after a swipe-fee disagreement could bite by year’s end. Undoubtedly, American Express brings in incredibly affluent users, many of whom are collectors spending a pretty penny with their Platinum cards.\n\nMy guess is eBay’s Amex breakup will hurt it more than it’ll hurt Amex. Though, when EBAY stock sunk 1.4% on a huge up-day for the rest of the market, I think the breakup is already baked into the price.\n\nEtsy (ETSY) Etsy logo on a phone screen on a blue background. Phone is in a little cart and there are packages around them. ETSY stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nEtsy (NASDAQ:ETSY) is the go-to e-commerce platform for buying a wide range of hand-crafted goods, vintage artistic pieces and crafting materials. Lately, though, you’re probably likelier to see drop-shipped, mass-produced items taking up the digital real estate that should have gone to small mom-and-pop creators.\n\nThe good news is that Etsy is already taking action to bring back its platform’s creative appeal. Perhaps AI could play a growing role in monitoring sellers and ensuring they adhere to the company’s policies. For now, it’s unclear how many digital consumers the site could bring back as it returns to its roots and stops selling the type of stuff that you can just find on Amazon.\n\nIn any case, investors seem to be discounting the potential for a consumer spending resurgence. At 18.3 times forward P/E, ETSY stock looks quite cheap here, especially as the e-commerce platform becomes more AI-savvy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette owned shares of Amazon and American Express.

In the first quarter, he initiated a position in Alphabet and also increased his position in Amazon by 22% to about $920 million.\n\nLoeb Thinks This Company's Capital Allocation Strategy is \"Brilliant\"\n\nLoeb's also bullish on the energy transition and one of his favorite stocks that is expected to benefit from the AI-driven electricity demand is Vistra, one of the largest independent power producers and retail electricity providers in the US. Though the power company's core markets have experienced volatility due to weak domestic electricity demand, its \"capital allocation strategy has been brilliant\", he stated in his Q1 2024 letter to shareholders, seen by Insider Monkey. In the weak demand environment for fossil fuels, The Texas-based energy group made smart moves by shutting down its unprofitable coal plants and instead buying back 33% of its shares between 2018 and 2023. Additionally, its acquisition of nuclear generation assets of Ohio-based energy company, Energy Harbor, was right on time as governments are turning to nuclear fuel sources to meet the world's growing energy demands. Loeb expects Vistra to be a direct beneficiary of AI-driven electricity demand and is bullish on the company's unique position of holding both renewable and fossil fuel-based assets under its belt.\n\nLoeb's Bullish on LSEG, and For Good Reason\n\nAnother AI play Loeb is increasingly bullish on is UK-based stock exchange and financial data company London Stock Exchange Group. The activist investor likes the company's unique market position as a data provider that is democratizing and making financial data accessible to consumers without the use of additional third-party software. He sees London Stock Exchange Group benefitting from generative AI as information retrieval systems in financial services become more powerful. He also expects the company to develop \"a powerful Research Assistant application\" with Microsoft to reduce both human resources and time needed to process financial data. He thinks London Stock Exchange Group is at the forefront of capitalizing on the transition of the financial services industry \"from manual data processing via clunky desktop terminals to machine-assisted data processing\".\n\nStory continues Is Amazon Dan Loeb's Top Growth Stock Pick?\n\nOur Methodology\n\nWe scanned Third Point’s Q1 portfolio and picked growth stocks from the fund’s top 13F holdings. Additionally, we've also added overall hedge fund sentiment, as of Q1 2024. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nNote: All pricing data is as of June 6.\n\nIs Amazon Dan Loeb's Top Growth Stock Pick?\n\nAmazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)\n\nThird Point's Stake Value: $919,938,000\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Holders: 302\n\nDan Loeb grew his position in Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) by 22% and ended Q1 2024 with a stake of $919 million in the company. Loeb's bullish on Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and sees it as another \"best run legacy\" company that stands to capitalize on AI's secular trends. Other hedge funds also grew their positions sizably in the company as the stock was part of 302 investors' portfolios in Q1 2024, up from 293 portfolios in Q4 2023.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) was primarily known for its e-commerce business but over the years it has diversified into other verticals including cloud, streaming, advertising, and supply chain and logistics, among many others. The tech titan, like Loeb's other top 5 picks, has clear economic moats when it comes to its space. Amazon's been among the frontrunners to pen contracts with renewable power operators for 24-hour data centers. The company's also making strategic investments in AI startups, further growing its exposure and footprint. It invested an additional $2.75 billion in AI startup Anthropic in March, swelling its total investment to $4 billion. Its AWS business currently holds a majority market share and is among the top 3 cloud providers rivaling Microsoft's Azure and Alphabet's Google Cloud. The company's also developing its own custom AI chips (Trainium and Inferentia) for facilitating the development of deep learning models.\n\nApart from being a true disruptor in tech, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has generated billions of dollars of free cash flow over the years. Over the past 10 years, its free cash flow has grown at a CAGR of 34%.

AMZN has gained 45% over the past 12 months and its 1-year median target implies an additional 20% upside from current levels.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMZN) diversified business model, advances in AI and the data center market are painting an attractive story. While the stock is an obvious long-term portfolio pick, given its blue chip status and growth rates, its newest moves are adding more reasons to buy the stock while it trades at 3 times its sales while rivals MSFT and GOOG trade at higher P/S multiples of 13.3x and 7x.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc.

        "content": "A company as large as Walmart (NYSE:WMT) is undoubtedly using AI to automate parts of its business, such as inventory management and e-commerce fulfillment. If other retail stocks want to keep up with the world’s largest retailer, AI is not optional.\n\nWho else is using AI to strengthen their businesses and grow sales?\n\n“As we look to the future, it’s going to happen a lot faster than people can imagine once it’s all over. We’re talking a 3-5-year type of time horizon,” Gerald Storch, CEO of Storch Advisors, toldCNBC in May.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\n“It’s going to change everything. You start with the top line, where you really make all the money. AI is going to help us predict what’s going to sell and what’s not going to sell, and it’s even going to design those products.”\n\nIt is an interesting 5-minute interview. I highly recommend it if you follow retail stocks and AI.\n\nInspired by Storch’s comments, here are three retail stocks already leveraging AI for growth.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn many ways, Visa (NYSE:V) is the ultimate retail stock. In fiscal 2023 (September end-of-year), the company processed 212.6 billion transactions worldwide, 10% higher than a year earlier—many of them for retail stores.\n\nVisa and its peers work diligently to minimize fraudulent use of its products. AI is helping payment processors detect fraud faster. On March 27, Visa launched three new AI-powered solutions to its Visa Protect suite to help stop fraud. Over the past five years, it has invested $10 billion to help minimize fraud on and off the Visa network.\n\nLast October, Visa launched the $100 million Generative AI Ventures Initiative to accelerate its efforts in generative AI. The initiative will invest in companies developing generative AI technologies.\n\nVisa’s investments in AI are just one of many reasons to own V stock over the long haul.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are many ways a company the size of Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) could use AI to improve its business and create value for its customers. In 2023, Amazon invested $85.6 billion in technology and infrastructure, up 53% from $56.1 billion in 2021.\n\nOne example of how it uses the technology is Project P.I. Using a combination of generative AI and computer vision, its fulfillment operation can detect issues with a customer’s order, such as a defective product or incorrect size or color.\n\nTechCrunch recently highlighted Amazon’s work with AI voice search to make its Fire TV devices more helpful to users.\n\nStory continues\n\n“The AI understands natural language and phrases, and can answer specific queries like, ‘Which movie has the line “Life is like a box of chocolates?”’ (‘Forrest Gump,’ by the way). It can also pull up options based on the actors, characters, genres and topics,” TechCrunch contributor Lauren Forristal wrote on May 30.\n\nOver at the very profitable Amazon Web Services business, AI is written all over the operations. TechTimes reported that Amazon is working with Formula 1 to design an AI-created trophy for the winner of the Canadian Grand Prix.\n\nHow cool is that?\n\nHome Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) sign backdropped by blue sky\n\nSource: Rob Wilson / Shutterstock.com\n\nHome Depot (NYSE:HD) has been using AI and machine learning on its Home Depot app for years. In August 2018, it detailed five technologies changing how we shop. Nearly six years later, its AI focus has only gotten more serious.\n\nIn May, DailyMail.com showed how Home Depot uses AI, computer vision and cameras to spot the risk of theft and alert management.\n\n“Computer vision can identify complex carts or high value carts and signal a cashier to help the customer with their basket to ensure all products are scanned and accounted for,” stated Home Depot Senior Executive Vice President Ann-Marie Campbell.\n\nIt has been so successful that the company is using the technology to warn managers about messy shelves and damaged products. Given how many cities are adding cameras to their streets, it hardly seems like Home Depot’s use of computer vision is a significant violation of one’s privacy.\n\nBut, hey, I’m not paranoid. It is what it is.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "7 Top AI Stocks to Buy in June for Long-Term Growth",
        "content": "Technologies with the power to change the world come along every so often. Artificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful world-changing technologies of the past several decades, and perhaps ever. Its potential has created incredibly valuable stocks over the past 18 months and will continue to do so in the month of June. Investors seeking long-term AI growth need look first to today’s dominant hyperscalers.\n\nThat term refers to the largest tech firms which have the resources to scale AI technology fastest. There’s little reason to believe that they won’t continue to dominate the space this month and beyond. They continue to represent excellent long-term growth prospects overall.\n\nBeyond the hyperscalers, there are plenty of other AI stocks that will dominate the month of June. Let’s take a look at all of them in depth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNvidia (NVDA) An Nvidia (NVDA) semiconductor chip on a black background.\n\nSource: Hairem / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has quickly come to dominate the AI chip space, becoming the third most valuable company globally in the process. There is no clearer indication of Nvidia’s dominance than the prices it charges for its chips.\n\nThe H100 AI processor cost anywhere between $25,000 to $40,000. It was introduced in 2022. Demand continues to be incredibly strong today. The company also spent $10 billion developing the H100’s successor, Blackwell B200 chips. Those chips are expected to sell for between $30,000 to $40,000. They’re also expected to be four times as powerful as their predecessors.\n\nThat led to another blowout earnings period for the company. The story really hasn’t changed for Nvidia: Demand continues to outstrip supply and Nvidia bears continue to be proven wrong.\n\nShare prices have risen above $1,100. That’s sure to incite more talk of overpricing and calls to sell Nvidia and take profits. However, Nvidia continues to prove the doubters wrong and there’s no reason to believe that it won’t continue to do so throughout the month of June.\n\nGoogle (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) recently returned to form following a very strong earnings report. Most importantly, ad revenues are again strong. Google reported nearly $62 billion in ad revenues during the period. Those ad revenues accounted for the majority of overall revenues at $80.5 billion.\n\nAI continues to be one of the most important catalysts for Google stock but ad revenues are the main driver of the company. The strong report is positive not only because ad revenues jumped from $54 billion to $62 billion. First and foremost, those ad revenues are a proxy for economic strength overall. The resurgence bodes well for the macro economy. Furthermore, those strong ad revenues provide fuel in the form of capital for AI investments at Google.\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle has recently begun to invest more heavily in AI. The company is applying AI to its dominant search function in the hopes that it can further strengthen the product. Investors should be positive about Google’s AI investment simply for the fact it is a hyperscaler with significant resources. Investors should consider buying the stock because ad revenues are again strong and the AI narrative is continuing to strengthen at the company.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Sign of AMD office in Markham, Ontario, Canada. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. is an American multinational semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvancved Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) continues to play second fiddle to Nvidia in the AI chip war. A lot has been written about that and most of it concludes that it is a fine position for AMD and its stock: it is the value play in AI chips and the only realistic competitor to Nvidia’s dominant position at this time.\n\nAMD is also a company that benefits from high demand on a global scale. Recent reports show the U.S. is scaling back export issuance licenses for AMD and Nvidia. While the assessment period required for license issuance will temporarily slow demand, it indicates a greater opportunity. Companies around the world are going to continue to demand AMD chips.\n\nWhile the U.S. continues to lead in research and funding, other companies are also beginning to ramp up their investments in AI.\n\nThat simple truth is another reason to consider investing in AMD this month, next month, and beyond.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere are multiple positive factors suggesting Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) stock is a great choice to buy in June for long-term growth. The simplest of which may be the fact shares currently trade for $1,264 with a consensus target price of $1,517.\n\nPundits anticipate that Broadcom may undertake a stock split to make its share price more accessible to investors. That would increase liquidity which could spike demand, raising prices in the process.\n\nThose prices will probably continue to rise anyway given that earnings surged by 34% during the first quarter. Broadcom is also expecting $10 billion in AI chip sales in 2024. The company is clearly one of the more important AI chip stocks overall.\n\nFrom the perspective of long-term growth, Broadcom makes a lot of sense as an investment. It is one of the better AI chip dividend stocks available with a yield of 1.54% at present.\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir Technologies (PLTR) headquarters\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nPalantirTechnologies (NYSE:PLTR) continues to impress investors in 2024 following a strong 2023.  Last year, Palantir stock burst onto the scene following a quicker-than-anticipated progression to profitability. It then rattled off and continues to rattle off profitable quarters that suggest significant growth ahead.\n\nThe thing that continues to impress me about Palantir from the perspective of investment worthiness is its focus on Enterprise AI. The company is primarily interested in the development of AI business applications rather than those geared toward the individual consumer where there is much more there’s a much bigger opportunity in that space at the moment.\n\nPalantir’s core product is its Foundry platform. That platform allows firms to adapt AI into their operations. The company is also impressive from the perspective that it is rapidly growing its private side business segment. Palantir has long enjoyed a strong relationship on the government side but is quickly growing its corporate relationships.\n\nIt all suggests that Palantir stock is well positioned for long-term growth.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is another company that has the resources to hyperscale AI. However, the stock had been something of a laggard in relation to AI as the other tech giants struck first in 2023.\n\nThen, in 2024, Amazon upped its AI investment. That manifested in the completion of a $4 billion investment in AI startup Anthropic, which continues to be one of the most promising artificial intelligence companies of the future. The company is primarily using Amazon’s AWS Services as its cloud provider. Anthropic will use AI chips developed by Amazon to train its algorithms.\n\nThe thrust of the agreement is very similar to that between OpenAI and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Some would argue that Amazon is late to the game but in any case it now has better overall prospects in generative AI.\n\nThe company also recently received FAA approval allowing it to expand its drone deliveries for online orders.\n\nASML (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML (NASDAQ:ASML) essentially has a monopoly position within the AI chip supply chain. The Dutch company is a gatekeeper as the leading manufacturer of extreme ultraviolet lithography systems. The stock has benefited tremendously because of this positioning and will continue to do so throughout June and beyond. Those EV systems are crucial for the production of the most advanced AI chips.\n\nDemand for the most advanced AI chips is only going to grow from here. That simple truth is very evident in the hype and excitement surrounding the Blackwell chip release, just as one example.\n\nASML continues to struggle with significant issues, primarily export bans to China. The company recently reported that EUV systems located in Taiwan could be disabled in the event that China attacks the independent nation and major chip manufacturing hub.\n\nASML stock will continue to be an obvious choice for all of the facts mentioned above. It essentially has a monopoly position and can act as a gatekeeper exerting substantial influence across the AI chip supply chain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Consequently, investors should concentrate on the best Warren Buffet stocks to navigate the market uncertainty.\n\nBuffett’s evolving investment philosophy with Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has shifted from a quantitative focus to a more qualitative one.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOccidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is a traditional oil and energy player that has effectively cemented its position as a juggernaut in its niche. It’s been a long-time favorite in Buffet’s investing portfolio, representing 4.4% of Berkshire’s massive portfolio. Most recently, in February, the company raised its stake in OXY stock by 1.8%.\n\nOXY is an evergreen play in the oil and gas space, boasting an integrated approach incorporating midstream and marketing segments. As of late, we’ve seen it pivot to sustainable energy, aiming to leverage its cutting-edge carbon capture technology. It has already struck a deal with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), which could add north of $150 million to Amazon’s sales.\n\nDespite operating in a choppy market environment, it posted strong bottom-line results, maintaining its margins in line with its lofty historical figures. Consequently, it can continue paying its healthy dividend, yielding upwards of 1.41%, while trading at under two times forward sales estimates.\n\nBank of America (BAC) Bank of America (BAC) logo on top of a retail office building.\n\nSource: 4kclips / Shutterstock.com\n\nBank of America (NYSE:BAC) is a pillar of Buffett’s portfolio, representing almost 12% of it. This stake dates back to the 2011 debt crisis when Buffet invested $5 billion in the company. Over the years, his position in the company has remained mostly unchanged, representing the second-largest holding in his portfolio.\n\nBAC boasts a commanding presence in its niche, catering to north of 66 million loyal customers. Its robust client base provides a healthy stream of top-and-bottom-line growth opportunities. Moreover, in addition to its healthy capital position, the heightened interest rates currently in effect have further bolstered its financial stability.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the higher-for-longer narrative and a resilient U.S. economy will likely sustain BAC’s improved operational performance.BAC’s optimistic outlook was reinforced by its stellar first-quarter (Q1) performance. It outperformed Wall Street expectations with increased net interest and noninterest income and an adjusted EPS of 83 cents, beating estimates by six cents. These strong numbers underscore BAC’s financial strength and growth potential, solidifying its position as a cornerstone in Buffett’s portfolio.\n\nChubb (CB) Illustrative Editorial of Chubb website homepage.

It sprung into the spotlight when Berkshire revealed a massive $6.7 billion stake in the company, amounting to nearly 26 million shares.\n\nThe company has performed remarkably well lately due to a combination of strategic price adjustments, increasing premiums, and a healthy improvement in profitability. Its recent financials support that notion, with year-over-year (YOY) growth in sales exceeding the 17% mark, 106% higher than its 5-year average.  Additionally, its EBITDA growth of 51% exceeds its 5-year average by 120%.\n\nIts most recent quarterly report showed a strong 14.2% jump in net premiums and a robust 20.3% surge in core operational income. Also, it bumped its dividend to 91 cents per quarter, marking the eighth consecutive year of dividend increases. Given the favorable business environment, Chubb is poised to reward investors further, solidifying its position as a giant in the insurance space.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "Billionaire Ken Griffin Goes Bargain Hunting: 3 Stocks He Just Bought",
        "content": "Nearly everyone likes bargains. That's true no matter how much money you have. Even billionaires go bargain hunting at times.\n\nWe saw an example of this in the first quarter of 2024. Billionaire Ken Griffin bought several stocks for his Citadel hedge fund -- and you can bet he expected good returns on his investments. Here are three stocks Griffin bought in Q1 that rank among Citadel's largest holdings.\n\n1. Hess\n\nHess(NYSE: HES) ranked as Citadel's third-largest holding at the end of the first quarter. This lofty ranking was due to Griffin's aggressive buying of the oil stock. During Q1, he purchased over 8.8 million shares of Hess, increasing Citadel's stake by nearly 18x in the process.\n\nGriffin probably liked Hess' valuation. The stock currently trades at 15.3 times forward earnings. Its forward earnings multiple was at a similar level throughout Q1.\n\nHowever, I suspect that the billionaire's biggest reason for buying more shares of Hess was that he was betting the pending acquisition of the company by Chevron goes through. Hess shareholders recently approved the deal. If the transaction closes, Citadel and other Hess shareholders will receive a premium of nearly 17% to the current share price.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) was already a top holding for Citadel going into Q1. It was the hedge fund's fifth-largest position at the end of the quarter thanks to Griffin's buying an additional 352,000-plus shares.\n\nBased on many commonly used valuation metrics, Amazon doesn't appear to be much of a bargain. For example, its shares trade at over 38 times forward earnings and nearly 8.6 times book value.\n\nHowever, the company has been notoriously difficult to value using earnings-based metrics because it has invested heavily to drive future growth. Now, though, Amazon is focusing on boosting its profitability. The stock also sports a lower price-to-earnings multiple than it's had throughout much of the last 10 years.\n\n3. Bank of America\n\nBank of America(NYSE: BAC) trailed behind Amazon as Citadel's sixth-largest holding at the end of the first quarter. The big bank stock moved into this spot as a result of Griffin increasing his hedge fund's stake in BofA by nearly 390% in Q1.\n\nAfter declining significantly in the first three quarters of 2023, Bank of America stock has rebounded strongly. It's beating the S&P 500 handily so far this year with a gain of over 17%.\n\nThe stock is still attractively valued, though. Its forward price-to-earnings ratio of under 12.3 is well below the S&P 500's forward earnings multiple of 21.1 and the S&P 500 financial sector's average multiple of 15.5.\n\nStory continues\n\nAre these stocks still good picks?\n\nWe won't know if Griffin continued to buy these stocks in the second quarter until Citadel's 13F regulatory filing is submitted in August. However, I think all three are still good picks.\n\nThere's still a chance that Chevron's acquisition of Hess could be derailed. However, Chevron is confident the deal will close later in 2024. I expect the transaction to finalize and enable investors who buy Hess stock at the current price an opportunity to make a relatively quick profit.\n\nI like Amazon's growth prospects. Amazon Web Services (AWS) should benefit tremendously as organizations build generative AI applications in the cloud. Advertising has emerged as a major new growth driver for Amazon. I predict the company's earnings will keep growing.\n\nAs previously mentioned, Bank of America's valuation is a big plus. I view the company as one of the top technological innovators in the banking industry. BofA's forward dividend yield of over 2.4% should also increase the stock's total return.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "SNAP vs. PINS: Why I Think Pinterest Stock Is Better",
        "content": "In this article, I’ll delve deeper to explain why I have a neutral stance on Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and a bullish outlook on Pinterest (NYSE:PINS). Within the social media sphere, Snap and Pinterest stand out as two companies with distinct positioning and strategies, yet both have demonstrated robust growth in user bases and revenues in recent years. Despite both stocks enjoying strong share performance over the past 12 months, PINS appears to be better positioned, in my view.\n\nSnap (NYSE:SNAP)\n\nThe Santa Monica, California-based Snap Inc. is the developer of the Snapchat platform, a social media platform known for its predominantly young audience, with nine out of 10 teenagers and young adults between the ages of 13 and 24 using the platform. Ads constitute Snap’s primary source of revenue, with the company monetizing users through advertising. Additionally, Snap generates revenue from its hardware device, Spectacles, and offers a premium subscription model called Snapchat+, providing users with additional features.\n\nWhen examining the price chart for SNAP stock over the past six years, one might question why the company experienced significant growth in 2020 and a substantial decline since 2021 (down more than 80% from its peak).\n\nThe stock surged from $17 per share at its IPO in 2017 to its all-time high of $83 in September 2021. This remarkable increase was propelled by the company’s exceptional financial performance in its initial years as a publicly traded company, coupled with a strong bull market in that period. In 2021, Snap reported revenues of $4.1 billion compared to $850 million during its IPO year, achieving profitability for the first time in the first quarter of 2022.\n\nDespite the impressive financial metrics and robust growth in daily active users (DAUs) during this relatively fast period, the euphoria surrounding SNAP stock led to it being traded at a market value exceeding $130 billion despite generating just over $4 billion in annual revenues and not yet turning a yearly profit.\n\nHowever, in 2022, amid adverse market conditions characterized by high inflation and rising interest rates, many tech and growth stocks, including Snap, experienced a significant downturn. Snap also faced challenges such as declining ad spending, resulting in stock price volatility after earnings reports.\n\nWhile Snap’s performance over the last 12 months has shown gains of around 45%, the company continues to face volatility. This is evidenced by the mixed reactions to its Q4-2023 and Q1-2024 earnings reports, as depicted by the sharp decline and sharp rebound in the chart below.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Snap experienced a strong negative reaction in Q4 after reporting modest revenue growth and failing to meet market expectations, the company rebounded in Q1 by surpassing revenue expectations. Revenue grew by 21% year-over-year, and daily active user (DAU) numbers increased by 10% year-over-year. Additionally, other metrics, such as the number of Snapchat+ subscribers, more than tripled to over nine million subscribers in Q1 compared to the previous year.\n\nAnother point of concern is that much of Snap’s growth trajectory has been financed through leverage, even though it paid down about $440 million in the past 12 months. Currently, the company’s balance sheet carries a substantial amount of total debt of $3.89 billion despite its ability to generate significant free cash flow. In 2023, Snap had a 70% debt-to-assets ratio, which is the highest in history and significantly higher than that of its peers, especially Pinterest.\n\nLooking ahead, I believe Snap is well-positioned for a more consistent trajectory, unlike its tumultuous past. The company stands to benefit from increased ad spending as the economy enters a higher growth phase. However, concerns remain regarding Snap’s valuation, with the company trading at a forward EV/EBITDA ratio of 57.8x, well above the industry average of 7x, and an EV/sales ratio of 5x, well above the 1.2x industry average.\n\nGiven these circumstances, a stretched valuation is the primary reason why Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Brian Nowak has a bearish stance on Snap. Despite the company’s strong performance in the recent quarter, characterized by significant improvements in purchase conversions from brand advertising, Nowak advises caution. He suggests that investors should refrain from overreacting to the beat in Q1 or the revenue guidance for Q2, which implies a modest 1% year-over-year increase.\n\nIs SNAP Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTaking into account Nowak’s bearish stance, along with assessments from other Wall Street analysts, the consensus rating on SNAP is Hold. The stock has eight Buys, 18 Holds, and two Sell ratings. The average SNAP stock price target stands at $15.59, suggesting modest upside potential of 2.6%.\n\nPinterest (NYSE:PINS)\n\nThe San Francisco-based social media company Pinterest focuses on a different target audience compared to Snap. Its core demographic consists of women with purchasing power, although the platform has been working to expand its user base and enhance its advertising capabilities. Additionally, Pinterest emphasizes shoppable features like direct links and advanced ad measurement tools.\n\nThe company primarily generates revenue through advertising, offering various ad formats such as Promoted Pins and Shopping Ads and enabling businesses to reach relevant audiences on the platform. Pinterest also features a “buy it” button, allowing users to purchase pinned products directly, potentially generating revenue through commissions from partner merchants, such as Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nWhen it comes to the company’s stock performance, PINS’ performance over the past four years has followed a comparable trajectory to SNAP. The stock experienced a significant rise in 2020, reaching an all-time high of $89 in February 2021, driven by strong financial performance and user growth. However, the market downturn in 2022 led to a drawdown of almost 80%.\n\nIn the last two years, Pinterest shares have performed well, rising nearly 100%, with the company focusing on cost control and improving its bottom-line losses. Pinterest boasts a strong financial position, with low debt levels and rising free cash flow compared to peers, including Snap. Its debt-to-free-cash-flow ratio stands at 0.7x, and in 2023, the company’s debt-to-assets ratio was 14%. This positions Pinterest for greater revenue growth and user acquisition.\n\nLooking ahead, Pinterest’s partnership with Amazon and its focus on shoppability and full-funnel advertising can be seen as growth catalysts. For the full year 2024, revenue growth is expected to reach 15%. Despite trading at a forward EV/EBITDA of 26.4x, which is stretched compared to the industry average, it is nearly half that of Snap. On the other hand, the company seems overvalued based on the EV/sales metric, as Pinterest trades at 8x sales compared to Snap’s 5x multiple.\n\nOther important points supporting the potential for growth and appreciation in Pinterest’s shares include key factors cited by BMO Capital analyst Brian J. Pitz, who is one of the Pinterest bulls. These factors include the improvement of the platform’s international monetization through a partnership with Google Ads Manager and greater small-business adoption with new product launches (including generative AI features). Additionally, management aims to increase revenues in the mid-teens over the next three to five years.\n\nIs PINS Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nCurrently, the consensus among Wall Street analysts is that PINS stock is a Moderate Buy based on 15 Buys and six Holds assigned in the past three months. The average PINS stock price target is $46.28, implying upside potential of 8.3%.\n\nThe Verdict: Neutral on SNAP, Bullish on PINS\n\nI’m leaning towards Pinterest having stronger fundamentals than Snap right now. Pinterest seems to have less to prove, even though its valuation is far from a bargain. The premium EV/sales multiple is more justified based on the better quality of its fundamentals.\n\nWhile both companies are well-positioned for growth and likely to be long-term winners, I see Snap’s performance as highly susceptible to inconsistency. This stems from its struggle to turn a profit and potentially stretched valuation multiple, leading to negative reactions.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "RIVN vs. LCID: Which EV Stock Is the Better Pick?",
        "content": "Electric vehicle manufacturers Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) and Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) were once at the forefront of significant hype in the automotive industry back in 2021. However, the situation has drastically changed since then. Both stocks have plummeted by about 90% over the past three years. In this article, I’ll delve deeper into these companies and explain why I hold a bullish outlook for Rivian and a bearish outlook for Lucid.\n\nRivian (NASDAQ:RIVN)\n\nThe Irvine, California-based Rivian is an electric vehicle manufacturer that focuses on creating rugged, hip, and eco-friendly vehicles. Currently, Rivian offers two primary consumer vehicles: the R1T (a pickup truck) and the R1S (an electric SUV). By 2023, the company had produced over 57,000 electric vehicles and successfully delivered more than 50,000 of them.\n\nRivian has raised significant funding from big names like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Ford (NYSE:F), and it’s been growing rapidly, with plans to produce 100,000 electric delivery vans for Amazon. Rivian has also been working on a new vehicle “skateboard” platform that could support future vehicles or be adopted by other companies.\n\nAs recently reported in its first-quarter earnings at the beginning of May, one of the main highlights was announcing a strategic shift by unveiling its new R2 model. This medium-sized, low-cost vehicle will start at $45,000, making it competitive with Tesla’s (NASDAQ:TSLA) Model Y and priced much lower than the R1. This seems to be an essential step towards a better cost-per-vehicle conversion, as well as a good strategy for increasing its market reach in the face of fierce competition in this space.\n\nFurthermore, with the new model, Rivian hopes that lowering its conversion cost per vehicle in the second half of 2024 should lead the company to finally report a net profit in the fourth quarter of 2024, which could prove to be a near-term catalyst for the stock.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that Rivian continues to face significant financial challenges, particularly its high cash burn rate. To illustrate the extent of this issue, in the most recent quarter, Rivian reported nearly $6 billion in cash and equivalents, a significant decrease from the $11.7 billion reported in the same period the previous year.\n\nYet, the $1.2 billion in revenues generated in the first quarter of the year, combined with a loss from operations of $1.48 billion, is not good. This is especially true when considering that the loss from operations did not evolve compared to the same period last year when Rivian lost $1.43 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, Rivian is still at a stage where it is growing revenues but has not yet managed to improve its operating losses, which raises a yellow flag. So much so that over the last 12 months, Rivian has lost around 20% of its market value.\n\nBut even with the seemingly endless bearish momentum since its IPO, it’s still hard to say that Rivian is a cheap stock, although now it’s much easier to make that case than in recent years. Rivian trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 2.2x, more than double the auto industry average of 0.80x and higher than that of Chinese EV manufacturers like BYD (OTC:BYDDY), NIO (NYSE:NIO), and XPeng (NYSE:XPEV), which trade below 2x. However, it is about a third of the P/S ratio that Tesla traded at in the past 12 months.\n\nIs RIVN Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nAmong the 20 Wall Street analysts who have covered Rivian in the last three months, the general consensus is predominantly bullish, resulting in a Moderate Buy rating. The average RIVN stock price target is $13.89, indicating upside potential of 18.3%.\n\nOne standout among these bulls is Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) analyst Adam Jones, who believes Rivian is uniquely positioned beyond Tesla in the market to scale an integrated software stack critical to reaping rewards in AI. It can do so while it has a “market value 1/60th that of Tesla.”\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID)\n\nUnlike Rivian, Newark, California-based Lucid Motors is an electric vehicle maker that focuses on luxury electric sedans and SUVs. Lucid Motors has one main consumer vehicle, the Lucid Air, which the company sold 4,369 units of in 2023.\n\nAs Lucid concentrates on producing high-priced models with superior technology, the company places a strong emphasis on quality. The first Lucid Air model (the top-of-the-line Lucid model) boasted an impressive range of 520 miles on a single charge, making it the longest-range EV rated by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).\n\nLucid is also working on a new electric SUV model called the Lucid Gravity, which should be launched in December of this year and will be priced at less than $80,000. In addition to the Gravity SUV program, Lucid has also announced that it plans to introduce mid-sized vehicles that should begin production at the end of 2026, representing a significant step for it to expand its addressable market.\n\nBut while Lucid sales are still modest (to say the least), all these developments and expectations come at a huge price. To fund its operations, the luxury EV manufacturer relies mainly on the Public Investment Fund (PIF) of Saudi Arabia, which has been a loyal and long-term backer. In 2024, Lucid raised $1 billion, dedicated especially to producing its new SUV, the Gravity.\n\nEven though Lucid has solid financial stability today, thanks to the PIF funding, the company faces significant sustainability challenges in the niche luxury EV market. In its most recent quarter, Lucid disclosed a cost per vehicle of about $200,000 based on nearly 2,000 deliveries and a cost of revenues totaling $404.8 million.\n\nAdditionally, the company reported a net loss of $680.9 million in Q1 2024, translating to a net loss of approximately $345,000 per vehicle. These results indicate underwhelming production and sales growth despite modest increases.\n\nBy the end of Q1, Lucid had $3.99 billion in total cash and short-term investments and a free cash flow of negative $714.9 million. If the company continues to burn cash at these levels by the middle of next year, it will come close to running out of cash.\n\nThis lack of sustainability has significantly impacted Lucid Motors’ market capitalization, which was valued at $90.9 billion in November 2021 but has since plummeted to around $6.4 billion. The primary concern is that even at a much-discounted historical valuation, there is still no justification for the company’s valuation multiples. Lucid trades at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 10.4x, nearly double Tesla’s multiple and five times that of Rivian.\n\nIs LCID Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus on Wall Street regarding Lucid shows prevailing skepticism, as six out of eight analysts covering the stock in the last three months have given it a Hold rating. The average LCID stock price target among these analysts is $3.16 per share, indicating upside potential of 13.3%.\n\nNeedham analyst Chris Pierce is one of the skeptics. Although he recognizes Lucid’s best-in-class technology and leading efficiency, he notes that the company’s low delivery numbers limit fixed cost absorption and increasingly require capital injections.\n\nThe Verdict\n\nAlthough EV stocks, in general, have been experiencing bearish momentum recently, I have a bullish view of Rivian and a bearish one of Lucid.\n\nBoth Rivian and Lucid face significant challenges in making their business operations truly sustainable, as recent results show they are still burning substantial amounts of cash.\n\nHowever, I consider Rivian to be a better pick due to its closer proximity to achieving sustainability compared to Lucid, primarily because Rivian has a broader market presence and trades at a much more reasonable valuation.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A stock market rally is still underway, with the S&P 500 index rebounding in May. Now, this rally has mostly been led by high-growth tech stocks. However, some names with unique value are certainly garnering more attention. You know, the high cash flow producing companies with solid balance sheets that return capital to shareholders.\n\nInvestors want stability and seek more defensive positioning to balance some of the risks various high-growth stocks provide. Of course, you can always generate a higher upside by moving up the risk spectrum. However, not every investor is willing to do that right now.\n\nHere are three value stocks to buy for a more defensive approach to the markets.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) Berkshire Hathaway (BRK-A, BRK-B) logo, stock trade and chart on smartphone. Business and finance market.\n\nThis year started well for Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), as the company reported a $11.22 billion operating profit. This was a 39% increase from 2023, indicating an optimistic outlook. Railroad earnings were marginally lower, but its energy business earnings nearly doubled in the last 12 months.\n\nMoreover, Warren Buffett revealed a previously veiled $6.7 billion investment in Chubb, detailed in a recent SEC filing. This stake, concealed during accumulation, marks Buffett’s ongoing influence on investment trends. Chubb’s global operations, including notable underwriting for former President Trump, add intrigue to Berkshire’s latest move.\n\nTrading now at a reasonable price-earnings ratio of 21.5 times, BRK-B stock offers great value. The market anticipates 23.3% annual earnings growth by 2029. This led to an upgrade to a Buy rating. Currently, the stock’s price target is at $490, showing consensus 18.2% upside from its current levels.\n\nOccidental Petroleum (OXY) Occidental Petroleum (OXY) Company logo seen displayed on smart phone\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nHouston-based oil company Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY) is among the leading hydrocarbon exploration and production companies in the market. It operates in North Africa, U.S. and the Middle East.\n\nOccidental saw a $1 billion boost to annual free cash flow with oil for $70 per barrel. This deal led to a 22% dividend increase in early 2024. Moreover, CrownRock’s addition strengthened Occidental’s portfolio.\n\nLast year, the company announced a partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to deploy carbon capture technology. The market reacted positively to this collaboration, which boosted Amazon’s revenue by $150 million. The deal also diversifies Occidental’s revenue streams amid increasing demand for sustainability.\n\nAs the oil industry shifts towards eco-friendly practices, Occidental has emerged as a leading oil stock to buy. Investors should buy OXY stock for substantial gains in the long-run.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America (BAC) bank of America stock BAC stock\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother key driver in Buffett’s portfolio is Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). The company stands out as one of his best banks, accumulating 13.2% of Berkshire Hathway. Last March, BAC offered stability amid sectoral stress from high interest rates. Despite challenges like a higher cost of capital, BofA’s forward-looking metrics suggest potential when rates decrease.\n\nBank of America’s investment banking fees were predicted by CEO Brian Moynihan to increase by 10-15% in Q2, rebounding after a prolonged industry downturn. Moynihan also anticipated low single-digit growth in trading revenue, driven by equities’ performance. Goldman Sachs’ President noted a slower recovery in equity capital markets than debt markets.\n\nWhile digital assets attract attention, Bank of America doesn’t prioritize them due to lack of client demand. Instead, they focus on AI’s potential to streamline payments and improve customer experiences. Initiatives like Intelligent Receivables and extending AI assistant Erica to corporate clients showcase the company’s commitment to innovation.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Layoffs, abusive calls, and AI fears: Inside the front lines of Amazon’s ‘customer obsession’ promise",
        "content": "The bad news blindsided Amazon customer service employees across the globe in mid-May: More layoffs had arrived. This time, it was middle managers.\n\nIn one Amazon office in Europe, a senior customer service official informed employees during a group meeting that a restructuring would remove an entire level of middle management, but since he refrained from using words like “layoffs,” it wasn’t initially clear whether impacted employees would be out of a job completely or simply reassigned. As employees exchanged puzzled looks trying to decipher what exactly was transpiring, they finally realized that some in attendance had effectively just been laid off.\n\n“In the end, we only barely understood that my colleague next to me was fired,” one longtime Amazon customer service manager told Fortune. “I’ve never felt that embarrassed.”\n\nAround the same time in other parts of the world, some longtime managers tried to log into their Amazon computer system unsuccessfully. In at least one instance, a manager contacted the company’s IT department for assistance only to learn that they should expect outreach from HR instead. Other managers returned to their computers after being bushwhacked by news of their fate to find that there would be no goodbyes: The company had already locked them out of their systems.\n\nThe bare-knuckled job cuts are just one of the many rounds of layoffs made by tech businesses over the past two years, as companies like Alphabet, Meta, Microsoft, and Salesforce retrench from a pandemic-fueled hiring spree. At Amazon, tens of thousands of workers across the company have been let go since the fall of 2022, a business practice that some insiders say has become more common since Andy Jassy replaced Jeff Bezos as CEO.\n\nFor Amazon’s customer service ranks—the frontline staff at a nearly $2 trillion business that proudly markets itself as “customer-obsessed”—the layoffs carry a special significance. At a time when remote work and cost-cutting have upended established work patterns, and with the first wave of generative AI threatening to reshape the very nature of many professions, the plight of Amazon’s customer service managers offers what could be a preview of broader changes coming to corporate workforces around the world.\n\nAlready, the question of what comes next for this division at Amazon is dominating side conversations and text threads between Amazon employees in call centers and virtual offices from the U.S. to Costa Rica to India. Will Amazon continue to outsource even more customer interactions to third-party firms? Are current employees unknowingly training an AI replacement under the guise of a new software tool that management is forcing them to use? How far off is complete automation of their roles?\n\nStory continues\n\nFortune spoke to a dozen Amazon customer service employees and managers, all of whom requested anonymity either because Amazon policies prohibit them from speaking to the press without permission or because they don’t want to risk losing out on severance that the company is offering them. Throughout the conversations, one common theme emerged: The workers believe the future of their work is more tenuous than it was yesterday and more difficult than ever before.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan told Fortune that business leaders and teams are empowered to make their own staffing and investment decisions, and that leadership has been managing through an unprecedented series of events, including the global pandemic and the resulting unpredictable shifts in consumer demand and the labor market.\n\nWhen Fortune told Amazon that Amazon employees and managers estimate that anywhere between a couple hundred and 600 roles were recently eliminated, the spokesperson would only confirm that more than 100 positions were cut.\n\nIn the U.S., Amazon provided 60 days of pay and benefits to the customer service managers who were recently laid off, plus severance. Some may be reassigned to another Amazon role if there’s a fit elsewhere in the company, and Amazon said that’s already occurred in some instances.\n\nIn a statement, she said that the opinions and anecdotes of the 12 employees who spoke to Fortune “do not match the data” that Amazon gleans from the thousands of customer service employees it regularly surveys. “Overall, the majority of our frontline customer service employees report having high job satisfaction, and in fact, it is up this year versus last,” she said.\n\nThe \"low-level guys\"\n\nWithin the vast universe of Amazon workers, which totaled 1.5 million full- and part-time employees at the end of March, customer service representatives inhabit a curious middle zone—not exactly fitting within the ranks of the warehouse workers and delivery drivers, nor entirely within the corporate realm of engineers, salespeople, and other office folks. SEATTLE, WA - JUNE 16: People walk past the signature glass spheres under construction at the Amazon corporate headquarters on June 16, 2017 in Seattle, Washington. Amazon announced that it will buy Whole Foods Market, Inc. for over $13 billion. (Photo by David Ryder/Getty Images)\n\nThe Amazon managers who were laid off are salaried employees who might make somewhere between $60,000 and $80,000 a year in the U.S. if they were promoted internally. (Amazon’s spokesperson said that range is below the average, but declined to provide more detail.) They aren’t paid overtime but have job commitments that could at times necessitate working 50 to 60 hours a week, employees told Fortune. They are also eligible to earn some Amazon stock based on their performance.\n\nAt the lower level, Amazon customer service agents, or CSAs, get paid hourly (from just north of $15 to a couple of dollars over $20 in the U.S.) to respond by phone, email, chat, and social to questions and complaints from shoppers and Amazon device users when online self-service tools don't suffice. While some agents work out of call centers, many work remotely from home. In 2022, Amazon moved more employees from call centers to remote positions, reportedly to save money on real estate costs. Amazon also outsources some customer service work to third-party companies, employees said.\n\nDespite Amazon’s longtime tenet that it “strives to be Earth’s most customer-centric company,” the common feeling among customer service employees, however long they have worked at the company, is not so warm and fuzzy. “We are the low-level guys, the ones who cost something,” said one longtime customer service manager.\n\n“We definitely are seen as a cost to the company and that’s something that they remind us of often,” said a longtime manager laid off recently.\n\nAs with most things at Amazon, customer service teams operate in a culture of thrift and efficiency (even at its corporate offices, Amazon’s idea of employee perks leans more toward free bananas than the complimentary gourmet food found at Google). In recent years, however, the push to squeeze costs out of the customer service team has been more pronounced, sources said. All customer service managers and employees who spoke to Fortune said that the already small budgets for rewarding agents with modest gift cards or swag have been slashed or eliminated over the last few years.\n\n“They have cut down all our engagement budgets,” one said: “everything related to improve a team's morale, relieve stress, make them feel like they belong to the company.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson disputed that “engagement” budgets have been cut despite claims to the contrary from frontline agents as well as managers with direct knowledge of such budgeting.\n\nAmazon previously told Fortune that the restructuring was intended to help shrink the gap between higher levels of management and customers. But some managers and frontline agents who spoke to Fortune expressed concern about how much the workloads of the remaining managers will increase, and how customer escalations from frontline agents might get lost in the shuffle.\n\nThe mental health toll of vitriolic diatribes\n\nThe cutbacks have come at the same time that Amazon has made it more difficult for customer service agents to provide concessions to customers as easily as they once did, according to employees, some of whom also say that scammers, and customers who have been the victims of scammers, have grown alongside Amazon’s sales. Customers who abuse Amazon return policies may also be partly to blame.\n\nThe upshot for Amazon customer service employees is that accomplishing day-to-day tasks is more challenging, and often accompanied by abuse.\n\n“We’ve become so restrictive and set on frugality that it’s become an uphill climb for even a reasonable customer to get help,” one longtime manager said.\n\nWhile Amazon helped create the expectation of free returns for the e-commerce industry, the company’s returns process can be at times friction-filled, and employees say it has gotten worse. “It’s just not the customer service that people once knew Amazon for,” one said. Andrew Jassy, chief executive officer of web services for Amazon.com Inc., speaks during the 2019 CERAWeek by IHS Markit conference in Houston, Texas, U.S., on Monday, March 11, 2019.

Photographer: F. Carter Smith/Bloomberg via Getty Images\n\nLongtime employees say this cost-focused environment has exacerbated what some consider to be a mental health crisis among Amazon’s CS agents. They say a dramatic shift began during the early days of the COVID-19 pandemic, when customers who were bound by stay-at-home orders began spewing the type of vitriol at phone agents that they’d never consider unleashing face to face.\n\nCustomers wishing rape or death on Amazon customer service employees is now not unheard-of. Diatribes laced with profanity have become more of the norm.\n\n“The amount of coworkers who’ve told me something like, ‘I don’t think I’d step in front of a bus but I probably wouldn’t move if one was coming,’ is high,” one longtime Amazon employee said.\n\nManagers have taken notice.\n\n“I am very concerned about the mental health of people who report to me and the stress they are under,” one longtime customer service manager told Fortune.\n\nAmazon spokesperson Margaret Callahan said the company cares “deeply about our employee experience and works hard to continually improve it.” She added that Amazon has programs and resources in place for employees who deal with a “difficult” or abusive interaction, and that CSAs can terminate a customer conversation if a warning doesn’t curb the customer’s behavior.\n\nAmazon also disputed claims from longtime employees and managers that it is harder for them to provide customer concessions than in the past, but noted that the company has worked over the past two years to more consistently apply its concessions policies in different markets around the world.\n\n“We’re not perfect, and when mistakes occur, we’re not only diligent to remediate it with our customer, but we also use the situation as a learning opportunity that fuels continuous improvement to our tools, processes, and policies,” Amazon’s Callahan said.\n\nA new worry: Are you training your chatbot replacement?\n\nWhile some of these issues have percolated for years, a newer one is causing significant strife throughout Amazon’s customer service operation—and AI fears are partly to blame. Recently, Amazon leaders have mandated that customer service agents exclusively use a new internal software tool to resolve customer issues. The software program, known as AC3, has been in development for years, but only recently has access to the previous tool been cut off.\n\nThe first issue with the program, according to frontline employees and managers alike, is that the tool is slow and full of bugs, with some agents telling Fortune that it can extend customer interactions by two to three times the previous average. Whereas the old tool used to easily allow an agent to browse a customer’s Amazon history, the tool now mainly prompts employees to follow a Q&A process.\n\nIn a role where efficiency goals are stressed, the software hiccups are anxiety-inducing for frontline reps. Consistently missing these goals can affect job security and promotion eligibility, employees told Fortune. Even one manager who believes the tool holds great promise admits it was rolled out before it was ready for prime time.\n\n“It is defective,” the manager said.\n\nThe tool has also severely limited the amount of customer information and purchase history that Amazon customer service agents can access, employees told Fortune. While several managers said limiting access could be a win for customer privacy, they also admitted it often makes resolving issues much more complicated and could actually end up benefiting customers with a history of abusing Amazon’s return policies because representatives are effectively blind to useful, historical context. Several employees described their work as attempting to help customers with a hand tied behind their back.\n\nAn Amazon spokesperson said the company continues to invest in tools to improve both the customer and employee experience, and uses feedback to improve.\n\nTo make matters worse, some employees also fear that the software tool is designed in such a way that they are essentially helping train their AI replacement. A new structured Q&A flow that agents are now required to follow has struck some workers as an odd, and largely unnecessary, process for their routine interactions with customers. Another possible clue, according to one employee: After an agent resolves a refund issue for a customer using AC3, the final messaging on the screen is written as if a customer is viewing it, not an agent.\n\n“It was employee-facing before and now it’s customer-facing,” one customer service employee said. “It was almost like the customer could do this themselves.”\n\nAnother current longtime customer service manager claimed to Fortune that their superior has confirmed as much.\n\n“It learns,” the longtime manager said of the software. “We are training AI. It’s not speculation.”\n\nThe Amazon spokesperson did not offer a comment on the idea that employees are training AI through the tool.\n\nConsidering the AI hype cycle currently dominating the business world, no one should blame customer service agents for thinking the worst. The company’s Amazon Web Services division, after all, is currently marketing its own AI chatbot service specifically to call centers. These fears are not materializing out of thin air.\n\nFrom the most recent layoffs, to the stress and verbal abuse they encounter regularly, to their dissatisfaction with the new work tool, Amazon customer service employees are wondering whether company executives are even aware of their plight—and whether they should still be able to boast of customer obsession with a straight face.\n\n“I was excited to join the company years ago,” one longtime manager told Fortune. “I thought we were revolutionary at the time.”\n\n“Now,” they added, “we are exactly the same as anyone else.”\n\nAre you a current or former Amazon employee with thoughts on this topic or a tip to share?

        "content": "Jeff Bezos, a household name synonymous with Amazon, revolutionized e-commerce. But years ago, Amazon was just a dream Jeff Bezos shared with his brother and sister.\n\nIn the mid-1990s, investing in an online bookstore was a bold move. Bezos's siblings, Mark and Christina, took that leap. In 1996, they invested $10,000 each in Amazon, acquiring 30,000 shares. Today, those shares are potentially worth over $1.26 billion each.\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nThe average American couple has saved this much money for retirement — How do you compare? A new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offers a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends. Here’s how you can invest today.\n\nIn 1996, a $10,000 investment in Amazon was considered a substantial risk. However, a 2018 Bloomberg report revealed that when Amazon's stock price reached $91, their shares were valued at $640 million each.\n\nAt an Amazon share of $146, Bezos's siblings' stakes were valued at $1.025 billion each, as reported by Luxury Launches. Now, with the shares priced at $179, their stakes have grown to approximately $1.26 billion, marking an astonishing return of more than 12,566,658%. It's important to note that there is no public information on whether they have retained their shares.\n\nBezos founded Amazon in July 1994, envisioning the untapped potential of e-commerce. Despite the internet's limited use by government and educational institutions at the time, Bezos was committed to his vision.\n\nConvincing others to invest, however, proved challenging. Bezos held 60 meetings with family, friends, and potential investors, but 38 of them declined. Some of those who declined later admitted to regretting their decision, either accepting it as a life lesson or finding it difficult to discuss.\n\nTrending: Can you guess how many Americans successfully retire with $1,000,000 saved? The percentage may shock you.\n\nEven Bezos’ parents were warned about the 70% risk of losing their investment. In the book \"The Everything Store: Jeff Bezos and the Age of Amazon,\" he reportedly stated, \"I want you to know what the risks are because I still want to come home for Thanksgiving if this doesn't work.\"\n\nAmazon did face challenges along the way, including the dot-com bubble. The company went public on May 15, 1997, with shares priced at $18. Despite the challenges, Amazon survived and thrived, expanding far beyond its initial focus to become a tech giant with a market cap of $1.5 trillion.\n\nDespite their low public profiles, Mark and Christina Bezos have remained integral to Amazon's story. Mark pursued a successful career in advertising and philanthropy, while Christina has focused on family and charitable efforts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Bezos siblings' Amazon investment is undeniably a legendary success story. While not everyone has a brother like Jeff, their experience highlights the immense potential of investing in innovative startups.\n\nHigh risk often leads to high rewards, but this isn't the right path for everyone. If you're considering venturing into startup investments, it's wise to consult a financial advisor. They can help you assess whether this type of investment aligns with your financial goals and risk tolerance. Remember, while the allure of high returns is tempting, safer and more stable investment options are available to suit different preferences and financial situations.\n\nRead Next:\n\nWarren Buffett flipped his neighbor's $67,000 life savings into a $50 million fortune — How much is that worth today?

        "content": "A group of UK retailers are suing Amazon for damages of up to £1.1 billion, over claims it misused their data and pushed them out of the market to inflate its own profits.\n\nThe British Independent Retailers Association (Bira) said it was the biggest collective action ever launched by UK retailers.\n\nThe claim is being filed by the group, on behalf of UK retailers, at a specialist London tribunal on Thursday.\n\nBira alleges that Amazon’s UK marketplace illegally used data belonging to competing sellers to market rival products for a cheaper price.\n\nIt primarily took place between 2015 and 2023, before new rules set by the European Commission came into effect.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nThe information it took helped it decide which products it should sell itself, at what price, and which consumers to target, therefore benefiting its own retail operations, according to the claim.\n\nShoppers can buy products sold directly from Amazon, or through independent sellers who list their products on the marketplace.\n\nMore than 80% of Amazon’s UK purchases are made by customers using a system dubbed the “buy box”, whereby shoppers make a purchase using the “buy now” or “add to basket” buttons.\n\nBira also alleges in its claim that Amazon manipulated the buy box to favour its own products and conceal those belonging to rival sellers.\n\nAmazon has long challenged claims that it misuses the information it collects from third-party retailers, and that it uses the buy box to favour its own retail operations.\n\nIt also agreed to a number of commitments after the UK competition watchdog opened an investigation into its practices in 2022.\n\nBira, represented by law firm Willkie Farr & Gallagher, estimated that Amazon could be forced to pay out as much as £1.1 billion in damages if the case is successful. Amazon is being sued by a group of UK retailers over claims it misused data from third-party sellers (Ben Birchall/PA)\n\nIt said this was calculated using economic analysis of data showing online sales made on Amazon’s UK marketplace.\n\nIf the tribunal agrees to proceed with the class action, then a trial could not happen until the middle of 2026, unless Amazon agrees to make the retailers involved a settlement offer beforehand.\n\nStory continues\n\nAndrew Goodacre, Bira’s chief executive, said Amazon has become the “dominant marketplace in the UK” for people shopping online.\n\n“As a result, for small retailers with limited resources, Amazon is the marketplace to start online trading,” he said.\n\n“The British public has a strong relationship with its local, independent retailers and ensuring they are not put out of business by Amazon’s illegal actions is a key driving force behind this collective action.\n\n“This is a watershed moment for UK retailers, but especially for small independent retailers in this country.”\n\nAmazon has been contacted for comment.",

        "content": "LONDON (Reuters) - Amazon is facing a one billion-pound ($1.3 billion) collective lawsuit from British retailers who allege that the online marketplace misused their data to boost its own market share and profits.\n\nThe British Independent Retailers Association (BIRA), an umbrella body grouping numerous small traders, was due to file the lawsuit on behalf of around 35,000 retailers at the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) in London on Thursday, its lawyers said.\n\nThe suit alleges that Amazon made use of non-public data provided by retailers selling goods on Amazon's Marketplace to offer cheaper rival products for sale directly to consumers.\n\nBIRA Chief Executive Andrew Goodacre said small retailers had little choice but to use Amazon, given its reach, but that the case was intended to stop it putting them out of business.\n\n\"The filing of the claim today is the first step towards retailers obtaining compensation for what Amazon has done,\" Goodacre said in a statement.\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nBIRA's case also alleges that Amazon manipulated the \"Buy Box\" feature on its website, shown near the top of product pages, to its own advantage.\n\nThe \"Buy Box\" is the subject of a separate lawsuit brought on behalf of consumers and valued at up to 900 million pounds ($1.1 billion).\n\nBritain's Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said in 2022 that it was investigating Amazon, including the way it selects the products placed within the \"Buy Box\".\n\nLast year, the CMA said it had accepted commitments from Amazon to help protect fair competition on its retail platform.\n\n($1 = 0.7830 pounds)\n\n(Reporting by Sam Tobin; Editing by Kevin Liffey)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.\n\nNvidia’s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, “Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.”\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the “Magnificent Seven” companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Streamers like Netflix, Max, and Peacock are raising prices — here’s why",
        "content": "It's getting more expensive to watch your favorite streaming shows — especially if you want to watch them without commercials.\n\nAd-free streaming plans have become a primary target of price increases as media companies like Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN) raise the costs of their respective offerings — all while keeping the prices of cheaper, ad-supported options unchanged.\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive at first. Why would streamers want to raise the costs of premium tiers at a time when consumers are becoming more choosy about the services they subscribe to? Wouldn't they rather users sign up for more expensive options than cheaper ones?\n\nNot necessarily, experts say.\n\n\"When you want to optimize revenue, you would actually increase the price of the ad-free tier because even if users turn to the ads, you're still making the same money,\" said Marc DeBevoise, who helped launch CBS All Access and now serves as CEO of streaming tech company Brightcove.\n\nDeBevoise explained it all boils down to the additional ad revenue per user. Added on top of the subscription price of the lower tier, the total revenue per user will typically end up matching the premium option.\n\nThat's why companies may decide to increase ad-free pricing since they want to be \"economically differentiated in the two plans,\" DeBevoise said.\n\n\"You want to have the ad-free tier effectively make you more money per user per month, if possible. So I could see [companies] tweaking the pricing for that reason,\" he continued. \"These are revenue maximizing opportunities, not necessarily trying to push more subscribers [to the ad tier.]\"\n\nEarlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced it will raise the prices of its ad-free plans on its streaming service, Max, by $1 each to $16.99 for ad-free and $20.99 for its “ultimate” tier, which allows four concurrent streams and 4K streaming options. The price hikes come just ahead of the second season of Warner Bros.' blockbuster \"Game of Thrones\" prequel, \"House of the Dragon,\" which is scheduled for release on June 16.\n\nPrior to Max's increases, Comcast's (CMCSA) flagship streaming service, Peacock, announced price hikes that will come in July, just ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, after it upped prices for the first time last summer.\n\nThe streamer plans to raise prices by $2 for its Peacock Premium plan and mostly ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier to $7.99 and $13.99, respectively.\n\nThe timing of both companies’ respective increases is important.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You seek to raise the prices in two types of moments. One is when you know folks don't want to cancel and you have a large, full-ordered audience that wants to stick around for the amazing things you're about to deliver,\" DeBevoise said, referencing Peacock's upcoming Olympics coverage and Max's \"House of the Dragon\" premiere.\n\n\"The other is when people are not paying attention and just let their subscriptions roll on their credit cards,\" he added, noting many price adjustments are often tested on a smaller cohort of users before platforms roll them out to a larger subscriber base. It's getting more expensive to watch your favorite streaming shows (Courtesy: Getty Images) (simpson33 via Getty Images)\n\nVirtually all of the major streaming companies raised the cost of their respective services throughout the course of last year amid greater profitability challenges and a push to reaccelerate top-line growth.\n\nBut subscribers aren't necessarily sticking around. According to the latest data from consumer measurement platform Antenna released at the end of May, US subscriber churn — or the act of paying users abandoning their streaming plans — stood at 4.6% in April, higher than the 4.2% seen in the same month last year. Still, the data was well off of the records reported at the start of the year in January, when overall churn came in at 6.1%.\n\nIn terms of whether or not there will be a ceiling on price hikes, DeBevoise said media companies are still \"figuring out the audience,\" especially as the content bundle consistently shifts for each streamer over time — whether it be tentpole event coverage like the Olympics or the exclusive rights to a sports game.\n\n\"Ultimately, they're trying to find a very profitable model,\" he said. \"The real question will be exactly what price. You're going to see that continue to be tested.\"\n\nThat means more price hikes will likely be on the horizon.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Tech Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "With all the tech attention on market movers like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), it can seem like tech stocks are too late to get in on. However, one of the beauties of the American economy is the constant innovation its competitive landscape drives. Smaller tech companies are making moves every day, even if the attention they receive seems disproportionately low.\n\nHowever, these unrecognized and undervalued tech stocks can still significantly boost an investor’s portfolio over time. As with all investing, buying into a position at the right time is exceptionally important. For example, when a stock’s intrinsic value has not been met by its market price, the theoretical upside potential can be the difference between the two, or a further increased trajectory depending on the stock’s popularity.\n\nThus, investors should not shy away from value tech stocks that may not have the most glamorous or exciting reputation while consistently performing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMarathon Digital Holdings (MARA) In this photo illustration, the Marathon Digital Holdings (MARA) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD) mining can be costly and risky. Yet in the case of Marathon Digital Holdings (NASDAQ:MARA), the business model has proven exceptionally lucrative, despite relatively reluctant investor engagement. The company runs and manages its own entirely vertically integrated system for Bitcoin mining; from its firmware to hardware design, and even cooling infrastructure.\n\nThis allows MARA to efficiently extract and store a large amount of bitcoin in its corporate treasury. The catch, however, is that this treasury relies on market interest in Bitcoin, to be high enough to translate to a generous cash amount. Despite this risk, as of right now, MARA commands an attractive price-to-earnings ratio of 14.49x and a price-to-book ratio of 3.53x.\n\nThese metrics suggest the stock is undervalued compared to the broader crypto technology sector. Thus, for investors seeking undervalued tech stocks to get in on, MARA could be a solid pick so long as Bitcoin stays relevant.\n\nConcentrix (CNXC) 3D rendering of human on technology background\n\nSource: whiteMocca / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs a technological services company, Concentrix (NASDAQ:CNXC) maintains a broad array of customers through which it has been able to grow its financial stability. The company recently reported an impressive revenue increase of 46.83% year-over-year (YOY) for its Q1 earnings report. This brought it to quarterly revenue of $2.4 billion but disappeared behind a 62.37% increase YOY in operating expenses, which cost $678 million and brought net income down to $52 million for the quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe result? Despite stunning revenue growth, the company’s stock has been on a gentle discount trajectory. The stock is down roughly 37% year-to-date and may tumble further before its next earnings report. However, this dip in share value is not representative of the company’s growth and influence, as it recently debuted on the Fortune 500 list in 499th place.\n\nThe company continues to excel at expanding its service categories, from customer relations to information technology consulting, and will likely continue to grow revenue through the second half of 2024.\n\nTelesat (TSAT) an abstract graphic of the earth in the cosmos\n\nAs a company focused on communications infrastructure based in space, Telesat (NASDAQ:TSAT) will see its share of ups and downs over the years. That’s simply a reality of the costly process of producing satellites for geosynchronous and low Earth orbits that are at consistent risk from debris. Moreover, the company has seen a slowdown in revenue growth, with anticipated declines priced in for 2024.\n\nThe value proposition for Telesat is in its future networks, however. Once its broadband satellite coverage is completely operational, the company can take advantage of a rapidly growing subsection of telecommunications and internet provision. This will open revenue streams for internet infrastructure in many of the more remote and underdeveloped regions of the world where people live but do not have easy internet access.\n\nThus, TSAT could be undervalued for its prospects, especially considering its price-to-earnings ratio of 1.36x and price-to-book of 0.26x.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Teamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections",
        "content": "It's been an eventful few weeks for the Teamsters. (Photo: Jim Allen/FreightWaves)\n\nThe Teamsters union has recorded several organizing or contract-signing victories in the past few weeks, but a step it has taken toward representing at least one group of Amazon workers has garnered the biggest headlines.\n\nAn independent labor union that won representation at a Staten Island, New York, warehouse in 2022, a victory that Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) is fighting, has agreed to come under the umbrella of the Teamsters, according to media reports. The Teamsters posted an announcement about the agreement on the company’s X (formerly Twitter) feed.\n\nThe Amazon Labor Union (ALU) is the grassroots organization that won a 2022 vote to unionize more than 8,000 workers at a giant Amazon facility in Staten Island. Efforts by national labor unions at other Amazon facilities have failed; the Retail Wholesale and Department Store Union is seeking a third election at an Amazon warehouse in Bessemer, Alabama.\n\nThe tie-up between the Teamsters and the ALU, announced Tuesday, needs to be ratified by the more than 8,000 rank-and-file members before becoming official.\n\nThe ALU has not been able to sign a contract with Amazon, which is fighting a legal battle against the union on several fronts.\n\nThere also have been multiple reports of strife within the union, which failed in an organizing vote at another Amazon warehouse on Staten Island soon after its victory. The ALU win in its first Staten Island vote remains the only time a union has won a representation election at an Amazon facility.\n\nLocal union needs a big ally\n\nHarry Katz, a professor at Cornell University and the president of the International Labor and Employment Relations Association, told FreightWaves that the ALU had preliminary discussions with the Teamsters about some sort of affiliation soon after it was elected but that the talks fell short.\n\nThe advice and guidance the ALU is getting as an independent union “doesn’t compare to the know-how and resources that the Teamsters has,” Katz said.\n\nGiven the extensive use of outside transportation companies Amazon uses, some of them with companies whose drivers have Teamsters representation, “what the Teamsters potentially provides is leverage against Amazon,” Katz said.\n\nWhile mounting some sort of secondary boycott is illegal, Katz said, the Teamsters may be able to find a way to “hassle” the online retailer.\n\nBut it still will be a challenging battle. Although the ALU was voted in by the rank and file, that only mandates that Amazon bargain in “good faith.” “It’s very hard to ever reach a first contract because the law merely requires Amazon to bargain in good faith,” Katz said. “It doesn’t require that the parties reach agreement.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut with the Teamsters-ALU tie-up, Katz said it will need to be determined “whether the union at Amazon, affiliated with the Teamsters, can generate enough bargaining leverage to convince Amazon to sign its first agreement.”\n\nKate Bronfenbrenner, director of Labor Education Research and a senior lecturer at Cornell University’s School of Industrial and Labor Relations, described Amazon as “aggressive as an employer opposed to unions as you can get.” She added that fact “doesn’t mean the union can’t win, but it takes something much more than a one-local site can do.”\n\nRatification by the members of the ALU, she said, is “not a slam dunk.”\n\n3 wins in the field\n\nWhile the affiliation with the ALU may be the Teamsters story that has gotten the most attention, the more mundane work of organizing workers and signing contracts was positive in May for the union.\n\nA list of contract representation votes from the National Labor Relations Board records three successful Teamsters organization elections certified by the NLRB in recent weeks.\n\nOne of them is at 10 Roads Express, where the Teamsters last year successfully organized workers in Iowa and Nebraska. The company is primarily a contract carrier for the U.S. Postal Service.\n\nIn the latest election at the Greensboro, North Carolina, facility of 10 Roads, according to NLRB data, 42 votes were cast in favor of representation while 13 were cast in opposition. The election covers all full-time and regular part-time route drivers employed at the site, according to the NLRB.\n\nIn a statement celebrating the victory, the Teamsters said the vote was the latest step in a broader effort to unionize drivers at the company.\n\nThe Teamsters said the North Carolina victory brings its record to having unionized more than 300 workers at 10 Roads facilities in Colorado and New Jersey, as well as the North Carolina and Midwest successes.\n\n“The Teamsters’ victory in Greensboro will give us an even stronger foundation for more organizing at 10 Roads,” John A. Murphy, Teamsters national freight director, said in the prepared statement. “Our message to 10 Roads drivers everywhere is that the Teamsters are here to help you win what’s yours. This latest win further solidifies the Teamsters’ presence at 10 Roads and expands the growing movement among drivers to demand their rights and secure a better workplace.”\n\nOther victories recently certified by the NLRB were for smaller groups of workers.\n\nAt Performance Team Logistics, a subsidiary of Maersk (DKK: MAERSK-B.CO), a vote in May saw 14 votes in favor of unionization with Teamsters Local 179. Three votes were cast in opposition.\n\nNLRB described the pool of voters as all full-time and part-time drivers at Performance’s Elwood, Illinois facility.\n\nA spokeswoman for Maersk said Performance Team “owns and operates trucks and electric vehicles in various locations across the United States.” She added that there is unionization at other Performance Team facilities.\n\nThere are 19 workers impacted by the vote, she said. “While we prefer to work directly with our employees without the presence of a third party, we respect each employee’s right to make their own decision about whether to vote for a union,” the spokeswoman said.\n\nThe NLRB also recently certified a victory for Teamsters Local 481 at Penske Truck Leasing in El Centro, California. The good news for the Teamsters was that the vote was unanimous. But the grand total of votes was three. It covers maintenance technicians.\n\nThe Teamsters does not always announce local victories. But it does frequently highlight contract signings and has done so recently.\n\nContract signed at a Ryder outlet\n\nThe union’s workers at several Ryder Truck Rental (NYSE: R) facilities in Minnesota, represented by Local 974, have ratified a three-year contract that calls for a 14.5% increase in pay over the life of the deal. There are also benefit improvements for the 43 workers covered by the contract. They include more vacation time and strike protections.\n\nUnionization is widespread at Ryder. In the company’s 10-K filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission for this year, Ryder said the company has 98 separate labor agreements. Its workers are primarily represented by the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers, the United Auto Workers and the Teamsters.\n\nA Ryder spokeswoman confirmed the new deal and the size of the wage increase.\n\nRepresentatives from 10 Roads and the Teamsters had not responded to FreightWaves’ queries by publication time.\n\nMore articles by John Kingston\n\nTeamsters rack up late-2023 wins, stage significant strike in ’24\n\nTeamsters out at Southern California trucking company; other votes mixed\n\nWhy Teamsters is willing to sacrifice 22,000 union trucking jobs\n\nThe post Teamsters tie up with Staten Island Amazon union, win other elections appeared first on FreightWaves.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks That Are Screaming Buys in June",
        "content": "If the last few years have taught investors anything, it's the importance of keeping a long-term mindset when investing in the stock market. Macroeconomic headwinds in the post-COVID world sent the Nasdaq Composite plunging by 33% in 2022. Tech stocks were hit particularly hard as a spike in inflation curbed consumer and commercial spending.\n\nYet since the start of 2023, that same index has climbed by 60% thanks to economic improvements and excitement over emerging markets like artificial intelligence (AI). As a result, over that entire period -- from the end of 2021 until today -- it's up by about 7% again. And those who sold in 2022 will not have benefited from the surge many stocks have enjoyed since then.\n\nFor instance, tech giants Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) suffered stock declines of 55% and 50% in 2022. However, their share prices have since soared by 158% and 110%, respectively, as tech stocks have come back into favor.\n\nBoth companies have reputations for delivering consistent and significant gains over the long term. Meanwhile, coming developments indicate they will continue to profit from the tailwinds of tech for years. Here's why I see them as screaming buys in June.\n\nThe case for Advanced Micro Devices\n\nShares of AMD have risen by more than 4,000% since 2014, with the last decade likely the most crucial period in its 55-year history. CEO Lisa Su took the helm 10 years ago, pulled the company back from the brink of bankruptcy, and led it to an impressive recovery.\n\nDuring that period, AMD's annual revenue rose by 312% while operating income climbed by 169%. Much of its growth is owed to the launch of its line of Ryzen central processing units (CPUs) in 2017. Those powerful chips allowed AMD to consistently take market share from Intel and given it the funds to expand into other sectors.\n\nIndeed, AMD's CPU market share rose from 18% in the first quarter of 2017 to about 33% today. Meanwhile, Intel's fell from 82% to 64%.\n\nAMD's success has led it to delve into other areas of tech, such as AI. Over the last year, the company has released new AI graphics processing units (GPUs) to compete with the offerings of market leader Nvidia as it seeks to profit from soaring demand. Additionally, AMD is gradually expanding into the AI-capable PC market. According to a forecast from Canalys, AI-capable PCs will represent about 18% of all PC shipments this year, and that share is projected to more than double to 40% in 2025.\n\nWith solid positions in multiple areas of tech, AMD is on a promising growth trajectory. The company's stock is trading at a premium, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 47. However, the vast potential of AI and other industries will likely keep its stock rising for years, making AMD an attractive long-term investment to buy right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for Amazon\n\nAmazon was hit particularly hard during 2022 as reductions in consumer discretionary spending caused steep declines in its e-commerce business. However, impressive growth over the last year illustrated the company's ability to navigate tricky market conditions successfully.\n\nAmazon posted its first-quarter results on April 30. Revenue rose 13% year over year to $143 billion, outperforming Wall Street's consensus estimate by $750 million. Its retail business grew significantly throughout 2023, and the trend continued into this year. Revenue from Amazon's two e-commerce segments delivered combined growth of 12% as their operating income hit nearly $6 billion -- a considerable improvement on the $349 million in losses they posted in the prior-year period.\n\nIn addition to solid gains in retail, sales in Amazon's advertising services division increased by 24% after it began showing ads on the Prime Video streaming platform. It's still early days for the company's ad business, but it's a promising growth driver.\n\nAll eyes were on Amazon's cloud growth this earnings season, as it represents the tech giant's expanding role in AI with Amazon Web Services (AWS). The platform reported 17% revenue growth in Q1 as operating income spiked 84% year over year. Amazon is investing heavily in AWS' AI capabilities by building new data centers worldwide, launching new AI tools, and venturing into chip production.\n\nThanks to its thoroughly diverse business model and vast financial resources, Amazon is easily one of the best growth stocks available. Its price-to-sales ratio sits at an attractive 3, which could be a bargain valuation that makes Amazon a screaming buy this June.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: This Will Be Wall Street's First $5 Trillion Stock",
        "content": "Over the long run, the stock market has proved to be a superior wealth creator. Over the last century, no other asset class has come anywhere close to matching the annualized average return generated by stocks.\n\nBut not all stocks are created equally.\n\nOne of Wall Street's greatest attributes is that it's dynamic. History tells us that today's largest stocks are unlikely to be the biggest publicly traded companies 20 years from now. Ongoing innovation, mergers, acquisitions, legal judgments, competition, and a host of other factors are constantly shaking up the \"leaderboard\" on Wall Street.\n\nDespite this unpredictability, I strongly believe one of the largest companies on today's leaderboard can overcome historic odds and become the first stock to reach a $5 trillion market cap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt won't be these three widely touted \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nFor a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, it would have to be an industry leader that's fueled by innovation and generates boatloads of cash flow. In other words, the perfect definition of companies found in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" However, some of the most-logical candidates among the Magnificent Seven are the stocks I believe are least likely to reach the psychological $5 trillion level.\n\nFor example, the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), probably looks like a no-brainer to become the world's largest company by market cap. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in high-compute data centers, which has afforded the company exceptional pricing power.\n\nOn the other hand, investors have, without fail, overestimated the adoption of every next-big-thing innovation or new technology for 30 years. Although AI is the hottest thing on Wall Street, most businesses aren't even sure how to utilize the technology to drive additional sales and profits. It's going to take time for AI utility to evolve, which likely means an AI bubble-bursting event is coming at some point in the future.\n\nI'll also add that Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise about 40% of its net sales, are all developing GPUs for their AI-accelerated data centers. Even if these chips are used in just a complementary fashion to Nvidia's GPUs, it likely signals a peak in order activity.\n\nI wouldn't count on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) being the first $5 trillion stock, either. Though Apple's iPhone dominates in the domestic smartphone market, and the company has repurchased a truly jaw-dropping $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013, its growth engine has completely stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, every physical product segment for Apple saw sales decline. Some of this decline can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, personal computer sales are retracing now that workers have returned to the office. But continued weakness in iPhone sales suggests that recent innovations aren't hitting home with consumers.\n\nElectric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is unlikely to be the first $5 trillion stock, as well. Despite being North America's leading EV manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company to generate a recurring profit, Tesla's growth engine has sputtered and its efforts to become more than a car company have predominantly fallen flat.\n\nGrowing competition in the EV arena has encouraged Tesla to slash its prices on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. These price cuts have reduced Tesla's operating margin from 17.2% to just 5.5%. With EV inventory levels still rising, additional margin-crushing price cuts may be necessary.\n\nFurthermore, CEO Elon Musk has given investors few reasons to cheer. Though he's overseen the introduction of five mass-produced models (3, S, X, Y, and Cybertruck), the overwhelming majority of Musk's promised innovations haven't been fulfilled. If these promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, the company looks anything but \"magnificent.\" Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $5 trillion stock will be...\n\nAmong the handful of companies that have helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to record highs, it's e-commerce colossus Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) that has the best chance to be Wall Street's first $5 trillion stock.\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is the face of the company, online retail sales produce razor-thin margins and are minimally relevant when it comes to generating operating cash flow and net income. It's Amazon's three faster-growing and higher-margin ancillary operating segments that give it the ability to become Wall Street's largest publicly traded company.\n\nIt all starts with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Even though businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending, AWS surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales, as of the March-ended quarter. This is a considerably higher-margin segment than e-commerce, and it'll consistently grow at a much faster pace. As a stand-alone business, I believe AWS could be worth up to $3 trillion by the end of the decade, based on its current growth trajectory.\n\nThe second all-important operating segment that can help carry Amazon to a $5 trillion valuation is subscription services. Before stepping down as CEO, Jeff Bezos announced in April 2021 that his company had leaped above 200 million global Prime subscribers. The steady growth of its online marketplace, along with securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, gives Amazon strong pricing power with Prime.\n\nThe third puzzle piece is its advertising segment. Amazon is attracting in the ballpark of 2.5 billion unique visitors to its website on a monthly basis. Since of most of these visitors are motivated shoppers, Amazon has an insatiable dangling carrot that encourages advertisers to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of shoppers.\n\nCollectively, these three segments are what generate almost all of Amazon's operating cash flow.\n\nWhile earnings per share (EPS) is a smart measure of value for mature businesses, Amazon tends to reinvest a majority of its cash flow into high-growth initiatives. Though this can, at times, have a negative impact on its EPS, these aggressive investments are rapidly increasing its cash flow -- and cash flow is a far better measure of value for Amazon. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nDuring the entirety of the 2010s, Amazon closed out each year at a multiple of 23 to 37 times forward-year cash flow. Put another way, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times operating cash flow to own shares of Amazon during the prior decade.\n\nBy 2027, Wall Street's consensus calls for $18.64 in cash flow per share. Based on where Amazon closed on Friday, May 31, this would place it at a multiple of just 9.5 times cash flow. If Amazon were to sustain a 10% annualized growth rate in cash flow through 2030 (based on the $18.64-per-share consensus for 2027), its multiple would drop to just 7.\n\nAmazon's stock can comfortably rise by the 172% needed to reach a $5 trillion valuation and still come in well below its median cash flow multiple from the previous decade. Among Wall Street's most-influential businesses, it has the clearest path to an eventual $5 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Dell Stock (NYSE:DELL): Still Too Expensive Despite Recent Plunge",
        "content": "Hardware, storage, and peripherals manufacturer Dell (NYSE:DELL) has become one of the most popular artificial intelligence (AI) stocks in the market today. After the company reported its most recent earnings results at the end of May, the stock price crashed nearly 20% because of all the built-up hype and enthusiasm accumulated in Dell’s stock price. Even with the recent sell-off, I still tend to see Dell as a company trading at too expensive a valuation not to have its business entirely AI-driven, so I have a neutral stance on the company.\n\nIn this article, I’ll dive deeper into its latest quarterly results to see what’s happening at Dell.\n\nDell’s Fiscal Q1 2025 in Review\n\nThe Round Rock-based company delivered nearly everything investors wanted to hear in its most recent quarter. Sales increased annually by 6.2% to $22.2 billion for the period ending May 3, surpassing Wall Street estimates of $21.6 billion. Profit, excluding certain items, was $1.27 per share, in line with the consensus.\n\nBefore delving into the details, it’s important to note that Dell operates in two distinct business segments: the Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG), which deals with servers, networking, and storage, and the personal computing Client Solutions Group (CSG). While the latter has faced challenges in recent years, the server business is thriving, primarily due to the significant investment in AI spending in this sector.\n\nThis was precisely the panorama reported in recent earnings for Fiscal Q1 2025. Dell reported Infrastructure Solutions Group (ISG) revenue of $9.2 billion, up 22% year-over-year, with record servers and networking revenue of $5.5 billion, up 42%, while Client Solutions Group (CSG) revenue was $12.0 billion, flat year-over-year, with commercial client revenue at $10.2 billion, up just 3%.\n\nOne of the main areas of market interest is AI, where Dell has significant growth potential. The company reported that its AI server backlog was $3.8 billion, increasing sequentially by approximately $900 million. In other words, demand for orders has been outpacing Dell’s ability to deliver, primarily due to the growth in the AI sector.\n\nHowever, the impacts of AI aren’t solely restricted to ISG. Another important point highlighted by Dell is the optimism surrounding CSG. Commercial PC demand is anticipated to experience a significant improvement as the year progresses into a new refresh cycle, driven not only by an upcoming Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Windows refresh cycle but also by an anticipated increase in PC demand as the industry makes major advancements in AI-enabled architectures and applications.\n\nStory continues\n\nDell’s Next Steps Toward AI\n\nDell’s management also emphasized the company’s plans to capitalize on AI in the short term. The company launched the Dell AI Factory, which should help accelerate its adoption of AI by combining workload-optimized solutions with an open ecosystem for partners such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Meta (NASDAQ:META).\n\nIn addition, Dell has enhanced its direct-to-chip liquid cooling technology with a GPU server that boosts power efficiency by 2.5 times. This innovation is crucial for hyperscaler companies, including leading Big Tech firms in the cloud industry like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), which seek power-efficient solutions for their extensive server requirements and costly GPUs.\n\nBy offering more power-efficient solutions, it will be possible to lower costs and enhance industry performance. At the current level, Dell stands out as one of the main alternatives to provide this support and improve the efficiency and profitability of companies’ AI capabilities.\n\nThe Turning Point in Dell’s Quarter\n\nIn general, Dell’s reported results were fairly consistent, with several positive points to praise. But even when everything seemed to be going well in Round Rock, Texas, there was still a significant problem that the company was going to communicate to its shareholders: Dell’s guidance regarding its gross margin, which will be partly dragged lower by AI-optimized servers.\n\n“Given inflationary input costs, the competitive environment, and a higher mix of AI-optimized servers, we expect our gross margin rate to decline roughly 150 basis points,” Dell’s CFO said during the earnings call.\n\nAlthough Dell’s management team emphasized its commitment to a disciplined cost structure, expecting operating expenses to fall by low-single digits, around 3% annually by 2024, this was not enough to reassure investors. As a result, that was the inflection point for a major sell-off in Dell’s stock following the earnings call.\n\nOf course, the reasons for Wall Street’s disillusionment with Dell’s results didn’t stop there.\n\nThe adverse reaction emphasizes that Dell has been priced with very high expectations regarding its AI potential. Shares had appreciated by around 280% in the last 12 months until the earnings day. This took the company from a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of about 16x in May 2023 to a multiple that reached beyond 36x in late May 2024. It’s at ~28x today, reflecting its revaluation based on its AI capabilities.\n\nI still believe that Dell is an expensive company relative to its growth since it’s not an AI-only business. Dell’s AI segment accounts for less than 40% of its overall revenue. Given this fact and the little-to-no growth prospects for the rest of the business in the long term, I don’t think Dell deserves the premium valuation of about double that of its peers.\n\nIs DELL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe analyst consensus toward DELL is bullish, giving the stock a Strong Buy rating. The average Dell stock price target, based on projections from 12 Wall Street analysts over the last three months, stands at $157.15 for the next 12 months. This implies 14.2% upside potential.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDell reported another consistent and promising quarter. However, it was overshadowed by its gross margin guidance, which fell below market expectations.\n\nWe’re still in the early days of the AI-server boom, and Dell is doing well to establish its presence in this market. However, the company’s shift from a hardware focus to an AI-centric business has led to a high valuation multiple, creating challenges in accurately assessing how much AI will contribute to Dell’s market value.\n\nConsidering that Dell seems overpriced for a hardware company—and hardware is still its main source of revenue—the current valuation carries a high risk of slippage from expectations of increased profitability growth in AI. That said, I prefer to adopt a cautious stance, remaining neutral on Dell stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Walmart Stock (NYSE:WMT): The Recent Run May Not be Over",
        "content": "Walmart (NYSE:WMT) stock rallied after clocking in some incredible Fiscal Q1-2025 numbers that sparked one of its best single-day rallies in years. That’s not bad for an old big-box retailer in the new age of tech. As Walmart continues betting big on its e-commerce redesign, expansion of Walmart+, and product innovation, among other intriguing moves, a strong case could be made that WMT stock deserves to trade at a much higher multiple after its recent gains with higher-income consumers; perhaps one that’s more reminiscent of Costco (NASDAQ:COST), which trades at 50 times earnings.\n\nEither way, I wouldn’t bet against the $530 billion retailing colossus here, as its recent run may just be getting started. At writing, Walmart stock is trading at 28 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E). That’s certainly quite a high multiple for Walmart standards but one that’s still worth paying, given the bright spots in the company’s latest quarter. Moving forward, I expect the firm to double down on the efforts that ultimately led to a remarkable start to its fiscal year.\n\nRicher Customers Shopping at Walmart, But Walmart Needs Them to Stay\n\nWalmart isn’t just making impressive market share gains; it seems to be seeing an uptick in more affluent households, specifically those pulling in at least $100,000 yearly. Such richer customers helped Walmart achieve a rise in U.S. comparable store sales (or comps) by almost 4% in the last quarter. As you may know, the upper-middle-class customer is more Costco’s turf than Walmart’s.\n\nThough only time will tell where the well-off demographic takes their business in future quarters, my guess is that the recent surge is not just a mere outlier that’s to be ignored. Further, Walmart may have an opportunity to spruce things up a bit to become a more “upscale” place to shop.\n\nNotably, former Walmart U.S. CEO Bill Simon recently cautioned that wealthier consumers may take their business elsewhere once inflation returns back to normal. And after a pretty tame personal consumption expenditures (PCE) inflation figure (up 2.7% year-over-year in April), it certainly seems like the days of high inflation are coming to an end (thank goodness). However, I still view Walmart as having many tools that could help it retain the richer crowd it has welcomed in its doors recently.\n\nEven as food price deflation becomes the name of the game, Walmart still stands to be the cheapest place to shop. But richer customers may not care about price as much as quality and convenience once inflation makes its round-trip back to (or even slightly below) 2% in coming quarters. And although Great Value (Walmart’s low-cost private-label brand) presents great value, it’s no Kirkland Signature (a Costco private label) when it comes to quality.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot to discount quality improvements made by Walmart’s cheapest private-label food brand, but it’s clear that Walmart needs to charge a bit more if it wants to boost the quality factor markedly higher. In short, Walmart needs some better goods, and it’s offering just that with its newest private-label brand, Bettergoods. The brand isn’t necessarily targeting higher-income consumers, but they do seem to be channeling quality and innovation more than just seeking to drive down prices to the floor.\n\nBettergoods: The Kirkland Signature of Walmart?\n\nInitially, there will be just north of 300 Bettergoods products, many of which are still quite affordable at less than $5.00. Whether we’re talking cardamom rose raspberry jam or toasty salsa, it’s clear that such goods are unique-sounding enough to be considered a must-try, especially if one finds themselves with a bit more cash to splurge on something other than the cheapest possible item in a product category. Personally, I’m a big fan of the Bettergoods announcement. Still, I wouldn’t dub the brand as the new Kirkland just yet.\n\nEither way, I view such an addition to the Walmart brand roster as a potential tool to help keep the wealthier customers coming back. It’s clear Walmart has a formula that’s drawing in crowds, whether it be through its enhanced grocery-delivery service, the much-improved e-commerce platform, the value of the Walmart+ subscription (or Walmart Delivery Pass in Canada), or the wide selection of low-cost goods that help customers beat inflation.\n\nThe big question now is whether Walmart can position itself more competitively with a premium low-cost retailing heavyweight like Costco while retaining lower-income consumers. On the low-income front, Walmart has no issues with its outstanding value proposition (its Great Value brand is markedly cheaper than the big brand names) and the optionality of its membership program.\n\nHowever, I think a Walmart+ subscription brings further value to the table, even for those consumers who are just getting by. Undoubtedly, the main star of Walmart+ has to be the free delivery of groceries ordered from the digital platform.\n\nOver the years, Walmart has quietly powered ahead with its e-commerce prowess since bringing on the slew of talent from its Jet.com acquisition made all the way back in 2016. Though Jet.com shuttered four years after the deal was struck, the talented folks brought aboard have really helped leave long-lasting changes while directing the e-commerce team in the right direction.\n\nWhether we’re talking about a more intuitive web and mobile interface, enhanced data collection to improve (and personalize) the customer experience, or quick and easy access to weekly flyers and coupons, Walmart’s digital storefront has improved by leaps and bounds over the years, perhaps by enough to close off much of the gap with its top rival Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nWith the ability to offer quick and efficient grocery delivery, Walmart’s e-commerce platform now has something that even Amazon lacks: strength in grocery deliveries. With Walmart+ thrown in, perhaps Walmart finally deserves a gold star for catching up in the e-commerce race without skimping on its brick-and-mortar presence.\n\nIs WMT Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nOn TipRanks, WMT stock comes in as a Strong Buy. Out of 28 analyst ratings, there are 24 Buys, four Hold recommendations. The average WMT stock price target is $71, implying upside potential of 5.8%. Analyst price targets range from a low of $65.00 per share to a high of $75.00 per share.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nOn the middle-to-high income front, Walmart looks a heck of a lot more competitive with its Bettergoods products, which will probably be well worth the extra buck relative to the Great Value brand. Add the solid e-commerce and delivery capabilities into the equation, and Walmart may just have what it takes to nip at the heels of Costco and other rivals that higher-income consumers love to shop at.\n\nHeck, the convenience factor may be Walmart’s key to taking more share, given the absurd crowds over at the local Costco amid inflation. If anything, it’s quite inconvenient to head over to the local Costco during the weekend, as consumers from the area seek out bulk bargains.\n\nStill, don’t expect new customers, especially wealthier ones, to stop shopping at Walmart now that they’ve discovered the deals, the added convenience, and improved quality standards.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Whole Foods’ prices have never been more accessible to consumers and the chain has Jeff Bezos and Amazon to thank, said its founder.\n\nJohn Mackey, who founded Whole Foods in 1980 with a staff of 19 people, said after Amazon acquired the company in 2017 it shed its “whole paycheck,” reputation for sticker shock.\n\n“Amazon let us drop our prices four times,” Mackey told Fortune. “I hardly ever hear the ‘whole paycheck’ narrative any longer—that’s due to Amazon.”\n\nAlthough slashing prices cost the business revenue in the short term, Mackey knew it would make it stronger in the future, and he credits Amazon’s former CEO and current executive chairman Jeff Bezos with having the foresight to take that chance.\n\n“Jeff’s a brilliant man; he's a genius,” Mackey said “What I like about Jeff the most, besides he’s creative and entrepreneurial, is he thinks really long term.”\n\nThe organic supermarket chain is now going further to help attract consumers on a budget. The company has doubled down on sales and discounts for many products as well as savings options for Amazon Prime members. Last month at the Milken Institute Global Conference, Whole Foods CEO Jason Buechel told Yahoo Finance that the company plans to open 30 stores a year.\n\nWhole Foods’ efforts to cut prices are especially timely as inflation continues to weigh on Americans’ grocery budgets. Although inflation at the grocery store has shown signs of easing in recent months, prices are still 21% higher than they were in January 2021.\n\nApart from letting Whole Foods drop its prices, Amazon also gave employees a pay bump, Mackey added, and unlike other acquisitions in the business world, Amazon didn’t try to force its culture on the company.\n\n“They didn't try to change Whole Foods,” he said.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Reuters) - The Amazon Labor Union (ALU) has agreed to affiliate with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, one of the largest U.S. labor unions, in the latest sign that unionization efforts are picking up at the e-commerce giant.\n\nALU won a landmark victory in April 2022 after workers at Amazon's JFK8 facility, located in the New York City borough of Staten Island, voted to join the union, a first for the company in the United States.\n\nThe labor movement was driven by concerns over worker safety, including an alleged lack of protections for warehouse workers during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nTeamsters General President Sean O'Brien announced the affiliation on Tuesday, during the union's general executive board meeting in Washington.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n\"Together we are creating an unstoppable movement to take on Amazon,\" O'Brien said in a statement released on Wednesday.\n\n\"It will require unprecedented unity and long-term investment to finally force this company to respect working people and fairly negotiate.\"\n\nAmazon did not immediately respond to Reuters' request for comment.\n\nTeamsters said its board has unanimously approved the affiliation agreement. The ALU members will vote to ratify the agreement in the coming weeks.\n\nIf ratified, ALU will be a part of Teamsters' 1.3 million-member organization. The union will represent the roughly 8,000 Amazon warehouse workers at JFK8 and will have jurisdiction across New York's five boroughs, Teamsters said.\n\n(Reporting by Harshita Mary Varghese; Editing by Alan Barona)",

        "title": "7 Robotics &amp; Automation Stocks to Own Before They Transform Industries",
        "content": "Contrary to the dramatic headlines about robots replacing human workers, a robotics & automation revolution is quietly reshaping multiple industries — changing their entire faces rather than just swapping one form of labor for another.\n\nBut there’s a hitch for retail investors: many of the most innovative robotics & automation stocks remain private, limiting public investment opportunities. While ETFs like the iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO) or even Cathie Wood’s ARK Autonomous Technology & Robotics ETF (BATS:ARKQ) offer a way to invest in this sector indirectly, they may not satisfy all investors’ desires to target some of the top tech directly.\n\nFor those who prefer a self-directed, active management approach to robotics & automation stocks, these seven publicly traded robotics & automation stocks represent the best in their class. These companies span the gamut of market capitalizations, offering both the stability of large caps and the growth potential of small caps, alongside a wide range of industries to best diversify your robotics & automation stock holdings.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nZebra Technologies (ZBRA) A photo of the sign for Zebra Technologies (ZBRA) outside of a building.\n\nSource: Michael Vi/ShutterStock.com\n\nZebra Technologies (NASDAQ:ZBRA) is upstream of the wider robotics & automation sector by providing downstream developers with essential technology and tools, including sensing and communication technologies. The company offers autonomous, customizable base model robots to industries seeking to integrate workplace robotics yet lack ready-made solutions or are otherwise unable to afford internal R&D. Zebra provides customizable robotics platforms that can be tailored to meet specific industry needs—a key aspect of the burgeoning robotics & automation market.\n\nUnlike many companies in the robotics space, Zebra stands out for its profitability and stability, attributes bolstered by its diverse revenue streams spanning printing, scanning, computing, and software technology. This diversification allows Zebra to invest confidently in its growing robotics division without the heightened financial risks typically associated with the sector.\n\nTrue to form, the company’s most recent quarterly report blew past analyst expectations, marking $1.18 billion in sales (beating expectations by 2.17%) and a $2.84 EPS, compared to analyst consensus estimates of $2.45. Shares surged on the news, but don’t let that dissuade you from investing in this robotics & automation stock for the long haul.\n\nStory continues\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Samsara (IOT) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nLike Zebra Technologies, Samsara (NYSE:IOT) is a top player building the infrastructure necessary for robotics & automation systems to function. However, as its ticker symbol suggests, Samsara is deeply involved in the expanding Internet of Things (IoT) sector. The IoT encompasses a network of interconnected physical objects and their communication systems. Samsara’s technology is the invisible backbone integrating industrial robots into a seamless operational network.\n\nToday, Samsara focuses on the big picture, applying its technology on a larger scale and focusing on applications such as fleet vehicle management and safety, movement tracking, and heavy equipment operations. Behind the scenes, these areas are critical to efficient and safe workflows.\n\nWhile Samsara has not achieved profitability, its prospects remain bright for investors interested in robotics stocks. The company’s latest financial report showed a 39% increase in annual recurring revenue and a 20% improvement in its adjusted free cash flow margin. With management aiming for positive non-GAAP earnings within the year, Samsara represents a promising investment in the foundational technologies that will drive the future of home and industrial robotics.\n\nAeroVironment (AVAV) The logo for AeroVironment (AVAV) is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nAeroVironment (NASDAQ:AVAV) is a defense sector stock loved by Cathie Wood of Ark Invest fame. It is increasingly emphasizing integrated robotics & automation within its value chain. The company is primarily known for its forays into drone tech, with its flagship Raven UAS being one of the most widely used small surveillance drones leveraged by the United States and partner nations. But, increasingly, it’s also bringing peripheral robotics & automation tech into the fold, as evidenced by a 2023 acquisition.\n\nLast September, AeroVironment rolled supplier Tomahawk Robotics into its company via strategic acquisition. Tomahawk develops control systems that rely on artificial intelligence, and the acquisition lets AeroVironment “further integrate both companies’ technologies and accelerate [their] implementation of AI and autonomy into AeroVironment’s platforms,” according to Chairman, President, and CEO Wahid Nawabi.\n\nLike other top robotics & automation stocks on the list, AeroVironment recently posted strong quarterly earnings. Highlights include a $0.63 EPS, nearly doubling analyst estimates, on sales of $186.58 million — 10% higher than prior revenue projections.\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Cognex Corp (CGNX) Cognex (CGNX) logo displayed on smartphone with pink and blue background behind, symbolizing CGNX stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/rafapress\n\nCognex Corp (NASDAQ:CGNX) is another upstream robotics & automation stock, offering investors a wide range of machine vision, guidance, and sensing systems targeting industrial manufacturing processes. The company’s tech helps smooth out automated industrial systems by helping identify parts, pin down defects during assembly, and keep the robotic systems moving and online. Insiders bought Cognex stock hand-over-fist last year, enforcing the stock’s long-term prospects.\n\nThe company’s strong financial standing includes a 17% R&D-to-revenue conversion rate and a 72% gross margin rate. Better yet, Cognex is a strong contender among dividend stocks, with a 20-year track record of consecutive payouts and a current 1.6% total yield. Though first-quarter sales slumped slightly, this represents an ideal buying opportunity for long-term robotics & automation investors — shares are down 5% over the past month, but don’t expect the stock to stay suppressed for long.\n\nIntuitive Surgical (ISRG) A sign with the Intuitive Surgical logo standing outside of a company office. ISRG stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nIntuitive Surgical (NASDAQ:ISRG) is a powerhouse among robotics & automation stocks, merging advanced technology, robotics, and the ever-profitable healthcare sector. A top player in both the S&P 500 and NASDAQ-100 indices, Intuitive Surgical reliably supplies specialized, high-end medical equipment that sets it apart from competitors that focus on traditional medical hardware. Better yet, its top tech offerings revolutionize surgical procedures by improving efficiency and patient outcomes.\n\nIntuitive Surgical is aggressively expanding its global presence as the healthcare industry continues rebounding. The company’s most recent quarterly report showcased a notable 16% year-over-year increase in the usage of its flagship robotic surgery system, the da Vinci platform, maintaining a consistent installation rate with 313 units installed this year, compared to 312 in the first quarter of 2023. Coupled with an 11% increase in sales and a rise in net income to $545 million from $355 million, these achievements reinforce Intuitive Surgical’s standing as a premier robotics & automation stock.\n\nLooking ahead, Intuitive Surgical is gearing up to launch its next-generation da Vinci platform. CEO Gary Guthart has indicated that this new model will possess “10,000 times the processing power” of existing models, substantially improving data analysis, sensing technology, and digital functions, ultimately elevating the company’s offerings and market position significantly.\n\nRobotics & Automation Stocks: Symbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo. Focus on center of phone display. Unmodified photo. SYM stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nOn the mid-cap front, Symbotic (NASDAQ:SYM) is revolutionizing how prominent retailers, including Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Target (NYSE:TGT), handle their warehouse operations. Symbotic employs AI to drive its warehouse robotics platforms, enabling quicker, more efficient selection, packing, and shipping than traditional methods while improving safety practices and reducing costs. Although major brands are currently its primary clientele, Symbotic’s strategy to broaden its market reach could propel this robotics & automation stock to new heights.\n\nThe company is exploring a new initiative to make warehouse automation and robotics accessible to small- and medium-sized businesses (SMBs), which typically lack the financial means to invest in the technology that larger corporations can afford. Symbotic’s approach involves targeting multi-user warehouse complexes and integrating automation into the facilities as part of a leasing incentive instead of selling directly to SMBs.\n\nWhile big-name clients continue to provide a steady revenue stream, the SMB sector represents a vast, largely untapped market for robotics & automation stocks. Successfully tapping into this segment could create a sustainable revenue model for Symbotic, turning it into a diversified, recession-proof robotics & automation stock for years to come.\n\niRobot (IRBT) In this photo illustration the iRobot Corporation (IRBT) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\niRobot (NASDAQ:IRBT) is a speculative (but cheap) robotics & automation stock that’s seen tough times yet remains worth buying — though perhaps not for the reasons you expect. While its range of autonomous vacuum cleaners has its merits, the real value in iRobot lies in its extensive portfolio of advanced, patented technology and the potential for third-party licensing. This was a key factor behind Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) interest in acquiring the company.\n\nAmazon’s bid to acquire iRobot revealed a previously unknown patent Amazon filed, describing “An autonomously motile device [that] may be capable of moving or performing other actions within an environment.” This description hints at a hybrid between an Amazon Alexa and an iRobot vacuum, showcasing the strategic nature of Amazon’s attempt to acquire iRobot for $1.7 billion—aiming to leverage iRobot’s technology rather than develop similar tech in-house. Of course, the acquisition fizzled out, but understanding Amazon’s initial motivation to buy the robotics & automation stock reveals iRobot’s latent potential.\n\nDespite the setback with Amazon’s acquisition, iRobot’s technological assets and patent portfolio remain valuable, with ample opportunities for further acquisitions or licensing deals. Moreover, with iRobot trading at just 0.3x sales, this stock offers compelling value, making it an attractive buy for those looking to invest in the future of at-home robotics.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "Investing.com - In a significant win for organized labor, the Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Labor Union has officially joined forces with the International Brotherhood of Teamsters, a union boasting 1.3 million members. This partnership provides Amazon workers with stronger representation and resources as they strive for a contract from the global giant.\n\nIn the upcoming weeks, members of the Amazon Labor Union will vote to confirm the affiliation. The Teamsters General President, Sean M. O’Brien, announced the affiliation during a union board meeting in Washington D.C., where the affiliation agreement was unanimously approved by the Teamsters' board.\n\nThe newly formed ALU-International Brotherhood of Teamsters (IBT) Local 1 will represent approximately 8,000 Amazon warehouse workers at JFK8, covering all five boroughs of New York. This will be the first ALU-IBT local union fully established under the Teamsters Constitution. Members of ALU-IBT Local 1 will gain access to the financial and organizational support of the Teamsters International Union, the Teamsters Amazon Division, and Teamsters Joint Council.\n\nSean O’Brien said, \"Together we are creating an unstoppable movement to take on Amazon. Building relationships with workers, communities nationwide, and rank-and-file Teamsters has been essential to creating the capacity to stand up to Amazon — and this affiliation demonstrates it. It will require unprecedented unity and long-term investment to finally force this company to respect working people and fairly negotiate. The Teamsters proudly set the standard in the industry with our historic agreement protecting 340,000 UPS Teamsters, and we will make sure that standard is upheld at every other company, and especially at Amazon.”\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAmazon Labor Union joins forces with Teamsters\n\nChargePoint Shares Dip on Lower-Than-Expected Q2 Outlook\n\nGreif posts mixed Q1 results as revenue falls short of expectations\n\nView comments",

Shares of the company have rallied 24.4% year to date, outperforming the Zacks Internet Services industry’s growth of 19.3%.\r\n\r\nIn order to deliver generative AI experience across its products and services, Google is constantly making efforts to power them with its most advanced and powerful large language model (“LLM”), namely Gemini.\r\n\r\nReportedly, the company is planning to add a Spotify extension to Gemini in order to deliver an enhanced music streaming experience to Gemini users.\r\n\r\nThis comes right after the recent rollout of YouTube Music Gemini Extension, which enables users to search music and play radio, among others, with the help of an AI chatbot experience.\r\n\r\nThese endeavors are expected to aid Alphabet in gaining momentum in the music streaming space.\n\nAlphabet Inc. Price and Consensus Alphabet Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAlphabet Inc. price-consensus-chart | Alphabet Inc. Quote\n\nGrowing Generative AI Efforts Aid Prospects\n\nPer a Fortune Business Insights report, the global generative AI market size is expected to hit $67.2 billion in 2024 and reach $967.7 by 2032, seeing a CAGR of 39.6% between 2024 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAlphabet is well-poised to capitalize on the above-mentioned prospect, thanks to its growing generative AI efforts.\r\n\r\nRecently, Google upgraded Android Studio's bot with Gemini Pro, which will enable developers to ask coding-related questions. Users will be able to add generative AI-powered features to their apps seamlessly by accessing the Gemini API starter template through Android Studio.\r\n\r\nThe company also made Gemini 1.5 Pro available in a public preview on Vertex AI.\r\n\r\nGoogle unveiled LearnLM, a family of generative AI models designed for conversational tutoring on various subjects.\r\n\r\nIts introduction of the latest additions to the Gemma family of open models, including Gemma 2, the next generation with a 27-billion parameter model, and PaliGemma, the first vision language model for image captioning, labeling and Q&A use cases, remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nGoogle also introduced various open-source tools to support generative AI projects and infrastructure. The new tools include the likes of MaxDiffusion — a collection of reference implementations of various diffusion models, JetStream — a new engine to run generative AI models, MaxText — a collection of text-generating AI models targeting tensor processing units (TPUs), and NVIDIA’s NVDA GPUs in the cloud.\r\n\r\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities across various products will help Google deliver enhanced user experience, which, in turn, is expected to aid Alphabet’s overall financial performance in the days ahead.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $295.53 billion, which indicates year-over-year growth of 15.2%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $7.60 per share, which implies year-over-year growth of 31%. The EPS estimate has moved 0.4% north over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompetitive Scenario\n\nThe Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) company’s growing generative efforts are making the battle intensified for its peers like Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, which are also flexing muscles to bolster generative AI capabilities.\r\n\r\nYou can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft continues to make strong efforts to boost its generative AI capabilities. Its integration of GPT-4 into its search engine Bing and browser Edge to deliver a ChatGPT-like experience to users remains noteworthy.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft Azure offers the Azure OpenAI Service, which enables the seamless application of LLM and generative AI techniques in various use cases. It recently launched the latest copilot templates on Azure OpenAI Service that allow retailers to build personalized shopping experiences and support store operations.\r\n\r\nIn addition, Microsoft and OpenAI are reportedly collaborating on an ambitious venture to establish a cutting-edge data center project to address the imperative need for advanced infrastructure to manage generative AI-driven complex data and tasks.\r\n\r\nThen again, Amazon’s AWS is riding on Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nIts latest partnership with NVIDIA to power its portfolio with the generative AI technology is another positive. Per the terms, the NVIDIA Blackwell GPU platform will be available on AWS. This will help speed up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "2 Stocks to Watch &amp; One to Avoid From the Volatile Retail Pharmacy Industry",
        "content": "In the middle of the ongoing trend of digitalization within the healthcare product supply side, there has been a significant shift toward digital consumption of healthcare products and services as well. Amid acute supply-chain disruption and staffing shortages within healthcare, the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry is witnessing exponentially growing demand for distant medical services and remote patient care. Further, mail-order pharmacies are registering growth by adopting digital health services in the form of telehealth and remote monitoring. With digitization, retail industry players are also significantly strengthening their omnichannel presence from sole brick-and-mortar dependency. All these are creating unique opportunities for industry stalwarts like Walgreens Boots Alliance WBA and Herbalife Ltd HLF, which are investing strategically in easy patient access to prescription and maintenance medications.\r\n\r\nHowever, the majority of the retail pharmacy and drug store heavyweights have been southbound due to the ongoing pressure of rising expenses and labor shortages. Further, under the ongoing stringent monetary policy, consumers have limited money to spend, which is leading to a decline in retail pharmacy products. Added to this, unfavorable drug pricing and reimbursement are a burden on this sector. CVS Health CVS is one such stock whose performance is negatively impacted by these industry-wide trends. Last but not the least, perceiving the huge growth prospects of this space, there have been a number of new entries that have increased competition in the space. In particular, a stalwart like Amazon’s AMZN strict domination within the retail drugstore space has created a survival issue for the existing entities.\n\nIndustry Description\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry includes retailing of a range of prescription and over-the-counter medications. The broad retail network of companies within the retail pharmacy industry delivers advanced health solutions to patients, customers and caregivers. Over the past few years, the scope of the retail pharmacy and drugstore market has expanded exponentially. In North America, some of these entities evolved to add wellness products and groceries to their traditional portfolio of prescription and over-the-counter medications. Looking at the attractive growth potential of this industry, non-healthcare leaders like Amazon acquired pharmacy delivery startup PillPack to enter the U.S. healthcare space.\n\n3 Trends Shaping the Future of the Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Industry\n\nMassive Digital Adoption: Thanks to the pandemic, there has been a significant shift in demand toward mail order and online pharmacies. Even now, when the pandemic is over, pharmacy retailers have been witnessing growing consumer preference for these alternative channels compared to brick-and-mortar pharmacies. The digital pharmacy market is rapidly gaining popularity in the form of improving access to physicians, diagnosis and treatments. Further, with the digitalization of drug stores, easy online purchases of medicines have gained popularity.\r\n\r\nAccording to an Insight Partners report, the digital pharmacy market size was valued at $96.4 billion in 2022. It is projected to reach a global market size of $363.9 billion by 2030. A 2023 pharmacy study by J.D. Power (as published in Progressive Grosser) noted that while customer reliance on digital platforms was 76% in 2022, the same shot up to 81% in 2023.\r\n\r\nAmazon Steals Market Share: Amazon Pharmacy’s omnichannel performance has been significantly robust since its inception. Going by a Viseven report of 2023, Amazon’s omnichannel experiences are the keystone to customer retention, helping it cover previous sales reductions. This has significantly increased competition in the retail pharmacy market. In March 2024, Amazon Pharmacy announced same-day delivery of prescription medication in New York City and the greater LA area, with plans to expand the service to more than a dozen U.S. cities by the end of the year. In October 2023, Amazon Pharmacy announced the launch of a drone delivery service. Amazon Pharmacy is currently using generative artificial intelligence to fill prescriptions more quickly and accurately.\r\n\r\nFollowing its entry into the healthcare market, the e-commerce giant has grabbed a significant chunk of the online pharmacy market.  With several other initiatives in progress, needless to say, Amazon’s emergence as a major pharmacy services player is a significant blow to the industry, putting retail pharmacy and drugstore stocks in a tighter spot.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Difficult Pharmacy Reimbursement Scenario: Brand-name drugs that hold wide profit margins are protected with a reliable supply chain. However, low-margin generic drugs, which have a fragile supply-chain network, have been bearing the brunt of the ongoing economic slump. Drug retailers are also witnessing a constant rise in medicine prices, stemming from the rising cost of raw materials. The industry players are currently grappling with continued pressure from non-reimbursable pharmacy expenses, which are significantly pulling down mass demand for prescription as well as over-the-counter drugs and vaccinations.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, to improve operating margins, pharmacy retailers have announced plans to reduce their footprint. In December 2023, CVS Health stated that it would change the way it prices its prescription drugs with new pharmacy reimbursement.\n\nZacks Industry Rank Indicates Dull Near-Term Prospects\n\nThe industry’s Zacks Industry Rank, which is basically the average of the Zacks Rank of all the member stocks, indicates dull near-term prospects. The Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry, housed within the broader Zacks Retail and Wholesale sector, currently carries a Zacks Industry Rank #227, placing it in the bottom 8% of more than 248 Zacks industries. Our research shows that the top 50% of the Zacks-ranked industries outperforms the bottom 50% by a factor of more than 2 to 1.\n\nWe will present a few stocks that have the potential to outperform the market based on a strong earnings outlook. However, it’s worth taking a look at the industry’s shareholder returns and current valuation first.\n\nIndustry Underperforms S&P 500 & Sector\n\nThe Zacks Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores industry has underperformed the Zacks S&P 500 composite as well as its sector over the past year. The stocks in this industry have collectively lost 23% over this period against the Retail-Wholesale sector’s growth of 23.6%. The S&P 500 composite has risen 23.2% over the said time frame.\n\nOne-Year Price Performance\n\nIndustry's Current Valuation\n\nOn the basis of forward 12-month price-to-earnings (P/E), which is commonly used for valuing medical stocks, the industry is currently trading at 7.46X compared with the S&P 500’s 20.90X and the sector’s 22.86X.\n\nOver the last five years, the sector has traded as high as 11.88X, as low as 7.18X, and at the median of 8.98X, as the charts below show.\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\nPrice-to-Earnings Forward Twelve Months (F12M)\n\n2 Retail - Pharmacies and Drug Stores Stocks in Focus & 1 to Avoid\n\nWalgreens Boots continued to transform the method of delivering healthcare through physical stores and digital channels. The company’s network of micro fulfillment centers is helping to stabilize staffing and pharmacy hours, reduce work full pain points and free up capacity to drive the outcomes that matter most to its patients and partners. WBA is also piloting a virtual pharmacy to redefine connected care, increase patient access, enhance workplace flexibility and extend its pharmacist reach.  At present, Walgreens Boots’ 11 micro-fulfillment centers support 4,600 stores.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for fiscal 2024 revenues indicates growth of 4.9% from the 2023 reported figure. The company’s long-term earnings growth rate is 5%. Walgreens Boots carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at present.  You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nPrice and Consensus: WBA\n\nHerbalife, as a premier health and wellness company and community, offers science-backed products to consumers in more than 90 markets through entrepreneurial distributors. It provides products in the areas of weight management, targeted nutrition, energy, sports and fitness, outer nutrition, and literature and promotion items. The company is currently expanding in the United Kingdom and Spain, banking on the rollout of an all-new distributor e-commerce platform built on Herbalife One. The company’s new restructuring plan to streamline organizational structure (with expected annual cost savings of at least $80 million beginning 2025 and approximately $40 million in 2024) buoys optimism.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2025 revenues indicates growth of 3.9% from the 2024 projected figure. The company’s 2025 earnings growth rate is 33.5% from the 2024 projected figure. Herbalife carries a Zacks Rank #3 at present.\n\nPrice and Consensus: HLF\n\nCVS Health is committed to increasing investments in fast-growing spaces like enterprise data platforms, cloud capabilities and digital products to offer innovative solutions through mobile and web channels. However, recent challenges in Medicare Advantage mar CVS Health’s profitability. The company’s healthcare benefits segment costs soared much faster due to increased Medicare utilization and a decline in the company's Medicare Advantage star ratings. The company’s health services segment faced headwinds in the form of the loss of a large client and continued pharmacy client price improvements. The downward revision in the 2024 outlook looks worrisome.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 earnings estimates indicates an 18.4% plunge from the 2023 level. CVS Health, which presently holds a Zacks Rank #5 (Strong Sell), delivered a trailing four-quarter average negative earnings surprise of 2.3%.\n\nPrice and Consensus: CVS\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "After a solid earnings season where S&P 500 earnings grew 5.9% year-over-year, markets remain in excellent shape. At the same time, the economy is chugging along with no signs of recession in sight. Against this backdrop, finding stocks to buy for additional equity exposure is justified.\n\nBetting on bullish action here is a consensus view. Indeed, Wall Street analysts have hiked their year-end targets. On May 15, BMO Capital’s Brian Belski hiked his S&P 500 target to a street-high 5,600. Other analysts have followed, including permabull Tom Lee, who expects the index to hit 5,500 by the end of June.\n\nWith more than $6 trillion on the sidelines, we might be due for an explosive second half. That’s why you need some stocks to ride this momentum. Notably, several catalysts could push these stocks to buy higher. Earnings will recover further in the second half. Furthermore, they will flex their earnings power due to idiosyncratic factors highlighted below.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) First Solar logo on smartphone in front of computer screen with graphs. FSLR stock\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis photovoltaic cell maker is in the right spot to benefit from several tailwinds. First Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) will benefit from the continued shift from fossils to renewable energy. In the U.S. alone, solar power generation will increase by 75% from 163 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2023 to 286 billion kWh next year. As the largest U.S. solar manufacturer, this company will benefit.\n\nAnother big tailwind for FSLR stock is Biden’s administration’s imposition of tariffs on solar imports. Under the new measures, tariffs on solar modules will increase from 25% to 50%. The U.S. government’s actions are meant to shield U.S. solar manufacturing from Chinese competition.\n\nNo American company is as well positioned as First Solar to capitalize on these tariffs. It produces 50% more panels than the next competitor in the U.S. Thus, it will profit from the robust demand from industrial-scale or commercial installations.\n\nConsidering these tailwinds, First Solar is one of the best stocks to buy. At the end of Q1, its total contracted backlog was 78.3 gigawatts, with orders stretching through 2030. UBS Jon Windham expects EPS to quadruple from $7.78 in 2023 to more than $36 in 2027. With this acceleration, FSLR stock will soar higher.\n\nPrologis (PLD) The Prologis (PLD) logo displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter dropping more than 20% from its highs, Prologis (NYSE:PLD), the world’s largest industrial REIT, is a buy. This owner of top-tier warehouses manages over 1.2 billion square feet worldwide. It leases these facilities to logistic firms, e-commerce players and other businesses.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrologis is at the intersection of two long-term trends that will drive secular demand for its warehouses. First, e-commerce growth will be a revenue tailwind. According to Prologis CEO Hamid Moghadam, e-commerce requires three times as much space as normal brick-and-mortar stores.\n\nThe second tailwind is the onshoring trend, in which multinationals are relocating their supply chains to the U.S. Furthermore, companies are seeking more warehouse space for more inventory in an effort to boost supply chain resiliency. This bodes well for its long-term demand.\n\nLast quarter, Prologis reduced guidance by 1%, resulting in a 20% drop in the stock. In my opinion, the stock has been unfairly punished. Luckily, this is an opportunity to buy a high-quality REIT with reliable multinational tenants. Its top tenants include Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), FedEx (NYSE:FDX), United Parcel Service (NYSE:UPS) and Walmart (NYSE:WMT).\n\nDue to e-commerce and onshoring tailwinds, this industrial warehouse is one of the top stocks to buy. It is a multi-year cash-flow growth story that will prove the doubters wrong.\n\nWaste Management (WM) Image of green Waste Management (WM) branded truck in the foreground and building with Waste Management flag in the background.\n\nSource: rblfmr / Shutterstock.com\n\nSometimes, trash can be turned into treasure. Indeed, that has been the Waste Management (NYSE:WM) playbook as it has grown into the largest waste collector and recycler in the U.S.\n\nOn June 3, the company announced the acquisition of Stericycle (NASDAQ:SRCL) in a $7.2 billion deal. The stock dropped lower after the announcement. However, given the complementary business this deal brings, Waste Management is among the stocks to buy.\n\nStericycle’s medical waste and secure information destruction portfolio will broaden Waste Management’s service offerings. This will enable Waste Management to offer clients a comprehensive suite of environmental solutions, positioning the company to win business against competitors who lack a broad range of services.\n\nFurthermore, the deal has synergies to boost the combined entities’ earnings and cash flow. Management projects $125 million in annual synergies from cost optimizations.\n\nThe Stericycle deal is a game changer for Waste Management due to the market opportunity to deliver diversified services. Moreover, WM stock is a bargain that will work in all environments. In expansions, waste collection tracks economic growth – the more economic activity, the more waste is generated. And in contractions, it is resilient since garbage services are a necessary utility.\n\nOn the date of publication, Charles Munyi did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. will drop American Express Co. cards as a payment option because of “unacceptably high fees,” according to an email reviewed by Bloomberg News that the online marketplace plans to send to customers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority BlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India? Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Indian Stocks Lead Gains in Asia as Modi Ally Pledges Support\n\nEBay will notify customers this week about the change, which is set to take effect Aug. 17.\n\n“After careful consideration, eBay has decided to no longer accept American Express globally effective August 17 due to the unacceptably high fees American Express charges for processing credit card transactions,” the company said in the email.\n\nThe two firms have been embroiled in negotiations around the merchant discount rates — also known as interchange fees — charged by Amex at the point of sale. The fees, imposed each time a card is used in a transaction, have long been a headache for merchants. One trade group said retailers paid more than $172 billion in card-processing fees last year.\n\nAmex, however, said its research shows that its fees are comparable to what eBay must pay to accept similar cards on other networks, such as Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., while providing more value.\n\n“American Express card members have an average transaction size at eBay that is more than double the transaction size of cards from other networks,” New York-based Amex said in a statement. “We find eBay’s decision to drop American Express as a payment choice for consumers to be inconsistent with their stated desire to increase competition at the point of sale.”\n\nCompetitors of eBay — including Amazon.com Inc. — have made similar moves while bargaining over transaction fees. Amazon threatened to stop accepting all Visa cards on its global network before finally striking a deal. Amex has also lost deals, including its once-exclusive pact with Costco Wholesale Corp., over its terms.\n\n“Ultimately, we agree with AXP’s stance as the company prices to value, and it would be a slippery slope downwards if AXP sacrificed on price,” Keefe, Bruyette & Woods Inc. analysts Sanjay Sakhrani, Steven Kwok and Vasundhara Govil said in a note, referring to the company by its stock ticker. “Recall this was a big reason for AXP backing out of the Costco relationship in the past.”\n\nAmex said eBay represents less than 0.2% of its total network volume.\n\nStory continues\n\nEBay has lost significant market share to other e-commerce giants such as Amazon and Walmart Inc. in recent years, and last month provided a weaker-than-expected earnings outlook for the current quarter. Globally, shoppers will spend $73.4 billion on the marketplace this year, according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\n(Updates with analyst commentary starting in eighth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Dozens of investors have written to Amazon raising concerns over the retail giant’s alleged response to trade union membership at its Coventry warehouse.\n\nCCLA Investment Management has sent the letter as part of a group of 50 investors and advisors, including Nest and Storebrand, in defence of worker bargaining rights.\n\nThe investors have urged Amazon to prove that they are implementing their Global Human Rights Principles in the letter. Amazon staff members have held industrial action at the Coventry warehouse over the past year (Jacob King/PA)\n\nIt comes after the GMB union launched legal action against Amazon in April over its long-running battle for recognition at the Coventry site.\n\nThe union accused Amazon of posting anti-union messages on message boards and claimed that workers were called into lengthy meetings where managers were critical of unions.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nAmazon said it does not believe “there is any merit” in the legal action.\n\nThe group of investors said in the letter they believe Amazon’s alleged actions are “misaligned” with the company’s stated approach to human rights.\n\nThe have also asked Amazon for an explanation on its approach for respecting the rights of freedom of association and collective bargaining.\n\nIt also comes after a number of shareholders also raised similar concerns at a vote at Amazon’s annual general meeting earlier this year.\n\nPeter Hugh Smith, CCLA chief executive, said: “As an investor in Amazon, we want to do the right thing – both by our clients who expect us to be good stewards of their capital and by Amazon’s employees.\n\n“In light of the countless media reports and allegations, and given two major ESG data providers have expressed concerns, questions from investors need to be answered.\n\n“We want to see Amazon appoint a reputable third party to assess how they implement their human rights policies in UK fulfilment centres and to commit to rectifying any areas of non-conformance identified.\n\n“The clock is ticking and it is time for Amazon to set the record straight.”\n\nAn Amazon spokesman said: “We agree that everyone has the right to choose to join a union, and that everyone also has the right to leave a union if they choose.\n\n“Our employees told us how difficult it was to cancel their union membership so we provided information to help, through signs that always state that it’s an employee’s personal choice.\n\n“Additionally, it is made clear to employees that attendance at meetings is entirely their choice too. We do not believe there is any merit in the legal action.”",

        "title": "Here Are My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is still a massive theme in the market. The market has only gotten a taste of what this technology can offer, and the results have already been promising.\n\nIf investors haven't aligned some part of their portfolio to this technology, it's not too late. There are plenty of great AI stocks that can be phenomenal investments and purchased at a fair price, providing exposure to one of the most promising technological revolutions since the internet.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor (NYSE: TSM) is one of the best ways to invest in AI, as it will be a winner regardless of whose software or AI model is the best. TSMC manufactures the chips that go into critical infrastructure, such as graphics processing units (GPUs) that process the AI models. Because Taiwan Semiconductor is a foundry, it creates chips for companies that compete against each other, like Nvidia and AMD. By being neutral in the AI arms race, TSMC is in a great position.\n\nManagement is also excited about the prospects AI technology is bringing to its business. They expect the portion of its business associated with building AI-related chips will grow at a 50% compounded annual growth rate for the next five years. This growth will result in AI chips making up more than 20% of its overall revenue by then.\n\nThat's massive growth and makes Taiwan Semiconductor a strong investment. Although the stock isn't as cheap as it used to be, it's still a fair buy at 24 times forward earnings. TSM PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nConsidering that the S&P 500 trades at 21.5 times earnings, Taiwan Semiconductor only trades at a slight premium to the broader market.\n\nAlphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) stumbled out of the gate when nearly every company around it was launching and integrating generative AI models. Now, Alphabet has caught its competition and has rolled out several features that integrate this technology throughout its product ecosystem.\n\nStill, AI is only a small part of Alphabet's investment thesis, as advertising accounts for more than three-quarters of its overall revenue. The AI tools Alphabet develops for advertising are far more important than any other, as these bring value to paying customers.\n\nOne example is integrating its Gemini model into its Performance Max (PMax) product. Meeting all PMax guidelines greatly increases the odds of a successful advertising campaign. It used to take some back-and-forth to check all the boxes; now, it can be done instantly, as Gemini can ensure all guidelines are met. This type of efficiency excites investors about the prospects of generative AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nDue to its stumbles, Alphabet also trades at a lower premium to many of its big tech peers, at 23 times forward earnings. This is an excellent price to pay for the stock, and investors should take advantage of this price while they still can.\n\nAmazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) may not be at the top of investors' minds when looking for AI stocks. While the company is an avid user of the technology, it may not be easy to pinpoint where Amazon would benefit.\n\nHowever, its Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud computing business is slated for huge gains. Many companies trying to integrate generative AI and large language models (LLMs) into their businesses don't have the computing power necessary in-house. So, they rent some computing space from a cloud computing provider like AWS. (Alphabet also has a competing product in Google Cloud.)\n\nThis allows its users to easily scale up or down depending on workload size, and after a year of consolidation in 2023, AWS is back to growth mode in 2024. In Q1, AWS revenue rose 17% year over year to $25 billion. While that's only 18% of Amazon's total sales, the division is highly profitable. Operating income rose 84% year over year to $9.4 billion, accounting for 62% of operating profits.\n\nAWS is critical to Amazon's structure, and the growth it's experiencing, thanks to the AI boom, will help the company tremendously.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The 3 Best Consumer Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Let’s explore the three best consumer stocks to buy in June 2024. These companies have demonstrated resilience and the ability to capitalize on key trends driving the consumer sector. By focusing on these top performers, investors can potentially benefit from the continued growth and success of these businesses.\r\n\r\nConsumer stocks can be either defensive plays or those that are more cyclical in nature. Defensive consumer stocks, such as those in the consumer staples sector, tend to be more resilient during economic downturns. This is because they provide essential goods and services that consumers continue to demand, regardless of the economic climate.\n\nThese stocks often offer stability and consistent dividends, making them attractive to risk-averse investors. Consumer discretionary, however, tend to rally when times are good, and the U.S. economy has gone from strength to strength recently.\r\n\r\nThis article will explore more defensive, dividend-based companies, as well as those that deploy capital in the aims of delivering capital appreciation for investors.\n\nProcter & Gamble (PG) Procter & Gamble Union Distribution Center. P&G is an American Multinational Consumer Goods Company\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nProcter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), as a consumer staples giant, offers a diverse portfolio of essential household products, including brands like Tide, Gillette and Pampers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nP&G’s products often generate several times more annual revenue than its nearest competitors, thanks to the company’s significant investments in research and development, marketing and artificial intelligence. The company’s size allows it to maintain a competitive edge through leveraging its relationships with retail partners\r\n\r\nThe main reason why investors should consider PG as one of those consumer stocks to buy is due to its strong dividend. P&G’s payout ratio is 60.51%, and it has increased its dividend for 52 consecutive years.\n\nPG is one of my favorite consumer discretionary stocks — it offers good income with low volatility and it has a great mix for conservative investors.\n\nMcDonald’s (MCD) McDonald's golden arches\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock\n\nMcDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) is a global fast-food chain that has demonstrated resilience during economic downturns. The company’s strong brand recognition sets it apart, and I feel that its shares have now entered a buying zone.\r\n\r\nThe company plans to introduce more deals, including a $5 meal deal, to address the slowdown in store traffic caused by inflation-weary customers, and its stock price has fallen around 12% year-to-date.\n\nLike PG, MCD is also a low-volatility blue-chip stock that should be worth of investors’ attention. It offers a dividend yield of 2.54%, with a quarterly dividend of $1.67 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMcDonald’s payout ratio is 53.84%, and it has increased its dividend for about 16 consecutive years. The company also has a buyback yield of 1.61%.\n\nI believe that MCD could be a great addition to one’s portfolio if investors seek a strong economic moat above all else in the consumer sector.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) An image of an Amazon logo on a building\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) has expanded into various consumer-related sectors, such as streaming services, grocery delivery.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, Amazon’s investments in AI startups like Hugging Face and Anthropic, along with the development of its own AI chips — Trainium and Inferentia — and a planned $11 billion investment in data centers, means that it could continue to dominate the e-commerce landscape, as well as make further inroads into the higher margin consumer businesses.\r\n\r\nSome analysts, including chartist Bruce Kamich, are increasingly bullish on AMZN’s future prospects, and I agree with his sentiment. Kamich’s point-and-figure chart calculations suggest price targets of $199 and $223 for Amazon shares. However, he cautions that if the stock trades below $166, the daily price target may weaken.\n\nAMZN’s shares are significantly below their all-time high, and I believe that it will be the big FAANG stocks like AMZN that will be the primary beneficiary of the ongoing AI revolution, of which AMZN has only just started to tap into.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. The first five topics can be seen here, and these are the final five themes:\n\nCloud computing return to normal\n\nInvestors have been gaining greater confidence in the ability of certain headwinds to cloud revenue growth over the past 12-18 months normalizing, and thus attention for 2024/2025 is shifting to trying to gain a better understanding of how building momentum in artificial intelligence workloads & AI related services could contribute to growth and margins going forward.\n\n“We still see the long-term adoption of cloud computing services by enterprise customers as a secular theme due to broad-based increases of digital spending and shifts in IT budgets toward cloud adoption,” said analysts at Goldman, in a note dated May 17.\n\nWith meaningful revenue backlog, we see the broader public cloud landscape evolving from simply being a conversation around cost savings/efficiency to being an essential piece of driving growth for customers through utilization of AI-related offerings, operationally/industry specific solutions & partner integrations, all of which have a goal of improving the extraction & utilization of data to drive business outcomes while keeping that data secure.\n\nIn addition, companies have expressed optimism that AI workloads could build in momentum as a tailwind for 2024 & beyond.\n\nGoldman sees the tech giants Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) as the most exposed to this potential upside.\n\nNormalization of online travel demand\n\nThe multi-year period of abnormal travel growth, caused by COVID and then the associated pent-up demand, is coming to an end, and Goldman sees structural growth for the online travel industry returning to pre-COVID levels in the high-single-digit/low-double-digit percentage range.\n\nAs growth normalizes, online travel agencies are increasingly focused on a number of initiatives to drive brand loyalty, less reliance on performance advertising, including investing in loyalty programs and merchandising/discounts direct to consumers.\n\n“We believe generative AI has the potential to reshape the online travel funnel and how companies approach customer acquisition & conversion,” said analysts at Goldman Sachs.\n\nAdditionally, “we are witnessing a greater focus on capital returns with online travel companies increasingly buying back stock (or announcing shareholder return authorizations that have surprised to the upside).”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stocks most exposed to these themes include Expedia (NASDAQ:EXPE), Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG), Airbnb (NASDAQ:ABNB) and Tripadvisor (NASDAQ:TRIP).\n\nEvolution of interactive entertainment\n\nThe bank sees the potential rise of a hybrid distribution model of mobile/cloud as well as the potential emergence of VR/AR [virtual reality/augmented reality] physical equipment as the next generation of distribution and interfaces, albeit while acknowledging the inherent technological challenges limiting pace of adoption.\n\nThe other distribution mode that we will continue to monitor is whether any industry participant is able to successfully build enough scale of content to capitalize on the subscription-ification of the consumer Internet.\n\nWith consumers increasingly shifting consumption habits to short-form video and gaming, we have seen companies focus on a few themes in an effort to capitalize on evolving consumer behavior: The addition of new verticals by large scaled platforms (e.g., Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) expanding into gaming, and Spotify (NYSE:SPOT) expanding into audiobooks & podcasts); expanding distribution channels and touchpoints (e.g., Take-Two's (NASDAQ:TTWO) partnership with Netflix on Grand Theft Auto mobile games); the emergence of cloud gaming; and the extension of key intellectual property (e.g., Netflix TV series around Take-Two/Ubisoft franchises).\n\n“Looking longer-term, we expect large-scaled platforms to be the best positioned to capitalize on the aforementioned trends given the scale of consumers which provides greater leverage on fixed content costs, the breadth and depth of content library providing abundance of consumer choice, and rising pricing power as more value is delivered to consumers,” said Goldman Sachs.\n\nShifting industry momentum\n\nLooking to the remainder of the year, the bank sees Internet companies focused on the following themes: executing against a more normalized revenue backdrop; mixed margin outlooks; and a renewed commitment to shareholder returns, with several companies announcing new buyback authorizations and/or dividends.\n\nA key debate for investors will be how online penetration rates continue to evolve from these higher levels and how this translates back into the remaining secular growth runway of companies within these verticals.\n\nThe maturation of end markets is contributing to a step-up in competitive intensity, with companies increasingly focused on a mixture of demand/supply incentives and the launch of new products/adjacencies to help sustain revenue growth, broaden platform offerings, and deepen customer relationships.\n\nAdditionally, companies are earmarking an increasing amount of capital towards shareholder returns, with the sector returning $111 billion in 2023 (99% through buybacks) and with nearly $200 billion in remaining buyback authorization still waiting to be deployed.\n\n“We expect companies to continue to use shareholder returns in the years ahead, with this likely to support a continued broadening of their investor base,” Goldman added.\n\nRegulatory matters and business practices\n\nThe rise of government and regulators’ focus on the business practices of the industry’s scaled players has been a persistent theme in recent years, said analysts at the investment bank, seeing three potential areas of risk.\n\nThe bank cited “headline noise” if investigations, fines and new rules proliferate; rising costs to comply with an array of global initiatives; and headwinds to any in-market consolidation or strategic M&A by large players, causing the industry to lean back on internal product R&D.\n\nOver the short/medium term, the regulatory focus on antitrust issues continues to be the biggest area of uncertainty, citing the U.S. Department of Justice lawsuit against Google; the U.S. Federal Trade Commission lawsuit against Amazon; and the U.S. DOJ lawsuit against Google as well as the European Commission statement of objections against Google.\n\nSuch scrutiny of the largest companies is likely to persist, “and we expect that investors will remain acutely focused on ‘headline risk’ and watch for new developments.”\n\nIn addition, the increased number of antitrust-related regulatory developments in recent months/years has created an increased degree of uncertainty and volatility around potential long-term business structure and market share dynamics, particularly if it results in “structural” remedies being enforced.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 2\n\nHotel executives set sights on empty office buildings as supply lags demand\n\nBoeing's Starliner capsule is launched from Florida on first crewed space flight\n\nView comments",

        "content": "As the month of June kicks off, there are several S&P 500 stocks to buy that showcase a promising future. With market sentiment shifting in response to global events, inflation data and Federal Reserve policies, investors remain keen to identify stocks with substantial growth potential.\n\nIdentifying promising S&P 500 stocks involves a multi-faceted approach, including analyzing company financials, industry trends and market positioning. However, even if you can get this right, there is still the possibility of losing money. That is why it is crucial for investors to have a broad diversified portfolio, and never invest more than you can afford to potentially lose in any one stock. However, with a healthy approach and proper risk management, investors can position their portfolio for success in June and beyond.\n\nNow, let’s discover the top three S&P 500 stocks to buy in June 2024!\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a leading American semiconductor company spearheading the artificial intelligence and 5G revolution. Wall Street is just beginning to take notice of its comprehensive Snapdragon platform, which is set to drive revenue growth over the next decade.\n\nQualcomm’s recent financial performance has been impressive, with the company reporting strong revenue and earnings growth. This growth has been largely driven by its Snapdragon platform, with demand accelerating in the handset, automotive and Internet of Things (IoT) segments. Prior to 2024, Qualcomm trailed behind many semiconductor companies. However, that is changing fast now with the stock up over 45% year-to-date. In its latest quarterly results, Qualcomm saw a resurgence in handset revenues. The IoT segment grew 11% YOY and QCT Automotive revenues accelerated 35% YOY. Additionally, its recent blockbuster deal to integrate AI chips for Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) surface PCs is a gamechanger. This makes Qualcomm one of the best S&P 500’s stocks to buy in 2024.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is a diversified healthcare company that provides a wide range of health insurance and healthcare services. The company is the largest health insurer in the United States, and has maintained steady growth in both good and challenging macroeconomic environments.\n\nUnitedHealth Group’s integrated model, combining insurance with healthcare services through its Optum segment, provides a competitive edge. This has contributed to the company’s robust revenue, earnings and free cash flow since its acquisition of Optum in 2011. In addition to its strong revenue and earnings, it has remained a formidable dividend growth stock. UNH stock has returned significant capital back to shareholders over the years, growing its dividend at an 18% CAGR over the last decade. Very few companies of its size can replicate this growth, and it can be attributed to its strong cash flow from operations. In FY23, UnitedHealth Group’s free cash flow increased 10% YOY to a record $25.7 billion. Earnings per share also saw strong double digit growth, and management reiterated its EPS guidance of $27.50 – $28 per share in FY24.\n\nStory continues\n\nOracle (ORCL) ORCL stock: a 3-dimensional Oracle sign in an outdoor setting\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NYSE:ORCL) stands as one of the top S&P 500 stocks to buy in June. Its recent foray into generative AI and strategic investments into cloud infrastructure strengthen its long-term growth prospects.\n\nOracle has quietly been expanding its cloud business, making key investments into generative AI, cloud infrastructure and data centers. While it does not hold the reins of legacy cloud providers like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft, it remains a strategic partner in the AI race. Oracle’s Gen2 cloud infrastructure is uniquely positioned to meet the growing demands of AI workloads. Training and inference for complex AI models, including large language models, is impossible without the necessary infrastructure to back it. This demand has contributed to Oracle’s booming cloud business, that is at a $20 billion annual run rate in 2024. Moreover, it is rapidly expanding its data center footprint, with plans to build 100 new data centers across the globe. This won’t be the last time that you hear about generative AI, and rest assured that Oracle will be a part of the picture.\n\nOn the date of publication, Terel Miles did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "A Bull Market Is Here. 3 Reasons to Buy Amazon Like There's No Tomorrow.",
        "content": "The S&P 500 confirmed its presence in bull territory earlier this year by reaching a record high -- and just recently, it's shown its strength by roaring to yet another high. This momentum isn't over if history is a guide. That's because bull markets of the past have lasted considerably longer than bear markets -- nearly nine years versus 1.4, according to First Trust data.\n\nSo how can you benefit the most from these times of market growth and optimism? By investing in solid growth stocks that have what it takes to perform both now and over the long haul.\n\nOne of my favorites is a company most of us know pretty well. This company may deliver groceries and other merchandise to your door and entertainment to your TV or e-reader.\n\nI'm talking about Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), a stock that's climbed 17% so far this year, buoying the S&P 500, and this company's gains may be far from over. Let's check out three reasons to buy Amazon like there's no tomorrow. Image source: Getty Images.\n\n1. Leadership in two high-growth markets\n\nAmazon is a leader in both e-commerce and cloud computing, markets Grand View Research forecasts will expand at compound annual growth rates of more than 18% and 21%, respectively, to 2030. This market position, and the fact that Amazon continues to improve its offerings, mean that as these industries grow, Amazon should greatly benefit.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has put the focus on offering customers the lowest prices possible and achieving record delivery speeds. The company, through recent cost structure moves that I'll discuss, has decreased its cost to serve -- allowing it to cut prices on certain items and still maintain profitability. And in recent times, it's delivered orders at its fastest speeds ever. These two points are important to customers, so they should keep them coming back.\n\nAs for cloud computing, Amazon Web Services (AWS) dominates the global market and continues to expand, with a focus on the hot area of artificial intelligence (AI). It offers products and services across price ranges, so it may appeal to a broad variety of customers. In the most recent quarter, AWS, which generally drives Amazon's overall profit, reported double-digit growth in net sales and operating income -- so it's on track to continue powering the company's earnings.\n\n2. On track to monetize artificial intelligence\n\nSpeaking of AI, Amazon could be among the first to monetize it. In the recent quarter, AWS reported an annualized revenue run rate of $100 billion, thanks to Amazon's investment in this potentially game-changing technology.\n\nStory continues\n\nHow is AWS generating revenue from its investment so quickly? Amazon is tackling AI from every angle, making it possible for the company to play a role in just about any AI project.\n\nAWS sells the nuts and bolts to launch an AI program such as chips to train AI models -- and it offers everything from premium chips by leaders like Nvidia to lower-priced options Amazon has developed in house. For those who don't want to start an AI program from scratch, AWS also offers a fully managed service that gives customers access to top large language models that they can customize. Finally, Amazon also has developed a variety of apps, such as Amazon Q, a generative AI-powered assistant for software development.\n\nThe AI market is forecast to reach more than $1 trillion by the end of the decade, and Amazon's focus on this technology could make it one of the big winners.\n\n3. A new cost structure that could boost earnings\n\nAmazon has a solid track record of earnings growth -- but it has hit bumpy patches along the way. In fact, rising interest rates and the difficult economic environment weighed on the company back in 2022 -- so much that Amazon reported its first annual loss in nearly a decade.\n\nThe good news is the tough economic times prompted Amazon to revamp its cost structure, making moves that not only helped it recover in the short term but also set it up for long-term growth. Amazon took steps like cutting jobs and improving efficiency, and it also made a huge change in its fulfillment process that's lowered its cost to serve.\n\nAmazon switched its U.S. fulfillment model to a regional one from a national one, bringing inventory closer to the customer. This is saving Amazon money, as mentioned, and it's also speeding up deliveries. So it's great for the customer and for Amazon -- a win-win situation.\n\nThese and other cost efforts put Amazon in great shape to succeed right now in the bull market and over time throughout market cycles. So right now is a fantastic time to buy Amazon shares hand over fist and hold on for the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Stocks Billionaires Are Buying in the Wake of the Nasdaq Bull Market",
        "content": "The Nasdaq Composite is up 60% since bottoming out in late 2022, but the recent buying activity from a select group of billionaires shows there are plenty of stocks that still have room to run.\n\nDaniel Loeb of Third Point, Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management, and David Tepper of Appaloosa Management have created incredible wealth from successful investing careers. These investors see opportunities in e-commerce, cloud services, and video games.\n\nLet's look at three stocks each investor recently bought, and why they could deliver great returns for you, too.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nThird Point's CEO and Chief Investment Officer, Daniel Loeb, has an estimated net worth of $3.3 billion, according to Forbes. Loeb is an opportunistic investor who looks for undervalued stocks that could rise based on specific catalysts. The firm added to its position in Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) in the first quarter as the e-commerce leader continues to show progress in reducing costs to grow earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThe shares are up 47% over the last year and currently trade at almost 40 times this year's consensus earnings estimate. This valuation looks expensive, but Amazon's earnings are growing so rapidly right now that the stock could actually look quite cheap in another few years.\n\nAmazon has been optimizing its inventory across regional fulfillment centers to speed up delivery. It's on a mission to rein in costs to maximize the company's profit potential, and that's working like a charm. The company's earnings tripled year over year in the first quarter, and it could continue to report substantial earnings growth as management is still identifying areas to improve efficiency.\n\nLoeb clearly likes Amazon's dominant position in online retail shopping and its ability to execute on maximizing financial results. Wall Street analysts project Amazon's earnings per share will reach $7.39 in 2026, and the company's latest results indicate it is well on track to meet those estimates.\n\nAmazon has always commanded a premium valuation due to recurring revenue streams from its loyal Prime members and the long runway of growth it has in its cloud computing business. If the stock is still trading at a forward P/E of 39 in two years, that would put the share price at $288, implying an upside of 63%.\n\n2. Take-Two Interactive\n\nChase Coleman is the founder of Tiger Global and has an estimated net worth of $5.7 billion, according to Forbes. Tiger Global oversees about $50 billion in equity assets and has delivered superior returns for investors over the last two decades. One stock the firm bought in the first quarter is leading video game producer Take-Two Interactive(NASDAQ: TTWO).\n\nStory continues\n\nThe video game industry has a long history of growth going back to the 1970s. This is reflected in Take-Two's share price performance, which handed investors a market-beating 674% cumulative return over the last 10 years. Take-Two stock is on the march as investors look forward to a blockbuster new release next year.\n\nTake-Two's Grand Theft Auto V has been a runaway success, selling around 200 million copies. The game offers players continued updates and expansions that keep them playing year-round, which is why investors are high on the company's prospects as the next release in the long-running series is around the corner.\n\nGrand Theft Auto (GTA) VI is planned for launch in the fall of calendar 2025, and there appears to be enormous pent-up demand for the first GTA title in over a decade. The official trailer was released in December and has been watched 192 million times to date on Alphabet's YouTube.\n\nWhat's more, Take-Two has several other releases scheduled for the next few years, which are expected to drive EPS up to $9.06 over the next three years, according to the Wall Street consensus.\n\nEven if Take-Two's forward P/E drops from an expensive 64 to a more reasonable multiple of 30, Wall Street's forward EPS estimate would imply a share price of $271, implying a nearly 70% upside over the current share price.\n\n3. JD.com\n\nJD.com(NASDAQ: JD) is one of the leading online retail businesses in China, and it has over $150 billion in annual revenue. The company has maintained stable revenue over the last year in a weak economy, but slowing growth sent the stock well off its previous peak.\n\nBillionaire hedge fund manager David Tepper, who has a net worth of over $20 billion, is one of the most successful investors over the last few decades. He took advantage of the lower share price to acquire a stake in JD.com worth almost $100 million in the first quarter. Tepper is clearly making a contrarian bet on one of the leaders in China's internet sector, which has seen many of the top stocks fall to new 52-week lows over the last year over increasing competition and sluggish consumer spending.\n\nJD.com stock has already climbed about 45% off the 52-week low. The share price is responding to positive financial results, where the company's revenue grew 7% year over year in the first quarter, driven by strong growth in active customers.\n\nThe latest results could be the start of a trend. JD.com's operational efficiency is a solid competitive advantage. The company provides logistics support to other major retailers like Walmart, and it continues to expand same-day delivery to more customers to solidify its competitive position.\n\nThe stock's forward price-to-earnings ratio of 9.1 is a steal. As the company recovers, Wall Street analysts project the company's earnings to reach $4.08 in 2026. A combination of healthy earnings growth and a higher P/E could lead to substantial gains from the current share price. The S&P 500 average P/E is 27, so JD.com could double in value if the stock's valuation moves closer to the market average.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- EBay Inc. will drop American Express Co. cards as a payment option on the online marketplace because of “unacceptably high fees,” according to an email reviewed by Bloomberg News that the company plans to send to customers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India? BlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Bonds Rally as Traders Reload Fed Bets After Data: Markets Wrap\n\nEBay plans to notify customers this week about the change, which is set to take effect Aug. 17.\n\n“After careful consideration, eBay has decided to no longer accept American Express globally effective August 17 due to the unacceptably high fees American Express charges for processing credit card transactions,” the email states.\n\nThe two companies have been embroiled in negotiations around the merchant discount rates — also known as interchange fees — charged by Amex at the point of sale. The fees, charged each time a card is used in a transaction by the respective payments network, have long been a headache for merchants. One trade group said retailers paid more than $172 billion in card-processing fees last year.\n\nAmex, however, said its research shows that its fees are comparable to what eBay must pay to accept similar cards on other networks, like Visa Inc. and Mastercard Inc., while providing more value.\n\n“American Express Card Members have an average transaction size at eBay that is more than double the transaction size of cards from other networks,” New York-based Amex said in a statement. “We find eBay’s decision to drop American Express as a payment choice for consumers to be inconsistent with their stated desire to increase competition at the point of sale.”\n\nCompetitors of eBay — including Amazon.com Inc. — have made similar moves while at the bargaining table over the transaction fees. Amazon threatened to pull all Visa cards from being accepted on its global network before finally striking a deal and abandoning the bluff. Amex has also lost deals, like its once-exclusive pact with Costco Wholesale Corp., over its terms.\n\nEBay has lost significant market share to other e-commerce giants like Amazon and Walmart Inc. in recent years, and last month provided a weaker-than-anticipated earnings outlook for the current quarter. Globally, shoppers will spend $73.4 billion on the marketplace this year, according to average analyst estimates compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nStory continues\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStartup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies The Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Elon and Donald Seem to Have Made Up Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Sleeper Solar Stocks That You Will Wish You Bought Sooner",
        "content": "2023 was a very tough year for solar stocks overall. The Federal Reserve’s decision to hike interest rates several times made borrowing much more expensive, resulting in lower profitability for solar firms. Solar ETF performance was pretty dismal overall with some stunning losses.\n\n2024 began with the expectation of a turnaround on hopes for interest rate cuts. Those cuts have yet to materialize but solar stocks are staging something of a comeback. That comeback has been catalyzed not by cuts but instead by narratives around clean electricity demand spikes due to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nLarge AI hyperscalers run data centers that consume massive quantities of electricity. Those companies are looking to carbon-neutral electricity to power increasing electricity demands. Recent analyst suggestions that solar power may be the answer have reignited interest across the sector.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) stock was trading sideways this year up until the AI clean electricity narrative emerged. That suggestion sparked interest in the stock sending prices from $196 to $276 overnight.\n\nAs noted, AI hyperscalers like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) are making substantial efforts to introduce carbon neutrality at the data center level.\n\nCarbon emissions from those companies accelerated last year. Microsoft’s emissions increase 29% in 2023 relative to 2020 levels. Meanwhile, the company has pledged to be carbon neutral by 2030 creating a massive opportunity for companies like First Solar that have the capacity to serve solar energy data center scale demand.\n\nThe renewable opportunity extends far beyond America’s borders. In 2023, renewable capacity expanded by 50% globally. Solar power was the most important contributor to that growth. Photovoltaic cells accounted for three quarters of renewable energy capacity additions worldwide during the year. There are multiple reasons to be bullish on First Solar stock at the moment.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) multiple powerline towers are shown against a sunset and a distant city skyline. AQN stock\n\nSource: zhao jiankang / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) stock has surged over the past month and a half. Although the stock is currently fully priced and then some there is reason to invest now.\n\nNextEra Energy is a unique company in terms of its composition. The company operates two distinct business segments: one is the largest sun and solar renewable energy firm globally, the other is the largest publicly traded utility in the U.S.\n\nStory continues\n\nSo, the company is clearly positioned to take advantage of the AI data center carbon-neutral energy opportunity. It should be a big beneficiary of the rising demand for solar energy due to AI.\n\nHowever, I also like the stock for its utility business and the dividend that the company pays. That dividend currently yields 2.6%. It should become increasingly attractive in anticipation of rate cuts later in the year. What I mean is that bond yields are currently high but will fall once the Federal Reserve enacts rate cuts. That should prompt a pivot back into utility stocks for their dividend yields.\n\nArray Technologies (ARRY) Solar penny stocks: Piggy bank in front of solar panel infrastructure\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nArray Technologies (NASDAQ:ARRY) stock should be improving significantly in the coming weeks and months.\n\nThe company reported earnings in the second week of May showing just how drastically the solar sector has declined. First quarter revenues were just above $153 million, down from nearly $377 million a year prior.\n\nThe gutting of demand turned the company from one that produced $17 million in net income a year ago to one that produced a net loss exceeding $11 million during the first quarter of this year.\n\nIn that report, Array Technologies noted it expects revenue generation to ramp up during the back half of 2024. I can only assume that the company made such projections on the expectation of rate cuts.\n\nIt is likely the company will exceed those former guidance projections now that the cat is out of the bag about AI-driven solar demand. Solar companies are going to rush to increase capacity meaning array technologies will have a golden opportunity to sell more of the ground-mounted tracking systems designed to maximize efficiency.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Chinese Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Chinese stocks don’t always have the best reputation among American traders. While these businesses can often hold sound theses and financials, the wildcard of potential government intervention or macroeconomic concerns can easily throw off your entire investment rationale. Risks mount up compared to other foreign companies With so much uncertainty, undervalued Chinese stocks are considered riskier trades.\n\nOver the past few years, Chinese stocks have been decimated. A regulatory crackdown by the CCP in November 2020 sent shockwaves through the industry. Stocks like Alibaba have fallen by 50% over the past five years, shedding hundreds of billions of dollars from their market cap. But at a certain point, these beaten-down companies become tremendous discounted opportunities. Here are three undervalued Chinese stocks to buy now for a bounce back.\n\nAlibaba (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba (NYSE:BABA) is the eighth-largest Chinese company in market capitalization and is a pioneer in the eCommerce and digital payments sectors. Wall Street analysts are certainly forecasting a rebound for Alibaba. In May, 47 of 48 recommendations were a Buy or Strong Buy rating, and the average price target of $109.49 represented a nearly 40% upside from the current price.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs mentioned, the stock has been down by roughly 50% over the past five years. Surprisingly, at that time, the company’s Alipay super app became the most widely used payment application in China, with over 660 million monthly active users. Alibaba’s operations of two of China’s largest eCommerce sites, Tmall and Taobao, have also been crucial for this company in expanding its addressable market and solidifying Alibaba’s market dominance.\n\nAlibaba is an undervalued Chinese stock because it’s trading at historically low multiples. Shares of BABA trade at 1.5x sales and 9.3x forward earnings despite growing its revenue at a ten-year CAGR of 33%. With such a discounted price underlying great financials, Alibaba stock is an amazing candidate for a rebound and breakout in June.\n\nJD.Com (JD) JD.com is a Chinese e-commerce company. Smartphone with JD.com logo on the screen, shopping cart and laptop. JD stock\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.Com (NASDAQ:JD) is a Chinese e-commerce company focusing on the business-to-consumer or B2C industry. It is a direct competitor to Alibaba’s Tmall platform and, like Alibaba, holds a bullish outlook for Wall Street analysts. The average analyst price target is $43.33, which implies more than 40% upside, and the street-high target of $97.12 is more than three times its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter, JD had a surprisingly good earnings report, and the stock rebounded. Revenue grew by 7.04% QOQ, and net income jumped by nearly 14.0%. Another area where JD is excelling? It’s now building up the largest network of drone and robotic delivery services. Their investments in AI and robotics and testing of autonomous delivery trucks have also been guided by management to be key growth driving areas.\n\nLike Alibaba, you’re getting JD at a rock bottom price multiple. Shares trade at 0.3x sales and 8.9x forward earnings. This low multiple is also accompanied by a company that has grown its revenue at a CAGR of 30% over the past ten years and its five-year net income at a CAGR of 50%! Buying JD stock at these prices almost seems like a no-brainer.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Smartphone displaying orange Temu logo in a miniature shopping cart against a yellow background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/yanishevska\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is more known as the owner of eCommerce website PinDuoDuo. In May, 44 of the 45 analyst recommendations for PDD were a Buy or Strong Buy rating. The average analyst price target sits at $205.53, which is nearly 40% higher than today’s price.\n\nThis stock has fared better than Alibaba and JD over the past year. Shares of PDD have returned more than 120% over the past 52 weeks and more than 650% over the past five years. This growth is largely attributed to the launch of its Temu marketplace in more than 50 countries worldwide to take on Tmall and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN). Although it started as an agricultural marketplace, PDD’s platforms now sell nearly anything you can think of!\n\nDespite increasing its revenue at a ten-year CAGR of 67%, shares are trading at lower multiples than ever before. Shares of PDD trade at 5.2x sales and 12.9x forward earnings. But the impressive thing about PDD is its 62% gross margins, nearly double the industry average of 32.5%! With such healthy financials, it would be foolish not to scoop up shares in this undervalued Chinese company.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Hartana and Vayun Chugh did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Snowflake CEO Is Seeking AI Deals in Battle With Databricks, Microsoft and Amazon",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Snowflake Inc.’s new Chief Executive Officer Sridhar Ramaswamy is looking for deals in artificial intelligence to stay competitive with peers like closely held Databricks Inc. and the cloud computing giants.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Mnuchin Chases Wall Street Glory With His War Chest of Foreign Money Treasuries Gain as JOLTS Spurs Faster Fed-Cut Bets: Markets Wrap Intel CEO Takes Aim at Nvidia in Fight for AI Chip Dominance\n\nThe data analytics provider was in talks to acquire startup Reka AI for more than $1 billion, but the discussions fizzled without a deal. Snowflake released its own large language model, Arctic, in April, and lets customers use LLMs from other companies like OpenAI on its platform. In May, Snowflake announced it would hire about 35 employees from AI-oriented startup TruEra, which last raised $25 million in 2022.\n\n“We will be on the lookout for acquisitions opportunistically,” Ramaswamy said in an interview, adding that Snowflake will also work to hire top AI talent. “The number of people, in my opinion, that can train truly world-class foundation models right now is vanishingly small — I would say like a couple hundred people.”\n\nRamaswamy, a former Google executive and co-founder of search startup Neeva, became Snowflake’s CEO earlier this year. His chief task is to resuscitate revenue growth, which has been buffeted by tight corporate technology budgets. One part of the effort has been to invest in AI.\n\nStill, investors have soured on Snowflake since sales growth rates have dropped from 69% in the year ended January 2023 to an estimated 24% in the current fiscal year, which ends in January 2025. The shares have plunged 31% this year, closing Monday at $136.93 in New York.\n\nCompetition with Databricks in certain areas means Snowflake needs to improve some functions, such as the ability to easily use data stored in different places, Ramaswamy said. Databricks has said sales of its data warehousing product, which goes head-to-head with Snowflake, jumped 200% in the previous year, ending 2023 at a $250 million annual revenue run rate.\n\n“If you’re in the business of storing data and getting insights from it, we’re just a much easier and more pleasant way to do it as opposed to needing to stitch together multiple services in order to do the same thing,” Ramaswamy said when asked about competition with Databricks.\n\nAt Snowflake’s annual customer conference Tuesday, the company announced products to help users access and analyze data stored in more places. It is also expanding support for Iceberg, a data storage method first created by Netflix Inc., which has become more popular in recent years. “We’re sort of leaning into it very heavily because we think it’s what customers want,” Ramaswamy said.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors are primarily focused on Snowflake’s relevance in AI and competitive positioning against Databricks and cloud infrastructure giants like Microsoft Corp. and Amazon.com Inc.’s Amazon Web Services, Brad Zelnick, an analyst at Deutsche Bank, wrote before the conference. “We believe it will be important for management to address some of these topics and rightly or wrongly perceived threats head on.”\n\nAs for competition with the cloud providers, Ramaswamy said Snowflake’s products are better than comparable ones from Microsoft and Amazon, though their tools are “going to get better and so we need to keep improving our core product as well.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Budget Geeks Who Helped Solve an American Economic Puzzle Startup Brings New Hope to the Pursuit of Reviving Frozen Bodies Yes, Walmart Store Managers Really Can Make $500,000 a Year Disney Is Banking On Sequels to Help Get Pixar Back on Track How Rage, Boredom and WallStreetBets Created a New Generation of Young American Traders\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Costco Gobbles Discretionary Market Share Thanks To Its Value Proposition",
        "content": "Costco Gobbles Discretionary Market Share Thanks To Its Value Proposition\n\nLast week, Costco Wholesale Corporation (NASDAQ: COST) reported its fiscal third quarter earnings that surpassed estimates. Last Thursday, Costco management emphasized its membership pricing, digital sales growth, along with its recently expanded partnership with Uber Technologies Inc (NYSE: UBER).\n\nFiscal Third Quarter Highlights\n\nFor the quarter ended on May 12, Costco recorded revenue grew 9% YoY to $58.52 billion, earning $3.78 per share. Excluding gasoline and foreign exchange impact, comparable sales, rose 6.5%. E-commerce sales surged 20.7%powered by gold and silver bullion, gift cards and appliances. Membership fees brought about $1.23 billion to the revenue table, rising 7.6% YoY.\n\nLowering Prices Bodes Well For Costco\n\nLike its peers, Target (NYSE: TGT), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ: WBA) and Walmart (NYSE: WMT) Costco has lowered prices over the quarter to boost discretionary spending. Walgreens Boots Alliance even slashed its full-year earnings outlook in response to a challenging retail environment in the US. Target is also expecting another slow year after reporting its 2023 sales fell for the first time since 2016. Over the past few weeks, even the mighty e-commerce titan Amazon.com Inc (NASDAQ: AMZN) joined Walmart and Target in slashing prices on thousands of household goods. Back in May, Target announced it is slashing prices on 5,000 items, after already lowering prices on 1,500 items in an effort to boost consumer spending. As the lower average cost per item is key to Costco’s value proposition when it comes to buying in bulk, lowering prices even further could further fuel sales and unsurprisingly, Costco plans to continue doing so. In their recent earnings report, both Target and Walmart noted a pullback in discretionary spending, while Costco's value and unique deals have given way to more discretionary spending and a larger market share.\n\nCostco is waiting for the right time to raise membership prices.\n\nThroughout most of its history, Costco has been raising its membership prices every five years on average, but it's now been nearly seven years since its last price hike and Costco is still keeping them steady. At the end of the third quarter, Costco had 74.5 million members, up from 73.4 million last quarter and 69.1 million from last year’s comparable quarter, reporting about a million more memberships than analysts had expected. Costco is not willing to risk these figures.\n\nStory continues\n\nCostco is determined to catch up on the digital front.\n\nCostco has been working for a while to catch up digitally after historically being slow to adapt to new trends, such as online shopping. With its latest quarter, its efforts have started to pay off with e-commerce sales growing 20.7%YoY. Along with Uber, Costco also has a yearslong partnership with Instacart (NASDAQ: CART). Through Instacart, Costco is offering same-day grocery delivery to customers. Uber also recently partnered with Instacart in an effort to take down DoorDash (NASDAQ: DASH) and its higher-income suburban shoppers.\n\nPreviously, Uber Eats delivered Costco products in test markets across Texas, but the partnership recently expanded to 17 states in the U.S. as well as all of its Canadian locations. Uber and Costco aim to expand their alliance across the U.S. as well as other international markets where Costco is present. Being considered as the king of suburbia, Costco is the perfect ally to Uber on its quest to conquer the suburbs. Excluding food court items, Costco members and non-members will be able to purchase products, while members will enjoy 15% to 20% lower pricing. Costco members will also gain a 20% discount on an Uber One membership that includes free deliveries, discounts on certain purchases, as well as member pricing on rides.\n\nCosto continues to expand its store footprint across the U.S. and the globe.\n\nDuring the reported quarter, Costco opened a pair of new locations in the U.S. In the current, fourth quarter, it plans to open a total of 12, having already opened two since the reported third quarter ended, with nine new locations planned in the U.S. two in Japan and one in South Korea, which would imply 29 new locations during the fiscal year.\n\nThe warehouse retailer is doing business as usual, while it continues to grow across the U.S . and beyond, gobbling market share, with plenty of more room for growth ahead as Americans look for ways to save when buying home goods and discretionary items.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "Goldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1",
        "content": "Investing.com - The quarterly earnings season has largely ended, and Goldman Sachs has taken this opportunity to revisit its top 10 investing themes for 2024, and the stocks in focus in conjunction with these themes. Here are the first five topics:\n\nThe rise of generative AI\n\nThe rise of artificial intelligence, specifically Generative AI, and its potential to alter the consumer and enterprise computing landscape has been a key debate for investors for the past 12 months or so, analysts at the influential investment bank said, in a note dated May 17.\n\n“In many ways, we see AI (its continued development and deployment across all aspects of the digital economy) as perhaps the most influential theme in decades and reminiscent of other prior major internet shifts (e.g. the shift from desktop [Web 1.0] to mobile [Web 2.0]),” said Goldman.\n\nStocks of publicly listed technology companies have tended to react promptly to perceived changes in strategic positioning resulting from the rise in Generative AI, Goldman added.\n\nSo far the debate around Generative AI has tended to center largely on the infrastructure layer - fulfillment of the Cloud Computing needs associated with this technology, involving largely Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) - and the AI model/platform layer, where we view that only a select few (mainly Google, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META)) have the scale of capital and technical resources to compete effectively.\n\nHowever, the bank increasingly sees an opportunity for AI implementation to begin to drive meaningful impacts, both positively and negatively, across various aspects of consumer internet in 2024 - the application layer.\n\nInvestor debates are likely to center around about how Generative AI might alter go to market strategies; input costs; and the competitive landscape for any specific end market that disrupts more traditional desktop/mobile behaviors.\n\n“Broadly, we expect Generative AI to produce a mix of product innovation and changed consumer behavior across many subsectors in our coverage,” Goldman added.\n\nBlurring lines between advertising and e-commerce models\n\n“We continue to see blurring lines between traditional advertising and e-commerce business models,” analysts at Goldman said, “with retail media capturing more budgets as traditional e-commerce platforms continue to build out their advertising offerings and digital advertising platforms continue to innovate around social commerce.”\n\nThat said, over the past few months, the bank has also observed a pivot in strategies by both e-commerce and digital advertising companies as it relates to this theme by embracing a partnership-type model versus trying to directly compete for traffic and transactions.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bank continues to see that social commerce remains a key long-term secular theme within digital advertising, but expects digital ad platforms to further pivot their strategies and prioritize building better user experiences around shopping/commerce over the medium-term.\n\nGoldman sees Google; Meta Platforms (in partnership with Amazon); and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS) (also in partnership with Amazon) as well positioned against this theme.\n\nTurning to retail media, Goldman sees a long runway for Amazon to continue to grow its advertising business.\n\nElsewhere, Uber (NYSE:UBER) disclosed that advertising revenues hit a $900 million annualized run-rate in the fourth quarter of 2023 and remains on track to exceed its prior target of $1bn+ by 2024, while Lyft (NASDAQ:LYFT) is also focused on scaling its advertising business.\n\nRising competition in e-commerce landscape\n\nThe e-commerce landscape continues to reset towards a new normal of slowing demand, more moderate increases in online penetration rates, an ongoing shift of spending from goods to services, and a more discerning consumer.\n\nConsumers appear to be consolidating their online spending around fewer platforms and refocus on price/selection/convenience - supporting gains from two main types of players: large aggregators with scale, leading delivery speeds, and competitive pricing, and platforms focused on low-cost items, including new Asia-based cross-border competitors.\n\nThe bank continues “to see Amazon as best positioned to produce a mixture of strong revenue growth and margin expansion with lower risk to estimates relative to smaller peers against an increasingly volatile consumer backdrop.”\n\nImpact of AI on digital advertising\n\nArtificial intelligence and automation in the context of digital advertising (across various aspects of the value chain) has been a key theme in recent months, potentially allowing smaller advertisers to adopt more sophisticated digital ad strategies and driving better targeting/returns on customer acquisition spend, as well as helping individual creators.\n\nIn some ways, this democratizing effect and the broader integration of AI into digital advertising could be an positive for smaller platforms as AI implementation improves underlying ad tech, drives deeper user engagement and/or enables improved performance for other digital channels.\n\nThis could offer upside over the long-term for mid-cap digital ad platforms, including the likes of Pinterest, Snap, DoubleVerify (NYSE:DV) and Yelp (NYSE:YELP).\n\nThat said, a potentially more likely outcome, is that the large-scaled, incumbent platforms (who are furthest along in terms of AI development&adoption - e.g. Google&Meta Platforms) disproportionately benefit from this theme, as these platforms have the scale of capital, engineering talent/resources and first-party data to remain AI leaders and that smaller platforms may have difficulty matching.\n\nShift of local commerce activity online\n\nLocal commerce continues to build in scale as consumers increasingly prioritize faster delivery speeds and as the industry invests to meet these expectations.\n\nTraditional e-commerce companies and on-demand delivery platforms are increasingly competing head-on, as on-demand platforms expand into more traditional retail categories, and as both sets of players are focusing more resources to digitize large categories that were historically underpenetrated by online.\n\nThese new verticals are accretive to the growth of restaurant delivery businesses, with the likes of Uber and DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) seeing strong momentum.\n\n“Both UBER and DASH have commented on these new verticals being important investment areas that while a drag to margins today (not yet adjusted EBITDA profitable) are displaying improving unit economics and strong growth and support mgmt’s confidence that these businesses have attractive long-term return profiles,” said Goldman.\n\nWithin more traditional eCommerce platforms, Amazon continues to expand its online grocery business and is increasingly consolidating its various brands/platforms in a more integrated offering for consumers.\n\nAmazon sees room to drive further efficiencies from its logistics network which Goldman expects to remain an important tailwind to multi-year retail margins.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoldman's 10 industry themes for 2024 - Part 1\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq dip in choppy trading after economic data\n\nRussia's two largest banks to open in annexed regions of Ukraine by July\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant and Piling Into This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred three weeks ago. During the heart of earnings season, and following the eagerly awaited April inflation report, institutions with $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn simple terms, a 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter. In this instance, it covered trading activity during the March-ended quarter. Even though these snapshots are backward looking, they can offer valuable insight into what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\n\nOne theme that's definitely stood out for more than a year has been Wall Street's love for almost anything involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Using software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to evolve over time without human intervention, provides AI with multitrillion-dollar utility in virtually all sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut what's interesting about this affinity for AI stocks is that the face of the AI revolution has been sent to the chopping block for two consecutive quarters by billionaire investors. At the same time, we've seen billionaires repeatedly pile into another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock with abundant long-term potential.\n\nOver a half-dozen billionaires are dumping Nvidia stock\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence might be the hottest innovation since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, it didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers from casting aside shares of the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement during the March-ended quarter. Eight billionaire investors -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- sent shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) packing, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia has taken advantage of its AI-driven opportunity. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred choice in high-compute data centers, and it's enjoying otherworldly pricing power on these chips as a result. Nvidia's gross margin came in at a scorching-hot 78.4% during its fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, there are four very clear reasons for billionaire investors to be skeptical of Nvidia moving forward.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is that history has been unkind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Without fail, investors have overestimated the uptake/adoption of every new innovation, and AI is unlikely to break this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, the company that most-directly benefited from its rise (Nvidia) would be the likeliest to deflate.\n\nThe second issue is that Nvidia's pricing power on its GPUs is likely to wane in the quarters to come. Competitors are rolling out GPUs designed to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 GPUs retain a compute edge over its competitors, the increased availability of new GPUs will lessen the scarcity that sent Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere. When this pricing power fades, so will Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nTight domestic regulation on AI solutions is another concern. In each of the last two years, U.S. regulators have restricted what AI chips Nvidia can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Nvidia even developed toned-down AI-GPUs (the A800 and H800) specifically for China following the first round of export restrictions in 2022, only to have these chips also banned for export to China last year. Sans China, Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly revenue.\n\nThe fourth and final puzzle piece that may have encouraged billionaires to ring the register is an increasing amount of internal competition. Nvidia's top four customers account for roughly 40% of its net sales. The problem is that they're all developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed chips are to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs or to replace them entirely, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from these industry-leading businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis Magnificent Seven stock has been the apple of billionaires' eyes\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have been widely credited with sending Wall Street's major stocks indexes to record-closing highs. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest (by market cap) and most-influential businesses in the country and are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven companies are industry leaders with well-defined long-term catalysts and clear competitive edges. In fact, the four top customers of Nvidia I alluded to earlier are Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nBut these are also stocks that billionaires have been avid sellers of in recent quarters... with one exception: e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the first quarter, nine billionaires piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia stock (Laffont, Griffin, and Englander) were buyers of Amazon shares.\n\nThough Amazon's online marketplace is considered the \"face\" of the company, it's not why billionaires have taken the plunge. Amazon's exceptional growth in cash flow has everything to do with its trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's cash flow or bottom line than the ongoing growth and success of cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on an analysis from Canalys, AWS accounted for a hearty 31% of global cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. As of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. With enterprise cloud spending still rapidly accelerating, the juicy margins associated with cloud services should allow Amazon to rapidly grow its operating cash flow.\n\nSubscription services (e.g., Prime) is another segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth potential. In exchange for Prime member perks like free two-day shipping on most online marketplace orders and access to Amazon's growing content library, Amazon enjoys strong subscription pricing power with Prime. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and has almost certainly added to this total.\n\nThe third higher-margin ancillary segment that does some heavy lifting for Amazon is advertising. When you're driving in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion monthly visitors to your site each month, as well as growing the number of Prime subscribers, it's easy to command higher prices from advertisers who want motivated shoppers to see their message(s).\n\nPut these three ancillary segments together and you get a company slated to more than double its cash-flow-per-share between 2023 and 2027. Relative to its future cash flow, Amazon remains historically cheap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Where Will Amazon Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Although Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has been a fantastic business to have owned over the past two decades, in more recent times, this just hasn't been the case. Shares are up just 10% in the last three years (as of June 3).\n\nThis modest gain, which lags the Nasdaq Composite's return, doesn't take away from the fact that this e-commerce and cloud computing juggernaut is one of the most dominant enterprises on planet Earth. And that's why investors should still keep it on their radar.\n\nWhere might Amazon stock be three years from now?\n\nOnline shopping\n\nIt's a startling statistic, but about 38% of all online spending in the U.S. goes through Amazon.com. This is significantly higher than its second- and third-place rivals (Walmart and Apple, which have about 6% and 4%, respectively). That lead just goes to show you the stranglehold Amazon has in the e-commerce space.\n\nI have zero doubt that this is still going to be the case in 2027. With its relentless focus on obsessing over the customer, Amazon provides shoppers with millions of items at low prices. And thanks to its sprawling logistics network, fast and free shipping is offered in a cost-effective way that only improves the consumer experience. It was recently reported that Amazon has already added 16 million square feet of warehouse space this year in an effort to bolster its delivery capabilities.\n\nIn the U.S., online shopping accounts for less than 16% of all retail spending. That share has climbed from 10% exactly five years ago. Assuming this slow-and-steady rise continues, this provides a nice secular tailwind for Amazon to capture more sales growth.\n\nAmazon's growth drivers\n\nAmazon is arguably one of the most innovative companies out there. Despite being known mainly as an e-commerce business among the general public, there are other segments that will keep its expansion going at a brisk pace.\n\nMany investors are familiar with Amazon Web Services (AWS), the company's industry-leading cloud computing division. AWS typically posts double-digit revenue growth. And in the most recent quarter (Q1 2024, ended March 31), it reported a superb 37.6% operating margin.\n\nInvestors should expect AWS (which accounted for 16% of revenue in 2023) to become a more important driver of sales and earnings in the future. The shift from on-site tech infrastructure to off-premises, coupled with many clients' desire to integrate artificial intelligence capabilities into their operations, provides AWS with a nice tailwind.\n\nThen there's digital advertising, an area Amazon has found tremendous success in thanks to its popular online marketplace. Ads were introduced to the Prime Video streaming service in January, providing another valuable asset to monetize.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the last quarter, digital ads resulted in $47.2 billion of annualized revenue. This scale puts it behind only Alphabet and Meta Platforms in terms of domestic market share.\n\nChanges in valuation\n\nIt doesn't take a lot of convincing to get one to appreciate Amazon's operations. It dominates multiple industry verticals and has meaningful growth potential.\n\nBut investors need to consider valuation in their analysis before determining what to do with the stock. While Amazon hasn't been too great of an investment in the past three years, since the start of 2023, shares are up 112%. Consequently, the valuation isn't as attractive as it was about 12 months ago, when the stock traded at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of just 2.4.\n\nToday, the P/S multiple sits at 3.2. That might seem expensive, but it's in line with the stock's trailing-10-year average. Given the potential for sizable revenue and income gains over the next three years, investors are likely to be rewarded if they add Amazon shares to their portfolio.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Last year and this year saw record numbers of institutional and retail investors pile into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company’s stock value has increased, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia makes graphic chips used to train and operate AI applications. As a result, companies experimenting with AI applications are buying Nvidia products, causing its stock to climb.\n\nBut not everyone is enthused with Nvidia, including billionaires. That’s certainly true for legendary investor Warren Buffet, who famously said not to buy what you don’t understand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s see which stocks billionaires are betting on instead of Nvidia. You just might walk away with insights into what stocks to buy for your portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is a strong investor favorite and one of the solid stocks to buy.\n\nIt sure is for billionaire Steven Cohen, who slashed his investment company Point72’s Nvidia position by 55% this quarter but maintained Amazon as the company’s largest stock allocation at $680 million.\n\nThe tech and e-commerce business has forayed into several industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, entertainment, publishing and AI. That has made it one of the most successful companies and earned it a place in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe company’s 2024 Q1 results had a strong showing across all key metrics. It included a net income of $10.4 billion against $3.2 billion last year. Its earnings per share also grew to $0.98 from $0.31 a year ago.\n\nMoreover, Amazon shares are in focus after Reuters reported the company is in talks to pump billions of euros into data centers in Italy in its latest push to expand its cloud presence in Europe.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has a $332 billion stock portfolio spread out across 41 stocks, and Nvidia isn’t one of them.\n\nThe holding company’s top five holdings include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 41%, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC): 12%, American Express (NYSE:AXP): 10%, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO): 7.4% and Chevron (NYSE:CVX): 5.8% — per Q1’s 13F filing. Chevron’s position is worth over $19 billion.\n\nThe oil and gas company is noteworthy because Berkshire Hathaway significantly upped its stake in Q4 last year.\n\nChevron shares are expected to rise if it buys out Hess Corp (NYSE:HES) in a $53 billion merger proposal. The deal is currently on ice due to a dispute with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), a Hess partner.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite that particular wrinkle, analysts are bullish on Chevron — and it’s a promising stock to buy. At the time of writing, CVX has 12 buy ratings on the Wall Street Journal, with a price target of $183.99. Shares are currently trading in the ballpark of $162 apiece.\n\nCVR Energy (CVI) The logo for CVR Energy (CVI) is shown on a cellphone next to a screen displaying the company's website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll signs have been pointing to trouble for CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI), but that hasn’t stopped billionaire Carl Icahn from allocating close to 20% of his portfolio to its shares.\n\nThe Sugar Land, Texas-based oil refining company’s financials for Q1 2024 paint the picture of hard times for the company for the past year.\n\nFor instance, it netted only $90 million this quarter compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Its adjusted earnings were 4 cents per diluted share against earnings of $1.44 for the first quarter of last year.\n\nIcahn first bought CVR stock in 2012.

        "title": "4 CEOs Who Bought Their Own Stock in May",
        "content": "Defying bad news, several chief executive officers bought their own companies' stock last month. Here are four cases that caught my eye.\n\nAt Skyworks Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), CEO Liam Griffin spent just over $1 million to buy 11,142 shares. That brings his total holding to 153,431 shares, worth more than $14 million as of May 31.\n\nA semiconductor maker, Skyworks specializes in chips for mobile devices, especially smartphones. Its customers have included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Samsung Electronics Co. (XKRX:005930) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SWKS.\n\nApple is the biggest customer, and Skyworks has been criticized for over-dependence on Apple. That's a valid criticism, but far from a fatal one in my view.\n\nSkyworks has grown its revenue at an 11.60% annual clip in the past decade. But in the past year, revenue fell (coincidentally) 11.60%. Investors have to gauge which result is more indicative of the future.\n\nGriffin is apparently on the optimistic side of that choice. He has been with Skyworks for many years and has frequently sold shares acquired as executive compensation. Last month's buy was his first open-market purchase since 2006.\n\nSkyworks stock seems reasonably priced at 15 times the earnings analysts expect for the fiscal year in progress.\n\nGlobe Life\n\nGlobe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) shares took a 53% dive on April 11, on a negative report by Fuzzy Panda Research. Fuzzy Panda, which held a short position in the stock (betting on a decline) alleged that Globe was guilty of insurance fraud.\n\nFuzzy Panda alleged that Globe Life has sold life insurance policies to dead people and fictitious people. It also alleged that Globe Life executives secretly had an ownership stake in Xcel Testing, and directed recruits to Xcel to prepare for licensing examinations.\n\nGlobe Life responded that Fuzzy Panda's report was wildly misleading and painted a picture of the company that is deliberately false. It said the report mischaracterizes facts and uses unsubstantiated claims and conjecture.\n\nThe company has co-CEOs James Darden and Frank Svoboda. Both of them bought shares in May, as did two other company executives. In addition, four directors bought shares in April, about two weeks after the short seller's attack.\n\nBloomberg News on April 12 described Fuzzy Panda as an anonymous organization.\" I'm skeptical that the short seller's attack is accurate. Accordingly, I think the stock is a speculative buy, but I wouldn't put more than 1% of your portfolio in it.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobe Life shares fell from more than $120 early this year to just below $50 when the short seller's report hit. It has climbed back to about $83.\n\nOxford Lane\n\nOxford Lane Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXLC) is a closed-end investment company that invests in collateralized loan obligations. CEO Jonathan Cohen spent $25 million in May to greatly increase his stake. President Saul Rosenthal made an identical investment.\n\nThese two executives are attempting to shore up a company that has posted four losses in the past 10 years. The dividend yield is gigantic, at about 17% a year, and dividends are paid monthly. A dividend that large is a danger sign, but may also be an opportunity.\n\nAcacia Research\n\nAcacia Research Corp. (NASDAQ:ACTG) is bafflingly diverse for a small company. One segment makes printers and supplies for industrial printing. Another explores for and produces oil and gas. A third acquires and manages patents.\n\nThe company has lost money in six of the past 10 years. Over that time, the stock has lost 65% of its value. Nonetheless, CEO Martin Mcnulty and general counsel Jason Soncini bought shares in May. These were the first insider buys since 2021.\n\nThe record\n\nThe column you're reading is the 70th one I've written about insider purchases and sales. I'm missing some data for the first six, but can tabulate 12-month results for 60 columns all those from 1999 through a year ago.\n\nThe stocks I've recommended based on insider buys have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index by an average of 0.40 percentage points.\n\nWhen insiders bought, but I suggested avoiding the stock, the average result trailed the S&P 500 by 24 percentage points.\n\nOn stocks where I discussed insider sales, the average result was two percentage points below the index.\n\nOn a few stocks, I noted buying by company executives but made no comment or an ambiguous one. Perversely, this group beat the benchmark by 16 percentage points.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, and a syndicated columnist.

        "title": "Amazon (AMZN) Rides on AWS Amid Strong Generative AI Efforts",
        "content": "Amazon’s AMZN shares have gained 16.1% on a year-to-date basis, outperforming the Zacks Internet Commerce industry’s return of 11.1%. The e-commerce giant is riding on the solid momentum in its cloud computing arm, Amazon Web Services (“AWS”).\r\n\r\nAWS has been riding on an expanding clientele on the back of its strengthening generative AI capabilities. This is evident from its latest partnership with SAP SAP.\r\n\r\nPer the terms of this collaboration, AWS and SAP strive to accelerate the implementation of generative AI for various enterprises.\r\n\r\nSAP intends to embed generative AI solutions across its enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications with the help of AWS.\r\n\r\nSAP will integrate generative AI models from Amazon Bedrock, such as the Anthropic Claude 3 model family and Amazon Titan, into its generative AI hub in SAP AI Core to provide its customers with access to several large language models (LLM) and foundation models (FM).\r\n\r\nWith the latest partnership, AWS has become the first cloud provider certified to support the SAP portfolio.\r\n\r\nSAP, which already uses AWS Graviton3 chips to support SAP HANA Cloud, now plans to leverage AWS Trainium and AWS Inferentia chips to train and deploy future SAP business AI offerings.\r\n\r\nClearly, SAP’s extended collaboration with AWS has added strength to the latter’s clientele.\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus Amazon.com, Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nAmazon.com, Inc. price-consensus-chart | Amazon.com, Inc. Quote\n\nSolid Generative AI Capabilities: Key Catalyst\n\nPer an Allied Market Research report, the global generative AI market is likely to hit $191.8 billion by 2032, witnessing a CAGR of 34.1% between 2023 and 2032.\r\n\r\nAWS’s growing generative AI efforts are expected to aid Amazon in capitalizing on the immense growth prospects in the generative AI market.\r\n\r\nAWS is gaining significantly from the solid adoption of Amazon Bedrock, which has provided it with a breakthrough in the generative AI space. Amazon Bedrock offers seamless access to high-performing foundation models from AI companies through an API.\r\n\r\nAWS also offers Amazon CodeWhisperer, which is designed to provide generative AI-powered customized code suggestions by leveraging an organization's internal codebase.\r\n\r\nThe company’s recent collaboration with NVIDIA, through which it will make the latter’s Blackwell GPU platform available on AWS, is a plus. This will aid in speeding up inference workloads for resource-intensive, multi-trillion-parameter language models.\n\nExpanding Clientele Aids Growth\n\nStrengthening generative AI capabilities, along with AWS’s other robust cloud solutions, expanding data center network, and an increasing number of AWS Regions and Availability Zones are bolstering its customer base.\r\n\r\nRecently, NinjaTech AI partnered with AWS to launch its next-generation AI agent called Ninja, which has been trained using the latter’s machine learning chips Trainium and Inferentia2 in order to make them powerful and useful.\r\n\r\nCrowdStrike extended its strategic partnership with AWS to accelerate cloud security and AI innovation. It is using Amazon Bedrock and Amazon SageMaker in order to boost innovation in SIEM transformation, and novel cybersecurity AI use cases.\r\n\r\nBrightcove started using Amazon’s generative AI assistant called Amazon Q Business on AWS internally for real-world use cases applicable to the enterprise, media and entertainment technology sectors.\r\n\r\nBlackBerry recently unveiled a generative AI-backed cybersecurity advisor called Cylance Assistant, which leverages Amazon Bedrock to enable organizations to enhance their cybersecurity operations.\r\n\r\nWe believe that AWS’s expanding customer base will continue to drive its top-line growth. In first-quarter 2024, AWS generated revenues of $25.04 billion (18% of the total sales), which grew 17% year over year.\r\n\r\nThe strengthening performance of AWS will drive Amazon’s overall performance, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for 2024 revenues is pegged at $638.24 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 11%. The same for 2024 earnings stands at $4.58 per share, implying year-over-year growth of 57.9%. The EPS estimate has moved north by 1.1% over the past 30 days.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS Clientele Growth Aids Competitive Position\n\nExpanding clientele will continue to help AWS sustain its dominant position in the global cloud market and gain a competitive edge against its peers, namely Microsoft MSFT and Alphabet’s GOOGL Google.\r\n\r\nAmazon accounted for 31% of the worldwide cloud provider market in first-quarter 2024, per the latest Canalys data.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft, which accounted for 25% of the market, is riding on solid momentum across its Intelligent Cloud business that reported $26.7 billion in revenues in third-quarter fiscal 2024 (43.2% of the total revenues), up 21% year over year. The business is benefiting from the robust adoption of Azure, driven by strength in Azure AI. Azure and other cloud service revenues grew 31% year over year.\r\n\r\nGoogle Cloud is contributing substantial growth to Alphabet's total revenues. Expanding data centers, availability zones and cloud regions are expected to keep boosting the company's cloud position. Alphabet’s Google Cloud acquired 10% of the market and reported revenues of $9.6 billion (11.9% of the total revenues), up 28.4% year over year in first-quarter 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nAmazon is riding on AWS’s expanding clientele and strong partner base. Its expanding global presence is a positive. Growing capabilities in grocery, pharmacy, healthcare and autonomous driving are other positives. Deepening focus on generative AI is a major plus that is helping it outperform cloud peers, including Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud.\r\n\r\nAmazon currently has a Value Score of B, which makes it an attractive pick for investors.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Amazon Stock Just Set a New All-Time High. Here's Why I'm Still Buying.",
        "content": "Some investors understandably worry about purchasing stocks when they are at all-time highs. While it seems like a stock would be vulnerable to a drop at those levels, it's best to look at the bigger picture. Over the long term if it's a quality business, the stock should continue to gain in value.\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) recently hit a new all-time high in early May, but has pulled back a couple of percentage points since then. Still, I think Amazon's stock is a great buy right now. Here's why.\n\nIts businesses are all enjoying incredible success\n\nAmazon has been firing on all cylinders as a business. It divides its business into three divisions: North America, international, and Amazon Web Services (AWS). In previous quarters, at least one of its three major segments wasn't doing well, but that's not the case now.\n\nThe e-commerce side of Amazon, which is split up by geography, is much wider than its online store. It also includes rapidly growing segments like third-party seller services, advertising services, and subscription services. In fact, Amazon's online store segment only grew 7% year over year when all regions were combined. However, these other segments helped North American and international sales rise by 12% and 10%, respectively.\n\nWhile that is respectable growth, the profits in these divisions were outliers. The North American segment delivered nearly $5 billion in operating income (up 455% year over year), and international delivered its first operating profit ($903 million) since the second quarter of 2021.\n\nThis is evidence that Amazon's efficiency focus continues to have a massive effect and will drive higher profits throughout 2024 if they stay on their current path. Should Amazon's trajectory continue, 2024 will be an exciting year on the commerce side of the business.\n\nAWS is back in growth mode after a tough 2023\n\nWhile the commerce side of the business delivers the bulk of revenue, the AWS cloud computing business delivers the profits. In 2023, AWS struggled because its customers were focused on optimizing their spending. According to management, that trend has largely wrapped up, and new workloads far outweigh the decreasing ones.\n\nIn Q1, AWS revenue rose 17% to $25 million, the highest total revenue in the cloud computing industry. This growth rate marks the fastest since Q4 of 2022. Higher revenue also drastically increased AWS's operating income, which rose 84% to $9.4 billion.\n\nThese figures clearly show why Amazon is hitting new all-time highs. Revenue is up double digits, and operating income is rising incredibly fast as well. This combines for a stock set to deliver more record highs should that success continue into Q2 and beyond.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmazon shares trade at a premium\n\nHowever, one drawback may be the stock valuation. Amazon trades at a high valuation if you utilize the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. AMZN PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAmazon's stock is hard to value because its earnings are rapidly increasing due to efficiency improvements combined with strong revenue growth. As a result, the forward P/E is a bit more of a shot in the dark than most investors would like.\n\nStill, I think investors can confidently buy Amazon at this valuation because analysts only think Amazon will produce earnings per share of $4.53 over the next 12 months. In Q1 alone, Amazon produced $0.98 per share, and Q1 was historically one of Amazon's weakest quarters. As a result, I think the forward P/E of 40 is a conservative estimate, and the stock is far cheaper than that in reality.\n\nEven though Amazon recently set a new record high, I'm confident it can continue to rise even more throughout 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Ray Dalio Just Bought These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Tracking what billionaire hedge fund managers are doing is a great way to get ideas for your portfolio. Most of the time, they have a proven track record, but you need to make sure they're buying stocks for reasons similar to yours. Otherwise, you may get stuck holding a stock with strong short-term movements but a poor long-term outlook.\n\nBridgewater Associates, run by Ray Dalio, is a massive hedge fund with nearly $175 billion in assets under management. In Q1, it bought many stocks, but among its biggest buys were companies related to artificial intelligence (AI). With AI being such a broad field, looking at what billionaires are buying is a great way to double-check yourself, and you might even find a new idea.\n\nMaking a massive bet on AI proliferation\n\nIn Q1, Bridgewater Associates increased its positions in the following stocks:\n\nCompany Current Percentage of Portfolio Previous Percentage of Portfolio Alphabet 4.1% 1.6% Nvidia 3.2% 0.7% Meta Platforms 2.4% 1.3% Microsoft 1.2% 0.4% Amazon 1% 0%\n\nData source: WhaleWisdom.\n\nThat's a sizable increase in many of the biggest AI players, pointing to Ray Dalio's belief that AI will be a massive growth catalyst for these stocks. So far, he's been right, as these stocks have had a phenomenal performance in 2024.\n\nHowever, information about which stocks these billionaires have been buying isn't available to the public until 45 days after Q1 ended, so we're dealing with two-month-old information right now. So, are these five still worth buying at today's prices?\n\nThese AI stocks are great picks for all investors\n\nStarting with the biggest of these positions, Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Bridgewater has made it the third-largest investment overall in his portfolio. This is a turnaround in sentiment, as many believed Alphabet was losing the AI arms race until a few months ago. While it stumbled out of the gate, its latest AI releases have been positively received, and its generative AI model, Gemini, is emerging as a top pick in the space.\n\nThis has ignited a run-up in the stock, with Alphabet rising nearly 20% since Q1 ended. Despite its rise, Alphabet remains attractively priced at 23 times forward earnings, making it a strong buy now.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), the king of AI hardware, is a much harder stock to assess. It recently reported earnings for its fiscal 2025's first quarter (ended April 28) and saw revenue rise a jaw-dropping 262%. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThis rise was fueled by the massive demand for graphics processing units (GPUs) used in data centers to train AI models. Nvidia has been one of the index's best performers for two years straight, but this massive growth makes the stock hard to assess.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, Nvidia trades at 42 times forward earnings, making it quite expensive. However, this premium may be worth it if the AI demand persists for many years. Nvidia is a very tough stock to assess, and I wouldn't fault investors for passing it over right now.\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ: META) is similar to Alphabet because most of its revenue comes from advertising. With dominant properties like Facebook and Instagram under its roof, it generates a lot of money from advertising. However, Meta has also been making substantial AI investments in developing its own generative AI models that are suitable for its uses.\n\nIt has integrated its AI model into these platforms and can help create content or understand something about a post. While these technologies have monetizable uses, their primary use right now is to solidify Meta's place as a company with top-tier social media platforms. At 24 times forward earnings, it's a great stock to buy.\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) has partnered with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT-powered products into its primary offerings. Its Copilot is already integrated into the Microsoft Office suite of products (if you pay the subscription fee) and provides impressive productivity increases. Microsoft also has a strong cloud computing business in Azure, and this division is seeing incredible growth as companies scramble to increase their computing power to create their own in-house AI models. While Microsoft is seeing great success as a business, it's a very expensive stock. MSFT PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nAt 36 times forward earnings, it's not far off from Nvidia's valuation despite much slower growth levels. Due to Microsoft's price, I'll take a pass on the stock for now.\n\nLastly, there is Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN), a company that many may not see as an AI investment. While most of Amazon's revenue comes from its commerce-related business, 62% of its operating income comes from its cloud computing division, which is benefiting from the same trends as Microsoft Azure. Amazon Web Services (AWS) holds the largest chunk of the cloud computing market share and is growing revenue at a healthy 17% year-over-year pace.\n\nOverall, Amazon is thriving right now, with sales climbing 13% and earnings per share dramatically rising from $0.31 last year to $0.98. Amazon is another tricky company to value, as it's still working on maximizing its profitability. Although it trades around 40 times forward earnings, I think it's a fair price to pay because Amazon is still enacting many margin-boosting measures.\n\nOverall, Ray Dalio and Bridgewater Associates' investments in Q1 are great picks. Although investors shouldn't blindly follow them into these buys, I think these stocks are a great starting point when searching for top-notch investment ideas.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Amazon Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) stock has been a fantastic long-term performer. Over the last decade through May 31, shares of the e-commerce and cloud computing giant have soared 1,030%, about four and a half times the S&P 500 index's 230% return.\n\nGiven Amazon's huge size (it's the fifth-largest company on the S&P 500 index), many investors probably wonder whether it's too late to buy its stock. Below are five reasons Amazon stock is a buy now.\n\n1. Amazon's e-commerce business still has much growth potential Chart note: The big surge in early 2020 was driven by the huge increase in online spending when the pandemic started.\n\nConsumers continue to increase the amount of spending they do online relative to their overall retail spending. In the first quarter of 2024, e-commerce sales accounted for 15.9% of all U.S. retail sales, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In 2023, e-commerce sales accounted for 19.4% of total retail sales worldwide, per Statista, which predicts this percentage will rise to 20.1% in 2024.\n\nWith e-commerce sales only accounting for 15.9% of U.S. retail spending and about 19% to 20% of global retail spending, there is still much room for these percentages to grow. And Amazon should continue to be the biggest beneficiary of this secular trend because it's the world's largest e-commerce company. In 2023, Amazon had a nearly 38% share of the U.S. retail e-commerce market, according to Statista.\n\n2. Its cloud computing service still has strong growth potential\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS) is the world's largest cloud computing service. In the first quarter of 2024, it had a 31% share of the cloud infrastructure services market, according to an estimate by Synergy Research Group. This business -- which is highly profitable -- has significantly benefited from the industry's strong growth.\n\nAWS still has much growth potential because the industry's long-term growth projections are robust. This is thanks in large part to the surging interest among entities of all kinds to obtain generative artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Synergy Research projects that the industry, which had an annualized revenue run rate of about $300 billion as of the first quarter of this year, will double in size in four years. That equates to a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of about 19%.\n\n3. Amazon Prime keeps getting better and adding new members\n\nAmazon keeps adding members in the U.S. and internationally to its Prime subscription loyalty program. The company only very rarely shares its Prime membership numbers, but research firm Consumer Intelligence Research Partners (CIRP) regularly tracks U.S. Prime membership.\n\nStory continues\n\nPrime membership grew to a record high of 180 million U.S. consumers in March, according to an estimate by CIRP. This number represents an 8% increase over the firm's estimate for March 2023. (CIPR's estimates represent the number of individual consumers who are Prime members, not the number of subscriptions, as members of a household often share a subscription.)\n\nAmazon continuously adds free benefits to Prime to keep current members happy and to entice others to subscribe. The most noteworthy sweetening of the Prime program in recent years was the company transitioning its standard free delivery benefit from two days to one day for numerous items. Some items are also available for same-day free delivery.\n\nJust this past week, Amazon added another goody to Prime: Members can get a free ongoing Grubhub+ membership (worth $120 a year) and order Grubhub restaurant deliveries directly on Amazon.com and in the Amazon Shopping app.\n\nAmazon benefits from growth in its Prime program in two ways. First, it generates more subscription revenue. A standard membership in the U.S. costs $139 per year or $14.99 per month. Second, Prime members have been found to spend more money than nonmembers on Amazon's e-commerce site. A 2021 survey by CIPR revealed that members spent just over twice as much as nonmembers on Amazon's site.\n\n4. Numerous other avenues for growth, particularly in advertising\n\nAmazon has countless other businesses with growth potential: digital advertising, healthcare, Prime Video, and smart-home gadgets, to name a few.\n\nThe company's advertising business is particularly noteworthy because it's been growing rapidly and is presumably quite profitable, as is the overall industry. In the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's advertising revenue jumped 24% year over year to $11.8 billion. This business accounted for 8.2% of the company's total quarterly revenue of $143.3 billion.\n\n5. Amazon stock is reasonably valued\n\nWall Street analysts expect Amazon's earnings per share (EPS) to grow at an average annual rate of 28.2% over the next five years. The company's shares are currently priced at 37.9 times its projected forward earnings. While this isn't a cheap valuation, it's reasonable for a stable company like Amazon that generates strong cash flows from operations.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Magnificent Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in June",
        "content": "Most people who are faced with making a big decision want to know their options first. But when there are many options, the decision-making process can still be overwhelming.\n\nI suspect some investors could have this feeling in choosing which artificial intelligence (AI) stocks to buy. While there are lots of good alternatives, I think a few rise to the top. Here are three magnificent AI stocks to buy in June.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nThe adjective \"magnificent\" definitely applies to Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). Shares of the graphics processing unit (GPU) maker have skyrocketed roughly 180% over the last 12 months and have delivered a jaw-dropping gain of more than 24x over the last 10 years. Nvidia is the fastest-rising member by far of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nHowever, what Nvidia has done in the past isn't as important as what it could do in the future. The company's amazing growth story isn't going to end anytime soon. Tech companies continue to buy Nvidia's AI chips as fast as they can get their hands on them.\n\nNvidia plans to launch its new Blackwell GPU platform later this year. Blackwell will be the most powerful AI architecture ever. Unsurprisingly, the demand for Blackwell already outstrips the anticipated supply.\n\nYes, Nvidia trades at a nosebleed price-to-earnings ratio of nearly 65. I've been leery of the stock's valuation at times, but growth puts high earnings multiples into a different context. And Nvidia is poised to continue delivering stunningly strong growth.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is another Magnificent Seven stock that's been a big winner, thanks in part to its AI initiatives. Its shares have soared around 45% over the last 12 months, and Amazon has also been an 11-bagger over the last decade.\n\nI expect Amazon Web Services (AWS) will be one of the biggest beneficiaries of the generative AI explosion. It's already the biggest cloud services provider. In my view, AWS' approach of making multiple large language models (LLMs) and AI tools available to its customers is a smart strategy. While AWS is a major customer for Nvidia (and will be among the first to get Blackwell), the cloud unit also offers its own custom, cost-effective AI chips for training and inference.\n\nDon't overlook Amazon's opportunities to use AI internally. The company is laser-focused on boosting profitability, as evidenced by its earnings jumping 225% year over year in the first quarter. CFO Brian Olsavsky said in Amazon's April earnings call that it's investing in technologies, including automation and robotics, to reduce costs further.\n\nStory continues\n\nAI isn't the only reason to buy Amazon stock, though. Amazon has multiple growth drivers, including advertising, expansion into healthcare, and its forthcoming Kuiper satellite internet service.\n\n3. Meta Platforms\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) is the smallest company of these three (and the next-to-smallest among the Magnificent Seven) with a market cap of \"only\" around $1.17 trillion. However, Meta has been a monster stock over the last 12 months, with a gain of over 75%.\n\nI like Meta largely because of its valuation. The stock's price-to-earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio is 1.08, lower than all the other Magnificent Seven members. But can Meta deliver on the growth projections baked into that metric? I think so.\n\nThe company has great opportunities to use AI to increase the monetization of its video and messaging features, including Reels and WhatsApp. It's also working hard to engage users to enhance the value of its platform to advertisers.\n\nCEO Mark Zuckerberg believes it's \"quite possible that smart glasses that have AI assistants built in will be the killer app.\" He thinks AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of Meta's business. Zuckerberg is also committed to developing artificial general intelligence (AGI). Meta doesn't have to succeed on all fronts, though, to deliver exceptional long-term returns for investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "We Think Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN) Can Stay On Top Of Its Debt",
        "content": "Some say volatility, rather than debt, is the best way to think about risk as an investor, but Warren Buffett famously said that 'Volatility is far from synonymous with risk.' So it might be obvious that you need to consider debt, when you think about how risky any given stock is, because too much debt can sink a company. As with many other companies Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) makes use of debt. But is this debt a concern to shareholders?\n\nWhen Is Debt Dangerous?\n\nDebt is a tool to help businesses grow, but if a business is incapable of paying off its lenders, then it exists at their mercy. Part and parcel of capitalism is the process of 'creative destruction' where failed businesses are mercilessly liquidated by their bankers. However, a more usual (but still expensive) situation is where a company must dilute shareholders at a cheap share price simply to get debt under control. Of course, debt can be an important tool in businesses, particularly capital heavy businesses. When we think about a company's use of debt, we first look at cash and debt together.\n\nCheck out our latest analysis for Amazon.com\n\nHow Much Debt Does Amazon.com Carry?\n\nYou can click the graphic below for the historical numbers, but it shows that Amazon.com had US$73.3b of debt in March 2024, down from US$92.9b, one year before. However, it does have US$85.1b in cash offsetting this, leading to net cash of US$11.8b. debt-equity-history-analysis\n\nHow Strong Is Amazon.com's Balance Sheet?\n\nThe latest balance sheet data shows that Amazon.com had liabilities of US$153.0b due within a year, and liabilities of US$161.3b falling due after that. On the other hand, it had cash of US$85.1b and US$41.7b worth of receivables due within a year. So its liabilities outweigh the sum of its cash and (near-term) receivables by US$187.5b.\n\nGiven Amazon.com has a humongous market capitalization of US$1.84t, it's hard to believe these liabilities pose much threat. Having said that, it's clear that we should continue to monitor its balance sheet, lest it change for the worse. While it does have liabilities worth noting, Amazon.com also has more cash than debt, so we're pretty confident it can manage its debt safely.\n\nBetter yet, Amazon.com grew its EBIT by 232% last year, which is an impressive improvement. That boost will make it even easier to pay down debt going forward. The balance sheet is clearly the area to focus on when you are analysing debt. But it is future earnings, more than anything, that will determine Amazon.com's ability to maintain a healthy balance sheet going forward. So if you're focused on the future you can check out this freereport showing analyst profit forecasts.\n\nStory continues\n\nFinally, a company can only pay off debt with cold hard cash, not accounting profits. While Amazon.com has net cash on its balance sheet, it's still worth taking a look at its ability to convert earnings before interest and tax (EBIT) to free cash flow, to help us understand how quickly it is building (or eroding) that cash balance. Over the last three years, Amazon.com reported free cash flow worth 15% of its EBIT, which is really quite low. That limp level of cash conversion undermines its ability to manage and pay down debt.\n\nSumming Up\n\nWhile Amazon.com does have more liabilities than liquid assets, it also has net cash of US$11.8b. And we liked the look of last year's 232% year-on-year EBIT growth. So we don't have any problem with Amazon.com's use of debt. Above most other metrics, we think its important to track how fast earnings per share is growing, if at all. If you've also come to that realization, you're in luck, because today you can view this interactive graph of Amazon.com's earnings per share history for free.\n\nIf, after all that, you're more interested in a fast growing company with a rock-solid balance sheet, then check out our list of net cash growth stocks without delay.\n\nHave feedback on this article?

        "title": "2 Leading Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Tech stocks have been on the move this year, fueling the Nasdaq Composite's growth of 13% since January. Investors have grown bullish over the vast potential of artificial intelligence (AI) and its ability to bolster sectors across tech. Industries like cloud computing, chip production, data centers, autonomous vehicles, consumer products, and more have been boosted by AI and will likely continue expanding for years.\n\nThe tech industry has a reputation for delivering consistent gains over many years, making it an excellent place to start whether you're new to the stock market or a seasoned investor looking for new opportunities. Tech companies tend to benefit from reliable demand for upgrades to hardware and software, with the industry hardly ever stagnant from year to year.\n\nIn fact, the Nasdaq-100 Technology Sector index has climbed 409% over the last decade despite the COVID-19 pandemic and a market downturn in 2022. Meanwhile, the emergence of AI and other industries suggests tech still has plenty to offer new investors in the coming years.\n\nSo, here are two leading tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Advanced Micro Devices\n\nAs a leading chipmaker, Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has a powerful position in tech. The company supplies its hardware to companies across the industry, with its chips powering custom-built PCs, laptops, cloud platforms, video game consoles, and more. Many of your own devices likely utilize AMD's chips, and you might not even know it.\n\nFor instance, in 2020, AMD became the exclusive supplier of chips to two of the world's most popular consoles, Sony's PlayStation 5 and Microsoft's Xbox Series X|S. These companies have sold nearly 80 million units since their respective consoles launched, illustrating how lucrative the partnerships are for AMD.\n\nHowever, all eyes have been on the chipmaker's expanding position in AI over the last year. AMD is challenging Nvidia's leading position in the industry with competing graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips necessary for building AI models. AMD launched its line of MI300X AI GPUs last December, and its efforts appear to be paying off.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AMD's revenue rose 2% year over year, beating Wall Street estimates by $20 million. It wasn't significant growth, but the performance of key segments shows the company is moving in the right direction. During the quarter, a spike in GPU sales led revenue in its data center segment to pop 80% year over year.\n\nAdditionally, AMD's client segment enjoyed an 85% increase in revenue, driven by a rise in central processing unit (CPU) sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMD still has a lot of work ahead as it works to steal market share from Nvidia and expand its AI PC division. However, the company has an exciting long-term outlook. Meanwhile, AMD's price-to-earnings ratio has fallen 75% over the last six months, suggesting its stock has actually increased in value. Given its potent position in tech, AMD's stock is worth considering in 2024 and beyond.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is easily one of the most attractive ways to invest in tech, thanks to its diverse business model. The company may be best known for its online retail site, but it has grown into so much more over the years. In addition to holding the leading market share (by a large margin) in e-commerce, Amazon is the biggest name in cloud computing with Amazon Web Services (AWS); has delved into video streaming, grocery, and space satellites; and is now going full force into AI.\n\nIn fact, Amazon's reach is so vast that it dominates markets it never set out to, like being the country's biggest video game retailer with a 44% market share, ahead of GameStop and Apple's App Store/Arcade.\n\nAmazon's e-commerce segment remains a highly profitable business. In Q1 2024, revenue in its North American and international divisions rose 12% and 10% year over year. Meanwhile, operating income for both retail segments hit a combined $6 billion, considerably improving on the $349 million in losses it reported the year before.\n\nYet, the best reason to invest in Amazon is AWS. The cloud platform delivered revenue gains of 17% year over year in Q1 2024 while operating income soared 84% to more than $9 billion. AWS gives Amazon a promising role in AI, with the company gradually expanding its library of AI cloud services and investing in new data centers worldwide. AMZN PS Ratio Chart\n\nMoreover, this chart shows Amazon has the lowest price-to-sales ratio among some of its biggest competitors in tech and AI. The figures indicate that Amazon's stock could be trading at a bargain compared to its rivals, making 2024 an excellent time to buy.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Advanced Micro Devices right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Advanced Micro Devices, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Advanced Micro Devices wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we look at the most expensive US state to live in. We have created a list of the costliest states in America, for the full free list, visit 20 Most Expensive US States To Live In.\n\nConsumers in the United States are experiencing the impact of burgeoning prices like never before. The cost of living in the country has increased considerably since the advent of the coronavirus pandemic. According to a report by Bloomberg in November last year, goods that cost $100 before the pandemic were now worth around $120. Prices have surged over the last three-to-four years by nearly as much as they did in a decade prior to Covid-19.\n\nA survey conducted by the Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) in September 2023 highlighted that 67% of the employees felt that inflation was rising quicker and higher than their salaries were, reiterating the stressful impact of the cost of living crisis on Americans. The figure was up from Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC)’s last survey held in 2022, in which it was measured at 58%. In order to ensure the financial wellness of its employees, the company announced to increase its minimum wage from $22 to $23 last year, and plans on raising it further to $25 by 2025. The move would enable all employees of Bank of America Corporation (NYSE:BAC) to earn at least $48,000 per annum.\n\nAnother company that has been active in making cost of living adjustments to employees’ wages and salaries is Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), which in September last year, announced to raise the hourly wage of its delivery and warehouse workers from $19 to $20.5 per hour. Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has been working to improve the financial well-being of its employees for quite some while now, starting in 2018, when it raised the company’s minimum wage to $15 per hour, which at the time was double of the federal minimum wage in the United States. While declaring the increase in wage then, Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) also stated that it would engage policymakers in Washington and across the country to increase their minimum wage levels.\n\nWhile some companies are making the right moves by increasing wages, a lot of others are just not able to do so due to the financial challenges facing them. In 2022, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) doubled its merit increases for certain employees, but a year later in May 2023 held back on raising salaries for full-time employees citing economic challenges and business priorities. The salary freeze has continued at Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) for well over a year now. However, the company’s executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group, Scott Guthrie, stated this month that Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) was considering resuming performance-based increments for some employees.\n\nStory continues\n\nSimilarly, Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) in February last year cut salaries of its employees after a loss in market share and a lower sales forecast. The deduction ranged from 5% for mid-level employees to 25% for top executives, including Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC)’s chief executive Pat Gelsinger, whose salary also got slashed. Hourly wage workers, however, remain unaffected.\n\nBy the way, before we dive deep into the list of the costliest states in the US to live in, you can also read about 20 Countries With The Cheapest Cost Of Living For US Citizens.\n\nMethodology\n\nThe most expensive US states to live in are ranked in ascending order of their cost of living index., and is from 2023 – the latest year for which figures are available. The cost of living index reflects the differences in prices of goods and services across regions or times in comparison to the national average. For instance, if a product costs $100 on average in the United States, and costs $120 in New York, the state of New York would have a cost of living index of 120.\n\nThe most expensive US state to live in is Hawaii!\n\n1. Hawaii\n\nCost of Living Index: 182.1\n\nHawaii is the most expensive US state to live in, with 82% higher cost of living than the national average in the United States. A key reason why the state has always been expensive is its location, which is 2000 miles southwest of the American mainland in the Pacific Ocean. Most of the basic items in the state are shipped from elsewhere. Moreover, the state has a staggering high housing index of 313.1. Utilities are 51% and transportation 35% more expensive in Hawaii than the national average.\n\nTo learn about other US states with a high cost of living, you can check out our detailed report 20 Most Expensive US States To Live In.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from cost of living across regions to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Prediction: These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth a Combined $25 Trillion by 2030",
        "content": "Is the hype warranted? That's a question investors must always ask about anything that receives a huge amount of attention.\n\nIn some cases, the hype fizzles away -- 3D printing comes to mind. However, in other cases, early hype is more than justified. For example, the massive market built around the internet has shown that many early proponents were right.\n\nI think artificial intelligence (AI) belongs in the latter category. In my view, the enormous success of multiple AI leaders is just the beginning. It's impossible to know what the future holds. However, I predict that by 2030, five AI stocks will be worth a combined $25 trillion -- perhaps even more.\n\nAI's fantastic five\n\nBased on market cap, the five biggest companies on the planet have one major thing in common: They're all investing heavily in AI. Not only that, their respective AI strategies have played a key role in their big gains over the last couple of years. Below are AI's \"fantastic five\":\n\nAI Stock Current Market Cap* Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $3.08 trillion Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $2.93 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $2.73 trillion Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $2.13 trillion Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.86 trillion\n\nData source: Google Finance. *Market caps as of May 30, 2024.\n\nMicrosoft surged past Apple earlier this year to take the No. 1 spot based on market cap. The company's partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unquestionably been the primary factor behind Microsoft's remarkable rise. The tech giant has integrated GPT-4 throughout its product lineup. Microsoft is especially benefiting from its relationship with OpenAI in its cloud business.\n\nApple delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2023. Since then, though, it's lagged well behind the other biggest AI stocks. Some investors have worried that Apple was getting left behind in the generative AI race. The company's growth has also slowed significantly due in large part to saturation in the smartphone market. Still, Apple remains in a close contest with Microsoft for the biggest market cap.\n\nNvidia is, without question, the brightest star in the AI universe right now. The demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to skyrocket. Every other company in the top five (plus many more) are Nvidia customers. Most of them would love to buy as many GPUs as they could get. Thanks to this tremendous demand, Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed.\n\nAlphabet seemed to have been caught by surprise by the successful launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It didn't take long, though, for the company to roll out its own generative AI products. Despite some public relations stumbles, Alphabet remains in the thick of the AI race with its Gemini AI models and Google Cloud AI offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon quickly introduced multiple generative AI products after ChatGPT took the world by storm. Amazon's AI initiatives have helped drive its stock much higher. The company's focus on profitability has also been a critical factor, with earnings more than tripling year over year in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe path to $25 trillion\n\nThe combined market cap of these five AI stocks stands at a little over $12.7 trillion right now. How can they together nearly double that amount to reach $25 trillion by the end of 2030? I think there are three major prerequisites.\n\n1. Organizations migrate rapidly to the cloud to benefit from AI's tremendous return on investment\n\nImportantly, AI must deliver tremendous returns on investment (ROIs) for companies. I expect this will be the case. If so, organizations across the world will almost certainly rapidly migrate their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy estimates that at least 85% of global IT spending remains on-premises, with the remainder in the cloud. AI could go a long way toward flipping those numbers by the end of the decade.\n\nThis migration would directly benefit Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud since they're the biggest cloud service providers. It should also help Nvidia as the leading source of chips for AI servers.\n\n2. AI computing technology continues to improve at a frantic pace\n\nIt's critical for Nvidia that AI computing technology, especially chips, continues to improve at a frantic pace -- and that the company leads the way. Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU platform, which will launch later this year, should help make this a reality. CEO Jensen Huang said in the company's Q1 call that \"other Blackwells are coming.\"\n\n3. Edge AI becomes a huge new market\n\nThe first two prerequisites should ensure continued success for Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon. But what about Apple? The tech giant needs edge AI to become a huge new market. Edge AI enables AI to be run on mobile devices. Since Apple has over 2 billion active devices worldwide, it should be in the driver's seat to lead the edge AI market.\n\nPotential problems and pleasant surprises\n\nWhat could go wrong to derail these five AI stocks from reaching a combined market cap of $25 trillion by 2030? A lot. On the one hand, an economic recession could cause tech spending to tank. AI might not deliver the ROI companies hope to achieve. The \"hallucinations\" and other issues with generative AI could remain problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be some pleasant surprises over the next few years. One possibility is a major breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AI). Perhaps AI computing power could increase even faster than anyone expects.\n\nWhatever happens, I think the hype about AI is warranted. And I won't be shocked if my prediction turns out to be too pessimistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Did Amazon Just Say \"Checkmate\" to Nvidia?",
        "content": "Much of the ongoing discussion on artificial intelligence (AI) revolves around the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks. Over the past 18 months, big tech has made a series of headline-grabbing, billion-dollar investments in AI initiatives.\n\nAmong leading enterprises in the Magnificent Seven are Nvidia and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). While Nvidia seems to have a strong pulse across all facets of the AI arena, I wouldn't over appreciate the company's dominance.\n\nLet's dig into what is driving Nvidia's growth right now, and explore how Amazon may leapfrog the company in the long run.\n\nNvidia is the AI chip leader, but...\n\nNvidia designs sophisticated semiconductor chips called graphics processing units (GPUs). GPUs have all sorts of applications ranging from training large language models, machine learning, autonomous driving, and more.\n\nBeyond the tech sector, generative AI has use cases in healthcare as well. Nvidia's GPUs are even being used by leading pharmaceutical companies such as Novo Nordisk -- the maker of Ozempic and Wegovy.\n\nUnsurprisingly, Nvidia's prolific reach has helped the company amass a staggering 80% share of the AI chip market.\n\nWhile it may seem as if Nvidia's lead is insurmountable, keep in mind that the AI revolution is still in its early stages. Although Amazon might look behind, I'd argue that the company is merely pacing itself and preparing for a marathon-style race. Image Source: Getty Images.\n\n...some in big tech are making moves of their own\n\nThe AI startup scene is absolutely packed. One of the more notable players is a machine learning company called Hugging Face, a unicorn that boasts Salesforce, Amazon, Google, Nvidia, Intel, Advanced Micro Devices, Qualcomm, and IBM as investors.\n\nDo you notice anything from that investor syndicate? Many of them are either chip companies or cloud computing specialists.\n\nConveniently, Amazon is both. In addition to Amazon Web Services (AWS), Amazon is developing a line of training and inferencing chips. Aptly named Trainium and Inferentia, these chips are igniting new sources of growth for AWS as cloud computing becomes evermore competitive.\n\nMoreover, Hugging Face recently announced that it is partnering with AWS to deploy workloads on the newest version of Inferentia. I see this as a big win for Amazon, and it ultimately serves as stepping stone for the company to migrate away from a reliance on Nvidia products in the long run.\n\nAnother way Amazon is starting to build some momentum is from its $4 billion investment in another AI startup, Anthropic. Like Hugging Face, Anthropic is training its generative AI models on Amazon's Trainium and Inferentia chips and is also using AWS as its primary cloud provider.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf this weren't enough to depict Amazon as a serious contender in the AI realm, consider the company's planned $11 billion investment to build data centers. While Nvidia also competes in the data center space, companies such as Amazon and Oracle have their own plans.\n\nIs now a good time to invest in Amazon stock?\n\nRight now, Amazon stock trades for roughly $179 per share. This is quite close to the company's all-time high of $189.\n\nWith that in mind, you might think Amazon stock is expensive. However, the chart below indicates something different. AMZN PE Ratio Chart\n\nOver the past 12 months, Amazon's share price has risen by roughly 50%. By contrast, the company's trailing-12-month earnings per share (EPS) has increased by 181%.\n\nSince the company's earnings growth is accelerating more than the share price, Amazon's price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple actually declines year over year. This means that even though the share price is touching all-time highs, Amazon is technically cheaper today than it was just last year.\n\nI think Amazon is underappreciated when it comes to AI. The company is investing aggressive sums and is already igniting some newfound momentum. Over time, I suspect that the moves the company is making today will pay off in spades and provide Amazon with a layer of flexibility over the competition.\n\nTo me, Amazon stock is dirt cheap and represents a compelling long-term opportunity in the AI space. While Nvidia will probably remain the posterchild of AI in the near-term, I think Amazon is making some savvy chess moves that will ultimately set it up as a superior long-term position.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Here Is My Top Artificial Intelligence (AI) ETF to Buy Right Now",
        "content": "Between work, family, hobbies, and other commitments, most people don't have hours to devote to stock research. Plus, let's face it. Picking individual stocks is more difficult and riskier than buying a basket of companies. This makes exchange-traded funds, or ETFs, an attractive vehicle. ETFs trade just like stocks, but the funds hold dozens of stocks linked by a specific theme. Several ETFs cater to the market's hottest sector: artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThere is a lot of hype around AI, and the enthusiasm is warranted. Companies are spending billions of dollars researching real-world solutions and bringing them to market, and organizations in many industries are already integrating generative AI and large language models (LLMs) into workflows. The efficiencies these tools provide and our ultra-competitive business world will encourage more companies to adopt them.\n\nOne estimate forecasts that the global market size will approach $2 trillion by the end of this decade, as shown below. Image source: Statista.\n\nWhat are the best artificial intelligence ETFs?\n\nNot all ETFs are created equal. Factors like diversification, assets under management, historical performance, and the expense ratio are important. The Global X Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF(NASDAQ: BOTZ) is a popular AI fund. It has $2.8 billion in assets under management and an expense ratio of 0.68%, which is competitive. Its portfolio currently holds 43 companies, focusing on those that will \"benefit from increased adoption and utilization of robotics and artificial intelligence.\"\n\nBOTZ is heavily weighted toward its top holdings. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) makes up more than 10% of the fund, and its top four holdings account for more than 35%. The fund has underperformed the SPDR S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: SPY) over the past year, despite Nvidia gaining 248%.\n\nBesides the reliance on a few top holdings, another potential drawback is its lack of big tech holdings. BOTZ investors miss out on Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), Meta (NASDAQ), and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and even one of my personal favorites, Arm Holdings(NASDAQ: ARM).\n\nBOTZ is most appropriate for investors seeking a well-managed portfolio featuring a few stocks with a focus outside big tech.\n\nGlobal X also manages the Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF(NASDAQ: AIQ). AIQ holds positions in 84 companies, has a 0.68% expense ratio, and has crushed the S&P 500 over the past year, as you can see below. SPY Total Return Level Chart\n\nThe Artificial Intelligence & Technology ETF has positions in all of the stocks above except for Arm Holdings. Its top stock is also Nvidia, but it accounts for only 5% of the total. AIQ is best for those who seek a diversified portfolio with an emphasis on big tech. AIQ is an excellent choice with a tremendous recent track record.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's my favorite\n\nHowever, my favorite AI ETF is the WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund(NYSEMKT: WTAI). WTAI is the worst-performing fund in the chart above, but this doesn't mean it won't outperform moving forward. Nvidia and Microsoft account for almost 13% of the S&P 500 and 8% of AIQ but under 5% of WTAI, which explains the underperformance. These stocks exploded last year, but they could soon hit fair value and level off.\n\nThe WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund is the most diversified of the three funds I've chosen, with no company making up more than 3% of assets. It currently holds 75 stocks, including big tech names. It also has the lowest expense ratio at 0.45%. Its most significant investments are in semiconductors (33%) and AI software (24%), thriving industries with serious room for growth as AI ramps up. Its recent underperformance could change quickly, since the semiconductor industry is cyclical and appears headed for another up cycle after a difficult 2022 and 2023.\n\nWTAI is a terrific pick for those who want significant diversification, a low expense ratio, and exposure to the industry's biggest names.\n\nYou don't have to be a brilliant stock picker to capitalize on a rising industry like AI. Sometimes, it's best to let those with more time to dedicated to following stocks choose. ETFs offer broad exposure with less risk and volatility. There are tons of options; perhaps one mentioned above is right for you.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and WisdomTree Artificial Intelligence and Innovation Fund wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now and in this article we will give you an AI penny stock that can be worthy of exploring in case you missed buying NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) when it was trading under $500 per share at the beginning of the year.\n\nIt's no secret that semiconductors are among the best pick-and-shovel plays for those looking to invest in the booming Artificial Intelligence sector. NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) saw its stock surge by more than 150% over the past year. This growth can almost solely be attributed to increased demand for its Graphic Processing Units (GPUs), which are perfect for processing large amounts of data required in various AI and machine learning applications.\n\nAmid this strong performance, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) was included in the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\", a group of the largest publicly-traded companies. However, as the AI boom continues, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is expected to continue to deliver solid returns to investors. The stock currently saw its price target upped by Goldman Sachs. Analyst Toshiya Hari raised the price target to $1100 from $1000 and reiterated the 'Buy' rating. In the research note, the analyst mentioned that the sustainable nature of NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA)'s growth suggests that the stock is trading at an attractive valuation.\n\nThe strong fundamentals suggest that NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a good pick for risk-averse investors looking for solid long-term returns. Therefore, it's not surprising that the stock is one of the most popular among hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. According to the latest round of 13F filings, 186 out of 920 hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey were bullish on NVIDIA at the end of March. We are following this metric because our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nEnter Navitas Semiconductor\n\nHowever, for risk-tolerant investors, we can suggest looking at Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). Similarly to NVIDIA, Navitas is a semiconductor stock, but it is currently trading at less than $4 per share, which makes it one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now. It may not reach the size of NVIDIA Corporation, but it's worth remembering that in 2014, NVIDIA was trading at less than $5 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nNavitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a small-cap company that is focused on power semiconductors, such as gallium nitride power integrated circuits and silicon carbide power devices. Basically, it is developing semiconductors that are used in power supply for various devices. In this way, Navitas' products have a wide range of applications, including mobile phones, laptops, and consumer electronics. Moreover, Navitas supplies semiconductors to some high-growth industries, such as Data Centers, electric vehicles, and solar inverters. Among the company's clients are Dell, Lenovo, Xiaomi, Amazon, OPPO, and Motorola. Most of the company's products that are currently being shipped are used in mobile device chargers. Missed NVIDIA? Check Out This Semiconductor AI Penny Stock\n\nA technician in a pristine lab, focused on designing a new semiconductor chip.\n\nOn a financial side, things look good for Navitas. The company has seen strong revenue growth over the past several quarters. In the first quarter of 2023, Navitas Semiconductor Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) saw its revenue grow by 73% to $23.2 million. The company has been seeing robust top-line growth over the past several quarters. However, the costs are also quite high and Navitas has yet to report a profitable quarter. For the first quarter, Navitas posted a net loss of $0.02 per share, significantly lower than the $0.39 loss posted a year earlier. Both first-quarter revenue and net loss were above analysts' expectations of $22.92 million and a loss of $0.15 per share, respectively.\n\nNavitas As a Pick-and-Shovels AI Play\n\nDespite the revenue growth and the further revenue growth potential, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) has seen its stock lose 48% since the beginning of the year. In an environment where most semiconductor stocks recorded gains, this doesn't look good. One of the reasons for the decline, was explained by the company's CEO Gene Sheridan on CNBC.\n\n\"We're not shipping to AI today, so our stock price reflects that,\" Sheridan said.\n\nHowever, the CEO added that Navitas plans to change that soon. The company plans to develop and market power chip technology that could be used to power AI-focused data centers. The company is developing power platforms that could provide higher power output to meet the demand required by AI processors, such as NVIDIA's Grace Hopper H100 and recently announced Blackwell chips. These chips demand between 700W to 1,000W and more power, which is significantly higher than 300W demanded by traditional CPUs. Navitas said it has around 30 customer projects in development and expects its power chips to be used in data centers at Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN)'s AWS, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s Azure, Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s Google, and Baidu Inc (NASDAQ:BIDU).\n\nCheck out our report about the cheapest AI stock and find out which company is as promising as Microsoft but that trades at less than five times its earnings.\n\nWhat Smart Money and Sell-Side Think About Navitas\n\nAs stated earlier, we believe that Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is one of the best AI penny stocks to buy now based on the hedge fund sentiment. At the end of March, there were 11 funds in our database bullish on the stock, down from 18 a quarter earlier. At the end of March, these funds held $80 million worth of shares.\n\nAnalysts also generally see potential upside in Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS). In May, following the earnings release, four analysts reiterated their buy ratings on the stock, although they did lower their price targets. Among these, the highest price target is currently assigned by Rosenblatt Securities, which has a $10 target. Other three analysts, at Robert W. Baird, Needham & Company LLC, and Deutsche Bank have a $7.00 price target. On the other hand, analysts at Jefferies, downgraded the stock to Hold from Buy and slashed the price target down to $4.00.\n\nIn conclusion, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a penny stock worth exploring. The company is advancing its developments to get more exposure to the AI sector, albeit it is late to the party. On the other hand, it has a broad pipeline of applications across various sectors and can unlock more growth in other areas. For example, in automotive, Navitas Semiconductors Corp (NASDAQ:NVTS) plans to start production of chips for EV chargers and has several big names among its customers, including Volvo, Smart, and Zeekr Intelligent Technology Holding Ltd (NYSE:ZK).\n\nIf you want to explore other AI stocks under $5 that smart money is bullish on, check out our free report on the 11 Best AI Penny Stocks to Invest in Now.\n\nIf you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Micron but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nRead Next: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Prediction: This \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stock Could Be a Better Investment Than Nvidia Over the Next 5 Years",
        "content": "The technology sector is currently experiencing something of a renaissance as breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI) have ignited newfound interest from investors.\n\nAmong the top AI opportunities are a small cohort of megacap tech companies collectively referred to as the \"Magnificent Seven.\" Over the last year and a half, semiconductor company Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has returned 628% -- more than any other member of the Magnificent Seven.\n\nNvidia is undoubtedly playing a big role in the AI revolution, and its near-term prospects look very strong. But what about the long term?\n\nAmong its Magnificent Seven peers, I see Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) as the superior investment opportunity. Let's explore why Nvidia is currently on a roll, and assess the long-term prospects of the chipmaker versus Amazon.\n\nNvidia is supercharged, but competition lingers\n\nGenerative AI applications, such as training large language models, machine learning, and accelerated computing, rely on a couple of key components. Namely, sophisticated semiconductor chips known as graphics processing units (GPUs), as well as data center network services, are integral for AI use cases.\n\nRight now, Nvidia sits conveniently at the intersection of GPUs and data center operations. Currently, the company is estimated to have 80% of the addressable market for AI chips.\n\nThis commanding lead has translated into record revenue, margins, and cash flow. NVDA Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe slope of the lines in the chart above underscores Nvidia's dominance. Demand for the company's chips and data center services is robust, and has provided Nvidia with a lucrative source of pricing power. However, Advanced Micro Devices and Intel are developing a suite of alternative GPUs.\n\nAlthough neither company has anywhere near the market share of Nvidia today, the longer-term secular tailwinds fueling AI suggest that there could be an opportunity to make up ground as Nvidia faces the challenge of matching customer demand trends with supply output.\n\nFurthermore, Nvidia is not only facing competition from other chip businesses. Meta Platforms and Amazon are both working on their own internally developed chips in an effort to move away from their reliance on Nvidia.\n\nAlthough I don't see either company migrating from Nvidia anytime soon, the longer-term picture suggests that some of Nvidia's major customers could be a less significant source of growth several years from now.\n\nWhy I see Amazon as the better investment\n\nToday, Amazon is best known for its e-commerce marketplace and cloud computing infrastructure -- Amazon Web Services (AWS). However, Amazon has a number of other opportunities in its ecosystem, including streaming, grocery delivery, and advertising.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis diversified business is what has me most bullish on Amazon's long-term prospects, because the company has a unique opportunity to amplify its reach by integrating AI across its entire operation.\n\nOne of the most lucrative moves Amazon has already made is its $4 billion investment into AI start-up Anthropic. Anthropic uses AWS as its primary cloud provider, and is training its generative AI models on Amazon's homegrown chips.\n\nMoreover, Amazon also recently committed $11 billion to build out data centers -- a move I see as a major validation that the company is serious about moving away from Nvidia in the long run.\n\nWhile the long-term gains from these projects are likely years in the future, I'm optimistic that Amazon is laying the groundwork for sustained growth. Looked at a different way, while Nvidia is currently enjoying triple-digit revenue and profit growth, I'm skeptical that the company can keep up such momentum. On the other hand, I think Amazon is just scratching the service of a new wave fueled by aggressive ambitions featuring AI. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe bottom line\n\nWhen it comes to choosing between Nvidia and Amazon, I don't think you can go wrong. Both companies are operating from positions of strength, and each represents compelling investment prospects.\n\nWith that said, Nvidia's stock price has risen sharply over the last couple of years. Given that competition lingers across both data center services and AI-powered chips, I don't see Nvidia sustaining its lead. Eventually, I think customers will broaden their AI infrastructure and complement existing Nvidia services with those from other vendors.\n\nIn turn, this dynamic would result in decelerating revenue and profitability for Nvidia in the coming years. By contrast, Amazon already boasts over $50 billion in free cash flow and $84 billion of cash and equivalents on its balance sheet.\n\nAmazon is in a really good spot, financially speaking, and has the flexibility to continue doubling down on its AI efforts. As a result, I think Amazon will eventually surpass Nvidia in terms of value as it grows into a more sophisticated enterprise. NVDA PS Ratio Chart\n\nConsidering the disparity between valuation multiples, I'd scoop up shares of Amazon and plan to hold them for the long run. Nvidia is trading at a noticeable premium, thereby suggesting some future growth may be priced into the stock. To me, Amazon's position in the AI realm is underappreciated, and the stock looks dirt cheap right now. I'd encourage investors to take advantage of this discount and continue monitoring the company's progress.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stock to Buy With $5,000 Right Now",
        "content": "The market has been red-hot this year, with the S&P 500 index hitting new highs recently. This surge has been led by growth stocks, as the economy remains solid and the potential of artificial intelligence (AI) is still in its early days.\n\nStocks are performing well, but one growth stock that still looks like a solid buy right now is Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN). If you have $5,000 to invest right now, Amazon could be a fantastic buy. Let's look at what makes the stock an attractive investment today.\n\nE-commerce and cloud juggernaut\n\nWhen looking at the largest growth stocks in the S&P, the one thing that most of them have in common is that they have become dominant players in a particular area. Examples of this include Apple in smartphones, Alphabet in search, and Nvidia with graphic processing units (GPUs).\n\nHowever, Amazon has become a dominant leader in two fields: e-commerce and cloud computing.\n\nIn e-commerce, Amazon has managed to capture a dominant market share of nearly 38%, according to data analytics website Statista. That is well ahead of its next largest competitor Walmart with just over 6% share.\n\nAmazon's dominance can be attributed to its vast warehouse and logistics network that can get both its own products as well as third-party offerings on its platform to customers quickly and cheaply. The amount of goods on its platform is staggering, which gives consumers an unmatched amount of options. The reviews on the company's website as well as Amazon's return policies also should not be overlooked, as they help give consumers confidence in their purchases.\n\nTaken together, this has created a huge moat for the company. At the same time, e-commerce is still growing around the world at a solid clip, with Boston Consulting Group projecting a 9% compound annual growth rate through 2027.\n\nAmazon should continue to be a major winner as e-commerce continues to grow and take share from traditional brick-and-mortar retailers.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon is also the No. 1 player in cloud computing with the Amazon Web Services (AWS) platform, which has about a 32% market share. Global cloud infrastructure service has been on the rise as companies continue to move from on-premise solutions to the cloud along with the rise of AI.\n\nThis helped AWS see 17% revenue growth in the first quarter of this year to $25 billion. While strong, this did trail the growth of Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud. The chief challengers grew by 31% and 28%, respectively. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nAI opportunity\n\nThroughout the years, Amazon has shown it is determined to win and that it is willing to spend money to ensure it happens. So while the company may currently trail in the AI race, I would not expect this to continue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company is already starting to ramp up capital expenditures to build new data centers to meet increasing demand for generative AI. On its most recent earnings call, the company said that while it will have to spend money up front, it will lead to improved operating margins and free cash flow down the line.\n\nAmazon has also begun selling customers large language models (LLMs) to help them in their AI efforts. Through its Bedrock solution, the company offers customers a number of foundation models from both itself and AI start-ups, while its SageMaker offering helps customers create their own AI models by doing such tasks as preparing data for AI usage and helping train models more quickly.\n\nThe company has also developed its own AI chips in Trainium and Inferentia, although taking share away from Nvidia will not be easy given the dominance of its Cuda software platform. Amazon right now is likely more at the lower end of the market, but given the company's deep pockets and its strategy, it's best not to underestimate it in this area.\n\nApplying AI to its e-commerce platform is another opportunity. The company has already introduced some AI initiatives, such as making it easier for third parties to create listings through a new AI listing tool where all a customer needs is a URL to their existing website. AI can be applied to many areas of the company, from better product recommendations, to better product search, to helping improve logistics and inventory management.\n\nInexpensive stock\n\nGiven Amazon's willingness to spend to build out its logistics network and data centers, my preferred method of valuing the company is using an enterprise value (EV)-to-EBITDA multiple. This takes into consideration the company's net debt, while excluding noncash items such as depreciation. This metric reflects a company's cash-generating ability and operational efficiency while also considering its debt and cash balances.\n\nFrom that perspective, the stock trades at an attractive 13.5 times forward multiple. That is much lower than the 24x multiple it traded at in the recent past.

        "title": "These 3 Dow Stocks Are Set to Soar in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "Despite covering relatively few stocks, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is often considered a bellwether. Its 30 components have experienced significant change, and even though many slow-growth stocks remain in the index, it also includes many of today's largest and most dynamic companies.\n\nThis means some of the companies in the Dow will continue to fly high. If you want exposure to the Dow and the potential for significant growth, these stocks could serve you well over time.\n\nAmazon\n\nIndeed, Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.9 trillion market cap makes growth challenging. It means that it must generate more revenue and profit than much smaller companies to achieve the same percentage growth rates.\n\nHowever, Amazon has found a unique workaround. Its online sales business, which accounts for its largest revenue source, is a low-margin business supporting smaller, more dynamic enterprises. That includes advertising, subscriptions, and third-party seller services.\n\nMoreover, Amazon Web Services (AWS), its cloud computing business, made up $25 billion of Amazon's $143 billion in revenue for the first quarter of 2024. Nonetheless, thanks to its higher operating margin, it accounted for $9.4 billion of Amazon's over $15 billion in operating income.\n\nThe AWS segment gives it a much smaller base by which it can grow profits faster. Indeed, the $10 billion in Q1 net income rose 225% from year-ago levels. That increase likely contributed to Amazon's near-60% stock price surge over the last year.\n\nFurthermore, while the triple-digit profit growth is probably not sustainable, it makes its 51 price-to-earnings ratio, a level near multi-year lows, appear inexpensive. Such conditions should bolster Amazon's growth despite its size and stability.\n\nVisa\n\nDespite its massive size, Visa (NYSE: V) holds tremendous growth potential. Its global payments network continues to play a more critical role in the economy as society becomes more cashless.\n\nIt remains a leading (or arguably dominant) service provider with its credit and debit cards and merchant terminals. In 2023, 61% of all credit cards in the U.S. came from Visa. This was far ahead of Mastercard at 25% and American Express at 11%. Card Brand Market Share in the U.S., 2007-2023\n\nConsidering the volume of global transactions, it adds up to a staggering amount of gross payment volume, and from that, Visa collects a small fee.\n\nHowever, its largest revenue source is data processing fees. That involves services such as clearing, settlement, network access, and other related services. International transaction fees and other services make up the remainder of its revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn fiscal Q2 (ended March 31), Visa reported $8.8 billion in revenue, 10% above year-ago levels. Likewise, its $4.7 billion in net income also rose 10%.\n\nThis growth helped take the consumer finance stock more than 20% higher over the last year. Also, its P/E ratio of 31 is below the average multiple of 35 for the last five years, a factor that could attract more buyers. Given industry trends, Visa's march higher should continue for a long time to come.\n\nMcDonald's\n\nAdmittedly, investors may not look favorably at McDonald's(NYSE: MCD), given concerns over rising prices and wages. Media reports of the feared \"$20 happy meal\" may have contributed to the restaurant stock moving into correction territory.\n\nHowever, a $20 happy meal is not likely to happen anytime soon. Even if it were, McDonald's business model insulates it from those effects. Most of the company's high-margin revenue comes from building rentals and franchise fees -- fixed amounts that do not vary with sales. Also, the 4% to 5% of gross sales due to the company presumably rises with inflation, which mitigates the effects of rising prices.\n\nIndeed, the financials continue to trend higher. In the first quarter of 2024, revenue of $6.2 billion rose 5% compared with year-ago levels. With that increase, the company earned over $1.9 billion, a 7% yearly increase.\n\nAdditionally, investors should not forget the $6.68-per-share annual dividend. Its 2.6% dividend yield is around double the S&P 500 average of 1.3%. More importantly, it has risen yearly since McDonald's introduced the dividend in 1976. That rising return makes it more of a hold, particularly for longtime shareholders.\n\nFurthermore, its P/E ratio of 22 is below the five-year average of 28, allowing prospective shareholders to buy at a discount. As investors recognize that the rising prices are unlikely to derail McDonald's, they will likely have a more bullish outlook on the stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Colossal Growth Stocks to Buy in the New Bull Market and Hold For Years",
        "content": "The new 2024 bull market has reawakened many investors' interest in stocks. However, the truth is that quality businesses haven't gone anywhere. Stock prices may fluctuate, but good businesses can push forward through turbulent times and deliver results that compound investor returns.\n\nIf you're on the hunt for growth stocks to buy and hold for the long haul, you don't have to look far to find compelling businesses. Here are two stocks -- one a household name and the other a newer entrant to the cloud space -- that you might want to consider the next time you go shopping for your investment portfolio.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) has continued to demonstrate its ability to invigorate its business amid economic thick and thin while relying on growth from its core lineup of segments. Its e-commerce platform remains one of the largest in the world and is still the single largest revenue source for Amazon.\n\nMeanwhile, the company's Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment continues to dominate the global cloud infrastructure space. As one of Amazon's most asset-light businesses, it accounts for the lion's share of its profits.\n\nAWS also serves as the most clearcut example of Amazon's continued deployment of generative artificial intelligence and related tools across a wide range of client use cases.\n\nTools like Amazon Bedrock (a service for building generative AI applications), Amazon Q (a generative AI chatbot), and Amazon Sagemaker (a platform that helps customers build and train machine learning models) are being adopted by large enterprises to drive better efficiency and improve customer experiences.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Amazon's total net sales reached $143 billion, a 13% increase from the prior year. Of that total, $89 billion was attributable to e-commerce (online store sales and third-party service sales), $25 billion to AWS, and $11.8 billion to advertising. These are its three largest revenue sources.\n\nNet income for the three-month period soared 225% year over year to $10.4 billion, while operating income jumped 219% to $15.3 billion. Of that operating income total, $9.4 billion was derived from the AWS segment.\n\nEver the cash machine, Amazon ended the quarter with trailing 12-month free cash flow of $50 billion. If you're looking for a no-brainer stock with an established, wide moat across its core business drivers, Amazon remains a smart buy to add to again and again as the years progress.\n\n2. Toast\n\nToast (NYSE: TOST) makes money from selling restaurant software, hardware, and financial technology solutions to small to midsize enterprises in the U.S., the U.K., and Ireland. While still down considerably from its all-time high, the stock is trading up roughly 40% from the start of this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors have been far more cautious of late when it comes to growth-oriented business that are not yet profitable. However, Toast operates in a fast-growing space while providing products and services that face consistent demand.\n\nCurrently, Toast makes most of its money from various financial technology solutions. These include transaction-based fees it accrues when a restaurant processes a payment using its platform solutions, as well as fees from marketing and servicing loans for restaurant customers through Toast Capital.\n\nThose loans are originated by third-party partners, not Toast itself. The company also generates revenue from recurring subscriptions and from hardware sales, such as those of tablets and terminals.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, Toast delivered gross payment volume of just shy of $35 billion, a 30% increase from one year ago. Total restaurant locations jumped 32% year over year to 112,000, and its annual recurring run-rate at the end of the quarter was $1.3 billion, a 32% year-over-year hike.\n\nRight now, Toast is not profitable according to generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP). However, it did report a gross profit of $249 million in the recent quarter, a 43% year-over-year increase, and adjusted earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) of $57 million.\n\nIn the recent quarter, Toast was not cash flow positive, but it reported $135 million in operating cash flow and $93 million in free cash flow for all of 2023. Management is also targeting the company to reach an operating profit (based on GAAP) by the first half of next year.\n\nGrowth is accelerating, and management is pursuing a defined roadmap to profitability. Toast currently controls about 13% of the restaurant software market in the U.S. That's a sizable chunk of a broad, expanding addressable market, but one that allows it plenty of room to run. This stock may pose an intriguing buy for long-term investors who want to gain exposure to this space and have a sizable buy-and-hold horizon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Sorry Tech Stocks to Sell While You Still Can",
        "content": "In reality, many tech companies don’t have deep pockets. And in a higher interest rate situation, this becomes even more important. Although it seems the Fed will be forced to cut rates, latest FOMC minutes make future rate cuts less likely.\n\nTo make sure the inflation doesn’t take off again, the Federal Reserve remains in the restrictive monetary zone. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) forecasts that rate cuts may be off the table until December. In turn, the economic pressure will not be lessened at a time when 43% of small businesses couldn’t fully pay their rent in April, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThis market dynamic doesn’t bode well for tech stocks that have yet to reach profitability. With that scenario on the horizon, investors might consider selling these tech stocks to mitigate risks.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSnap Inc. (SNAP) The Snapchat (SNAP) and Instagram apps on displayed on an iPhone, which sits on a gray background.\n\nSource: BigTunaOnline / Shutterstock\n\nDespite owning the popular app Snapchat, Snap (NASDAQ:SNAP) has yet to deliver a positive net income period. The single quarterly exception was at the end of 2021 at only $23 million. This failure to sustainably monetize is similar to other social tech companies like Reddit (NYSE:RDDT). And, it positions them among tech stocks to sell due to uncertain profitability.\n\nThe bulk of Snap’s revenue comes from advertising owing to free Snapchat, which had 422 million daily active users in Q1 of 2024. However, both the user and revenue growth are not direct roads to Snap’s profitability. The company reported 21% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q1 of 2024 at $1.19 billion. However, it suffered a net loss of $305 million.\n\nAlthough that is lower than the $329 million net loss a year ago, Snap’s free cash flow took a dive to $38 million from $103 million in Q1 of 2023. On the upside, the company has zero debt maturing during 2024. This is helpful, given the elevated interest rate climate. But direct competition from Meta’s Instagram makes it less likely for a profitability liftoff.\n\nIn addition to profitability issues, Snapchat’s user growth seems to be plateauing from the high early growth in the 2010s, a similar trend to Twitter. SNAP stock is down 10% year-to-date (YTD) at $15 per share, down from its 52-week high of $17.90. And, it’s far below its all-time high of $83.11 in September 2021.\n\nRobinhood Markets, Inc. (HOOD) The Robinood app logo with the Robinhood (HOOD) website logo in the background.\n\nSource: Fluna nightEtJ / Shutterstock.com\n\nTo acquire a large piece of the retail trading pie, Robinhood (NASDAQ:HOOD) had to employ many shortcuts. Although having popularized zero commission trading, other fintech companies adopted the model. Robinhood’s core revenue generator, payment for order flow (PFOF), made this model viable despite causing controversy.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt relies heavily on subscription services and interest on cash. So, in a hard landing scenario, HOOD would feel the brunt along with the U.S. stock market. Moreover, Robinhood’s profitable quarters are far in between. The latest Q1 of 2024 earnings showed one of the rare exceptions, with $157 million net income compared to a $511 million net loss in the year-ago quarter.\n\nFurther, HOOD performance of 65% YTD at $20.45 per share would position the stock for a solid exit point. The present price is close to its 52-week high of $21.21 while far above its 52-week low of $7.91 per share.\n\nSnowflake Inc. (SNOW) The Snowflake logo on a company office in Silicon Valley, California. (SNOW stock)\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite being a high growth (by revenue) cloud computing stock, Snowflake (NASDAQ:SNOW) has been racking one quarterly net loss after another. The company’s total addressable market for storage and scaled computing is large. In fact, it’s estimated to grow at a CAGR of 17.8% by 2032.\n\nIn a regular market environment, this would make Snowflake Inc. an outstanding proposition. However, when the interest rate dynamic is combined with heavy weight competition coming from Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud and Microsoft’s Azure, the prospect is less appealing.\n\nIn fact, SNOW as a Software as a Service (SaaS) company, relies on these Big Tech companies to provide the physical datacenter infrastructure. Presently, Snowflake Inc. also relies on future growth expectations in which investors fund ongoing quarterly losses.\n\nFor fiscal Q1 of 2025, the company reported 33% YOY revenue growth to $828.7 million. Yet, the company’s net loss increased to $316.9 million from $225.6 net loss in a year-ago quarter. Ultimately, investor’s exposure to cloud stock is safer in Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or cloud-adjacent Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META).\n\nYear-to-date, SNOW is down 17% at $156.16 per share. This is sandwiched between the 52-week high of $237.72 and the 52-week low of $138.40, making for another solid exit point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Technology is evolving in three key areas right now: artificial intelligence (AI), fifth-generation (5G) wireless, and cloud computing. Taken together, these technologies are expected to revolutionize life as we know it in the coming decades.And while many technology companies play in each sandbox, a handful of companies are dominating and pushing the tech forward.\n\nFor investors looking to grow their portfolio, it is important to know which companies are market leaders and advancing the technologies that are reshaping the world. These are the growth stocks that can be counted on to outperform the market and deliver outsized returns to shareholders for many years to come. Here is the tech transformation trio: three stocks leading the charge in AI, 5G, and the cloud.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn AI, there is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). While the company trails archrival Nvidia(NASDAQ:NVDA) in terms of microchips and semiconductors that run AI applications and models, the company is working overtime to catch-up. Early signs are encouraging. As part of its first-quarter financial results, AMD reported that revenue at its Data Center unit grew 80% from a year earlier to $2.3 billion due to strong sales of its new MI300 series AI chip.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDue to overwhelming demand, AMD forecasted AI chip sales this year to be $4 billion. That’s double the amount the company had telegraphed last fall. AMD noted that it has sold more than $1 billion worth of its MI300 AI chips since they launched at the end of last year. While the MI300 chip has only been available for six months, management at AMD says they are already working on new AI chips and successors to the current generation of processors. AMD stock has risen 40% in the last 12 months.\n\nVerizon Communications (VZ) Verizon Retail Location. Verizon delivers wireless, high-capacity fiber optics and 5G communications. VZ stock\n\nSource: RAMAN SHAUNIA / Shutterstock.com\n\nIn fifth-generation wireless, we have Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ). The telecommunications company’s stock has been on the rise after better-than-expected Q1 financial results and fewer losses among its wireless subscribers. At the end of April, Verizon reported Q1 EPS of $1.15 compared to the $1.12 that was expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $33 billion, which matched Wall Street forecasts.\n\nVerizon credited the results to its flexible plans and streaming bundles that include discounted prices for services such as Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). The company also reported that it lost 68,000 monthly bill-paying wireless phone subscribers during Q1, which was much less than an estimated loss of 100,000 subscribers. A year earlier, Verizon lost 127,000 wireless subscribers.\n\nStory continues\n\nVerizon added that its customers are choosing its premium, customizable “myPlan” option, which has proven popular with consumers. Late last year, Verizon began offering discounted subscriptions to Netflix with its myPlan bundles. VZ stock has gained 13% over the past year.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California.

AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the leader in cloud computing with a 31% market share. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud computing unit, is increasingly important to the overall company. In Q1 of this year, AWS recorded $25 billion in revenue, beating estimates of $24.5 billion. AWS accounted for 62% of Amazon’s total operating profit during the quarter.\n\nIn speaking to analysts and media, Amazon executives credited the company’s growth largely to demand for cloud computing. The strong showing of AWS, which continues to dominate in the cloud space, powered Amazon to an EPS of 98 cents compared to the 83 cents that was forecast on Wall Street. Earnings more than tripled from 31 cents a year earlier. Total sales amounted to $143.3 billion, up 13% year over year.\n\nAMZN stock has increased by 44% in the last 12 months.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "Growth stocks can be volatile. Sometimes, they're beloved market darlings, with stock prices soaring on the wings of speculation and exciting business prospects. Just a few months later (or earlier), the same companies may be found in the proverbial bargain bin as investors seek stability and proven profits in times of crisis. This corner of the stock market isn't for the faint of heart.\n\nBut the same volatility that might make me reach for the antacids can only set the stage for incredible long-term gains. When the stock of a great high-growth company is on fire sale, it's time to buy.\n\nOn that note, let's check out a duo of formerly high-flying stock market sweethearts that have been swooning recently. One stock is almost back to its former highs, while the other stands a hair-raising 88% lower in three years. I'm talking about Netflix(NASDAQ: NFLX) and Roku(NASDAQ: ROKU), the service and platform masters of the media-streaming universe.\n\nHere's why you should add Roku and Netflix to your portfolio and hold them forever, for all intents and purposes. Spoiler alert: Both companies have a lot of growing left to do.\n\nA booming media market\n\nLet's start with Netflix's \"long term view.\" This document, found on the company's investor-relations website, outlines Netflix's long-term business plan in great detail. It also offers an overview of the streaming market as a whole.\n\nIt's a simple vision, really. Linear TV systems such as cable, satellite, and broadcast services have had their day, and streaming-video alternatives are taking over on a global level. The streaming experience is \"on-demand, personalized, and available on any screen,\" freeing consumers from the tyranny of broadcast schedules or programming digital-video recorders. The streaming market itself is growing as more and more people gain access to broadband-level internet connections and suitable viewing devices. In the end, the old-school linear TV experience should become a seldom-used novelty act, putting the trillion-dollar media market squarely in the hands of streaming media services.\n\nNetflix's unshakable leadership\n\nNetflix is the reigning champ in the streaming world. With a subscriber base of 270 million accounts -- rivalling the population of Indonesia, the fourth-largest nation in the world -- Netflix has carved out a dominant position in the market. About a year ago, Netflix shifted gears to focus more on profitability, much to the delight of analysts and investors.\n\nI mean, the initial reaction was a panic, as the company abandoned its long-held focus on optimized subscriber growth in search of more profitable options. But the upsides of the new strategy became clear over the next few quarters, and Netflix shares are sniffing at all-time highs again.\n\nStory continues\n\nRoku's emerging strength\n\nRoku is still in the earlier stages of its growth story, like a scrappy underdog with tons of potential.\n\nIt hasn't made the switch to a profit-first strategy yet, remaining laser-focused on global growth and capturing more users. Netflix is an important partner in this quest, alongside every streaming service that hopes to make a dent in the streaming market.\n\nNetflix has been a global operation since 2016, but Roku is almost exclusively an American growth story so far. The company doesn't even report its international business results, with one interesting exception. About 79% of its long-lived assets are located in the United States, 17% are found in the U.K., and the remaining 4% in \"other countries.\" It's a big world out there, and Roku is only getting started with its global-expansion plans. Current focus areas include Canada, Mexico, and Germany. Other first-world markets will follow, and the final ambition is to go worldwide.\n\nRoku's success is not guaranteed, of course. Rivals include local heroes in each target market as well as deep-pocketed tech giants led by Fire TV manager Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Chromecast/Google TV mastermind Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL). But if the trendsetting American market is any indication, Roku seems poised to enter about half of the global media market's 1.8 billion households. That's a long way away from Roku's current market footprint of 81.6 million accounts.\n\nDigital-advertising market recovery\n\nBoth Netflix and Roku are well positioned to benefit from the anticipated recovery in the digital-advertising market. Roku's stock price has been adversely affected by the downturn in digital-ad spending, but as the market recovers, the company should experience substantial gains in ad-based revenues. Additionally, Netflix's recent introduction of ad-supported streaming tiers opens new revenue streams, further enhancing its growth prospects.\n\nAd sales make the business world go 'round, and these companies are ready to help it spin.\n\nThe mature market leader and the undervalued turnaround story\n\nNetflix is like the wise elder in the streaming world. It knows the game, has proven its staying power, and offers stability and steady growth. With its shift to a profit-oriented model, Netflix is a solid choice for investors looking for robust and reliable profit growth. You would have laughed me off the stage for a statement like that in 2019, but things have changed.\n\nIn the opposite corner, Roku is the young and hungry upstart. Its number of active accounts and trailing revenues are similar to Netflix's figures in 2015 just before the service leader launched into a global presence. This high-octane growth stock looks tremendously undervalued these days.\n\nI can't promise that Roku will follow the Netflix playbook to perfection, but its trajectory should be quite similar. And it's a promising path, too: Netflix has quintupled its sales and delivered a 480% return to shareholders since the end of 2015. By comparison, the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index is only up by 160% over the same time span.\n\nWhether you prefer the stability of Netflix or the potential mega-upside of Roku, these are two stocks to buy and hold forever. The streaming-media market is going places, with Roku and Netflix in the vanguard. You can follow my example and own both of them for the long haul, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Roku right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Roku, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Roku wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon Stock Finally Hit a Record High After 3 Years. Can It Keep Going Up?",
        "content": "Did you know that until recently, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) stock was still off of its 2021 highs? Amazon stock last hit a high in July of 2021, almost three years ago. Even though Amazon stock gained 81% last year, it still came into 2024 nearly 20% below its peak.\n\nIt finally topped that in April. Can it keep going?\n\nWait, Amazon stock is down?\n\nAmazon stock sank in the in the previous bear market, and it's been climbing again since bottoming out last year. It surpassed its previous record in April of this year and hit a new high last week. AMZN Chart\n\nNow that Amazon stock is trading at its highest levels ever, is it the time to buy?\n\nIs AI the biggest tailwind Amazon has ever seen?\n\nAmazon stock has hit record highs many times in the past, and has gone on to surpass them by leaps and bounds. Had an investor sold at past highs, they'd have missed out on incredible gains. The new high doesn't mean the ascent is over -- it means investors have strong confidence in Amazon's potential right now.\n\nThe biggest driver of that confidence is Amazon's is artificial intelligence (AI). Amazon is investing heavily in its AI technology to support Amazon Web Services (AWS) and e-commerce providers. It's been using AI for decades, but since the launch of ChatGPT and the resultant interest in generative AI, Amazon has unveiled its own high-level solutions. It offers various tiers for every kind of user, from the technology for developers to create their own large language models (LLM) to solutions for non-techies to input their info and create complete web pages, full marketing campaigns, and more. And of course, Amazon uses AI in its own operations. It can pinpoint shoppers' preferences based on search history and more, offering side-by-side comparisons to help customers make decisions and convert higher sales. It also uses AI in its advertising business, where it offers advertisers perhaps the ideal platform to capture customers where they're already looking to spend money.\n\nThe potential for what AI can do for Amazon's business is substantial, creating a huge, untapped well of business for Amazon.\n\nThere's everything else\n\nAmazon is a leader in several areas, beginning with its core e-commerce business. Amazon's lead is so massive, with nearly 40% of total U.S. e-commerce, that it wouldn't be possible for any competitor to come close in the near future. It also continues to get better as it gets bigger. As it makes faster deliveries, more customers rely on it for more purchases, padding its already-wide moat.\n\nStory continues\n\nAWS is the largest cloud computing company in the world, with 31% of the market, and it consistently adds new, high-profile customers to the platform as well as expanded deals with current customers. Amazon recently opened a new $10 billion AWS facility in Mississippi and has started investing another $10 billion in Mexico and Saudi Arabia, and it still feels it's just scratching the surface of the opportunity.\n\nIt's a major player in streaming, complete with its own major film studio. It acquired MGM Studios in 2021. It's working on developing a healthcare business, and it has several smaller segments that add to the total.\n\nA new high, and more to come\n\nAmazon has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, but investors aren't worried about it growing even bigger. 62 out of 65 Wall Street analysts rate it a buy right now, with the other three rating it a hold. The average Wall Street consensus price target is for Amazon stock to gain 21% over the next 12 to 18 months, with a high of 94%.\n\nAmazon stock may have reached a new high, but expect even more of that going forward.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia by 2028",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares have soared 650% since January 2023. Consequently, its market capitalization has jumped from $360 billion to $2.7 trillion in less than two years. Demand for artificial intelligence (AI) systems was the driving force behind that price appreciation.\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) are currently worth $1.8 trillion and $2.2 trillion, respectively. However, both companies could eclipse Nvidia's current valuation within four years, meaning they could be worth at least $2.8 trillion by mid-2028.\n\nHere are the important details.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon reported stellar financial results in the first quarter, beating expectations on the top and bottom lines. Revenue increased 13% to $143 billion as advertising and cloud computing sales accelerated. Meanwhile, generally accepted accounting principles (GAAP) net income tripled to reach $0.98 per diluted share. Investors have good reason to think that momentum will continue.\n\nThe investment thesis for Amazon centers on its strong presence in e-commerce, digital advertising, and cloud computing, markets projected to expand at annual rates of 11%, 15%, and 21%, respectively, through 2030. Amazon runs the most visited online marketplace in the world, and its clout in retail has evolved into a robust digital advertising business. Specifically, Amazon is the largest retail advertiser in the U.S. and the third largest adtech company worldwide.\n\nAmazon is using artificial intelligence (AI) to increase revenue and boost efficiency across its e-commerce and advertising businesses. For instance, machine learning models optimize warehouse inventory and last-mile delivery routes, and a new generative AI tool helps brands create marketing content in a cost effective manner. Amazon has also shifted to multiple regional fulfillment networks (rather than one centralized network) and introduced ads on Prime Video. Those changes are not strictly related to AI, but they should boost profitability.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon Web Services (AWS) is the largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services. The company lost a percentage point of market share over the last year, but it remains well positioned to benefit from AI. Public clouds are the most cost-efficient way for businesses to get the computing power needed to build and run AI applications, so AWS has a significant advantage in its market leadership. However, the company has also expanded its portfolio with new products like Amazon Bedrock.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Amazon to grow sales at 10.9% annually over the next five years, a reasonable estimate given how quickly its major markets are projected to grow. Assuming Wall Street is correct, the stock could achieve a market capitalization of $2.8 trillion within four years if shares trade at 3.1 times sales in mid-2028. That seems reasonable, given that shares currently trade at 3.2 times sales.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat would that mean for investors? If Amazon is worth $2.8 trillion in mid-2028, shareholders will see annual returns of approximately 11.6% (from its current market capitalization of $1.8 trillion). Those gains would probably beat the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC), given that the index has compounded at 10% annually (more or less) over long periods.\n\n2. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet looked strong in the first quarter. Revenue increased 15% to $80.5 billion due to especially strong sales growth in Google Cloud and modest sales growth in Google Advertising. Meanwhile, net income jumped 61% to $1.89 per diluted share as the company continued to focus on expense management.\n\nThe investment thesis for Alphabet centers on its strong presence in digital advertising and cloud computing, with markets forecast to grow at annual rates of 15% and 21%, respectively. Alphabet is the largest adtech company in the world, due in large part to its dominance in internet search. Alphabet is experimenting with generative AI to fortify that dominance. For instance, CEO Sundar Pichai says recently launched AI Overviews are boosting Google Search usage and user satisfaction.\n\nSimilarly, Google Cloud is the third-largest provider of cloud infrastructure and platform services, but the company gained a percentage point of market share over the past year and its recent launch of Gemini could sustain that momentum. Gemini is a multimodal AI model -- meaning it can be prompted with text, images, video, and other media -- that Google Cloud customers can use to build generative AI applications.\n\nGoing forward, Wall Street expects Alphabet to grow sales at 10.5% annually over the next five years, a reasonable estimate (perhaps a little low) given how quickly its major markets are projected to expand. Assuming Wall Street is correct, the company could achieve a $2.8 trillion market capitalization within four years if shares trade at 5.9 times sales in mid-2028. That seems easily done since shares currently trade at 7.1 times sales.\n\nWhat would that mean for investors? If Alphabet is worth $2.8 trillion in mid-2028, shareholders will see annual returns just north of 6% (from its current market capitalization of $2.2 trillion). Those gains would probably underperform the S&P 500. That said, I believe Alphabet will be worth more than $2.8 trillion in four years, and I expect the stock to beat the market between now and then.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN): Prepping for Its Next Decade of Growth with AWS",
        "content": "E-commerce and cloud giant Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is poised for the next decade of growth after delivering a return of around 1,000% over the last decade. Thanks to its recent earnings beat, the stock price recently hit a new all-time high. Despite these gains, Amazon’s reaccelerated AWS growth, bolstered by AI, strong retail momentum, and margin and cash-flow expansion from optimization initiatives, make me bullish on the stock. Thus, I’ll buy the stock at current levels.\n\nAmazon Posts Yet Another Quarterly Beat Driven by AWS\n\nOn April 30, Amazon reported impressive Q1 results for the fifth consecutive quarter, driven by upbeat performance across all segments, including cloud, advertising, and e-commerce. Adjusted earnings of $0.98 per share handily beat analysts’ estimates of $0.84 per share. Also, earnings more than trebled (+216%) year-over-year compared to earnings of $0.31 per share in the prior-year period.\n\nFurther, net sales soared 13% year-over-year to $143.3 billion, and sales for Amazon’s cloud business segment, Amazon Web Services (AWS), grew 17% year-over-year to $25 billion, beating expectations. Segment growth was aided by renewed demand and investments in generative AI, which boosted AWS’s performance, alongside a near cessation of the cost optimizations that customers had resorted to last year.\n\nParticularly noteworthy is that AWS’s operating income jumped 84.3% year-over-year to $9.4 billion. Further, there was a significant operating margin expansion in the segment from 24% in the prior-year quarter to 37.6% currently.\n\nRegion-wise, North America sales grew 12% year-over-year, with International segment revenue growth at 11% (in constant currency). Moreover, operating income for all the company’s segments combined jumped by 219% year-over-year to $15.3 billion.\n\nBased on its robust Q1 performance, Amazon provided an optimistic Q2 outlook, above expectations. Q2 net sales are projected to grow between 7-11% to be in the range of $144-149 billion. Notably, operating income guidance of $10-14 billion ($12 billion at the midpoint) is also much higher compared to the $7.7 billion generated in the first quarter of 2023.\n\nAWS Sees Record Growth and Margins in Q1 Due to AI Impact\n\nAWS, Amazon’s cloud business, has long been the market leader and the profit engine for the company for years. However, after years of impressive growth, the segment saw a slowdown, with growth decelerating to 13% in 2023 compared to 29% in 2022 and 37% in 2021.\n\nThat downtrend is now history. In Q1, AWS’s sales grew 17%, helping AWS reach the much-anticipated $100 billion run rate milestone in revenues. Additionally, operating income for the segment saw a remarkable growth of 84%.\n\nStory continues\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is the catalyst behind this stupendous growth witnessed at AWS during the quarter. As a matter of fact, the tech titans of the world like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) have been investing heavily in AI technology.\n\nFor instance, Microsoft’s Azure has gained market share in the cloud space, now holding a 25% share versus 19% in 2021. The addition of AI tools has been a contributing factor toward Azure’s rapid growth over the years. Like its peers, Amazon is making meaningful investments in AI and developing its own large language models as well as investing billions in AI products like Anthropic (which competes with OpenAI’s ChatGPT).\n\nAmazon’s investments in AI are now reaping benefits and showing up in the financial figures. The company stated that the majority of its FY2024 CapEx (capital expenditures) will be toward bolstering AWS infrastructure and AI efforts. As the cloud leader, AWS can significantly monetize the growing demand for AI with its wide variety of cloud offerings.\n\nIt’s not just the margin expansion that impressed investors in Q1. It was a huge jump in cash flows despite substantial capital investments in AI and cloud infrastructure. This reassured investors that Amazon’s fundamentals remain intact. Q1 free cash flows grew to $50.1 billion (Q4: $36.8 billion) compared to cash outflows of $3.3 billion a year ago. Margin expansion, coupled with robust free cash flows, implies strong returns for investors in the years to come.\n\nEarlier this week, there was news that AWS is looking to invest billions in Italy to strengthen its cloud infrastructure and data center operations in the country. Similarly, AWS will invest billions in Spain (€15.7 billion) and Germany (€7.8 billion) with the aim of expanding its cloud business across European countries.\n\nAmazon has been undertaking key initiatives to streamline the company’s operations as well as bring down costs. These steps include transforming the U.S. fulfillment model from a nationwide one to a regional one and synchronizing inventory with the regional consumers, among others.\n\nOn a separate note, Amazon recently announced the departure of its AWS head, Adam Selipsky. He will be replaced by Matt Garman, an AWS veteran, to become the CEO of AWS. This leadership change may further enhance Amazon’s AI growth initiatives.\n\nAmazon’s Valuation Isn’t Expensive\n\nAs Amazon houses multiple businesses under its radar, I believe the EV/EBITDA ratio is the best metric to evaluate the stock’s valuation. Being an industry leader, the company has historically traded at high multiples. At present, however, Amazon stock is trading at around 14.3x EV/EBITDA (on a forward basis) compared to its own five-year historical average of 20.6x. This implies a huge 31% discount.\n\nFor the sake of comparison, let’s also look at its P/S ratio. Amazon is trading at a price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 3.0x. In contrast, cloud computing and tech giant Microsoft trades at a P/S of 13.1x, while social networking company Meta Platforms  (NASDAQ:META) trades at a P/S of 7.7x.\n\nTherefore, I believe the stock is trading at an attractive valuation and presents a great buying opportunity, given the strong growth potential across various business verticals.\n\nIs Amazon Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on Amazon stock, with a majority of them raising their price targets after the impressive earnings beat. Overall, the stock commands a Strong Buy consensus rating based on 42 unanimous Buys. Amazon stock’s average price target of $220.60 implies 20.5% upside potential from current levels.\n\nConclusion: Consider AMZN Stock for Its Long-Term Growth\n\nAmazon may have been a little late to the AI growth story, but it’s important to remember that AWS remains the leader in cloud infrastructure. Its substantial investments and recent leadership changes should yield significant benefits. The foundation has been laid, and I believe there’s no turning back for Amazon.\n\nWith multiple growth drivers, including AWS’s growth trajectory fueled by generative AI initiatives, a well-diversified business portfolio, strong retail performance, and impressive margin and cash-flow expansion, Amazon appears well-positioned for its next phase of growth. Therefore, I am confident in buying the stock at its current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 20 Biggest Supply Chain Companies to Know and in this article we will take a look at the largest supply chain company in the world.\n\nAn Analysis of the Supply Chain Industry\n\nAccording to a report by Fortune Business Insights, the global supply chain management market was valued at $23.58 billion in 2023, the market is expected to grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 11.7% and is forecasted to reach $63.77 billion by the end of 2032. The market's growth is driven by the rise of digital technology including e-commerce as companies expand their online sales, reaching a larger audience. This trend has increased competition among firms attracting customers by offering superior services at competitive prices. E-commerce has made shopping more convenient and accessible by providing multiple payment options and offering easy return policies to ensure customer satisfaction. These technologies enable businesses to track sales performance in real time, understand customer preferences, and refine their business strategies accordingly. B2B Supply Chain Management covers all transaction levels, from sourcing raw materials to delivering final products to customers. The increasing demand for just-in-time delivery pressures suppliers to deliver products more quickly and efficiently. Additionally, e-commerce facilitates supply chain management by allowing shipping companies to exchange documents electronically during fulfillment. The Asia Pacific region is expected to achieve the highest CAGR during the forecast period, driven by the growth of industry sectors such as manufacturing, logistics, and transportation. Some of the biggest companies are focusing on developing and launching advanced supply chain management solutions to meet the rising demand for supply chain operations in these sectors. Additionally, companies are investing in logistics infrastructure across various countries. In Europe, the supply chain market is being propelled by the rise of Industry 4.0 and IoT. The Federal Statistical Office of Germany reports that the growing need for effective production process management and adoption of automation has led to 82.0% of large organizations using supply chain management solutions.\n\nThe growth of the North American supply chain management market is driven by the increasing adoption of supply chain management solutions across the region. Recent research indicates that the usage of supply chain management solutions grew by 9.0% year-over-year in 2021. In the U.S., the logistics industry accounts for about 10.0% of the total GDP and is projected to reach approximately $175 trillion in 2022. As the logistics industry expands, the demand for supply chain management solutions is expected to rise in the coming years. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), there are over 5.0 million transportation and warehouse workers in U.S. corporations. Pandemic-related lockdowns, labor shortages, and geopolitics have significantly impacted the global supply chain, causing bottlenecks, rising costs, and disruptions. In response, companies integrated supply chains vertically, leading to market growth. The COVID-19 pandemic also drove companies worldwide to implement IT software based on digital technologies to streamline operations. The increasing digitization of businesses and supportive government policies are propelling market growth. For instance, industry experts noted that global investment in digital transformation reached $1.5 trillion in 2020, with increased investments from both small and large companies. This surge in digital technology adoption and government initiatives during the pandemic has boosted demand for supply chain management solutions.\n\nStory continues\n\nBiggest Supply Chain Companies\n\nSome of the biggest supply chain companies include Amazon, Inc.

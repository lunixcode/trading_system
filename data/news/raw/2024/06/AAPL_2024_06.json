        "title": "World’s Best Company According to the Media",
        "content": "This article will list world's best company according to the media.\n\nTransforming the Media Landscape: Challenges, Growth, and the Influence of Major Corporations\n\nMany people ask what a media company is and why their opinions matter. Media companies produce and distribute content through traditional and digital channels, influencing public opinion and shaping narratives via their broad reach and credibility. Knowing that the media sector encompasses a wide array of activities including advertising, broadcasting, networking, and news, we cannot ignore their impact on the market. Such firms operate across diverse fields, catering to end customers ranging from individuals to large enterprises. This list highlights major media corporations, providing insights into their operations and offerings.\n\nWhile digital media is faring considerably well, the same cannot be said about traditional media. In fact, the year 2022 saw losses from traditional media companies amounting to $5 billion on streaming services-except for Netflix, Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN). The Walt Disney Company (NYSE:DIS), Warner Bros. Discovery, Inc. (NASDAQ:WBD), Comcast Corporation (NASDAQ:CMCSA) and Paramount, are all some big entertainment conglomerates that are a part of the traditional media downfall in one way or another. Factors such as a weak advertising market, rising production costs, and declining revenues in traditional media have all been responsible for their demise.\n\nAn Accenture survey of 6,000 consumers highlights additional challenges by revealing their media consumption behaviors. The survey reveals 55.9% of those surveyed expressing frustration over paying at multiple platforms to access content, 65.5% finding it inconvenient to enter personal information repeatedly, and more than half complaining that recommendations provided did not match their interests. Moreover, as many as 30% of consumers now spend over 10 minutes searching for new content, a  figure that has since doubled from the past. As a result of many of these problems, linear TV viewership has dropped by 26% since last year, while Subscription Video on Demand (SVOD) has surged by 57%. Additionally, consumers have significantly increased their usage of social media (52%), social video (52%), and video games (50%)—areas where traditional media companies have minimal presence.\n\nThe media industry has experienced a profound transformation with the successful expansion of the subscription model, presenting new growth opportunities amid substantial declines in advertising revenues. Leading this shift, Amazon and Netflix have both achieved remarkable increases in revenue and audience numbers. Moreover, companies such as Amazon.com, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) are investing in diversified revenue streams such as gaming, streaming, and even live sports. These revenue streams give them a “safety net”, something that pure play companies lack.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs such, media firms have considerable influence over buyers, and their earnings place them at the top of the list.  The companies on the Forbes 2023 list of the top 100 companies collectively represent 61 different countries, $51.7 trillion in sales, $4.5 trillion in income, $238 trillion in assets, and $88 trillion in market value. As such, the ranking of the world's largest publicly traded firms currently leans heavily towards the United States, marking a shift since the 2008 financial crisis. Bagging the top spot in Forbes top companies is JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) with a market capitalization of $580 billion as of June 2024. This American multinational finance company is one of the most valuable companies in the world. The number two spot is taken by Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE:BRK-B) , an American multinational conglomerate holding company. Companies such as chip maker NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) are also gaining considerable traction owing to AI, having moved up more than a 100 spots on Forbes’ list. However, when talking about the best companies according to the media, the results may not tally with Forbes lists. world's best company according to the media\n\nImage by Igor Karimov from Unsplash\n\nMethodology\n\nThe compilation of the best firms by media began with lists published by media companies. In this regard, Forbes conducted extensive research, compiling multiple major rankings of the most valuable corporations, largest companies, top employers, and leading technology firms. Their methodology ranks the world's largest firms based on four metrics: sales, profitability, assets, and market value. To identify the top employers, they surveyed over 170,000 employees from international corporations and organizations across more than 50 countries. We also referred to Fast Company's list of the most innovative companies, top 100 tech companies, and Visual Capitalist's list of the most valuable brands. We compared these lists with previous years' rankings to determine which firms consistently appeared. It's important to note that these lists encompass both media companies and companies associated with media brands, too. This is how our compilation of the world's 30 best companies according to the media, as recognized by the media, was formulated.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see the details here).\n\nBased on our study, this is the world's best company according to the media.\n\n1. Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT)\n\nInsider Monkey Score: 6\n\nLiving under a rock would be the only way to remain unaware of Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) and its profound influence across various sectors and industries. Originally established as a software company, Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ: MSFT) has evolved into a tech powerhouse, offering a diverse array of products and services including operating systems, cloud services, game consoles, and AI technologies. Since its inception in 1975, Microsoft has made an indelible impact on the global stage, culminating in record-breaking revenue exceeding $62 billion USD in the second financial quarter of 2024. As of 2024, Microsoft's market capitalization stands impressively at $3.12 trillion USD, which is why is Microsoft on the top of the list of world's 30 best companies according to the media.\n\nCheck out our complete list of World’s 30 Best Companies According to the Media.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the most hated brands to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "content": "Fintech stocks continue to hold immense potential for delivering solid gains to investors. These companies are at the forefront of revolutionizing how we transact and think about money. And this includes the advent of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nAs we witness ongoing disruption in the monetary system, fintech stocks are paving the way forward. To capitalize on these fundamental shifts, I’ve researched three fintech stocks that strike the right balance between risk and reward. Often overlooked in financial media, these hidden opportunities garner strong buy ratings from analysts.\n\nMoreover, with falling interest rates predicted throughout 2024 and 2025, the economic environment is expected to favor fintech companies. This can boost market liquidity and growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s examine three smartest fintech stocks to buy with $5,000 right now. Each stand poised to deliver substantial returns, revenue and earnings hikes for both short- and long-term investors. Don’t miss out on these great opportunities.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is widely regarded as one of the smartest fintech stocks in which to invest due to its continuous innovation and strategic initiatives.\n\nRecently, Visa relaunched its SavingsEdge program, which offers enhanced value to small businesses in the U.S. and Canada. It includes features like Instant Coupons and Cashback Offers, allowing proprietors to save on essential purchases.\n\nAnother significant development for Visa is its achievement of issuing the 10 billionth token. The move generated $40 billion in incremental e-commerce revenue globally. Visa’s tokenization technology enhances security across digital payments by replacing sensitive personal data with cryptographic keys. This technology has not only improved transaction approval rates but also significantly reduced fraud. It saved the company $650 million in the past year alone.\n\nThus, Visa is in a great position to continue to offer value to SMBs as well as cut down on the rampant rates of fraud seen worldwide.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) remains a leading player due to its innovative approaches and strategic initiatives aimed at enhancing user experience and driving growth.\n\nRecently, PayPal introduced several new features, including Fastlane. This one-click guest checkout experience significantly accelerates transaction times for merchants and consumers. Additionally, the company unveiled PayPal Smart Receipts. It leverages artificial intelligence (AI) to offer personalized recommendations and cashback rewards.\n\nStory continues\n\nWith a robust two-sided platform connecting 428 million active accounts, PayPal maintains a competitive edge in the fintech industry. Its vast user base and extensive transaction data enhance its ability to prevent fraud and improve authorization rates.\n\nAdditionally, PYPL manages to maintain its significant first-mover advantage in the industry despite the plethora of new entrants into the market. It also continues to innovate to maintain this edge, which forms a powerful moat around the business.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nAffirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) is gaining attention as a smart fintech stock due to its recent strategic moves and partnerships.\n\nOne significant development is Affirm’s collaboration with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Affirm’s “buy now, pay later” (BNPL) service will be integrated into Apple Pay later this year. This partnership allows Apple Pay users in the U.S. to apply for Affirm BNPL loans during checkout, which could be a boon for the company.\n\nAlso, Affirm has seen positive momentum from financial analysts. Recently, Goldman Sachs initiated coverage of Affirm with a strong buy rating, highlighting it as a leading provider in the BNPL sector. This follows a similar strong buy rating from Mizuho.\n\nAFRM’s robust growth is further supported by its recent quarterly earnings report. It exceeded analysts’ expectations, demonstrating strong revenue growth of 51.2% year-over-year​ (YOY) last quarter.\n\nAll of these factors together means that AFRM is one of my strong picks as part of the smartest fintech stocks to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Matthew Farley did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "June jobs report ushers in new quarter during holiday-shortened trading week: What to know this week",
        "content": "A crucial week of labor market data will greet investors during a holiday-shortened trading week that begins the month of July, the third quarter, and second half of 2024.\n\nThe S&P 500 (^GSPC) enters Q3 up 14.5% so far this year, while the Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) rallied more than 18%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) gained a more modest 3.8% in the first six months of the year.\n\nWith stocks sitting near record highs and recent inflation trends proving more positive, all eyes have turned to the labor market for signs of weakness as the Fed maintains its restrictive interest rate stance.\n\nThe June Jobs report will provide a robust look at the labor market on Friday, while updates on private payrolls and job openings will also be in focus throughout the week. Updates on activity in the manufacturing and services sectors will also be scattered throughout the schedule.\n\nConstellation Brands (STZ) is expected to be the focus of the lone notable corporate earnings report during an otherwise quiet week before big banks officially kick off second quarter earnings season the following week.\n\nMarkets in the US will close early on July 3 (1 p.m. ET) and will remain closed on July 4 for Independence Day.\n\nA look at the labor market\n\nThe June Jobs report is due for release on Friday morning and is expected to show further cooling in the job market.\n\nThe report is expected to show that 188,000 nonfarm payroll jobs were added to the US economy last month, with unemployment holding steady at 4%, according to data from Bloomberg. In May, the US economy added 272,000 jobs while the unemployment rate ticked up slightly to 4%.\n\nBank of America US economist Michael Gapen reasoned a report along these lines would continue to show a labor market that is \"cooling but not cool.\"\n\nOn Friday, the latest reading of the Fed's preferred inflation gauge showed inflation eased in May as prices increased at their slowest pace since March 2021.\n\nThe print was viewed as a step in the right direction for the Federal Reserve's fight against inflation.\n\nPositive trends in inflation, combined with signs of slowing in economic activity, have economists arguing the Fed should be leaning toward cutting interest rates sooner rather than later.\n\n\"Emerging signs of softness in the labor market show [Fed] officials also need to be attentive to risks to the full employment side of their mandate,\" Oxford Economics deputy chief US economist Michael Pearce wrote in a note to clients. Construction workers work on a new building partly covered with a large US flag on Sept. 25, 2013, in Los Angeles. (FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP via Getty Images) (FREDERIC J. BROWN via Getty Images)\n\nHalftime report\n\nJust like 2023, most of 2024's stock market rally has been driven by a few large tech stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nMidway through the year, more than two thirds of the S&P 500's gains for the year have come from Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO). Nvidia alone has driven nearly one-third of these gains.\n\nDespite some short-lived rallies throughout the year, just two sectors have outperformed the S&P 500 this year: Communications Services and Information Technology. Both are up more than 18% compared to the S&P 500's roughly 15% gain.\n\nThis has kept the debate going over whether the second half of the year will bring a broadening of the stock market rally, a hot-button issue on Wall Street.\n\nMorgan Stanley's chief investment officer Mike Wilson recently argued in a research note that given weakening economic data and high interest rates, a true broadening in which sectors unrelated to tech pick up the slack is unlikely to happen.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nMore megacap exceptionalism\n\nMost strategists have reasoned that megacap tech companies have led the rally for good reason, given their earnings continue to outperform the market. That's expected to be the case during second quarter earnings as well.\n\nNvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, and Meta are expected to grow earnings by a combined 31.7% in the second quarter, per UBS Investment Bank US equity strategist Jonathan Golub.\n\nThe S&P 500 itself is expected to grow earnings by a more modest 7.8%.\n\nThis means that the lion's share of earnings growth is once again expected to come from Big Tech. And a similar trend has been seen in earnings revisions for the second quarter.\n\nSince March 31, Golub's work shows earnings estimates for the S&P 500 have fallen just 0.1%, far less than the typical 3.3% drop seen on average. This is due in large part to a 3.9% revision upward for the aforementioned six biggest tech companies.\n\nEntering the second half of the year, the debate over whether these Big Tech companies' consistent earnings beats will fall off will remain at center stage.\n\nWeekly Calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: S&P Global US manufacturing, June final (51.7 expected, 51.7 prior); Construction spending, month-over-month, May (0.3% expected, -0.1% prior); ISM Manufacturing, June (49.2 expected, 48.7 prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: Job openings, May (7.86 million expected, 8.06 million prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: MBA Mortgage Applications, week ended June 28 (0.8%); ADP private payrolls, June (+158,000 expected, +152,000 prior); S&P global US Services PMI, June final (52.3 expected, 55.1 prior), S&P Global US composite PMI, June final (54.6 prior); ISM services index, June (52.5 expected, 53.8 prior); ISM services prices paid, June (58.1); Factory orders, May (0.3% expected, 0.7% prior); Durable goods orders, May final (0.1%)\n\nEarnings: Constellation Brands (STZ)\n\nThursday\n\nMarkets are closed for the July Fourth holiday.\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic calendar: Nonfarm payrolls, June (+188,000 expected, +272,000 prior); Unemployment rate, June (4% expected, 4% previously); Average hourly earnings, month-over-month, June (+0.3% expected, +0.4% prior); Average hourly earnings, year-over-year, June (+3.9% expected, +4.1% prior); Average weekly hours worked, June (34.3 expected, 34.3 prior); Labor force participation rate, June (62.6% expected, 62.5% prior)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Prediction: Apple Will Be the World's First $4 Trillion Company",
        "content": "There is quite a race going on in terms of market cap. Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Nvidia are battling to find out which company is the largest in the world. Although the lead can change daily, Microsoft currently holds it by about $100 billion over Apple. While that's a massive figure, if Apple's market share increases by $100 billion in a single day, that actually equates to a 3.1% rise in its stock price, which is hard to grasp.\n\nWhile the $3 trillion threshold was breached not long ago, the $4 trillion threshold isn't that far away. Which of these three will gain that crown first? My guess is Apple.\n\nApple Intelligence is the catalyst behind a potential rise\n\nI'm no fan of Apple stock. At its current state, it's barely growing, expensive, and without an artificial intelligence (AI) strategy, making it an undesirable stock (in my eyes). But what Tim Cook and his team announced at the WWDC 2024 conference changed my opinion (for now).\n\nApple finally launched its Apple Intelligence product, its take on generative AI. Although it's about 12 months late to the game, I suppose better late than never. However, the reason Apple may have waited is why I am so impressed with in the announcement: Apple Intelligence will work only on iPhone 15 models and newer. This means only the current generation of phones can run it.\n\nWhether it's a hardware limitation or another way for Apple to kick-start growth in a struggling product line doesn't matter. Although there are no official numbers, it's estimated that around 90% of the current iPhone base doesn't have the newest model. So if Apple Intelligence becomes a must-have technology, it will ignite a new upgrade cycle.\n\nAnd iPhones aren't the only affected products. iPads and Mac computers must have the M1 chip to deploy Apple Intelligence, so this catalyst could spread beyond smartphones.\n\nThis combines for a stock that could reach $4 trillion if the masses deem the product a must-have.\n\nApple's sales have been slightly declining recently\n\nWhile estimates vary, a conservative guess on the number of iPhones deployed worldwide is around 1.3 billion to 1.5 billion. Should 10% of the user base speed up their upgrade cycle in addition to the current sales Apple is experiencing now, that would add an additional $117 billion in revenue to Apple's top line if the average cost of an iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Max is used ($900).\n\nApple's iPhone sales totaled $199 billion over the past year. So if this boost is combined with regular sales, Apple's iPhone sales could explode by over 50%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen you attach that growth to Apple's overall revenue, it would be about 31% higher. AAPL Revenue (TTM) Chart\n\nBecause Apple already has the infrastructure in place to build and market iPhones, increased sales would likely improve Apple's margins. But for argument's sake, let's say they stay the same.\n\nSo if Apple's stock price increased by 31% in tandem with the proposed revenue growth, its market cap would be $4.18 trillion. Because Apple Intelligence won't be released until the fall, it likely won't be until the holiday quarter that Apple sees a sizable revenue boost.\n\nSo the question becomes, could Microsoft or Nvidia rise that much between now and then? I don't see it happening for Microsoft. Although it's a dominant company, it's expensively valued and will continue to deliver solid results. It will eventually get to $4 trillion, but I don't see it happening until mid-2025.\n\nNvidia is the true wild card, as the strength the company and stock have shown is nothing short of incredible. We'll see what happens over the next few quarters with Nvidia, but investors may want to see results before bidding up the stock any further.\n\nApple is in a great position to take the crown of the first $4 trillion company with its latest announcement surrounding Apple Intelligence. If generative AI affects consumers as much as it has affected businesses, this feature will likely become a hit for Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Why Nvidia stock is now in treacherous waters: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe weight of high expectations is often a heavy burden to carry.\n\nIn life, if you are a top performer at work, it's expected that you will show up to be a top performer every single day. Having a bad day? That's not allowed, so go sling that crap somewhere else.\n\nSure, some college professor who gave an inspiring leadership speech at a TED Talk 10 years ago and is now appearing in one-minute clips on your Instagram feed might suggest it's OK to have bad days at work, even if you are a winner.\n\nTrust me, it's not — and don't let that social clip allow you to think otherwise.\n\nThis same philosophy could be applied to the stock market's most important stock: Nvidia (NVDA).\n\nI know you like that transition, Morning Brief readers! Hear me out on this top performer in the market.\n\nOver the past week, we were reminded of how inflated expectations are for Nvidia and how the stock has entered dangerous waters that many traders who arrived late to the Nvidia game have never navigated before.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia's market cap hit a staggering $3.34 trillion, eclipsing Microsoft (MSFT) to become the world's most valuable company. Over the next three trading days, on seemingly no fundamental news, the company shed $430 billion in market cap.\n\nFor perspective, Coca-Cola's (KO) market cap is $275 billion.\n\nSome folks I talked with told me people were taking profits on Nvidia going into the start of the second half of the year. Others I talked to for my \"Opening Bid\" podcast told me there is some chatter about new competitors entering Nvidia's turf, and maybe the company won't be as absurdly dominant over the next five years as many anticipate.\n\nAll of that is fair, but it reinforces the view that the stock is prone to sharp, out-of-the-blue negative shifts in sentiment because it's up 3,000% in five years.\n\nBut if you drill down further, you can see just how intense the expectations on Nvidia have become.\n\nNvidia's stock now trades at about 21x (super steep) forward sales, up from 12x (also steep) two months ago, according to research from Creative Planning chief market strategist Charlie Bilello. This is a significant premium over Microsoft at 12x and Apple (AAPL) at 8x, two tech titans that are performing very well fundamentally and are likely to continue rocking years ahead.  Nvidia's stock recently traded about 100% above its 200-day moving average, BTIG chief market technician Jonathan Krinsky pointed out. Since 1990, the widest spread that any US company has ever traded above its 200-day moving average while it was the largest company in the world was 80% by Cisco (CSCO) in March 2000, which marked its all-time high. \"In other words, Nvidia is in a league of its own,\" Krinsky said.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt sure seems that way.\n\nSimilar expectations were applied to chipmaker Micron (MU) going into earnings this week. The stock got blasted due to \"in-line\" guidance that didn't meet crazy expectations for anything tied to AI demand.\n\nAnd I emphasize crazy: On Monday, several sell-side analysts jacked up their estimates and price targets on Micron ahead of the report. As someone who used to manage a team of stock researchers, I can tell you that this action heading into an earnings report is not the norm. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, on June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIt reeked of analysts buying into the hype too much and hoping for a giant one-day pop in the stock.\n\n\"When you get a reaction like Micron's, where the numbers should be good enough to avoid a sell-off, let alone spur a rally, that’s a bad sign — a tell that expectations are so high that they can't be exceeded,\" Interactive Brokers chief strategist Steve Sosnick told me.\n\nOthers don't agree with my assessment that Nvidia is priced for perfection, and that is totally fine. I don't have a monopoly on good ideas!\n\n\"But for medium- to longer-term investors, the story still holds when we look at how far out their capacity is booked and pricing is firming,\" Tematica Research co-founder and chief investment officer Chris Versace said.\n\nOne thing we can all agree on: Nvidia is a top-performing employee in the market, and it will get no pass for trying to take a day off if it catches a cold.\n\nSpeaking of expensive tech stocks, shares of Amazon (AMZN) are up 55% in the past year. Questions linger about its culture, however.

        "title": "Halfway Into 2024: 2 Underperforming \"Magnificent Seven\" Stocks to Buy Before They Take Off",
        "content": "The \"Magnificent Seven\" represent some of the strongest businesses around. However, a few members of this elite group have failed to live up to expectations in the first half of 2024.\n\nSince the beginning of the year, the widely followed S&P 500 index has climbed 14.8% through June 26, but weak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares, which are up 11.6%. Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) has been the worst performer, with a recent dip in sales from its electric cars sending the stock down 21%.\n\nSometimes, betting on strong companies when they are experiencing temporary weakness can pay off over the long run. Indeed, both companies have promising growth opportunities unfolding in artificial intelligence (AI), which could have a huge impact on shareholder returns over the next decade.\n\nHere's why these stocks are ready to take off.\n\n1. Apple\n\nWeak iPhone sales have weighed on Apple stock year to date, but since the company's last earnings report in early May, the stock is outperforming the S&P 500, with the shares up 21%. The stock got a significant bounce following the company's Worldwide Developers Conference in June, where Apple unveiled highly anticipated artificial intelligence (AI)-powered features coming to iOS 18 later this year.\n\nApple Intelligence will be the biggest update to Apple's operating system in years. The AI features in this update will allow users to summarize long texts, create images, and receive personalized search assistance from Siri, just to name a few highlights.\n\nOf course, Apple has a profitable business angle here. While iOS 18 will be free to download like previous updates, the AI features will require devices with more recent processors, such as the A17 Pro chip found on the iPhone. iOS 18 will be a huge incentive for users with older devices to upgrade, and that could lead to record iPhone revenue during the holiday quarter.\n\nBeyond iOS 18, iPhone 16 is also expected to come in a new larger size of 6.9 inches for the Pro Max version, which could be enough to drive strong demand on its own. It's all setting up for a stretch of improving revenue growth over the next year.\n\nWall Street analysts are increasingly bullish. The current consensus is that Apple's sales will grow just 3% in fiscal 2025, but Evercore ISI recently raised its growth forecast from 4% to 7% and even sees a scenario where Apple could report double-digit top-line growth next year.\n\nMore analysts may raise their growth estimates as the launch of iOS 18 draws closer, which could send the stock even higher in the second half of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, the push into AI software could also benefit Apple's higher-margin services business (e.g., app sales) and drive above-average earnings growth. For these reasons, Apple is likely heading into a stretch of accelerating growth that could launch the stock higher over the next few years.\n\n2. Tesla\n\nTesla shares have been slashed in half from their all-time high. A few reasons are to blame, including weak car demand amid rising interest rates and the uncertainty around the recent shareholder vote to reinstate CEO Elon Musk's 2018 performance award.\n\nWith shareholders recently voting to reinstate Musk's $56 billion pay package, it removes a major cloud over the stock since some investors were concerned that Musk might eventually leave Tesla if the vote didn't pass. However, the stock has moved higher since the vote as investors turn their attention back to Tesla's growth opportunities.\n\nTesla plans to unveil Cybercab in August, which opens up a massive market for the company. Analysts expect most of Tesla's revenue to come from the robotaxi market over the long term, which is significant, given that the company's $626 billion market cap is mostly based on its revenue from electric cars that generate more than 80% of the company's revenue right now. However, RBC Capital sees 52% of Tesla's valuation will ultimately be driven by robotaxis, 27% by full-self-driving car software, 15% by Megapack batteries, and only 6% by electric cars.\n\nMusk compared Tesla's robotaxi business strategy to those of services like Airbnb and Uber. Tesla will operate some of the robotaxi fleet itself, while a certain number of customers can choose to contribute their own cars to the service. Tesla aims to one day have tens of millions of cars in its fleet worldwide. It would lead to a new high-margin revenue stream in service fees flowing back to Tesla.\n\nThe robotaxi opportunity reflects Tesla's growing capabilities in AI. It has about 35,000 Nvidia H100 graphics processing units (GPUs) currently used for AI training, but it plans to have more than twice that number by the end of 2024. These are not cheap, with each H100 selling for thousands of dollars. Tesla's capital expenditures have quadrupled over the last four years to $9 billion and will continue to grow.\n\nIf Tesla is successful in expanding its robotaxi service over the next decade, it could have a huge impact on the company's profitability and, therefore, lead to a higher valuation for Tesla stock. Given the company's history of proving critics wrong, it's worth keeping some shares of this Magnificent Seven stock among your stock holdings for a rainy day.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will take a look at the U.S. State with the Fastest-Growing Economy. We have also compiled a full free list of the 20 U.S. States with the Fastest-Growing Economies.\n\nNavigating Global Economic Challenges Post-COVID-19: Insights and Trends\n\nPost the COVID-19 pandemic, the global economy is currently in a recovery phase after the unprecedented declines that incurred between 2019 and 2022. However, this recovery is not as smooth as one would have hoped for. Factors like geopolitical tensions, supply chain disruptions, high inflation, and tightened monetary conditions have been slowing down the recovery process. One of the biggest problems that the world is battling with currently is inflation. However, a few recent developments hint towards a brighter future with headline inflation levels declining to prepandemic levels in some economies. By the end of 2023, global inflation fell to around 2.3% which was a significant decrease from the peak of 9.5% witnessed in the second quarter of 2022. But this progress is limited to a few developed economies like the U.S., China, and Germany. These are the most powerful countries in the world by economy, with GDP levels of $28.8 trillion, $18.5 trillion, and $4.6 trillion, respectively, as of 2024 - we have discussed them in detail in 20 Most Powerful Countries in the World by Economy.\n\nOne of the countries that have led this post pandemic recovery is the United States. The country has been capable of preserving its status as the leading global economy. According to the IMF, the GDP of the US was $26.95 trillion in 2023. The value for real gross domestic product (GDP) increased at an annual rate of 1.3 percent in the first quarter of 2024, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The United States is expected to continue climbing at this trajectory as the country is projected to have a real GDP of $32 trillion by the year 2040. For developing countries, however, it is a completely different story. These economies have been recovering but the recovery is quite slow, with inflation in the last quarter of 2023 standing at 9.9%. You can refer to 25 Countries with Developing Economies but Slow Growth Rates, to read about some of these economies in depth. Saudi Arabia and Poland are two of such economies with slowest growth rates amongst the developing economies with GDP levels of $1.07 trillion and $842.2 billion, as of 2023.\n\nWhile these macroeconomic trends provide us with a broader picture of the economy, the role of major corporations and industry giants in the rebuilding of the economy cannot be overlooked. Among other factors, businesses across major economic regions are driving the growth globally. Companies such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) are two of the most valuable companies in the US. With a market capitalization of $3.311 trillion, as of 13th June 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the biggest player in the technology sector. As of 2024, Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) installed base of active devices has exceeded 2.2 billion globally. Apple reported its financial results for the first quarter of 2024 on February 1, 2024. The revenue came in at $119.58 billion, surpassing estimates by $1.31 billion while earnings per share of $2.18 beat the consensus estimates by $0.08 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is another leading global technology firm with a market capitalization of $3.283 trillion, as of 13th June 2024. According to the quarterly financial reports released on January 30, 2024 for the second quarter of 2024, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported earnings per share of $2.93, surpassing estimates by $0.16. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) revenue was $62.02 billion for Q2 2024, ahead of market consensus by $888.19 million. The U.S. State with the Fastest-Growing Economy\n\nAn investment banker monitoring the performance of the Brazilian stock index, emphasizing the importance of the company in the economy.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor the purpose of this ranking, we acquired data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis on the real GDP for each US state. From the values of the latest year, 2023 and the base year, 2022, percentage change in real GDP was calculated. The states were then arranged in descending order based on their GDP growth rates and the state with the highest percentage change in GDP was picked.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

North Dakota\n\nPercentage Change in GDP: 5.87%\n\nReal GDP 2023: $58,015 million\n\nReal GDP 2022: $54,799 million\n\nWith a percentage change in GDP of 5.87% over the period 2022-23, North Dakota is the U.S. state with the fastest-growing economy.\n\nNorth Dakota has been enjoying a robust economy, characterized by a flourishing energy development sector, in addition to strong agriculture, real estate, and government sectors. North Dakota experienced the highest growth in real GDP among all 50 states in the first quarter of 2023, surging by 12.4%, according to North Dakota Governor’s Office.

        "title": "Buffett’s Next Big Buy? 3 Value Stocks Warren Could Scoop Up Soon",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is widely known as one of the best value investors of all time. However, there is more that goes on in his thought process than just value. In his 2023 shareholder letter, he quoted Charlie Munger’s advice to him in 1965:\n\n“Warren, forget about ever buying another company like Berkshire. But now that you control Berkshire, add to it wonderful businesses purchased at fair prices and give up buying fair businesses at wonderful prices. In other words, abandon everything you learned from your hero, Ben Graham. It works but only when practiced at small scale.”\n\nIndeed, most of his holdings are actually in quality companies that are meant to compound over the long-run, like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). That said, Buffett is flexible with is picks, having recently trimmed many of his premium holdings in the past few quarters. I believe he could rotate a lot of this cash into some value stocks, as he has done so many times in the past. Here are three that could fit the bill for investors like Warren Buffett seeking out value stocks with strong growth prospects.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFedEx Corporation (FDX) A FedEx employee loads a FedEx Express truck in Manhattan.\n\nSource: Antonio Gravante / Shutterstock.com\n\nFedEx (NYSE:FDX) is a company that doesn’t really need an introduction. The firm’s latest earnings report shows signs of stabilization and efficiency gains, even as macroeconomic headwinds persist.\n\nNotably, FedEx delivered $5.41 of adjusted earnings per share in Q4, beating consensus estimates by 4 cents. Full-year adjusted earnings per share also came in at the higher end of initial guidance, growing an impressive 19% year-over-year. These results were notable, as they came despite revenue falling short of original expectations. I’m encouraged by the management’s ability to expand margins through its DRIVE program, which achieved its $1.8 billion cost reduction target.\n\nWhat’s more, FedEx is generating robust free cash flows while reducing capital intensity ahead of schedule. This allowed the company to return $3.8 billion to shareholders in 2024. With the stock trading at just 0.8-times sales and a reasonable price-earnings ratio relative to its projected earnings growth, it’s also quite cheap.\n\nBuffett does not have a history with FedEx. I find that surprising, considering how relevant and solid this business is. “I believe Warren Buffett will acquire Federal Express [in 2020],” Doug Kass, president of the hedge fund firm Seabreeze Partners Capital Management and a longtime Buffett watcher, said a few years ago. That hasn’t happened, but it certainly could in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nTC Energy (TRP) Pipelines in the desert\n\nSource: bht2000 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTC Energy (NYSE:TRP) operates a vast network of natural gas and liquids pipelines across North America. The company’s Q1 results impressed, with TC Energy reporting record earnings and 11% EBITDA growth. The company is making solid progress on its secured capital program. It placed about $1 billion of projects into service so far in 2024, largely on budget.\n\nTC Energy has also executed on its $3 billion asset divestiture program, with the recent $1.1 billion sale of PNGTS among the most notable in this regard. The proposed spinoff of South Bow is also moving forward as planned. While TRP stock has dipped lately, I believe it’s nearing a bottom, and offers a tempting 7.3% dividend yield for those patient enough to wait for a turnaround.\n\nConsidering Warren Buffett’s affinity with pipeline stocks and his hints at pursuing Canadian opportunities, TC Energy could be a prime target for the Oracle of Omaha. The company’s robust margins make it a classic Buffett-style investment.

While Q2 was a strong quarter with earnings of CAD$3.8 billion and EPS of CAD$2.04, I have some concerns. Management acknowledged serious anti-money laundering deficiencies in the U.S. that allowed criminals to exploit the bank. This is a major red flag.\n\nNow, TD is investing CAD$500 million to overhaul its AML program, but the damage to its reputation could linger. Regardless, it is very safe, despite the low leverage ratio. The lender’s Tier 1 and Total Capital ratios, which are considered more comprehensive measures of a bank’s financial strength, are significantly better than the industry median. TD bank operating data\n\nClick to Enlarge\n\nSource: Chart courtesy of GuruFocus.com\n\nThe stock’s 34% decline from its peak could present a compelling entry point for value investors like Warren Buffett. He loves well-established banks almost as much as oil stocks. His $5 billion Goldman Sachs investment in 2008 was a master stroke in this regard. With Buffett eyeing Canadian assets, TD’s depressed valuation might entice him.\n\nThe bank’s strong earnings demonstrate the resilience of its diversified business model amidst challenges. And a 5.4% dividend yield sweetens the deal for income-seekers. While TD’s money-laundering issues give me pause, I believe the recent sell-off in this top Canadian bank is likely overdone.\n\nOn the date of publication, Omor Ibne Ehsan did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Reasons to Buy and Hold Apple Stock Forever",
        "content": "Tech giant Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been around a while and has delivered market-crushing returns over its long and storied history. However, some investors and analysts now feel it's no longer worth investing in the iPhone maker. The market cap now tops $3 trillion, which limits its upside potential, especially since Apple's biggest moneymaker -- the iPhone -- no longer generates the kind of year-over-year growth in sales that it once did.\n\nWhile these are fair concerns, there remain solid reasons to buy Apple's shares and hold onto them for good. Let's consider three such reasons.\n\n1. Apple's culture of innovation\n\nHow does a company remain relevant for decades? It's generally not enough to offer necessary products or services. Even in industries such as healthcare, corporations need to innovate constantly to avoid becoming dinosaurs. That's also true -- and arguably more so -- in the tech industry where Apple operates. The company has stayed relevant and thriving for as long as it has largely because it's created a culture centered around innovation.\n\nApple doesn't need to be first to market. It expertly takes existing products and adds its own spin to them. That's what it did with the iPhone and many other technologies. More recently, the company finally announced its artificial intelligence (AI) plans: It will add various AI functionalities to eligible devices (including the iPhone 15 Pro and beyond). While some observers worried that Apple was getting behind in the AI race, the company has made a meaningful move.\n\nNo doubt there will be more to come. Beyond AI, Apple pours plenty of money into research and development (R&D) to avoid becoming a dinosaur -- and, in fact, to remain highly relevant for a long time, just as it has throughout its history. That's an excellent reason to consider the stock.\n\n2. An incredibly deep ecosystem\n\nApple's success has paid off in many ways, one of which is that it now boasts a deep ecosystem of devices and customers who use at least one of them; more than 2 billion Apple devices are in circulation. It's difficult to overstate the value of this base of customers.\n\nThe company knows it, too -- that's why it's ramping up its services segment, through which it offers a variety of services including Apple Music and Apple TV. Apple has more than 1 billion active paid subscriptions.\n\nHere's another perk of Apple's strategy to increasingly rely on services: While making and selling hardware is a relatively low-margin business, the opposite is true for the services it offers to its vast base of customers. So, over time, there's a good chance that gross and profit margins will improve. That's great for the business.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt's true that the services unit still doesn't provide a substantial portion of its top line. In the second quarter of its fiscal year 2024 (which ended March 30), Apple's services revenue came in at $23.9 billion, about 14% higher than the year-ago period.\n\nApple's total sales of $90.8 billion dropped by about 4% year over year, so services accounted for only roughly 26% of total sales. But that number has generally grown over the years -- it was just 10% in the third quarter of 2015. This trend bodes well for Apple's long-term prospects.\n\n3. Apple's competitive advantages\n\nThough Apple benefits from a deep ecosystem, can it keep most of its customers? Thanks to its competitive advantages, it should be able to do so. Apple's business benefits from the network effect, switching costs, and a strong brand name, all of which are important sources of a competitive edge.\n\nApple's network effect can be seen in its App Store: The more people use it, the more valuable it becomes to developers, and vice versa. That's the hallmark of the network effect: The value of services increases with use.\n\nApple's devices also have features that other smartphones or tablets don't have, making communication between Apple-centric devices extremely convenient. Leaving the ecosystem means leaving these behind, hence the switching costs.\n\nLastly, Apple routinely ranks as one of the most valuable brand names in the world. These features make it likely that its business remains solid despite stiff competition.\n\nBuy and forget\n\nLike every company, Apple faces headwinds; a decline in iPhone sales in China and antitrust lawsuits both come to mind. However, the company has more than enough going its way to appeal to investors, including an excellent dividend program. So, if you're interested, look past Apple's recent struggles and consider sticking with the company for good.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Costco: These Unstoppable Stocks Are Better Buys",
        "content": "Costco(NASDAQ: COST) has grown into an impressive retail stock, delivering growth of 221% over the last five years. That kind of growth is usually reserved for tech stocks and outperforms competitors Walmart and Target. Costco's wholesale business and annual membership have seen revenue soar 59% in the same period. Meanwhile, the company has massive growth potential as it continues to expand abroad.\n\nHowever, just because a company's business is flourishing doesn't necessarily mean now is the right time to buy its stock. While recent growth has benefited current Costco investors, it has also raised the price of entry for new ones and tanked the value of its stock. COST PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nThis chart uses two key valuation metrics to show that two fellow retailers, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), offer significantly more value to investors than Costco. Amazon and Apple's metrics don't exactly make their stocks bargains, but they provide more bang for your buck than Costco, making them worth considering over the warehouse retailer.\n\nSo, forget Costco and consider buying one of these unstoppable stocks instead.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon has grown into a behemoth in retail, responsible for 38% of the e-commerce market. For reference, Walmart holds the second-largest share of the market at just 6%. Amazon's reach is so vast that it dominates markets it never intended to. For instance, the online retailer is responsible for 44% of all video game purchases in the U.S., even surpassing GameStop and Apple's App Store.\n\nAmazon's success over the years has given it the financial resources to diversify its business. In addition to e-commerce, the company has become a major factor in cloud computing, artificial intelligence (AI), video streaming, and digital advertising. These markets are expanding quickly, allowing Amazon to lean less on product sales and more on digital ventures that offer higher profit margins.\n\nThe company's cloud platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS), has quickly become its most profitable division and grants it a promising role in AI. Businesses are increasingly turning to cloud services to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, AWS is the world's biggest cloud platform.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, AWS reported revenue growth of 17% year over year, while operating income nearly doubled to surpass $9 billion (or 60% of Amazon's total operating income).\n\nOver the last year, Amazon's business has exploded, leading its free cash flow to soar more than 1,000%. The company is on a growth trajectory that is too good to pass up, with its stock a better buy than Costco this month.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Apple\n\nLike Costco and Amazon, Apple has built up immense brand loyalty with consumers over the years. The company leads the consumer tech market with the popularity of its products. Its dominance in the industry is most prevalent by its third-largest market share in the e-commerce industry, which it has achieved despite offering a significantly smaller product range than the industry's leaders (Amazon and Walmart).\n\nApple has faced headwinds over the last year as declines in product sales have concerned investors and seen its price trickle up just 12% in the last 12 months. The figure is less than half the S&P 500's 26% rise in the same period, though the tech giant has a reputation for often outperforming the index.\n\nHowever, a loyal user base and vast financial resources suggest that Apple will come back strong over the long term. The company hit $102 billion in free cash flow last year, more than rivals like Microsoft, Alphabet, or even Amazon. The figure indicates Apple has the funds to keep investing in its business and overcome current headwinds.\n\nIn 2024, the tech giant has expanded into two burgeoning sectors: AI and virtual/augmented reality (VR/AR). These markets are projected to expand at compound annual growth rates of 37% and 27% through 2030, illustrating Apple's massive potential.\n\nAt the start of this year, the company launched its first VR/AR headset with the Vision Pro and is reportedly working on a cheaper version that will be more accessible to the average consumer. Meanwhile, the company is investing in AI, announcing Apple Intelligence earlier this month. The AI platform will bring generative features across its product lineup and could boost sales as consumers update devices to access Apple Intelligence.\n\nApple is a no-brainer for anyone looking for an alternative to Costco's stock and could deliver significant gains as it expands its product lineup in the coming years. And that's before considering promising positions in digital services and fintech, which could further drive earnings growth.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has experienced many struggles since its 1980 IPO. After its board fired Steve Jobs in 1985, the company spent years in the wilderness. It suspended its dividend payout in 1996, and was close to bankruptcy when it brought Jobs back in 1997.\n\nShortly after that, Apple stock began a run that made it one of the most successful stocks in history, illustrating how innovation can dramatically improve a company's fortunes.\n\nApple's stock growth since Jobs' return\n\nIf one had bought $1,000 in Apple stock when Jobs returned in February 1997 and held on until today, that position would be worth around $1.8 million. That figure assumes this hypothetical investor would have reinvested their income from the dividend, which Apple reinstated in 2012. AAPL Total Return Level Chart\n\nJobs' first major move after returning was to integrate the Mac ecosystem with the broader tech world, convincing Microsoft to invest $150 million in Apple and develop and support a Mac-compatible version of its popular Office software.\n\nHe also set to build an Apple ecosystem, revamping the Macintosh, launching the iMac in 1998, and following up with a new MacOS in 2001. The company gained additional traction by launching the iPod music player in 2001, and opening Apple Stores and the iTunes Store soon after.\n\nHowever, the innovation that truly transformed Apple was the iPhone, which it launched in 2007. It pioneered the modern smartphone industry, and eventually eliminated many people's need to own a PC. So successful was the iPhone that it drives the majority of Apple's revenue to this day.\n\nApple's pace of innovation slowed with the passing of Jobs in 2011. Now, it more directly competes with devices and apps using Alphabet's Android operating system and with most of its mega-tech competitors in the artificial intelligence field.\n\nNonetheless, its continued innovations have at times made it the world's largest company by market cap, and positioned it in the top three today. Thanks to products such as the iPhone and its extensive ecosystem, Apple's stock price should continue to grow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe second half of 2024 is here and rate cuts from the Federal Reserve remain elusive, with warnings about valuations and AI-led market hype growing louder. A number of notable Wall Street analysts have recently warned that the markets remains more concentrated than ever where just a few stocks account for most of the gains, thanks to their dominance in the AI industry. Many also believe the market is up for a correction as it has entered the overbought territory. Financial services company BTIG recently said in a report that the world’s fifth-largest exchange-traded fund by assets under management (AUM), QQQ Trust Series 1, now trades “well into” overbought territory based on its Relative Strength Index technical indicator.  QQQ tracks  the Nasdaq-100 Index and it’s not surprising to see the ETF showing signs of being overbought as more and more investors pile into mega-cap tech stocks in order to ride the AI bandwagon.\n\nFor this article we scanned the holdings of the Invesco QQQ Trust Series 1 ETF and picked top technology holdings of the fund with higher Relative Strength Index (RSI) values. Usually, an RSI value of 60 and above shows a stock is overbought. We have also mentioned the number of hedge fund investors with these stocks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) an Overbought AI Stock in 2024?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 14-day RSI is over 61, worse than 95.24% of 2921 companies in the Software industry.  Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the third-biggest holding of the QQQ ETF, which is also entering the overbought territory based on its RSI metric according to a latest note by BTIG.\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a report last month that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could benefit from the rise of AI PCs. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Top 10 Overbought AI Stocks in 2024. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s iPhone shipments in China rose 40% in May, off the previous month’s pace of growth despite heavy discounting by major retailers in the weeks leading up to the country’s June shopping festival.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBiden Struggles as He Spars With Trump on Economy: Debate Takeaways Biden’s Disastrous Debate Accelerates Doubts Over Candidacy Supreme Court Poised to Allow Emergency Abortions in Idaho Biden Struggles Against Trump in High-Stakes 2024 Debate SpaceX Tender Offer Said to Value Company at Record $210 Billion\n\nSmartphone shipments climbed more than 13% but foreign brands — of which Apple comprises the vast majority — grew almost four times faster, according to Bloomberg News calculations off official data. Foreign smartphones accounted for just over 5 million units of the total, the latest figures from the China Academy of Information and Communications Technology showed.\n\nIPhone shipments began bouncing back around March, and leapt more than 50% in April. That’s partly because Apple and its Chinese resellers have been cutting prices since the start of 2024, in deals extending into the pivotal June 18 shopping festival. Before that, Apple had endured double-digit declines in sales after losing market share to Huawei Technologies Co.\n\nThe Chinese company is closing in on a billion active consumer devices running its inhouse operating system, underscoring how the US-sanctioned firm is taking the battle to Apple in the premium segment.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe FBI’s Star Cooperator May Have Been Running New Scams All Along RTO Mandates Are Killing the Euphoric Work-Life Balance Some Moms Found Surging Returns Lure Private Equity Giants to India Japan’s Tiny Kei-Trucks Have a Cult Following in the US, and Some States Are Pushing Back How Glossier Turned a Viral Moment for ‘You’ Perfume Into a Lasting Business\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Simple Trading Strategies: 5 Rules for Buying Great Stocks",
        "content": "For the sophisticated investor, trading strategies involve technical analysis, exhaustive investment research and years of experience in the stock market. But there’s no reason that everyday investors just looking to plan for retirement or protect their 401(k) investments have to feel like second-class citizens on Wall Street. Investing money in mutual funds or stocks is a serious business, but that doesn’t mean it has to be overly complex.\n\nYes, online stock trading can be affected by a host of variables. And yes, all trading strategies need to adapt to the current stock market conditions. But by following these five simple rules for buying stocks, you can dramatically improve your chances of success. After all, simple trading strategies can sometimes be the most effective.\n\n1. Buy What You Know\n\nEach investor forms their own trading strategies and rules for buying stocks based on their personal goals and risk tolerance. And similarly, each investor buys and sells stocks and mutual funds based on what makes sense to them, right?\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNot necessarily. The problem is that many investors fall victim to the latest fads on social media and dubious advice on investment websites, and they’re eager to buy the stocks everyone else is talking about. This is how traders got taken for a ride by the dot-com bubble, as folks piled into stocks that hadn’t yet turned a profit and that had no realistic way to make money.\n\nRemember Flooz.com, which pitched a kind of online currency that would serve as an alternative to credit cards?\n\nIt sounds like a crazy concept, but the company raised somewhere between $35 million and $50 million from investors and enlisted a few retail giants such as Barnes & Noble to join in. But at its core, Flooz was a glorified gift card company with limited partners. Three years after going public, Flooz was bankrupt — which shouldn’t have surprised anyone who took a hard look at the company’s business model.\n\nOn the other side of the coin, take Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), a maker of semiconductors for electronics. Thanks largely to its revolutionary AI chip, Nvidia grew its revenue by 262% year over year in the first quarter of 2024. It also looks like the demand for AI chips will outpace supply for at least several months, so Nvidia is unlikely to drop anytime soon.\n\nNever underestimate the power of your personal experience. If you notice consumer trends or new products with big potential, chances are other folks will, too. This will help you anticipate investment trends and profit from them instead of chasing other people’s stock picks.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. Buy Stocks Great Investors Own\n\nOf course, there’s a pitfall to relying on personal tastes alone. It’s always valuable to have an outside perspective on your stocks to make sure you’re on the right track. And if you want a second opinion, why not go right to the top and pick the brains of the best traders on Wall Street?\n\nThere’s a reason Warren Buffett is a bit of a rock star to individual investors: His trading strategies and ways to invest money seem almost superhuman. Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) makes timely and very profitable investments.\n\nIn May, Berkshire Hathaway came out on top again in a powerful earnings report. Its operating profit grew 39% from the previous year, and it reached a record-high cash hoard. How can individual investors enjoy similar success? Simple: Buy what Buffett buys.\n\nWhile it may be impossible to reproduce Warren Buffett’s investment strategy — and it’s highly unlikely you’ll ever get the chance to pick his brain for stock tips, many of Buffett’s investments are public record. Berkshire Hathaway must report its holdings quarterly; investments in equity securities are a regular feature of BRK holdings. And any stock that sees an influx of cash from Warren Buffett and company has trouble keeping it a secret due to the insatiable appetite for all things Buffett.\n\nTake Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), one of Buffett’s longtime favorite stocks. Although he has occasionally sold off portions of his Apple holdings, Buffett has overall increased his shares over the past several years. By the end of 2017, Buffett held roughly 162.6 million shares in the company. By 2024, he held a staggering 905.6 million shares.\n\nAs for Apple’s stock performance? While there have been some peaks and valleys, its growth has generally trended upward. On June 17, 2024, it reached an all-time high closing price of $216.67.\n\nThere is, of course, a danger to groupthink — and even Warren Buffett gets it wrong sometimes. It’s worth noting that while Buffett may be America’s favorite investor, there are a host of others with investment strategies worth watching. George Soros and Peter Lynch have been highly successful, and any investor could learn something from them.\n\n3. Buy Stocks for the Future, Not the Past\n\nSifting through quarterly reports and past performance for a company can provide insight into the health of a prospective investment. But it’s important to realize that these numbers are lagging indicators. When you look for the best stocks to buy, you should put a premium on future growth trends over previous successes.\n\nConsider shifting demographics and evolving geopolitics, such as the fact that China became the top automobile sales market in the world in 2008. This was thanks to an emerging middle class in the People’s Republic and lagging consumer confidence in the United States during the recession.\n\nChina’s automotive industry is still the largest in the world, partially because the industry easily adapts to market trends; in recent years, China has been working on developing electric cars and cars with advanced safety systems.\n\nThat trend has led to rising stocks in the automotive sector. The most notable is BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), a Chinese manufacturer with a focus on electric cars. While it’s had a few dips along the way, BYD is largely a growth stock — and it doesn’t hurt that Warren Buffett is an investor, either.\n\nIf investors could tell the future, it would be easy to play the stock market. But there is no crystal ball that will provide answers as to which companies will see success and which ones won’t.\n\nStill, you can increase your chances of sizable returns by doing your research. Remember that the stock market doesn’t exist in a vacuum, and real-world events can (and often do) inspire drastic changes. Ultimately, if you want to invest wisely, your rules for buying stocks should include focusing on future trends more than past successes.\n\n4. Buy Stocks With Great Leadership\n\nThe success or failure of a company relies in large part on the leadership and vision of its top executives. Growth comes from the top, not from random successes at a smattering of stores that trickle upwards. When you buy a stock, you have to realize that you’re buying its management too.\n\nConsider the successes and failures of Apple over the last three decades. In the early 1990s, Apple was considered a second banana to Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Windows rolled out cheaply and on a massive scale as Apple clung to high profit margins and a controlling, proprietary outlook.\n\nOn July 9, 1997, after three years of poor stock performance and crippling financial losses, the Apple board of directors placed Steve Jobs at the helm as CEO and began restructuring the company’s product line.\n\nWhat followed over the next 10 years was a parade of Apple successes — the iMac, the iPod, iTunes, Apple retail stores and the iPhone. Apple took that popularity and ran with it, and its newfound success was almost entirely because of its new leadership. Steve Jobs may no longer be Apple’s leader, but his legacy has shaped the company’s C-suite and helped continue Apple’s success.\n\nSure, there are stocks that succeed because they manage to cut costs and boost margins. But such a strategy can not keep a stock healthy and growing for long. If you want to invest intelligently, make sure your simple trading strategies include investing in smart leadership with a proven record of success and a willingness to challenge industry norms to get ahead.\n\n5. Buy Stocks With a Clear Plan to Sell\n\nYou might think that the best plan when buying a stock is simply to sell it for a profit, but many investors run out and buy “great stocks” without a clear plan for what their investment goal is and when they want to sell.\n\nThis practice can be brutal on your portfolio. After all, what is a great stock? Footwear manufacturer Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) was a great stock to buy in early 2007 at $23 a share — but only if you sold by October of that same year when prices were pushing $70, locking in your 200% gain.\n\nIf you held on a little longer, things didn’t look as cheery: Crocs stock dropped to $10 around 2010. But if you decided to hold CROX until 2024, you would have been pleased. Currently, it trades for a much higher $154.74. Whether CROX was a great stock or not depends on your investing horizon and what you expected to get out of the stock.\n\nIf you don’t have a general sense of your investment timeline, you’ll be stuck in an endless loop of uncertainty. You might be afraid to sell at a peak because you want to see if the stock rises more — and then find out that you waited too long. At the opposite end of the spectrum, you might rush to sell the stock at a peak and then see it continue to grow after you sell.\n\nShort-term traders who get greedy and refuse to sell can be just as bad as buy-and-hold investors who panic and sell too quickly. Many traders who sold off their stock when the market crashed in March 2009 not only locked in historic low valuations for the equities they sold but missed out on one of the biggest rallies in the market’s history in mid-2009.\n\nWhatever your tactics — simple trading strategies or not — keep your goals clearly in mind before making any purchase. Set a reasonable price target or holding time for any asset, and use this investment strategy to color your decision. Simply knowing that a company is a great stock provides little consolation if you sell your shares too early or too late to make any money.\n\nOn the date of publication, Sarah Edwards did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to incorporate many artificial intelligence features into some of its products this fall. Specifically, the tech giant will provide AI-powered “writing assistance, image creation and editing” assistance, along with increased capabilities for Siri.  The updates will be limited to the “iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, as well as iPads and Macs with M1 or newer chips. ”\n\nI don’t expect the moves to trigger a huge hardware upgrade that will tremendously lift Apple’s top and bottom lines. But on the other hand, a significant number of consumers are going to start using Apple’s AI offerings and become used to doing so. Over the longer term, that phenomenon is likely going to have a meaningful, negative impact on companies that supply Apple’s competitors and on other major players in the PC sector.\n\nTo the extent that consumers eventually become used to accessing AI from their iPhones, even some players in the data center space could take a sizeable hit. Moreover, if consumers like Apple Intelligence, the market share of Apple hardware could increase meaningfully. Here are three stocks worried about Apple’s AI plans.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on an outdoor sign\n\nSource: Akshdeep Kaur Raked / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) gets “most” of its revenue from Android devices and benefited last quarter from strong sales of AI-capable Android devices. To the extent that Apple’s AI offerings attract Android users to switch to iPhones, Qualcomm stock is likely to take a significant hit going forward. As a result, I view it as one of the stocks worried about Apple’s AI plans.\n\nMoreover, Qualcomm is also trying to sell AI chips for PCs. As more consumers become accustomed to utilizing Apple’s Macs for their AI needs, the sales of AI PCs powered by Qualcomm could sink. That’s especially true because Qualcomm-powered AI PCs have gotten off to a rather negative start. Specifically, Samsung’s new Qualcomm-powered laptop recently had trouble running some popular software, such as the Fortnite video game. One reviewer claimed that older software, such as printers acquired during the Covid era and VPN, “will break” on Qualcomm-powered PCs.\n\nAnd in the shorter term, QCOM stock could also be hurt by a rotation out of the semicondictor space that’s currently under way. According to investment bank Argus, many large investors are moving out of chip makers and into sectors that have struggled during the current bull market.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG,GOOGL) Alphabet Inc. (GOOG, GOOGL) and Google logos seen displayed on smartphones. The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL), of course, generates the majority of its revenue from being the world’s dominant internet search engine.\n\nIn the fourth quarter of 2023, for example, $48 billion of Alphabet’s $86 billion of revenue was generated from the Google search engine.\n\nMeanwhile, the iPhone has a total user base of 1.46 billion, and many if not most of the world’s wealthiest consumers use iPhones. If even 10% of Apple’s user base gets accustomed to utilizing Apple’s partner, ChatGPT, to obtain information instead of the Google search engine or Alphabet’s AI engine, Alphabet’s top and bottom lines will likely take significant hits.\n\nThe extent to which Alphabet needs Apple users to rely on Google’s search engine is shown by the fact that Alphabet paid Apple $20 billion in 2022 in exchange for Apple making Google the default search engine on iPhones.\n\nEventually, Apple may incorporate Alphabet’s AI model, Gemini, into Apple Intelligence. But until that happens, GOOG stock will be at risk of taking a nasty hit if Google search volume declines sharply on iPhones.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf the popularity of Mac PCs and laptops significantly increases as a result of Apple’s launch of Apple Intelligence, the growth of Advanced Micro Devices’ (NASDAQ:AMD) top and bottom lines is likely to slow. That’s because AMD sells chips used in many PCs and laptops but does not provide chips for Apple’s Mac offerings.\n\nMoreover, if consumers become accustomed to using their iPhones to conduct many of their AI-powered activities, AMD’s revenue from selling AI chips to data centers could come in meaningfully below analysts’ average expectations. That’s because iPhones will use their own internal chips to utilize AI, rather than rely on data centers to do so.\n\nAnd in related news, Morgan Stanley on June 10 downgraded its rating on AMD stock to “equal weight” from “overweight.” The bank believes that expectations for AMD’s AI chips are “too high.” However, the bank kept a $176 price target on the shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "This Semiconductor Stock Has Jumped 48% in 2024, and Artificial Intelligence (AI) Could Help It Soar Further",
        "content": "Share prices of Cirrus Logic(NASDAQ: CRUS) have been in fine form so far in 2024, clocking gains of 48% as Wall Street turns bullish on the chipmaker's prospects. The market is excited about a turnaround in the smartphone market, its solid quarterly results, and a potential improvement in the fortunes of its largest customer -- Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAfter all, Cirrus is highly reliant on Apple for a major chunk of its top line. In the recently concluded fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 30), Apple accounted for a whopping 87% of Cirrus' revenue. Apple's share of Cirrus' top line has increased in recent years. Apple contracts accounted for 83% and 79% of its revenue in the preceding two fiscal years.\n\nWhile reliance on a single customer for so much business is not a good thing, a turnaround in Apple's fortunes related to its efforts in artificial intelligence (AI) could be a blessing in disguise for Cirrus Logic. Here's why.\n\nCirrus Logic's largest customer could help accelerate its growth\n\nCirrus Logic is known for supplying audio codecs, camera controllers, fast-charging chips, and haptics solutions to smartphone customers like Apple. It posted $372 million in revenue in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2024, which was flat on a year-over-year basis but crushed the Wall Street estimate of $317 million. The company's non-GAAP (adjusted) earnings shot up an impressive 35% year over year to $1.24 per share, and the figure was nearly double the $0.64 per share consensus estimate.\n\nAdditionally, Cirrus' forecast of $320 million in revenue in the current quarter at the midpoint of its guidance range added to investors' bullishness as it was better than the $302 million analyst estimate. The guidance points toward a small jump in the top line from the prior-year period's figure of $317 million.\n\nSo Cirrus' fortunes are closely tied to Apple. This explains why Cirrus' top-line growth wasn't solid last quarter. Apple's iPhone shipments, for instance, fell almost 10% year over year in the first quarter of calendar 2024, according to market research firm IDC. Sales of iPads and wearables also dropped. As a result, Apple's overall revenue was down 4% year over year in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (which ended on March 30).\n\nThe good news for Cirrus Logic is that Apple's iPhone sales are expected to pick up pace as the year progresses, thanks to the proliferation of AI. Market research firm Counterpoint Research estimates that the AI smartphone market could clock a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 65% through 2027.\n\nStory continues\n\nThough Apple doesn't have an AI-capable phone in its portfolio yet (unlike Samsung), the company recently announced a slew of AI-related features that are expected to make their way to the next iPhone, which will go on sale later this year. From allowing users to leverage AI to summarize text to creating original images to transcribing phone calls, Apple has unveiled multiple features that could help it jump onto the AI bandwagon.\n\nJPMorgan analyst Samik Chatterjee believes that the integration of AI-specific features in the 2024 iPhone models is likely to spur a solid upgrade cycle and help Apple sell more smartphones. More specifically, Chatterjee expects Apple to sell 244 million iPhone units in fiscal 2025, which would be a 10% increase from the estimated shipments in the current fiscal year. The momentum is expected to continue in fiscal 2026, with estimated shipments of 268 million units.\n\nMoreover, as the tech giant's Apple Intelligence platform is compatible only with the iPhone 15 Pro series and iPads and MacBooks powered by M1 chips, the company could witness the arrival of a solid device upgrade cycle. JPMorgan estimates that this new upgrade cycle will be equal to what Apple witnessed when 5G smartphones arrived, and it is worth noting that the tech specialist's growth took off at that time.\n\nAdditionally, Apple is expected to release MacBooks with AI-capable chips this year, which would allow the company to tap another potentially lucrative market. All this bodes well for Cirrus Logic and explains why analysts have been turning bullish about its prospects.\n\nImproving growth could lead to more stock upside\n\nCirrus Logic's revenue in fiscal 2024 was down almost 6% from the previous year to $1.79 billion. However, analysts are expecting it to report a small improvement in the current fiscal year, which is evident from the following chart. CRUS Revenue Estimates for Current Fiscal Year Chart\n\nAs the chart above indicates, analysts increased their revenue guidance for the next fiscal year and expect Cirrus to deliver stronger growth. The prospects of AI-enabled smartphones and PCs and Cirrus' relationship with a top player such as Apple in these markets should help it sustain healthy growth for a long time to come.\n\nThat's why investors would do well to buy Cirrus Logic stock while it is still cheap. This semiconductor stock trades at 26 times trailing earnings right now, a discount to the Nasdaq-100's trailing earnings multiple of 32 (using the index as a proxy for tech stocks). We saw that Cirrus' earnings accelerated nicely in the previous quarter, and the company could sustain that trend with Apple's help.\n\nAs such, there is a good chance that Cirrus may be able to add to the already impressive gains it clocked in 2024.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cirrus Logic right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cirrus Logic, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Cirrus Logic wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "In this article, we will reveal the most technologically advanced city in the US. If you wish to look at our detailed rankings, you can go to the 20 Most Technologically Advanced Cities in the US.\n\nThe United States is a leader in technological advancement, with trends such as Augmented Reality (AR), Artificial Intelligence (AI), and Blockchain gaining popularity. The tech industry is a cornerstone of the U.S. economy. It is valued at approximately $1.6 trillion and contributes over 10% to the country’s GDP as of 2024.\n\nThe tech industry is the second-largest industry in the U.S., with 56% of its market comprised of hardware, software, and services. As of 2019, the U.S. was home to 557,000 tech firms and 13,400 startups, which has driven the net tech employment rate to 7.9% of the total American workforce. The industry is projected to grow by 5% in 2024.\n\nThe growth of the tech industry is leading to many benefits for the workforce. In 2023, the median annual salary for a tech employee was $104,000, significantly higher than the median of $48,060 for other jobs. The demand for computer and information technology jobs is expected to rise significantly over the next decade.\n\nFrom 2022 to 2032, an estimated 377,500 positions in this field will become available each year. The roles experiencing the fastest growth include information security analysts, with a projected 32% increase, software developers, quality assurance analysts, and testers, anticipated to grow by 25%, and computer and information research scientists, expected to see a 23% rise.\n\nThe U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) forecasts a 3% increase in employment across all occupations in the U.S. from 2022 to 2032. However, the computer and information technology sector is predicted to grow at a much faster rate of 14%. Within this sector, information security analysts are projected to have 16,800 job openings annually over the next decade, while software developers and related roles are expected to record 153,900 annual job openings.\n\nAccording to PwC's 2023 global workforce survey, tech employees also report greater job satisfaction compared to workers in other fields. While 56% of the overall respondents expressed satisfaction with their jobs, the figure rose to 64% among those working in the tech industry.\n\nThe United States is home to some of the major tech giants such as Amazon, Apple, Google, and Meta, with a combined worth of over $4 trillion. In the first quarter of 2024, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) reported an earnings per share (EPS) of $1.53, higher than the estimates of $1.51. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has managed to beat the EPS estimates in the consecutive last 4 quarters.\n\nStory continues\n\nHere's what RiverPark Advisors said about Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned, and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.” The Most Technologically Advanced City in the US\n\nCopyright: melpomen / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo shortlist the 20 most technologically advanced cities in the US, we began by identifying cities with a population greater than 500,000. Then, we evaluated cities based on various metrics such as their technology infrastructure, including broadband access and smart city initiatives. Cities were assessed for the presence of innovation hubs, research institutions, and incubators/accelerators to gauge the innovation ecosystem. Furthermore, we also looked at the presence of tech companies, IT job openings, and tech events and conferences across cities.\n\nFor the purpose of ranking, we opted for a consensus-based approach. We assigned a score to each city based on the number of times it appeared across our credible sources, including CBRE, Business Insider, Digi International, and WeAreDevelopers. In the case of cities having the same score, tiebreaking was done on the basis of which city was outranking the other in our sources. The most technologically advanced cities in the US have been ranked in ascending order of their scores.\n\nThe Most Technologically Advanced City in the US\n\nSan Francisco, CA\n\nScore: 4\n\nSan Francisco, CA hosts influential companies such as Salesforce and Udemy, which have made significant global impacts. Silicon Valley, located approximately 40 miles south of the San Francisco Bay Area, is renowned as the epicenter of tech innovation, housing 38 Fortune 500 companies including Apple, Google, and Intel as of 2020.\n\nFor the 10th consecutive year, the San Francisco Bay Area maintains its leading position in CBRE's 2022 Scoring Tech Talent report as the top market for tech talent. The tech labor market in the San Francisco Bay Area is the largest, with 378,870 workers, reflecting a 13% rise since 2016. This region leads in tech talent employment as its tech industry employs two-thirds of the workforce, beating the 41% national average by a significant margin.\n\nDiscover which city secured the second spot.

        "content": "We are currently in an AI bull run. Stocks like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are up over 100% year-to-date. Companies like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are announcing new AI-enabled services. This truly historic event opens up new growth potential for investors looking for AI stocks.\n\nEvery day, new growth and value stocks are emerging, most of them relatively unknown. A key metric used to find these companies is analyst growth predictions. These include increasing EPS predictions and high price targets. It also includes financial analysis. This includes analyzing gross margins, cash flow, and other financial data in context with the company’s operations at the time. Another key factor is the analysis of growth catalysts. This range from the introduction of new products and services, to mergers, new deals, etc.\n\nAll this information allows us to decently estimate growth stocks, and the three companies discussed today fit this perfectly.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nServe Robotics (SERV) a robotic hand reaching out to a human hand against a black background, with the pointer fingers touching. robotics stocks to buy soon\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/sdecoret\n\nServe Robotics (NASDAQ:SERV) is a relatively new company engaged in the market for autonomous food delivery robots. Its products work primarily in dense, urban environments such as the Los Angeles metropolitan area. The stock spiked on June 21, rising 7.53%, but analysts predict growth multiple times that.\n\nSERV is currently still starting out; it has an operating margin of -814.55%. While it is currently making a loss, analysts are bullish about this company for a few key reasons. One such reason is that SERV has seen year-over-year quarterly revenue growth of 2,252%. It has also strong leadership changes, with new roles being created in order to fill the needs of a growing company. It also has industry-wide backing, with a combined 44.27% of outstanding shares being held by institutions or insiders. The company also enjoys the support of UberEats, Nvidia, and 7-11, among others.\n\nA wide corporate backing, great growth, and an analyst growth estimate of over 2000% make this stock an immediate buy.\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nBaidu (NASDAQ:BIDU), often known as the “Google of China,” is a Chinese tech company specializing in AI and internet services. It invests in AI technologies like autonomous driving, voice recognition, and cloud services through initiatives like Baidu Apollo and Baidu Brain. It also holds a significant position in China’s search engine market.\n\nBIDU stock is currently trading at $88.22 with a market cap of $31.1 billion. The company has seen steady revenue increase over the past four years, increasing by 25% from $107 billion in 2020 to $134.6 billion in 2023. The company has seen positive profit and operating margins of 14.77% and 17.40%, and has also consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past four quarters by a huge margin.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu has products in a number of industries, which proves it immune to an industry slump. Several financial institutions rated the company as “buy” and “positive.”. Strong financials, a diverse product base, and investor confidence make BIDU on of the strongest undiscovered AI stocks.\n\nUiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nUiPath (NYSE:PATH) provides an end-to-end automation platform with robotic process automation (RPA) solutions across the U.S., Romania, United Kingdom, Netherlands, and globally. It offers software to build, manage, run, engage, measure, and govern automation within organizations.\n\nPATH stock is currently trading at $12.22 with a market cap of $7 billion. PATH is down 48.66% year-to-date, and I expect this negative trend to reverse anytime. While PATH’s financials do raise some red flags, such as its negative profit and operating margin of -6.41% and -14.76%, the company is poised for growth in the future. Analysts have set an average price target of $16.00 for the stock, indicating a potential increase of 31.00% – suggesting the stock is underpriced.\n\nThe company issued its Fiscal Year 2024 Impact Report last week, resulting in an 8.91% increase in its stock. This report emphasizes the company’s advancements in environmental, social, and governance (ESG) initiatives and their impact across four key areas, boosting investor confidence. UiPath is well-placed to capitalize on the AI trend, making PATH stock one of the great undiscovered AI stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In the latest trading session, Apple (AAPL) closed at $214.10, marking a +0.4% move from the previous day. The stock exceeded the S&P 500, which registered a gain of 0.09% for the day. Elsewhere, the Dow gained 0.09%, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq added 0.3%.\n\nPrior to today's trading, shares of the maker of iPhones, iPads and other products had gained 12.07% over the past month. This has outpaced the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.18% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.38% in that time.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. The company is expected to report EPS of $1.33, up 5.56% from the prior-year quarter. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $83.46 billion, up 2.04% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the annual period, the Zacks Consensus Estimates anticipate earnings of $6.59 per share and a revenue of $385.99 billion, signifying shifts of +7.5% and +0.71%, respectively, from the last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. With this in mind, we can consider positive estimate revisions a sign of optimism about the company's business outlook.\n\nOur research demonstrates that these adjustments in estimates directly associate with imminent stock price performance. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, spanning from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), boasts an impressive track record of outperformance, audited externally, with #1 ranked stocks yielding an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.17% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. As of now, Apple holds a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nIn terms of valuation, Apple is presently being traded at a Forward P/E ratio of 32.38. For comparison, its industry has an average Forward P/E of 11.63, which means Apple is trading at a premium to the group.\n\nWe can additionally observe that AAPL currently boasts a PEG ratio of 2.59. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.23 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. At present, this industry carries a Zacks Industry Rank of 48, placing it within the top 20% of over 250 industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank evaluates the power of our distinct industry groups by determining the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks forming the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nYou can find more information on all of these metrics, and much more, on Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Nvidia stock may be getting all of the attention of late, but there are plenty of others outperforming the broader market. One is another member of the so-called Magnificent Seven tech stocks: Apple.\n\nAn investment of $1,000 in Apple in June 2014 would be worth over $10,460 at Tuesday’s closing price of about $209, according to calculations from Morningstar Direct. That’s cumulative growth of over 946%, and an annualized return of 26.46%. (Shares on Thursday were mostly flat, trading around $214 at 3 p.m. ET.)\n\nThat’s not quite the explosive growth Nvidia has experienced in recent months, but it still far outpaces the S&P 500 over the same time period. And if you were lucky enough to get in at AAPL’s inception at the end of 1980, that $1,000 investment would be worth over $2.1 million today, with an annualized return of 19.22%.\n\nView this interactive chart on Fortune.com\n\nApple is one of seven stocks—in addition to Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla—that drove the stock market to new heights in 2023 and into 2024. That said, it’s been one of the weaker performers of the group in recent months, with earnings rising just 1% in the latest quarter and sales declining.\n\n'Significant innovation'\n\nStill, Bank of America rates Apple a buy, writing in a research note published this week that the company’s recent introduction of AI capabilities, called Apple Intelligence, and announcement that it will give third-party developers access to more AI features “should drive significant innovation from developers.”\n\n“We view conversational AI with context and privacy as key to monetization of the installed base of Apple devices over time with increased productivity, higher priced apps, increased subscription and payments from partners,” BofA’s Wamsi Mohan writes in the report.\n\nMohan also points to a likely increase in consumers upgrading their iPhones in the coming years—to have access to new AI features under development—and Apple’s ability to expand its services and other offerings as reasons to invest. In a best-case scenario, existing customers will race to upgrade their phones and iPads to get access to the AI, and those loyal to other operating systems may make the switch.\n\nOn the downside, softening consumer spending in general could impact the company, possibly leading to weak iPhone 15 sales—and longer iPhone replacement cycles generally. Customers may also simply not be interested in the Apple Intelligence features, and demand could turn tepid after initial interest wanes. Mohan also points to two antitrust cases in the U.S. currently ongoing that could negatively impact the company, among other concerns.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlso at play: Because the S&P 500 is weighted by market cap, the movements of companies like Apple and the rest of the Magnificent Seven—either up or down—can have an outsize impact. That's led some analysts and financial advisors to caution that the tech giants could be a bit overvalued, which may affect retail investors who are pouring more and more money into index funds.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Too Late to Buy Nvidia? 3 Stocks to Double Down on Instead.",
        "content": "Is the AI rally over for Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? The dominant AI chipmaker has fallen 10% from its all-time high and has now slipped back to the third most valuable stock on the market behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nInvestors, though, should probably just view it as the pause that refreshes. Nvidia stock is just taking a breather before its next run higher. With CEO Jensen Huang declaring “we are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution” due to corporate demand for AI, there will be no let up in Nvidia’s growth potential.\n\nYet, because the stock still trades at 71 times trailing earnings, 33 times next year’s estimates and 37 times sales, Nvidia is not cheap. If you missed the run-up in the chipmaker’s stock (sheepishly raises hand), don’t worry. There are still other AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia that can generate outsized returns for your portfolio.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat is why you just might want to double down on three stocks below. They might not generate 3,000% returns in five years as NVDA stock did but that doesn’t mean you can create fabulous wealth with these AI stocks today.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe first choice for any investor looking for AI stocks to buy instead of Nvidia would have to be Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). It is the one chipmaker perfectly positioned to challenge the industry leader, and in many respects is already doing so.\n\nIn just the two months since AMD released its AI-driven MI300X accelerator for data centers, the chipmaker already generated some $1.5 billion in sales. That’s not Nvidia-level revenue but AMD is only just getting started.  Data center revenue surged 80% in the first quarter, jumping to $2.3 billion from the year-ago period causing segment operating profits to more than triple to $541 million.\n\nAnd not content to rest on its laurels, Advanced Micro already has the next iteration of the accelerator ready to go. In the fourth quarter the chipmaker will release the Instinct MI325X accelerator that will take its AI capabilities to the next level.\n\nA lot of AMD’s growth will occur in the back half of the year. The semiconductor stock forecasts data center revenue will exceed $4 billion in 2024, up from its previous guidance of $3.5 billion. And the company is stealing market share from both Nvidia and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC). It owns one-third of the market and it is quickly padding its share.\n\nExpect Advanced Micro Devices stock to accelerate growth later this year and then continue a meteoric rise thereafter.\n\nStory continues\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nThe reason Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is the second AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia is because it is the chip foundry from where Nvidia gets its chips. If there is any company that will grow alongside the AI chip stock best it is TSM.\n\nMoreover, all the leading AI semiconductor manufacturers get their chips from Taiwan Semi, including Advanced Micro and Intel. The company has so much demand for its services that it can’t keep up with it and has had to expand manufacturing capacity. There are three new chip facilities planned to come online in the U.S. over the next few years.\n\nI’ve always liked picks-and-shovels-type investments. They are the behind-the-scenes stocks that allow you to avoid trying to pick the winners and losers. They are willing to sell to anyone wanting to pan for gold, so whichever stock emerges victorious they benefit from it and the others. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is just such a play, though arguably not in the same sense as most people think of these stocks.\n\nFirst-quarter revenue jumped 13% to $18.9 billion with rich profit margins across the board. Gross margins were 53%, operating margins were 42.1% and net margins came in at 38%.\n\nThe stock has doubled in value over the past year. Yet as AI demand maintains it white-hot pace look for TSM to achieve a trillion-dollar valuation of its own.\n\nVanEck Semiconductor ETF (SMH)\n\nI tend to not invest in exchange-traded funds (ETF) but in the same vein as Taiwan Semi is a picks-and-shovels stock on the AI chip trade, VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NYSEARCA:SMH) is a top AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. Or rather, you will be buying Nvidia and all the other AI chip stocks out there.\n\nWith ETFs, of course, you’re buying a basket of companies. Just like TSM, you’re not trying to pick winners and losers but buying all the players (generally speaking). It doesn’t matter who wins because there will be many winners and VanEck Semiconductor will likely hold them all.\n\nNot surprisingly, Nvidia is SMH’s largest holding, comprising 19.4% of the portfolio. The next biggest is TSM at 12.8% but it also owns hard-charging Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) (7.9%), Advanced Micro (5.2%) and clean equipment manufacturer ASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) (4.8%).\n\nIn reality, any of those stocks would be a good AI stock to buy instead of Nvidia. But why worry that one will stumble? Just buy them up all at once with VanEck Semi. It has a relatively low expense ratio of 0.43% and has generated returns this year exceeding 48%. A $1,000 investment three years ago would be worth over $2,060 today, and would have been achieved at lower risk.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Sirius XM's (SIRI) Content Expansion to Aid Subscriber Revenues",
        "content": "Sirius XM SIRI has been constantly investing to expand its content. This constant expansion of content is expected to aid top-line growth in the upcoming quarters.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SIRI’s 2024 subscriber revenues is pegged at $6.96 billion, indicating year-over-year growth of 1.44%.\r\n\r\nThe company recently announced a content expansion with a new show, The Andy Richter Call-In Show, where Andy Richter will take calls directly from fans. Richter, known for his three decades on late-night television, will bring his favorite after-hours dinner party chats to the show, inviting listeners to participate.\r\n\r\nJoined by comedians and friends, such as Sona Movsesian, Andy Daly, Nicole Byer and Laurie Kilmartin, Richter will share entertaining stories and field calls, creating a lively and interactive experience for his audience.\r\n\r\nOther recently released content includes The Optimist Project with Yara Shahidi, Mediaite’s Press Club hosted by Aidan McLaughlin, The Road to Cooperstown featuring Hall of Fame stories and Off Topic with Yamaneika hosted by comedian Yamaneika Saunders.\r\n\r\nEach show offers unique content ranging from inspiring conversations and political insights to sports history and pop culture commentary.\n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nSirius XM Holdings Inc. price-consensus-chart | Sirius XM Holdings Inc. Quote\n\nSIRI Faces Tough Competition in the Audio Streaming Market\n\nThese recent initiatives have strengthened the company's unique content offerings. However, tough competition in the audio streaming markets from giants like Spotify Technology SPOT, Apple AAPL music and Amazon.com AMZN music is a concern.\r\n\r\nSpotify leads with 44.4 million paid subscribers, followed by Apple Music with 32.6 million and Amazon Music with 29.3 million. SiriusXM has a total subscriber base of 31.9 million, according to a report by Music Business Worldwide.\r\n\r\nThe audio streaming market is seeing intense competition as major players leverage AI and innovative technologies to enhance user experiences. Spotify, known for its machine learning-driven features like Discover Weekly, has introduced AI Playlist, which offers users more control over their listening experience.\r\n\r\nApple is strengthening its presence with the acquisition of Shazam and Asaii and integration of AR into its music service. AAPL is also developing \"smart song transitions\" for Apple Music to improve the crossfade functionality, aiming to make song transitions seamless and unnoticed.\r\n\r\nAmazon Music is also stepping up its game with the introduction of Maestro, an AI playlist generator designed to simplify and enhance playlist creation. This feature, currently in beta for a limited number of U.S. customers, aims to make playlists more intuitive and enjoyable.\r\n\r\nShares of this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company have plunged 50.6% year to date compared with the Zacks Consumer Discretionary sector’s decline of 1%. The stock has also underperformed SPOT, which has gained 69.7%, followed by AMZN’s growth of 27.4% and AAPL’s rise of 10.8% in the same time frame. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nSIRI’s strong expanding content offerings and partnerships bode well with its long-term prospects. However, strong competition remains a major concern for the company.\r\n\r\nIts expanded podcast efforts fit well with the existing advertising-led focus at Pandora and AdsWizz and are expected to improve monetization in the near term.\r\n\r\nAdvertisement revenues (18.6% of the total revenues) rose 7.2% year over year to $402 million in the first quarter. The Zacks Consensus Estimate for second-quarter advertising revenues is pegged at $457.94 million, indicating year-over-year growth of 13.9%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for SIRI’s second-quarter loss per share is pegged at 8 cents, which has increased a cent in the past 60 days. The consensus mark for 2024 earnings is pegged at 31 cents per share, which has increased 2 cents in the past 30 days.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The 7 Smartest Stocks to Buy With $100 Right Now",
        "content": "If you’re feeling uncertain about the market’s direction, you’re not alone. Despite positive economic and stock market indicators suggesting renewed financial strength, the sentiment on the ground often tells a different story. With that in mind, when finding smart stocks to buy, it’s important to remain grounded in solid investment principles rather than purely emotional reactions.\n\nFinding smart stocks to buy now is a challenge amid this uncertainty. Questions linger: Have you missed the boat on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Will it continue to soar post-split as it has since June 7? Is Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) partnership with OpenAI a risky move or a strategic advancement in consumer electronics?\n\nNavigating today’s markets is tough, but these diverse smart stocks to buy now offer a balanced approach. They combine long-term speculative opportunities with the stability of perennial winners, providing a broader perspective and a solid foundation for future growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStem (STEM) A concept image of a person's hands holding a plant with floating glowing particles around it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nStem (NYSE:STEM) is a unique player in the sustainable energy sector, merging two highly lucrative fields: renewable energy solutions and artificial intelligence. At the heart of Stem’s offerings is its Athena software, an advanced control system that seamlessly integrates and optimizes resources from generators, grid power, solar farms, and battery storage. Athena leverages AI to make real-time decisions based on variables like weather and energy pricing, providing large-scale enterprise customers with a self-managing, efficient energy solution.\n\nDespite its penny stock status, Stem is aiming high, with leadership envisioning a tenfold increase in value. The company’s strategic vision is outlined in its “AI and the Future of Energy” white paper, which details how AI integration will drive efficiency and growth in sustainable energy markets.\n\nHowever, like many speculative smart stocks, Stem faces challenges, including a lack of profitability and cyclical sales that introduce variability. Yet, the company has moved beyond the pre-revenue phase and boasts a growing portfolio of completed projects. Stem represents a promising long-term investment opportunity in the sustainable energy sector, particularly for those looking to capture the emerging influence of AI within green infrastructure. Adding Stem to your portfolio could be a strategic move to benefit from the ongoing integration of AI in renewable energy.\n\nFresh Del Monte Produce (FDP) Vegetables and fruits are scattered over a white background.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nEven as inflation eases, consumers remain cautious with their spending due to persistently high prices, positioning Fresh Del Monte Produce (NYSE:FDP) as a smart defensive stock to buy with notable growth potential. Despite a slight dip in sales in the latest quarterly report, the seasonal nature of fresh fruit and produce suggests a likely rebound in summer sales, making the stock an attractive buy at its current price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSignificantly, Fresh Del Monte is optimizing operations across its enterprise to navigate economic and consumer pressures better. Financially, the company reduced total debt by 15%, a strategic move to save costs in today’s high-interest-rate environment. Additionally, a renewed focus on fresh and value-added sales resulted in a 5% revenue increase in this segment, with avocado sales soaring by 23% despite overall lower sales. This strategic pivot has proven successful, and management is expected to continue pursuing this direction.\n\nFresh Del Monte’s current dividend yield stands at a solid 4%, offering investors a chance to build a position through dollar-cost averaging and capitalize on the company’s growing blue-chip potential.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (GLDD)\n\nSource: Istvan Balogh / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD) provides a crucial service that often escapes the attention of most retail investors, making it one of those overlooked smart stocks to buy. The company specializes in deepening, dredging, and expanding waterways along coasts and within ports, playing an essential role in global trade and supply chains. This makes it relatively recession-proof, while its efforts in coastal beach reclamation align it with climate change management initiatives.\n\nGreat Lakes’ recent financial performance highlights its strength in a sector that faced prolonged challenges during the pandemic. The company’s EBITDA reached $43 million, the highest since the end of 2021, indicating a significant resurgence.\n\nLooking forward, Great Lakes is well-positioned to benefit from a record-setting $8.7 billion budget from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, creating a robust bidding environment for securing steady contract cash flows. With a dredging backlog of $879 million, the company has a clear projection of future income, further stabilizing its financial outlook as supply chains normalize.\n\nRumble (RUM) Person holding cellphone with logo of Canadian video platform company Rumble (RUM) Inc. on screen in front of business webpage. CFVI\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nRumble (NASDAQ:RUM) is steadily carving out its niche within the tech industry, positioning itself as one of the undervalued smart stocks to buy now with significant growth potential.\n\nThe platform boasts over 40 million monthly active users. While this number is modest compared to major video platforms like Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) YouTube, it represents a dedicated and loyal audience that consistently engages with the content.\n\nThis consistent user engagement underlines Rumble’s long-term viability as it continues to expand its advertising ecosystem. The company is also gaining traction by securing exclusive deals with prominent creators. A notable example is the recent partnership with the popular political show “Breaking Points”, highlighting Rumble’s increasing industry influence.\n\nMoreover, Rumble is diversifying its revenue streams by venturing into cloud services and data hosting. This strategic pivot could be the catalyst for significant growth. An example of this expansion is the e-commerce and payments processing company PublicSquare (NYSE:PSQH) migrating its Marketplace platform hosting to Rumble. This move demonstrates Rumble’s rapid growth beyond video hosting and into broader media and technology markets.\n\nBuzzFeed (BZFD) Buzzfeed (BZFD) logo on a phone with a keyboard in the background. Buzzfeed layoffs\n\nSource: Meir Chaimowitz / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Rumble, BuzzFeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) is an undervalued media stock that may soon capture more attention as activist shareholder activity ramps up. The company has faced numerous scandals over the years, including accusations of plagiarism, undue advertiser influence, and divisive political stances that have alienated many readers.\n\nThese challenges, coupled with declining sales and limited profitability, likely caught the attention of former presidential candidate and activist investor Vivek Ramaswamy. He recently acquired a large stake in BuzzFeed, signaling plans to drive significant changes within the company.\n\nRamaswamy is actively engaging with BuzzFeed’s board and met with CEO Jonah Peretto this week to explore various operational and strategic opportunities to maximize shareholder value. This includes potential staff cuts and a shift in the company’s editorial and business strategies.\n\nHis investment points to a broader strategy of addressing the dearth of high-quality, independent media outlets while advocating for greater transparency, objectivity, and quality in media content.\n\nDespite some resistance from BuzzFeed’s current management, Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management is emerging as a formidable force in activist investing, potentially eyeing further investments in the media sector.\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) is best known as a Bitcoin (BTC-USD) mining company, but its broader potential often goes unnoticed, making it one of the smart stocks to buy. As Bitcoin mining becomes more costly and less profitable, Riot’s extensive energy resources position it as an ideal partner for AI enterprises, which require vast amounts of power.\n\nRiot has already capitalized on its excess energy by selling it to local municipalities and utility operators, generating $71.2 million in revenue last year. While the company has yet to specifically target the AI industry’s energy demands, the evolving economic landscape suggests such a partnership could be mutually beneficial.\n\nAdditionally, the construction of new data centers is lagging behind the skyrocketing demand for AI, indicating that existing GPU facilities like Riot’s could soon be in high demand. Investors in Riot can appreciate not only the company’s future AI stock potential but also its current involvement in the crypto market. This dual focus is underscored by Bitcoin’s impressive 50% gain over the past six months, highlighting Riot’s robust position in the market.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT (APLE) a person in a suit holds a tiny house to represent reits to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nImproved consumer sentiment and the summer travel season are converging, making Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE) a prime stock to buy now. Apple Hospitality owns over 200 hotel properties across the United States, leasing them to top-tier hoteliers like Marriott (NASDAQ:MAR) and Hilton (NYSE:HLT). With a 6.5% dividend yield, Apple Hospitality offers an attractive alternative to fixed-income investments, providing upside through ownership of some of the priciest properties with the most reliable tenants in the industry.\n\nIn its most recent quarterly report, Apple Hospitality reported a significant boost in funds from operations (FFO) to $83.24 million, up from $78.96 million the previous year. FFO is a key metric for REITs as it represents earnings without property sale revenue and better represents leasing operations’ cash flow. This increase, particularly during a relatively subdued travel period, bodes well for the future.\n\nAdditionally, Apple Hospitality is benefiting from a rise in business travel, with midweek bookings showing substantial growth over the quarter. This positions the company to capitalize on the summer leisure travel season while maintaining stability through increased business travel, ensuring steady occupancy rates throughout the week.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Cybersecurity Stocks That Could Make Your Grandchildren Rich",
        "content": "The rise in cybercrime in recent years, driven by increased digitization and attackers deploying more advanced technologies, has increased investor interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nTo put things into perspective, experts predict that the cost of cybercrime will reach $10.5 trillion annually by 2025. That’s a massive number, considering that most cyberattacks can be prevented with better detection.\n\nIn response to these challenges, companies deploying technologies to combat malicious attacks are experiencing significant growth. The global cybersecurity market was $222.6 billion in 2023 and will grow at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12.3% until 2030.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nOne primary driver of this growth is AI, and its benefits are twofold. First, AI can be harnessed to detect potential cyber threats in a large volume of data in real time. Second, AI can identify areas requiring greater security controls through machine learning. This will help companies implement better prevention strategies while lowering costs.\n\nAs a result, companies actively incorporating AI in their cybersecurity offerings have become indispensable to businesses. Consequently, this has made them a wealth-generation channel for investors seeking long-term returns.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) CrowdStrike sign and logo at headquarters in Silicon Valley. CRWD stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nThe increase in cybercrime has sparked interest in cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. Leading the charge is CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD), whose shares surged over 173% this year. Several factors contribute to its success.\n\nThe first is a unique ‘pay for what you pick’ business model that has proven extremely successful. This approach allows customers to consolidate and customize modules to suit their needs on the platform. According to CrowdStrike, nearly 28% of its customers have adopted seven or more modules.\n\nThe second is its commitment to operating with a cloud-native architecture. CrowdStrike’s Falcon Horizon platform leverages automation and AI to identify threats across multi-cloud applications, thereby reducing cyberattack costs. Additionally, it allows users to manage workloads across cloud platforms through a single console.\n\nThis forward-thinking approach has paid off for the company. In its recent earnings report, revenue rose 33% to $921 million, with subscription revenue up 34% year-over-year (YoY). Revenue guidance for the full year was also raised by 30%.\n\nAs a leader in the cybersecurity space, CRWD trades at a premium valuation and is not a bargain buy. However, investors willing to hold the stock will find it to be one of the top cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth. The company was recently added to the S&P 500.\n\nStory continues\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother company making waves in the cybersecurity space is Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW). While the company is well known for its advanced firewall technology and cybersecurity solutions, Palo Alto’s Unit 42 gives it a competitive edge. Unit 42 is a team of world-renowned threat researchers that help federal agencies assess readiness and mitigate cyber risks. This research capability allows the company to gather valuable data and refine its risk mitigation strategies.\n\nThe success of Palo Alto’s cybersecurity services was evident in its most recent earnings report. Revenue was up 15% YOY to $2 billion, and EPS came in at $1.32 over the estimated $1.26. However, shares fell 9% following weak billing guidance. Billing for the fiscal year will land in the $10.13 billion to $10.18 billion range, below the $10.19 billion estimate.\n\nBut despite the decline, PANW stock remains fundamentally strong. The company has exhibited consistent growth over the years, and its array of AI-powered cybersecurity solutions will serve as a catalyst for continued expansion.\n\nThe recent dip presents a great buying opportunity for investors looking to get behind cybersecurity stocks for long-term growth.\n\nCloudflare (NET) Exterior view of Cloudflare headquarters. NET stock.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock\n\nA third name on this list of cybersecurity stocks to buy for long-term returns is Cloudflare (NYSE:NET). The company has embraced the role of GenAI in its offerings, proving it to be a useful tool in combating cyber attacks. Cloudflare’s services include a content delivery network (CDN) that stores cached copies of websites closer to the site’s visitors for easier access and a tool to help organizations combat bot-based attacks.\n\nClouflare’s recent earnings report underscored the success of its offerings. Revenue in Q1 was up 30% YOY at $378.6 million. Adjusted EPS came in at 16 cents, surpassing an estimate of 13 cents. The company hopes to keep this momentum going through Q2, with revenue ranging between $393.5 million and $394.5 million.\n\nLooking ahead, Cloudflare is well-positioned to thrive in an AI-focused cybersecurity environment. The company maintains a successful partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), providing security enhancements for its users. Cloudflare’s technology will also help encrypt AI queries in Apple’s new Private Cloud Compute (PCC).\n\nThe company’s promising prospects make this a good stock to add to your portfolio for long-term returns.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nDivya has a background in finance and accounting and has worked in FP&A roles at Fortune 500 companies.

        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Thursday?\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) has received approval from the Kaohsiung city government to construct its third 2nm fab.\n\nThis new facility will occupy 17.22 hectares in the Nanzih District industrial park, expanding TSMC’s regional footprint.\n\nThe land for this new project is situated east of TSMC’s initial plant at the 238-hectare Nanzih Technology Industrial Park, Fudzilla reports.\n\nAlso Read: Nvidia Accelerates AI Chip Production with New Packaging Tech to Meet Soaring Demand\n\nTSMC aims to meet the growing demand for AI chips, particularly Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) Blackwell-series, which have experienced high demand outstripping supply. Additionally, other chipmakers are keen to produce their own AI chips, pushing TSMC to ramp up its production capabilities.\n\nTSMC will develop the third fab on polluted land that it plans to clean and prepare for production.\n\nPrior reports indicated that TSMC was exploring advanced chip packaging methods to address the growing demand for AI-driven computing power. The contract chipmaker’s key customers, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia, and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD), have nearly booked TSMC’s 3nm process to total capacity through 2026.\n\nGoldman Sachs predicts a rise in three- and five-nanometer chip manufacturing prices, while JPMorgan expects TSMC to potentially raise its 2024 revenue guidance and capital expenditure.\n\nIs TSM A Good Stock To Buy?\n\nWall Street analysts view Taiwan Semiconductor (NYSE:TSM) on the whole as a Outperform, given the history of coverage over the past three months. Mark Li from Bernstein in Taiwan Semiconductor is the most optimistic, expecting a 33.33% rise in the stock in the coming year.\n\nBut looking at how the market as a whole thinks of the stock, you can reference historical price action for views on whether investors feel strongly about the stock one way or another. In the past 3 months, Taiwan Semiconductor rose 26.91%, which indicates that opinion improved on the business and how attractive it is to own based on either its stock price, or underlying fundamentals, like revenue, which rose 12.88% over the past year.\n\nA complete overview of how Wall Street views individual stocks is available here, while real time updates on the latest analyst actions will be delivered via Benzinga PRO.

        "content": "If there really is a “new industrial revolution” underway, then investors will want to buy Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) now. This is the top picks-and-shovels play for AI chip stocks and it offers a compelling growth opportunity.\n\nAs the leading pure-play foundry for the semiconductor industry, Taiwan Semiconductor supplies all the major AI chipmakers including Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) with their powerful chips.\n\nBecause AI is still in its infancy and demand from data centers and enterprise-class customers moving their data to the cloud remains white hot, Taiwan Semiconductor stock is a surefire winner now and for the foreseeable future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDuring a Gold Rush, Sell Shovels\n\nNvidia CEO Jensen Huang told the Databricks conference earlier this month “we are at the beginning of a new industrial revolution” but one that is different from similar upheavals in the past. This time, “we’re generating (artificial) intelligence.”\n\nAnd the chipmaker is leading the way. Sales more than tripled in the first quarter, rising 262% to $26 billion, a record for the semiconductor stock. Yet Nvidia couldn’t achieve such growth without first buying its “tools” from Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.\n\nDuring the Gold Rush of the late 1840s, the real winners were not those who panned for gold but rather the people who sold the miners the picks, shovels and wheelbarrows they needed.\n\nThey made money off every miner betting it all on finding a golden nugget. Levi Strauss made millions and created a clothing empire selling miners his unique riveted jeans and other tools.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is today’s Strauss selling AI miners their shovels. It produces the advanced semiconductors the industry needs to build their AI chips.\n\nBringing Home the Gold\n\nTSM’s first-quarter revenue jumped 13% year-over-year to $18.8 billion generating operating earnings of $8.5 billion, a 31% increase from last year.\n\nMargins also improved across the board with gross margins of 53.1%, operating margins of 42% and net margins coming in at 38%. Earnings of $1.38 per share were 9% higher than the year-ago period.\n\nThe chip foundry expects revenue to grow as much as 30% to $20.4 billion in the second quarter as demand for its manufacturing remains unrelenting.\n\nAnd it is not just the traditional chipmakers that Taiwan Semiconductor supplies. For example, it is also a key supplier of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) M-series chips.\n\nWhile the tech giant doesn’t sell its chips to others but rather uses them for its own use, it plans on making a new chip for its data centers. TSM will again be the supplier.\n\nStory continues\n\nMobile chipset maker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) also counts Taiwan Semiconductor as a key supplier. According to JPMorgan Chase analysts, Broadcom is now the second largest chip supplier behind Nvidia as it has branched out beyond just mobile devices into data centers and more.\n\nExpect Surging Profits\n\nAs the equilibrium between supply and demand tilts sharply in favor of the latter, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is raising its prices. A report from Commercial Times suggests TSM will raise prices on its 3 nanometer wafer by more than 5% while advanced packaging prices are expected to rise by 10% to 20% next year.\n\nAs the foundry builds out more facilities to help meet the growth expected, those price increases will flow straight to its bottom line.\n\nThe stock trades at elevated valuations on its march toward trillion-dollar status. However, the picks-and-shovels trade makes Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing stock worth the premium.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "There's something odd about the stock market's concentration: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe major indexes may have only chalked small gains Wednesday, but while the generals were sleeping, the soldiers were on the march.\n\nAt the vanguard, moderate losses in large-cap energy and financials were offset by outsized gains in the consumer discretionary sector — thanks principally to Amazon (AMZN) and Tesla (TSLA).\n\nThis seesaw theme has become a subtle but important market narrative. On days when AI isn't leading the charge, select pockets of strength keep the S&P 500 from more pronounced sell-offs — which itself is holding index volatility near multiyear lows.\n\nThe recent \"plunge\" in Nvidia is instructive.\n\nOnly Monday, the AI poster child closed down 13% from its record high. Surveying social media, you would think Wall Street was burning.\n\nBut during that harrowing three-day slump, a funny thing happened: The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) — up only 3% this year versus 14% for the S&P 500 — staged a comeback. Energy perked up, and biotech jumped as forgotten pockets of the market showed signs of life.\n\nThis seesaw-offsetting behavior is everywhere right now in lieu of correlations between even stocks in similar sectors. Stocks simply do not want to move in the same direction.\n\n\"This is a generationally weird US stock market,\" wrote Luke Kawa, a former director of investment solutions at UBS Asset Management Americas now at Sherwood Media.\n\nKawa was specifically referencing Tuesday's price action, in which the S&P 500 managed a 0.4% gain despite 384 of its components closing in the red — a new feat for a data set that goes back to 1996.\n\nSimilar \"firsts\" have been dotting the market statistics recently.\n\nBut none of this detracts from the argument — supported by ample research and history — that it's perfectly normal in a bull market to have gains concentrated in a few stocks.\n\nWinning stocks that enjoy a secular-themed rally get bigger and bigger until the move runs its course.\n\nIn a bull market, when leading stocks falter, other parts of the market that may not be generating hype-filled headlines can rise to the occasion. Sector rotation keeps volatility at the index level low as new winners offset losers. And then, at some point, the music stops and all sectors start selling off in unison, kicking off a new bear market.\n\nKawa tied this to the current market, writing that \"different major groups within the US stock market have been marching to the beat of their own drummers recently, and this dynamic has helped keep the stock market from lurching violently to the downside.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWe're not only currently seeing disparate returns among sectors and industries, but also inside them — even in the megacap tech stocks. In the past six months, if some of them, say Microsoft and Alphabet, are up, Nvidia and Apple might be down. The correlation between directional moves between pairs in this cohort is a scant 43%, Kawa noted.\n\nAll of this zigging and zagging keeps index-level volatility at bay, but Kawa lays out the major risk in this environment: a \"correlated shock\" that is distributed \"among these companies that control so much of US as well as global equity indices.\"\n\nThough the \"big drop\" remains the focal risk, divergences can persist longer than arbitrage investors can remain solvent (to turn an old Wall Street trope).\n\nIn fact, research by the data analytics team at BofA suggests that the current regime of low inter- and intra-sector correlation can persist for years. Stock correlations within the S&P 500 are at historic lows.\n\n\"Multiple years of decorrelation in the 90s as the internet bubble developed suggests that persistence of today's regime remains a risk,\" wrote BofA.\n\nAccordingly, the outsized bifurcation in returns between the chosen AI few and the rest of the market needn't end with a bang.\n\n\"Just because we’re in uncharted waters doesn’t mean we’re heading for a waterfall. It could end up being a lazy river,\" wrote Kawa. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Billionaires Are Selling Meta and Buying This Stock Instead",
        "content": "Billionaire stock transactions can be valuable data for investors. You shouldn't expect to uncover any enormous secrets that reveal infallible strategies shared universally among the ultra-wealthy. However, you can gain important insights about the factors that are influencing sophisticated investors based on the stocks that are being purchased or sold most heavily by hedge funds and billionaires.\n\nBillionaires are taking their gains on Meta\n\nThere's been a flurry of recent hedge-fund selling activity for Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META). Numerous billionaires and high-profile funds, including Steven Cohen, Andreas Halvorsen, Lee Ainslie, Ken Griffin, Jonathan Soros, and David Tepper, have all unloaded a large volume of shares in recent months.\n\nMeta's recent first-quarter earnings report was strong but mostly in line with analyst expectations. The company achieved 27% revenue growth and more than doubled its quarterly profits over the prior year.\n\nMeta reported higher user volume, more advertisement interactions, and more revenue per advertisement. That's a comprehensive set of improvements across its various revenue-driving components. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nMeta shares dropped steeply following the earnings report, despite the strong headline figures. The company's second-quarter outlook fell roughly 1.5% below consensus analyst expectations, and it also revised its full-year operating expense forecasts higher. Meta's sales guidance implies 18% annual growth next quarter, which marks a significant slowdown from the most recent results.\n\nIt's odd to see such a big sell-off following quarterly earnings that were overall positive or neutral. Meta did phenomenal work to stimulate growth while slashing costs in recent years. Those sorts of improvements are impossible to replicate year after year, but building incrementally on last year's improvements wasn't good enough for many investors.\n\nThis is evidence of unsustainably aggressive expectations and a \"what have you done for me lately?\" attitude from many shareholders. Meta's strong operational results and big returns have attracted a crowd of traders and short-term investors who piled in on the momentum. That's a recipe for volatility, as we saw after the last earnings report.\n\nIt's important to note that many of Meta's sellers still maintain large positions and that multiple billionaires and hedge funds have increased their Meta positions lately. Just recognize that the activity is skewed toward selling and reduced positions.\n\nThat's likely motivating many long-term investors to reassess their situations. Meta has returned 322% since the start of 2023, crushing the Nasdaq Composite's impressive 73% return over the same period.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat's led to rapid inflation in the stock's important valuation ratios. Meta's forward price-to-earnings ratio (P/E) and price-to-free-cash flow ratio have roughly doubled year to date, climbing above 25. Neither is particularly expensive relative to the company's growth outlook, but the stock is no longer the glaring value buy it was last year. META PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nVolatility is up, analyst expectations are more difficult to meet, growth is slowing, the stock is more expensive, and there's less low-hanging fruit to drive operational improvements. It's not hard to see why some billionaires took this opportunity to lock in their significant gains over the past year and redeploy capital elsewhere.\n\nApple is getting more attention\n\nIt seems that billionaires and hedge funds haven't tired of the \"Magnificent Seven\" quite yet, with one of Meta's peers attracting attention. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) has been a landing spot for some high-profile investors. Stanley Druckenmiller and Andreas Halvorsen opened large new positions, while Yan Huo, Paul Tudor Jones, Ray Dalio, Steven Schonfield, David Shaw, and Ken Griffin added significantly to their existing stakes.\n\nApple reported a 4% decline in revenue in its most recent quarterly financial report, with noteworthy weakness in the Chinese market and a discouraging outlook for iPhone sales. However, it posted its highest all-time earnings per share (EPS) and beat Wall Street's forecasts for sales and profits.\n\nLike many of its tech peers, Apple has cut operating expenses without hampering sales performance. It's also achieving record service revenues, which are recurring and have higher profit margins than device sales. That's important for predictable cash-flow generation.\n\nUntil May, Apple's recent performance in the stock market was less impressive. Shares fell roughly 10% from the start of 2023 through April 2024. Its forward P/E ratio and price-to-free-cash-flow ratio bottomed at approximately 25 earlier this year. AAPL P/E Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nApple's most recent financial data wasn't particularly encouraging, compared to Meta's, but there's a clear trend in the assessments by billionaire investors. Meta's rising valuation ratios met Apple's falling ratios, then the two stocks promptly switched courses. The timing of that reversal coincides with noteworthy hedge fund transaction activity. META PE Ratio (Forward) data by YCharts.\n\nBillionaire investors don't always get it right. However, hedge fund managers and ultra-high-net-worth people have access to resources and information that are often unavailable to the general public.\n\nTransaction data suggests that sophisticated investors were assessing valuation and outlook, leading many to sell Meta and buy Apple. Don't just follow these moves blindly -- make sure that you consider the logic behind the trends.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Meta Platforms right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Meta Platforms, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Meta Platforms wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Amazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time. (Nathan Stirk via Getty Images)\n\nAmazon (AMZN)\n\nAmazon's market cap hit $2tn this week for the first time, making it the fifth US company to hit that mark. The bullish sentiment reflects optimism around artificial intelligence and the potential for imminent interest rate cuts.\n\nThe stock rose 3.9% on Wednesday to $193.61, putting it in the same club as technology heavyweights Microsoft Corp, Apple, Nvidia and Alphabet.\n\nUS stock indexes have recorded robust gains this year on relentless enthusiasm around AI, optimism around resilience in the US economy and potential easing of interest rates from the Federal Reserve.\n\nWall Street was trading near record levels, largely powered by megacap stocks, such as Nvidia and Amazon, whose future cash flows stand to benefit from lower interest rates.\n\nApple (AAPL)\n\nApple saw its stock coast in premarket on Thursday, after having gained 2% in yesterday's session as it rides out a competition probe under the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nBrussels has accused the computing giant of stifling competition with practices in its App Store, marking the first enforcement actions under the new digital rules. The European Commission said earlier this week it was concerned about how Apple's controls on developers limits their ability to “freely steer their customers” to options outside of the App Store.\n\nMeanwhile, as the tech giant pushes into new tech, Rosenblatt has upgraded Apple to 'buy' from 'neutral' and increased its price target to $260 per share, citing the company's privacy-focused AI initiatives.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks mixed after yen hits 38-year low against dollar\n\nMicron (MU)\n\nChipmaker Micron was hit by AI jitters on Thursday, with its stock 6.8% lower in premarket. The company beat Q3 estimates for revenue but stumbled when it came to forecasts — disappointing investors.\n\nThe company forecast revenue of $7.6bn, plus or minus $200m, for the current quarter, compared with an estimate of $7.6bn, according to LSEG data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe company's results usually act as a weather vane for earnings in the chip sector, as it acts as an indicator of demand for various types of chips and end-markets.\n\nTesla (TSLA)\n\nTesla stock was down in premarket trade on Thursday, after gaining 4.8% in Wednesday's session. The electric vehicle maker gained this week, despite news that it would recall most of its Cybertrucks due to a fault with the windshield wipers and exterior trim. This would be the fourth time the vehicle has been recalled in the US.\n\nThe disclosure revealed the number of vehicles affected by the recall — 11,688 trucks — which would equate to the number of Cybertrucks sold, since it includes vehicles in use and in transit to customers. Because Tesla does not officially break out Cybertruck sales in its quarterly delivery report, getting a read on early Cybertruck sales is noteworthy.\n\nExtrapolating the numbers shows Tesla could deliver around 23,500 Cybertrucks this year. However, at its annual shareholder meeting two weeks ago, CEO Elon Musk disclosed Tesla achieved a production record of 1,300 Cybertrucks per week, with a stretch goal of 2,500 vehicles per week by the end of 2024.\n\nThe moves also comes after Musk clinched a reported $210bn valuation for SpaceX. Bloomberg reported the valuation earlier today, following an insight into the value of insider shares being sold in a tender offer.\n\nWatch: Amazon's $2tn market cap, consumer spending: Asking for a trend<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/josh-lipton/\\\">Josh Lipton</a> breaks down the major market trends of the trading day.</p>\\n<p>As inflation has put consumers under pressure, Lightspeed CEO Dax Dasilva provides insight into <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/top-trends-among-americans-dine-212125686.html\\\">Americans' dining preferences</a>.

Those tech stocks can continue to go up and that divergence can get wider and wider, similar to what we saw back in 2021. However, we can also see what I think is going to happen is as a start of the broader market to play catch up.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the number one company in terms of market valuation and it can now become “number on-er,” Truist Securities analysts said in a Wednesday note.\n\nOn June 18, Nvidia’s market cap climbed to $3.34 trillion, overtaking Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world’s most valuable public company. However, the chipmaker’s shares then fell in several consecutive sessions, losing the top position.\n\n“We considered that, even if fundamentals cooperate, stock upside could be limited owing to trading and technical challenges related to NVDA's #1 market cap position,” Truist analysts wrote.\n\nHowever, the firm said its comprehensive analysis of the data indicates “that becoming the largest company by market cap does not appear to systematically challenge future investment returns.”\n\nTruist evaluated the investment returns and valuations of stocks that have achieved the largest market capitalization over the past 26 years. These stocks include Microsoft, Cisco (NASDAQ:CSCO), ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN).\n\nThe analysis revealed that most of these stocks underperformed relative to the S&P 500 index over short-term periods of one week, one month, and three months following their initial ascent to the top market cap position. However, in the longer term, the stocks generally outperformed the S&P 500 over one-year, three-year, and five-year periods, the investment bank noted.\n\nOverall, analysts continue to view NVDA as the top choice for investing in the AI theme. Citing recent feedback from industry contacts, including component buyers and sellers, they note that there is ongoing and broadening demand for Nvidia's GPU systems. While Blackwell systems are particularly favored, Hopper systems are also being well received.\n\nWithin this, the investment bank raised its price target on NVDA shares from $128 to $140.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTruist raises Nvidia stock target: 'Number one can become number one-er'\n\nRivian investors to seek details on path to profits at investor day\n\nHedge funds 'aggressively' sold tech stocks in June - Goldman Sachs\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Warren Buffett Stocks That Are Screaming Buys Right Now",
        "content": "Warren Buffett and his team at Berkshire Hathaway have turned the conglomerate into one of the world's most valuable companies, with a market cap topping $880 billion (as of June 23). It hasn't happened overnight; it's been the result of decades of strategic investments and patience.\n\nConsidering Buffett and Berkshire Hathaway's investing success, it's not a surprise that their stock portfolio has become a go-to for investors looking for stock inspiration.\n\nKeeping in mind that your portfolio should reflect your financial situation and not necessarily that of a billionaire and nine-figure company, there are still stocks worth considering from their portfolios. The following three companies are great buys right now for long-term investors.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nAmazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) is a stock that Buffett was admittedly hesitant to sign off on at first, but it's always better late than never -- especially considering how rewarding it has been to investors.\n\nAmazon has already cemented itself as the leader of e-commerce, but its true growth will likely come from its cloud computing service, Amazon Web Services (AWS). AWS is the world's leading cloud platform and Amazon's biggest profit generator, responsible for over 61% of its operating income in the first quarter ($9.4 billion). AMZN Operating Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe first-mover advantage of AWS helped it capture a large market share, but competitors like Microsoft Azure have been gaining ground. However, AI advancements could help it with another growth spark. That's not because of AI innovations per se but because of what they enable other companies to do.\n\nAmazon is using AWS to help companies build and deploy machine learning models (SageMaker) and build and scale AI applications (Bedrock). This allows it to capitalize on its top-of-the-line infrastructure without depending too much on internal AI developments.\n\nIt's taking a similar approach with Supply Chain by Amazon, a full-set shipping and logistics service that allows businesses to streamline their operations and efficiently run their own e-commerce businesses.\n\nAmazon has spent years and billions building out its tech and supply chain infrastructure, and now it's leveraging these investments to benefit without relying so much on constant innovation (although that remains a priority). As this approach plays out, Amazon's revenue streams should grow and continue to solidify as one of the top cash cow businesses in the world.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is Berkshire Hathaway's top holding, making up close to 43% of its stock portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nMuch fuss was made about Apple lagging behind in the AI race, but it's much better to be delayed and thorough than rushed and faulty. Apple has consistently taken this approach when it comes to releasing new products and features.\n\nDuring Apple's Worldwide Developer Conference, it announced its own AI: Apple Intelligence. It's not Apple's in-house development; instead, it will integrate features powered by ChatGPT into its operating systems beginning in the fall.\n\nApple's new Apple Intelligence will only be available on its newest model iPhones, iPads, and Macs, giving consumers an incentive to upgrade their current products. This move, and the excitement around it, should help give Apple's revenue a much-needed boost after it has lagged in recent years due to slowing iPhone sales. AAPL Revenue (Quarterly YoY Growth) Chart\n\nAn anticipated rebound in hardware sales will be a great complement to the company's growing services segment, which grew 14% year over year in the first quarter and accounted for more than 26% of Apple's revenue.\n\nApple has already done great at incentivizing customers to remain in its product ecosystem. Add in its growth services like financial and health, and it's bound to be one of the world's top companies for quite some time.\n\n3. Visa\n\nBuffett is a major fan of companies with huge competitive moats, and Visa(NYSE: V) fits that description. Its competitive moat is its vast reach, with more than 130 million merchant locations and 4.4 billion cards in circulation.\n\nAs the world's leading payment processor, Visa stands to gain a lot from the network effect. Potential cardholders go with Visa because it's the most widely accepted card in the world, and merchants are likely to accept Visa cards because they're the most used.\n\nThis network effect has put Visa in a position to expand organically and operate with industry-leading profit margins. V Profit Margin (Quarterly) Chart\n\nThe world is becoming more digitally connected by the day, but many countries still operate on a cash economy. As they transition to digital payments, Visa is positioned to capture a significant amount of the growing market.\n\nVisa has shown that it's willing to make the necessary investments to innovate, expand, and remain the industry's top player. You want that from a company whose stock you plan to hold onto long-term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "FDVV: A Dividend ETF Where Nvidia Is the Top Holding?",
        "content": "You might be surprised to hear that a surging but low-yielding growth stock like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the top holding for a dividend-focused ETF, but that’s exactly the position it occupies in the Fidelity High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:FDVV). Just because Nvidia and other stocks like it feature a low yield doesn’t mean that dividend funds should automatically count it out, and FDVV is a good example of why, as we’ll discuss in this article.\n\nI’m bullish on this $2.9 billion ETF from Fidelity based on its portfolio, which consists of an attractive combination of “new-school” dividend stocks like Nvidia with “old-school” dividend stalwarts like Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP) and Philip Morris (NYSE:PM). The ETF also boasts a strong performance track record in recent years, a 3.0% dividend yield, and reasonable fees.\n\nWhat Is the FDVV ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to Fidelity, FDVV invests in an index “designed to reflect the performance of stocks of large and mid-capitalization dividend-paying companies that are expected to continue to pay and grow their dividends.”\n\nNice Mix of Dividend Stocks\n\nFDVV offers decent diversification with 105 holdings, and its top 10 holdings make up a reasonable 31.2% of assets. Below, you’ll find an overview of FDVV’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nAs you’ve surmised from the article’s title, Nvidia is the ETF’s top holding, with a weighting of 6.5%.\n\nAnd Nvidia isn’t the only high-growth, lower-yielding dividend stock from the tech sector that is prominent in FDVV’s top holdings. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are the fund’s next three largest holdings.\n\nNvidia yields less than 0.1%, Microsoft and Apple feature yields below 1.0%, and Broadcom is only slightly higher, with a yield of 1.2%.\n\nYou might wonder what these low-yielding tech stocks are doing in a “high dividend” ETF.\n\nFDVV’s strategy is to invest in companies expected to continue paying and growing their dividends, not simply the dividend stocks with the highest yields. Growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom are expected to grow their earnings over time and thus have the capacity to increase their dividend payouts in the future, making them a good fit for dividend funds like FDVV.\n\nThis expected earnings growth also makes them more attractive investments than many dividend stocks that feature high yields but feature low or no growth and are essentially businesses in decline.\n\nFDVV is prudent to include these stocks as, despite their lower yields, they have generated exceptional total returns over time through a combination of price appreciation and dividends. For example, Broadcom has generated an exceptional total return of 2,907% over the past decade, while Nvidia has returned a stunning 26,839% over the same time frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nTo be clear, past performance is no guarantee of future results. It’s unlikely that these stocks will continue to rise at this pace in the years to come, but this illustrates why it’s worth it for dividend investors (and funds) to include lower-yielding dividend-paying growth stocks within their strategies.\n\nFDVV does a good job of mixing lower-yielding, strong performers with higher-yielding, more traditional dividend stocks investors are accustomed to seeing in dividend ETFs. These include energy giants like ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX) and consumer staples blue chips like Pepsi, Philip Morris, and Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG).\n\nFDVV’s holdings collectively receive favorable ratings from TipRanks’ proprietary Smart Score system. The Smart Score is a quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Seven of FDVV’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and Broadcom, ExxonMobil, and Chevron feature “Perfect 10” ratings.\n\nFDVV itself features an Outperform-equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10.\n\nFDVV’s Performance Has Been Solid\n\nThis combination of new-school growth stocks that pay dividends and old-school dividend stocks has generated solid returns over time. As of May 31, FDVV has generated a strong 11.1% annualized return over the past three years and a solid 14.6% annualized return over the past five years.\n\nThis means that the dividend-focused FDVV has actually outperformed the broader market over the past three years, as the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF (NYSEARCA:VOO) has generated an annualized return of 9.6% over this time frame (as of May 31).\n\nHowever, FDVV has slightly lagged VOO over the past five years, as VOO has returned 15.8% annually over a five-year period.\n\nThat said, this is still an admirable five-year return, and FDVV investors can feel good about the total returns the fund has generated for them. An investor who put $100,000 into the fund five years ago would have $186,240 today.\n\nAbove-Average and Growing Dividend\n\nFDVV yields 3.0%, so its dividend yield is double that of the S&P 500. FDVV has been paying a dividend for seven years and has grown its dividend payout for the last three years in a row.\n\nModerate Fees\n\nFDVV charges a very reasonable expense ratio of just 0.15%. This means that the fund charges just $15 annually for every $10,000 invested. Assuming the fund returns 5% per year going forward and maintains this expense ratio, an investor putting $10,000 into the fund will pay just $85 in fees over a five-year period.\n\nIs FDVV Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, FDVV earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 83 Buys, 22 Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average FDVV stock price target of $52.32 implies 11.6% upside potential from current levels.\n\nInvestor Takeaway\n\nI’m bullish on FDVV because I like the way the fund invests in both lower-yielding but high-performing dividend-paying growth stocks like Nvidia and Broadcom and more traditional, higher-yielding but lower-growth dividend stocks like ExxonMobil and Chevron. This sound strategy has led to attractive double-digit annualized returns over time.\n\nFurthermore, FDVV sports an above-average dividend yield of 3.0% and charges an expense ratio of 0.15%. Adding it all up, FDVV looks like a sound choice for investors.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "This article first appeared in the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. Get the newsletter sent directly to your inbox every week by subscribing here.\n\nWhat does a diminished US tech giant look like? European regulators took a step closer to finding out, zeroing in on Apple and what they say are unfair restrictions in its App Store that stifle competition.\n\nThe heightened enforcement highlights Apple’s strategic predicament.\n\nIn a world saturated by high-end hardware — where customers are increasingly reluctant to surrender to endless smartphone upgrades — Apple’s services business has become more important to the company. But by leaning more heavily into App Store commissions and subscriptions, Apple draws more scrutiny to its “walled garden” business approach.\n\nIn preliminary findings, regulators in Brussels contended that Apple violated the Digital Markets Act, a law passed in 2022 designed to address anticompetitive behavior. The EU alleges Apple illegally blocked software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the App Store. The charges are the first to be brought under the European law, giving Apple the unlucky designation of being the first US tech giant to come in its crosshairs.\n\nApple insists that it is in compliance with the law, pointing to changes it has made in recent months and the ability of developers to steer their users to the web to complete purchases. The company will have a chance to formally respond, and the EU will come to a final decision early next year. European regulators are also probing the business practices of Meta and Google to verify their compliance with the law.\n\nApple’s charges in Europe come as legal troubles ratchet up at home. Apple faces antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general who have alleged that the iPhone maker wielded illegal monopoly tactics in the smartphone market.\n\nFrom Wall Street’s point of view, the multiheaded threat seems far off. Apple has only just arrived to the AI party, and its bullish analysts see AI monetization as the next lucrative frontier.\n\nThe ultimate cost of regulatory compliance might mean a splintered tech landscape with more restrictive rules for some markets. But the Apple ecosystem remains unrivaled.\n\nAnd if AI-focused apps fall into place like the prior generation’s, even a more competition-friendly form of gatekeeping will be enough to keep Apple on top.

        "content": "Analysts on Wall Street continue to pound the table on certain turnaround stocks likely to move higher through the year’s second half. With the quarter closing, analysts up and down the street are busy revising their forecasts and ratings on stocks to determine the securities likely to shine through summer into autumn.\n\nWhile not an exact science, analyst ratings can provide a view of a stock’s sentiment and a sense of where the share price is heading. This can be helpful as investors determine where to allocate capital and which stocks to buy and sell. Right now, analysts and traders are praising certain turnaround stocks as great investments.\n\nHere are three turnaround stocks for massive gains.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nDisney (DIS) A Legion of Studio Successes Will Keep Powering Disney Stock Higher\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nInvestment bank Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS) just initiated coverage of Disney (NYSE:DIS) with a “buy” rating and a price target of $125 per share. This implies 23% upside from current levels. Analysts at Goldman Sachs seem to feel that DIS stock has been punished enough. They like that the Mouse House has a hit theatrically released movie with “Inside Out 2” and cite the company’s competitive moats on both the media side of its business and its popular theme parks.\n\nDisney can use Goldman Sachs’s positive outlook. DIS stock has been in the doldrums for years. The company’s share price has declined 27% in the last five years. The stock bounced higher in this year’s first quarter after the company reinstated its quarterly dividend payment but has been treading water since April. Goldman Sachs sees the situation at Disney improving as the company invests heavily in enhancing its theme parks and making them more attractive to tourists.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background.

NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere’s a lot of hand-wringing about Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock after it decreased 13% in three trading days and entered correction territory. (A stock is considered to be in a correction if it declines 10% from recent highs.) Some in the financial press are screaming that a bubble is bursting in stocks associated with artificial intelligence and warning that the semiconductor industry is going down like the Titanic.\n\nWall Street analysts are urging investors to pump the breaks. They stress that the decline is due to profit-taking and option contract expirations as we approach the end of the second quarter on June 30. Several analysts have issued notes to clients saying that Nvidia stock will likely continue rising following the current volatility. At Jeffries (NYSE:JEF), analysts raised their target price on Nvidia stock to $150 from $135 and reiterated a “buy” rating. Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) has added Nvidia stock to its “best ideas.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNVDA stock remained at 158% this year.\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center.

Its shares have been rallying since the company unveiled its AI strategy earlier in June. Melius Research has raised its price target on AAPL stock to $260 a share from $227, saying the company is entering a new iPhone era. At the same time, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) reiterated its “buy” rating on the stock.\n\nAnalysts remain bullish on Apple’s AI strategy, which the company calls “Apple Intelligence.” They think it will lead consumers to upgrade their iPhones to get the AI enhancements and benefits. These include a revamped Siri digital assistant and the addition of OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology on future iPhones. AAPL stock has rallied 10% since its AI strategy became public. Year to date, the share price is up 13%.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in NVDA.

        "title": "Microsoft (MSFT) Faces Charges by EU for Bundling Teams, Office",
        "content": "Microsoft MSFT has been accused of breaching antitrust rules with the “abusive” bundling of its Teams and Office products by the European Union (EU) regulators.\r\n\r\nIn a preliminary finding, EU officials stated that Microsoft has breached the bloc's competition rules by bundling Teams with its popular Office 365 and Microsoft 365 productivity suites for businesses.\r\n\r\nThe potential consequences for Microsoft are significant, with the company facing a possible fine of up to 10% of its global annual revenues, a staggering amount of $211.9 billion in revenues reported for fiscal 2023.\r\n\r\nThe investigation, initiated nearly a year ago, stems from a 2020 complaint by Slack, now owned by Salesforce CRM. Slack alleged that Microsoft's practice of automatically including Teams with its Office software suite gave the communication tool an unfair advantage, stifling competition in the market for remote communication and collaboration tools.\r\n\r\nThe European Commission's preliminary findings suggest that Microsoft's practices may have restricted customer choice and hindered innovation. Specifically, the EU body is concerned that Microsoft has been forcing customers to acquire Teams by automatically bundling it with Office 365 and Microsoft 365 suites since at least April 2019. Furthermore, the Commission believes that interoperability limitations between Teams' competitors and Microsoft's offerings may have exacerbated the situation.\r\n\r\nIn response to earlier concerns, Microsoft had already taken steps to unbundle Teams from its productivity suites in Europe and globally. (Read More: Microsoft Splits Teams and Office to Counter EU Scrutiny)\r\n\r\nHowever, the Commission deemed these changes insufficient, stating that \"more changes to Microsoft's conduct are necessary to restore competition.\" As the investigation proceeds, the outcome could have far-reaching implications for how software suites are packaged and sold in Europe, potentially affecting millions of users and reshaping the competitive landscape in the business productivity software market.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation Price and Consensus Microsoft Corporation Price and Consensus\n\nMicrosoft Corporation price-consensus-chart | Microsoft Corporation Quote\n\nEU Intensifies Crackdown on Big Tech\n\nThis case highlights the EU's ongoing efforts to regulate major technology companies, with recent actions against Microsoft, Apple AAPL and Alphabet GOOGL-owned Google, highlighting the bloc's determination to ensure fair competition in the digital marketplace.\r\n\r\nShares of Microsoft have gained 19% year to date compared with the Zacks Computer and Technology sector, Apple and Alphabet’s growth of 22.4%, 28.4% and 8.1%, respectively. These cases underscore the growing tension between the EU's regulatory ambitions and the business practices of dominant platform providers.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously, Apple finds itself grappling with multiple regulatory challenges in the EU. The company faces its first charges under the bloc's new Digital Markets Act (DMA), accused of preventing app developers from directing users to cheaper options outside the App Store. This action strikes at the heart of Apple's tightly controlled ecosystem and could have far-reaching implications for its business model.\r\n\r\nGoogle is also facing increased scrutiny from EU regulators. The company is under investigation for potentially non-compliant measures related to the DMA's provisions against self-preferencing. The European Commission has expressed concerns that Google's current practices may not treat third-party services fairly in search results, a core issue in the ongoing debate about the power of dominant search engines.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, the European Commission has launched a new investigation into Apple's support for alternative iOS marketplaces, including the company's controversial core technology fee for developers. In response to these regulatory pressures, AAPL has taken the drastic step of announcing the blockage of certain features, including Apple Intelligence, iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing, for EU users, citing security concerns related to DMA compliance.\r\n\r\nFor Microsoft, the outcome of this investigation could have far-reaching consequences. If found in violation of EU antitrust rules, the company not only faces potential financial penalties but may also be forced to make significant changes to its product strategy and distribution model in Europe.\r\n\r\nLooking ahead, this Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) company will need to carefully navigate its product development and marketing strategies to align with evolving regulatory expectations, not just in Europe but potentially worldwide.

        "title": "Apple and FedEx upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls",
        "content": "Apple and FedEx upgraded: Wall Street's top analyst calls\n\nThe most talked about and market moving research calls around Wall Street are now in one place. Here are today's research calls that investors need to know, as compiled by The Fly.\r\n\r\nTop 5 Upgrades:\n\nRosenblatt upgraded Apple(AAPL) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $260, up from $196. Based on the firm's recent U.S. survey, Rosenblatt says strong privacy is \"by far the top feature consumers want in AI,\" so it contends that the unique privacy focus of Apple Intelligence \"could resonate\" and argues for market share lift potential for Apple in AI. JPMorgan upgraded FedEx (FDX) to Overweight from Neutral with a price target of $359, up from $296, following the fiscal Q4 report. The analyst cites the company's strategic option exploration in freight for the upgrade. DA Davidson upgraded Home Depot(HD) to Buy from Neutral with a price target of $395, up from $352. The firm cites a number of reasons for upgrading the stock as the market sits near an all-time high, including Home Depot shares being 19% off of their all-time high set in December 2021 and also 15% off of their 52-week high. Wolfe Research upgraded Robinhood Markets(HOOD) to Outperform from Peer Perform with a $29 price target after meeting with the company's CFO Jason Warnick. The firm came away \"more convicted\" in the strength and durability of Robinhood's earnings growth algorithm and its 2026 GAAP earnings estimate is 70% above consensus. Deutsche Bank upgraded Repligen (RGEN) to Buy from Hold with a price target of $155, down from $180, following a company visit. Repligen is operating at trough EBIT margins and will likely more than double its earnings power by 2027, the analyst tells investors in a research note.\n\nTop 5 Downgrades:\n\nCiti downgraded Sarepta Therapeutics(SRPT) to Neutral from Buy with a price target of $176, up from $172. After the 30% rally post-FDA approval and label expansion of Elevidys, Sarepta is now appropriately valued, the analyst tells investors in a research note. Piper Sandler downgraded Aptiv(APTV) to Underweight from Neutral with a price target of $63, down from $78, after Rivian (RIVN) announced the establishment of a joint venture with Volkswagen (VWAGY). At first glance, the news may seem unrelated to Aptiv, but the rationale for the joint venture is a red flag for the Aptiv thesis, the analyst says. Rosenblatt downgraded Viavi Solutions(VIAV) to Neutral from Buy with an $8.25 price target. The firm cites its \"growing worry\" that the telecom spending weakness of the last two years is more structural than cyclical for the downgrade. Morgan Stanley downgraded Accenture(ACN) to Equal Weight from Overweight with a price target of $300, down from $382. The analyst sees potential valuation compression for the shares from the company's decelerating cloud growth, longer-than-expected time for generative artificial intelligence revenue contribution, and more acquisition spend. TD Cowen downgraded MediaAlpha(MAX) to Hold from Buy with a price target of $13, down from $19. The analyst cites the recent news regarding the company's ongoing investigation with the Federal Trade Commission for the downgrade.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop 5 Initiations:\n\nStifel initiated coverage of Tesla(TSLA) with a Buy rating and $265 price target. The firm thinks the revamped Model 3 and upcoming Model Y refresh should bolster sales, followed by the commencement of its next-generation vehicle Model 2 production, leading it to believe Tesla is very well positioned to deliver robust multi-year growth in 2025-27 and beyond. Citi initiated coverage of Deere(DE) with a Neutral rating and $395 price target. The firm's outlook for machinery \"leans neutral-to-positive,\" reflective of its even split between Buy and Neutral ratings. BTIG initiated coverage of Northrop Grumman(NOC) with a Buy rating and $565 price target. The analyst expects the company to be one of the fastest growing among the defense prime contractors through the remainder of the decade given its exposure to high-growth end markets like space and incumbency on multiple critical programs of record that are deemed critical to national security. Barclays initiated coverage of JFrog(FROG) with an Overweight rating and $50 price target. The analyst says the company benefits from organizations beginning to deploy generative artificial intelligence, which in turn supports a broadening DevOps total addressable market. Barclays initiated coverage of Monday.com(MNDY) with an Overweight rating and $275 price target. The analyst says the company benefits from organizations beginning to deploy generative artificial intelligence, which in turn supports a broadening DevOps total addressable market.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple",
        "content": "Regulatory Clouds Are Mounting Over Apple\n\nOn Monday, EU regulators found that Apple Inc (NASDAQ: AAPL) violated the Digital Markets Act due to its lucrative App Store by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store. Regulators also revealed that they opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU. Apple responded that it is confident that the changes it made in the EU comply with the DMA.\n\nMeanwhile, in the U.S., Apple is defending itself against antitrust charges made by the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. In March, they sued Apple for using illegal tactics to hold on to a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nThe new law designed to rein in tech giants and limit their power is already starting to give Big Tech legal headaches.\n\nThe Digital Markets Act that went into effect in March aims to limit the monopoly power that Apple, Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT), ByteDance, and Meta (NASDAQ: META) enjoy by imposing more restrictive rules around competitive practices. Apple was the first of the tech titans to receive a claim for breaching the DMA by blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAltogether, the European Commission has significantly raised the financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators. As a reminder, Apple already lost to Spotify (NYSE: SPOT) who accused it for abusing its market dominance in the distribution of music streaming apps, and is appealing the court’s decision and consequent $1.95 billion fine. Besides evaluating Apple’s lack of compliance with giving users the freedom of choice and its steering rules, the EC is going after Alphabet to evaluate its measures to prevent self-preferencing the Google search engine over others as well as its steering rules as well. The EC wants to make sure that Alphabet implemented measures to for Google search rivals to be treated in a fair and non-discriminatory manner.\n\nEU watch dogs are also going after Meta for its pay or consent” model. As a gatekeeper, the EC is concerned about Meta being a responsible gatekeeper. EC wants to prevent the accumulation of personal data by gatekeepers and will question if Meta is obtaining consent from users when intending to combine or cross-use their personal data across different core platform services.\n\nStory continues\n\nSince enforcing the Digital Markets Act, the EC is showing that it will make sure that Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, ByteDance, Meta and Microsoft fully comply with the rules. Although this is still a small step to holding the tech titans accountable for their actions, it is a big step in ensuring fair competition in the digital economy and regulating gatekeepers. With Apple, the EC clearly showed it means business.\n\nDISCLAIMER: This content is for informational purposes only.

        "title": "The 7 Smartest Consumer Stocks to Buy With $500 Right Now",
        "content": "Consumers have rarely been under the kind of pressure they face today. Unemployment in May crept up to 4% while inflation stood at 3.3%, unchanged from the month before. With the Federal Reserve holding interest rates steady at 5.25% to 5.5%, the cost of borrowing remains high.\n\nThat’s like why the University of Michigan’s Consumer Sentiment Index fell 5% from April. Many of the jobs being created are just part-time employment forcing families to work two jobs (or more) just to make ends meet. Consumers are forced to turn to using credit cards but delinquencies are on the rise. The Fed says 9% of all credit cards and 8% of auto loans are delinquent.\n\nIt’s a gloomy backdrop and stands at odds with the go-go sentiment on Wall Street. As the market indices hit new all-time highs, consumers are whistling past the graveyard.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvestors, though, can use that to their advantage. While shoppers are reining in their spending to focus on basics, it is uneven as a number of businesses show strength. Below are seven top consumer stocks to buy now that are profiting from the dicey economy.\n\nBest Buy (BBY) A photo of a Best Buy store front.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nConsumer electronics retailer Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) continues to prove its resilience in all markets. It remains profitable even as sales slumped 6.5% due to same-store sales falling 6.1%. Earnings rose to $1.20 per share from $1.15 a year ago. Best Buy stock, however, is up 15% year-to-date and 25% high since reporting earnings one month ago.\n\nThere is good reason for the optimism. The PC market is basically at rock bottom with the potential for a significant sales boost to come. That’s because artificial intelligence (AI) PCs are starting to hit store shelves. They promise to revitalize the market with new power and capabilities that hasn’t been seen in many years.\n\nThe latest AI PC chips from Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) will be released in the coming months and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be bringing its AI-powered M4 chip to all MacBooks.\n\nComputers still account for a large percentage of Best Buy’s revenue. Although segment revenue fell 13% in the first quarter, there could be a surge on the horizon. But even if it doesn’t materialize, Best Buy has shown it is able to navigate treacherous waters profitably.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone\n\nSource: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading global online travel agent Booking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the next consumer stocks to buy now. Despite a glum economy, travel remains a bright spot. Certainly the “revenge travel” phenomenon that followed the pandemic has run its course but the industry is still forecasting growth. While demand this year will be as robust as it was in 2023, consumers are seeking out maximum value for their dollars spent. Booking’s family of platforms helps them achieve it.\n\nStory continues\n\nBooking operates some of the largest travel platforms in the world, including Agoda, Priceline.com and Kayak. It offers an extensive network of properties in almost every country globally making it a natural to attract the largest percentage of travelers.\n\nGlobal room nights increased 17% in 2023 from the year before and are now 24% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. They increased another 9% in the first quarter while rental car days jumped 11% and airline ticket growth soared 33% from the year-ago period.\n\nTravel could very well be pinched if the economy deteriorates further. If inflation doesn’t start heading appreciably lower and the Fed doesn’t cut rates or not as much as expected, it could hurt travel and tourism. But for those who can and will travel, turning to Booking Holdings for the opportunity will make it smooth sailing.\n\nCrocs (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nFootwear specialist Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) stumbled over the acquisition last year of the HeyDude brand but quickly picked itself up and dusted itself off. Due to the ongoing strength of its core plastic shoe, CROX stock is up 65% in 2024 and has doubled off its 52-week low.\n\nIt seems hard to believe the staying power of Crocs shoes. Initially a favorite amongst healthcare workers and others who were on their feet all day, the brand found favor in all segments of the market, even internationally. Sales in foreign markets are growing faster than domestic sales and have almost reached parity.\n\nAt the start of the year I noted how robust Crocs brand sales were and highlighted the stock’s very attractive valuations. “This is a deeply discounted stock with a still-valuable brand name that can run higher,” I wrote at the time but the case remains true today.\n\nDespite the phenomenal run-up in the stock, Crocs still trades at 11 times trailing earnings and estimates, goes for twice its sales and a bargain-basement 11x the free cash flow (FCF) it produces. CROX stock will wear out a lot of shoe leather as it runs higher from here.\n\nGenuine Parts (GPC) Hands holding a smartphone with the Genuine Parts (GPC) logo displayed.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nAftermarket auto parts retailer Genuine Parts (NYSE:GPC) is a stock primed to take advantage of this dicey economy and any recovery that follows.\n\nElevated inflation and interest rates have taken a toll on both new and used car sales. Although prices are down from their post-pandemic record, financing a new car is still too expensive. Dealers are resorting to incentives once again to lure in buyers and reduce rising inventories. It’s not much better for used car values either as those dealer incentives keep buyers away from used car lots.\n\nIt makes it better just to keep your existing car working. The average age of all vehicles on the road has crept up to 12.6 years but for cars it stands at 14 years. Buying parts to keep them working is keeping Genuine Parts busy. It operates the NAPA Auto Parts chain of retail stores.\n\nGlobal automotive sales rose 2% in the first quarter to $3.6 billion with segment profits rising 3.2% to $273 million.\n\nThe auto parts stock raised its full-year earnings guidance to $9.88 per share at the midpoint from its previous estimate of $9.80 per share. With the stock up less than 2% in 2024 and trading at just 13 times next year’s earnings estimates Genuine Parts is a solid consumer stock to buy.\n\nSkechers (SKX) photo of man practicing parkour, jumping on tall cement wall in black sneakers\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/areporter\n\nAnother footwear specialist deserving your attention is sneaker-maker Skechers (NYSE:SKX). The company is targeting $10 billion in sales eventually and while the North American market remains an important component of that, it is sales to international markets that will push it over the threshold.\n\nForeign sales of Skechers sneakers represent 65% of total revenue of $2.25 billion, which was a company record. They are also growing twice as fast as domestic sales, 15.2% versus 7.8%. More importantly, the direct-to-consumer (DTC) market is what is firing that growth, here and abroad. That’s key because DTC sales cut out the middleman and boost profits. Gross profit margins on DTC sales stands at 65.7% whereas the wholesale market is 44.7%.\n\nThe growth also suggests Skechers hasn’t lost any consumer mindshare over the years. They still find its footwear desirable and are willing to pay up for it.\n\nSkechers stock is up 15% year-to-date and more than 56% above recent lows. Yet shares still trade at an attractive 11 times earnings estimates, less than twice sales and 17x FCF.\n\nChewy (CHWY) chewy mobile app open screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, U.S. owners will spend $150.6 billion on their pets this year, up 2.4% from the $147 billion they spent in 2023. The greaterst percentage will be spent on food and treats, or some $64.4 billion, with another $38.3 billion going to veterinarian care and products.\n\nThat plays to the strengths of online petcare retailer Chewy (NASDAQ:CHWY). The majority of its sales come from pet food and treats but also supplies, pet medications and petcare products. The retailer is also expanding into new channels such as veterinary clinics, which hold the promise of higher margins. In April, Chewy opened its first two clinics and more are expected soon.\n\nBecause of the ongoing trend towards humanizing our pets, consumers are willing to spend more and pay up, whether its for food, toys or vet care. It provides a large, motivating force behind Chewy stock. Shares have bounced 70% off their 52-week low but with renewed sales strength the stock should go higher still.\n\ne.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt looked as though e.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) had run its course. The cosmetics and beauty care company had tripled in value last year but after starting off 2024 strong, stumbled hard. Shares lost more than a quarter of their value. That’s now a thing of the past. ELF stock is up 42% year-to-date and should keep charging ahead.\n\nAs I noted last month before the rebound, teens view e.l.f. Beauty as the No. 1 cosmetics brand in the country. According to Piper Sandler’s Taking Stock With Teens semi-annual survey, e.l.f. has a 38% share of the market, 16 percentage points more than the next leading brand. And teens are spending more money on cosmetics than at any time since 2018. The survey found teens are spending an average of $339 on cosmetics.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $205 per share and though it looks expensive at 98 times earnings, that very much in line with its average over the past five years. It is somewhat elevated over the period since it went public but a good argument could be made that it is worth the premium being charged.\n\nParticularly during difficult economic times, cosmetics are an items consumers are willing to splurge on. e.l.f. Beauty remains a smart consumer stock to buy today.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in GPC stock.

        "content": "Though crypto largely eclipsed its underlying technology, smart investors aren’t losing their grasp on blockchain’s long-term potential. The World Economic Forum recently published a lengthy piece describing many potential applications of blockchain tech, including luxury good authentication, personal data management and even advanced integrations with artificial intelligence and spatial computing.\n\nEven the Catholic Church is leveraging blockchain tech; in this case, the Vatican is converting printed manuscripts and books within its massive library and collections into NFTs in one example of “showcasing the utility of blockchain technology in safeguarding cultural heritage.”\n\nThe tricky part, of course, is determining which blockchain stocks to buy that offer long-term exposure to blockchain opportunities while minimizing the grift, fraud and general haze of questionable certainty of associated crypto asset classes in the meantime. But, in my mind, these blockchain stocks offer the best opportunity to do so — if you can stomach the volatility in the meantime.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nConsulting firm Accenture (NYSE:ACN) might seem like an unusual pick among blockchain stocks to buy, given its professional services-based business model. However, Accenture sets itself apart from other consulting competitors by being one of the few multinational mega-cap firms offering a comprehensive suite of blockchain-based services. These include blockchain business integration, metaverse management, supply chain optimization and digital identity management.\n\nAs blockchain technology continues to evolve and more businesses of various sizes and industries explore its potential to address diverse challenges, a need for specialized consulting services to tailor blockchain solutions will become increasingly pressing. Accenture’s early and large-scale investment in this niche positions it for long-term growth and success in the blockchain consulting arena.\n\nAt the same time, Accenture’s wide-ranging professional services set it apart from more speculative blockchain stocks and help ground it. The company’s most recent report included expanding operating margins and continued dividend strength but, notably, also saw generative AI sales surge as the company positions itself as a tech consulting leader able to address a range of emergent opportunities.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nLike Accenture, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) actively assists businesses in integrating blockchain technology into their daily operations. However, Broadcom’s role is more technical, providing the essential infrastructure and security needed to implement and manage blockchain across various applications. This pivot towards blockchain services is a strategic move to diversify Broadcom’s revenue streams, addressing a longstanding challenge for the stock, especially following its VMware acquisition.\n\nStory continues\n\nHistorically, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has contributed over 20% of Broadcom’s revenue through its 5G and wireless component segments. However, with VMware’s cloud computing synergies and a growing focus on blockchain technology, Broadcom is effectively reducing its dependency on a single major client. Investors should note that the VMware integration will incur about $1 billion in transaction costs in the short term, and, unfortunately, VMWare’s first quarter under its new parent company didn’t offer the performance some hoped. Still, even as there’s valid criticism that the stock is overvalued fundamentally, those interested in long-term blockchain stocks to buy will find something to like in Broadcom.\n\nBlock (SQ) Block logo over a background with former square logo. SQ stock.\n\nSource: Sergei Elagin / Shutterstock\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) is doubling down on its blockchain stock identity. After a few months of beta testing, the fintech stock is slowly bringing its physical crypto wallet offerings to market. The saying, “Not your keys, not your crypto,” underscores Block’s appeal to customers wary of third-party custodianships, such as that provided by its subsidiary CashApp. BitKey, Block’s wallet, is unique compared to similar offerings in that owners can transact across three domains: via digital app, through the physical hardware and through an emergency access option housed within Block’s servers to protect against theft or loss of the primary device.\n\nBeyond its blockchain ventures, Block stands out as a distinctive player in the broader fintech space even as shares slumped throughout 2024, largely due to wider economic unease and monetary policy. Still, the company combines the stability of a large enterprise with the agility and innovative spirit of a startup.\n\nThe company’s first-quarter report included a whopping 22% year-over-year gross profit increase alongside massively improved margins almost across the board. The company also quadrupled net income, making Block perhaps the most undervalued blockchain stock in today’s market.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Wednesday?",
        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Wednesday?\n\nAnalysts on Tuesday said that Taiwan’s Semiconductor Industry should maintain its global lead for at least the next eight to ten years.\n\nThey urged the government to ensure the country’s research security and develop a “grand strategy” considering changing supply chains.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM), headquartered in Taiwan, led global foundry revenue in the first quarter. It is a crucial supplier of Nvidia Corp and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nAlso Read: What’s Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Tuesday?\n\nChina’s state-backed Semiconductor Manufacturing International Co TSMC held a 62% market share in the first quarter.\n\nAt a forum called “Taiwan in the era of techno-geopolitics” in Taipei hosted by the new think tank Research Institute for Democracy, Society, and Emerging Technology (DSET), veteran analyst Ray Yang said he believes Taiwan’s semiconductor industry will maintain its competitive edge for another eight to 10 years, Focus Taiwan reports.\n\nRay Yang, consulting director at the Industry, Science and Technology International Strategy Center, stated, “Next year, the industry will utilize 2-nanometer process technology, and I believe Taiwan will continue to dominate until at least the 9-angstrom generation.”\n\nDuring these partnerships, Yang emphasized the importance of international collaboration and the need to protect Taiwan’s research security.\n\nMeanwhile, Taiwan’s Semiconductor Industry is facing geopolitical pressure linked to the U.S. concerns that most of the IC manufacturing is happening in Asia. However, it should still reach a mutually beneficial compromise with Washington, Taipei Times cited a former TSMC executive.\n\nKonrad Young, a former TSMC R&D director, told at the DSET forum that the semiconductor industry faces risks from US-China trade tensions-driven “geopolitics 2.0.”\n\nAccording to Young, “geopolitics 2.0” is a contemporary version of what he called “geopolitics 1.0,” which took place in the 1980s when the U.S., feeling threatened by Japan, sought to dismantle its dominance in the semiconductor industry. He noted that the current risk stems from the U.S.’s concerns amid its trade frictions with China, particularly the potential loss of Taiwan’s competitive edge if Taiwanese companies are asked to set up factories in the U.S.\n\nHowever, Young pointed out that American companies, including top IC firms such as Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), still rely heavily on TSMC for their chip manufacturing needs. This reliance makes it unlikely that the U.S. government would take actions resulting in mutually assured destruction.\n\nStory continues\n\nYoung also called for cooperation with non-US countries such as Europe, Japan, Southeast Asia, and even the Middle East, which have invested in the industry.\n\nTSMC stock gained over 72% in the last 12 months, buoyed by the artificial intelligence frenzy.\n\nPrice Action: At the last check on Wednesday, TSM shares traded higher by 0.21% to $172.96 premarket.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Jack Hong via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Wednesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "Huawei Technologies has emerged as the big winner in China's smartphone market for the recently-concluded midyear 618 shopping festival with the biggest jump in sales and the smallest discounts, according to the latest data from Counterpoint Research.\n\nHuawei sales jumped 42.4 per cent during the one-month 618 sales period that started May 20, according to Counterpoint, which attributed the rise to continued strong demand for the company's latest handsets, including those from the Mate 60 and Pura 70 series that run on China-made chips. The company also offered the smallest price discounts relative to major rivals, Counterpoint said.\n\nApple has been able to defend its position ahead of Huawei by offering its largest-ever discounts for iPhones in China, helping to boost sales by 2.7 per cent year on year amid intensifying competition in the premium segment. Counterpoint figures put Apple as the second-best seller by sales volume for the period, behind Vivo and ahead of Honor, Xiaomi and Huawei.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe 618 festival is China's biggest shopping season after Singles' Day. Amid a sluggish economy, e-commerce operators sought to attract more consumers this year by cancelling the traditional presale stage and extending the promotional period, which ran through June 20.\n\nTotal smartphone sales volume for the 32-day period grew 6.8 per cent compared with the same period in 2023, according to Counterpoint. The sales performance indicates a warm-up in demand, Counterpoint said, adding that it anticipates low single-digit year-on-year growth for China's smartphone market this year.\n\nEstimates from TechInsights are more pessimistic. It reported a 2 per cent decline in smartphone sales volume to 13.1 million units during the 618 festival. It expects the market to stay flat at 62.3 billion yuan (US$8.6 billion) this year.\n\nSlower growth in online shopping and the rapid rise of live-streaming e-commerce have made the traditional sales campaigns associated with shopping festivals less attractive to consumers, TechInsights analyst Peng Peng wrote in a report.\n\n\"Escalated worries about the downturn of China's economy\", including in the real estate and job markets, are also holding back consumer spending, Peng added.\n\nWhile Huawei saw the biggest growth in sales, Apple remained king in terms of sales volume and value, according to TechInsights.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple's iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max emerged as not only the most popular models in the 6,000 yuan price range, but also across all segments on the e-commerce platform JD.com. It is the latest indication of Apple's continued dominance in China's premium smartphone market, Peng wrote.\n\nHuawei came in third by sales value, after Xiaomi, and is growing as a major challenger in the high-end market, TechInsights data showed.\n\nChina's major e-commerce platforms saw gross merchandise value grow 13.6 per cent year on year during the 618 shopping festival, according to research firm Analysys. However, companies have largely stopped publishing their own sales figures for big shopping festivals.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Bigger Than Nvidia in 2030",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) is already reshaping the corporate world. Chatbot applications like OpenAI's ChatGPT can instantly craft text, images, videos, and computer code on command, which could drive a productivity boom worth trillions of dollars across the global economy.\n\nDeveloping those AI applications wouldn't be possible without the data center graphics processing units (GPUs) designed by Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). They contributed to an astronomical 427% increase in Nvidia's data center revenue in the recent quarter, pushing sales to a record $22.6 billion.\n\nThat growth is the reason Nvidia's valuation recently topped $3.2 trillion, making it one of the largest companies in the world.\n\nNvidia's incredible run won't last forever\n\nArtificial general intelligence (AGI) describes the point when AI matches human intelligence across most cognitive tasks. Some researchers -- including one who worked for OpenAI -- believe AGI could be achieved as soon as 2027 given the lightning-fast pace of development.\n\nAs is the case with most technologies, the continued advancement of AI beyond that point could yield diminishing returns. In other words, the number of commercial workloads that could benefit from machine intelligence beyond AGI is probably quite small. If that's the case, data center operators won't have to buy every new version of Nvidia's GPUs because the pool of developers who want (or can afford) the performance increase will also shrink.\n\nThat could put the brakes on Nvidia's growth by the end of this decade.\n\nCathie Wood's Ark Investment Management has been a consistent seller of Nvidia stock this year. Wood believes software companies could generate $8 of revenue for every $1 they invest in Nvidia's chips, so she feels that's where the next opportunity lies. Ark is joined by several billionaire fund managers who have also trimmed their Nvidia holdings recently.\n\nWall Street thinks Nvidia will generate $3.61 in earnings per share in fiscal 2026, giving its stock a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 35.2. The Nasdaq-100 index trades at a P/E ratio of 31.9 today, so if you believe Nvidia will trade at a market multiple over the long term, investors who buy the stock now will have to wait two years before its earnings catch up to the recent run in its stock price.\n\nOf course, Nvidia stock could also achieve a cheaper P/E ratio by falling. Whichever scenario plays out, here's why I think AI titans Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL), and Alphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) will be worth more than the chip giant by 2030.\n\nStory continues Image source: Microsoft.\n\n1. Microsoft\n\nWith a market cap of $3.3 trillion, Microsoft is already slightly bigger than Nvidia. However, if Cathie Wood is right about software being the next big AI opportunity, Microsoft is making all the right moves to extend its market cap advantage through the end of this decade.\n\nAfter announcing plans to invest $10 billion in OpenAI last year, Microsoft used the start-up's latest GPT-4 models to create an AI assistant called Copilot. It's available with most of Microsoft's flagship software products.\n\nFor example, businesses can now pay an additional monthly subscription fee to access the Copilot-enabled version of 365 (Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and more). With 400 million enterprise seats potentially eligible for that upgrade, it could translate into billions of dollars in extra annual recurring revenue for Microsoft.\n\nMicrosoft's Azure cloud platform has also become a distributor of the latest AI models for tens of thousands of organizations. That includes 65% of the Fortune 500 companies that are using the Azure OpenAI Service to build their own AI applications, utilizing large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 as a base.\n\nMicrosoft is on track to generate $244.9 billion in total revenue in fiscal 2024 (ending June 30), which is more than Nvidia is expected to generate nearly two years from now. Plus, Microsoft's current P/E ratio of 38.1 is a whopping 45% discount to Nvidia's current P/E ratio of 70.2. It's actually closer to where Nvidia's P/E ratio is expected to be in fiscal 2026, as I highlighted earlier.\n\nMicrosoft has a track record of success spanning almost five decades, and so long as the company continues to grow on the top and bottom lines, its market cap will likely increase in the coming years, whereas Nvidia faces downside risks.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple is another $3 trillion giant, and it might also have an edge over Nvidia in the long run thanks to its incredible hardware and software ecosystem. There are more than 2.2 billion active Apple devices worldwide, led by the flagship iPhone, and the company will use that installed base to become the largest distributor of AI to consumers.\n\nIt will achieve that through Apple Intelligence, which is set to launch in September within the new iOS 18 operating system. It was developed in partnership with OpenAI, so it will feature industry-leading models that promise to transform Apple's existing software. For example, the Siri voice assistant will draw on the expansive knowledge of ChatGPT, and apps like Mail, Notes, and Messages will be overhauled with a host of new writing tools to help users draft content more quickly.\n\nApple Intelligence is expected to drive a large upgrade cycle when the hotly anticipated iPhone 16 launches later this year, because rumors suggest it will feature a more powerful chip designed specifically for processing AI workloads. This will unlock a much faster experience for users who wish to lean on AI day-to-day.\n\nWall Street expects Apple to generate $386 billion in revenue during fiscal 2024 (ending September 30), which is more than Microsoft and Nvidia combined in their current fiscal years. Plus, Apple trades at a P/E ratio of 32.2 at the moment, so it's cheaper than both of its $3 trillion peers.\n\nWhile Nvidia is already reaping substantial financial rewards from AI, Apple's AI story is only just beginning, and it could have much more long-term potential given the sheer size of its ecosystem. Image source: Alphabet.\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet is the parent company of Google, YouTube, Waymo, and DeepMind. Google Search currently dominates the internet search industry with a 90% market share, but there have been concerns about AI applications like ChatGPT eroding its advantage. Simply put, chatbots offer a more convenient way to access information compared to traditional search, which requires the user to sift through web pages for answers.\n\nAlphabet responded to that threat by launching a series of AI chatbots of its own, culminating in the new Gemini models. Plus, the traditional Google Search experience now uses generative AI to provide users with text-based answers to their queries at the top of the page, saving them from visiting third-party web pages.\n\nThose two initiatives should protect the platform's dominance, and there was evidence of that in the first quarter of 2024. Revenue generated from Google Search increased by 14.3% compared to the year-ago period, marking the fastest growth rate in almost two years.\n\nPlus, Alphabet now offers Gemini to existing Google Workspace subscribers for an additional fee, where they can integrate it with Gmail, Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more to help users boost their productivity with AI. It's similar to the way Microsoft is offering Copilot for 365, and it effectively creates a new recurring revenue stream for Alphabet.\n\nAlphabet stock trades at a P/E ratio of about 27.5 right now, so not only is it much cheaper than Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple, but it's also cheaper than the Nasdaq-100 index. If Cathie Wood is right about AI software, Alphabet stock looks like an absolute bargain right now compared to Nvidia.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "You’ve Been Warned! 3 Nanotech Stocks to Buy Now or Regret Forever.",
        "content": "Nanotech stocks are among the hottest plays in the market right now, thanks to analysts predicting astronomical growth for the market. For example, Fortune Business Insights forecasted the market would grow to $91.18 billion in 2024 and reach $332.73 billion by 2032.\n\nThe CHIPS Act and other legislative moves by the U.S. are further bolstering the appeal of investing in nanotech stocks, committing $52.7 billion in semiconductors, including $39 billion in manufacturing incentives and $13.2 billion in R&D and workforce development.\n\nThe National Nanotechnology Initiative (NNI) is perhaps the biggest undertaking regarding the tech concept on U.S. shores, with 30 federal agencies participating in the initiative, underscoring the importance of nanotechnology, which bodes well for stocks in the space as well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTo achieve national objectives, the highest-ever NNI budget request is $2.16 billion in 2024 for basic and application-driven R&D. Because of the trade war with China, the number is likely to go up; China has the most nanotech startup companies in the world.\n\nConsidering the strategic importance of nanotech stocks, the market size on offer and the U.S. government taking this area very seriously, it’s no surprise investors are encircling this area.\n\nBut the methodology to select nanotech stocks needs to be simple: Do not go for stocks rated laggards by analysts, and don’t invest in stocks without any upside left. Having a streak of earnings beats also helps.\n\nApplied Materials (AMAT) Applied Materials (AMAT) company sign outside office\n\nSource: michelmond / Shutterstock.com\n\nApplied Materials (NASDAQ:AMAT) is unique among nanotech firms because selective tungsten coating densifies and improves transistor performance. AMAT has risen 44% year-to-date, and analysts estimate an average price goal of $240.91, or over 5% upside, which is fantastic for nanotech companies.\n\nNanotech stocks are riskier due to the technology, so choose a proven performer like AMAT, which has met Wall Street estimates 9 times in 12 quarters.\n\nIn Q2 2024, AMAT reported net sales of $6.65 billion, up from $6.63 billion, and net income of $1.72 billion, resulting in diluted EPS of $2.06, up from $1.86.\n\nBut AMAT predicts sales of $6.25 billion to $7.05 billion and EPS of $1.83 to $2.19 in the third quarter of fiscal 2024. This prediction disappointed experts, causing market caution.\n\nThe leading nanotech stock AMAT works on several nanotech initiatives outside of financials. UVision SP brightfield inspection equipment from Applied Materials solved Albany NanoTech’s immersion lithography defect inspection problems. Plus, modern laser polarization technology boosted semiconductor production by finding 30nm defects.​\n\nStory continues\n\nAdditionally, SEMVision G4 improved 2nm defect evaluation. SEM column technology and a multi-perspective SEM imaging system make this system the standard for sophisticated semiconductor examination.​\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) gets plenty of analyst love among nanotech stocks because of consistent performance, holding a Strong Buy rating with a $178.13 price target, a potential upside of over 6%.\n\nIn Q1 2024, TSMC earned $1.38 per share, above the estimate of $1.31. Sales were $18.87 billion, above the projected $18.41 billion, demonstrating the company’s resilience and efficiency notwithstanding global economic issues.​\n\nTSMC, Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) only supplier of iPhone and iPad A-series semiconductors, generates a lot of money from major IT companies. AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), gaming and data center titans, also use TSMC high-performance chips.\n\nThe company is upgrading vehicle chip products using 3nm technology to make automobiles more powerful and minimize energy use; it’s also studying MRAM and RRAM to enhance car microcontrollers.\n\nTSMC leads emerging semiconductor technology for 2-nanometer devices, making it the best company compared to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Samsung.\n\nThe company will invest $17.36 billion to prepare for long-term size and technological expansion. Under its development ambitions, TSMC aims to construct a $12 billion Arizona chip facility. This factory will make 5-nanometer circuits for next-generation technologies. Once the project is finalized in 2024, TSMC can better fulfill global demand.\n\nBoth TSMC and NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) are developing a $7.8 billion computer wafer facility in Singapore. This joint firm will be owned by TSMC-affiliate Vanguard. TSMC will find local manufacturing simpler.\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (TMO) A Thermo Fisher Scientific sign out front of an office in Silicon Valley, California.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nThermo Fisher Scientific (NYSE:TMO) has the most potential for growth out of the three nanotech stocks we looked at. Based on an average price target of $630.21, analysts think shares will grow over 11%.\n\nThe company showed a number of new nanotechnology and related technologies at the ASMS 2024 meeting. The new Stellar mass spectrometer from TMO makes clinical study and precise medicine better.\n\nThermo Fisher also released new versions of its Orbitrap Ascend Tribrid Mass Spectrometer, which can be used for biopharma, structural biology and multiomics. Also, the company’s Vanquish Neo UHPLC device makes mass spectrometers better at collecting data and moving samples through them.\n\nTMO has beaten Wall Street predictions in three of the last four quarters, most recently by about 20%, beating an EPS estimate of $4.7. And the growth story shows no signs of slowing down. Analysts expect its EPS to rise by around 12% in fiscal 2025.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "EU keeps flexing its antitrust muscles with US tech giants",
        "content": "The EU keeps turning up the heat on US tech giants.\n\nEuropean regulators hit Microsoft (MSFT) with an antitrust charge Tuesday, one day after the same regulatory body charged Apple (AAPL) with violating European Union competition law.\n\nThe European Commission (EC), the EU’s antitrust authority, said it informed Microsoft of its view that the tech giant had been illegally bundling — or \"tying\" — its Teams software to other proprietary business software, including Office 365 and Microsoft 365. Microsoft offices in Issy-les-Moulineaux near Paris, France. (REUTERS/Gonzalo Fuentes) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nTying the software applications together, according to the EC, violates the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union (TFEU), which prohibits abuse of dominant market positions.\n\nFines for violations can run up to 10% of a company’s worldwide annual revenue. For Microsoft, global revenue in 2023 totaled $212 billion.\n\nMicrosoft president Brad Smith said the company has already untethered Teams from some of its other software products.\n\n\"We appreciate the additional clarity provided today and will work to find solutions to address the commission‘s remaining concerns,\" he said.\n\nThe EC on Monday took a similar step against Apple, informing the iPhone maker that the rules for its lucrative App Store violated a different antitrust law — the EU’s recently enacted Digital Markets Act (DMA) — by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the store.\n\nApple defended its practices, saying, \"We are confident our plan complies with the law.\"\n\nThe actions this week are the latest examples of how the EU is making life a lot more challenging for businesses across the globe.\n\nThe 27-nation bloc has aggressively adopted new laws meant to police personal data and social media content, as well as the dominance of Big Tech. It has sued to block mergers, and it readied the world’s first comprehensive legislation to police artificial intelligence.\n\nThe EU, which was created in 1993, has a long history of moving more aggressively in its regulation of businesses than the US. European Union flags fly outside the European Commission headquarters in Brussels, Belgium. (REUTERS/Johanna Geron) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nIt even chalked up some early victories. In 2001, its antitrust stance doomed a $42 billion proposed merger between GE and Honeywell, even though that industrial union had received approval in the US.\n\nIn 2007, it adopted broad environmental legislation that pushed chemical companies around the globe to adhere to new restrictions.\n\nIn more recent years, the EU’s attempt to rein in tech giants has become a core focus. The EU's first major tech legislation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), went into effect in 2018.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt is designed to protect consumer privacy and security and imposes obligations on companies anywhere in the world as long as they \"target or collect data related to people in the EU.\"\n\nThe EU then added two more laws in subsequent years — the Digital Markets Act and Digital Services Act— that attempt to curb the dominance of Big Tech companies like Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Microsoft, and the content of major online social media and e-commerce sites.\n\nThe charges announced this week against Microsoft and Apple are detailed in separate legal filings, or statements of objection, that detail the EC’s investigative evidence and justifications for its claims. An Apple store in Munich, Germany. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nIn its statement outlining the charges against Microsoft, the EC said the tech giant’s practices may have granted Teams a distribution advantage because customers had no choice about whether to acquire access to Teams when subscribing to the company’s software productivity applications.\n\nThe commission went on to say that Microsoft imposed interoperability limitations on competing software with Teams, and that those limitations may have prevented competition, stifled innovation, and disadvantaged consumers.\n\nComplaints over Microsoft’s software bundles originated back in 2020 when Salesforce-owned Slack, a business software competitor, claimed the company was abusing its market power.\n\nThe EC’s investigations into the matter led Microsoft in October 2023 to untether Teams from some of its other software products. In April, it applied the change globally.\n\nMicrosoft will now have an opportunity to present its own evidence in response to the objections before the EC issues a final decision on whether or not the bloc’s antitrust laws were breached.\n\nThe EC’s final determinations are handled through administrative proceedings without a trial. However, appeals from the Commission’s final determination can be made to the European Court of Justice.\n\nAlexis Keenan is a legal reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) popped more than 3% on Tuesday morning, reversing a three-day slide that erased roughly $430 billion of the AI chip giant's market cap.\n\nShares declined nearly 13% since Thursday as investors rotated out of the stock, which hit a record-high close exactly one week ago when it briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nThe chip heavyweight gave back that title as the three-day sell-off commenced.\n\n\"I think it's way overblown. I don't think people should be nervous about what's happening with Nvidia,\" Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\n\n“I would use this weakness as an opportunity,\" he added, noting the timing of the decline.\n\n“We’re at the end of the quarter, so it’s a quarter-marking period. You’ve got a lot of big assets that are trying to reshuffle and rebalance,\" he said.\n\nPolcari added he wouldn't be surprised if the stock slid \"another 5% or 8%.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's market cap climbed back to hover around the $3 trillion market cap, though it was still below the valuations of Microsoft or Apple (AAPL).\n\nNvidia has played a pivotal role in buoying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) to repeated record highs in 2024.

        "content": "Nvidia stock (NVDA) popped more than 5% on Tuesday, reversing a three-day slide that erased roughly $430 billion of the AI chip giant's market cap.\n\nShares had declined nearly 13% since Thursday as investors rotated out of the stock, which hit a record-high close exactly one week ago when it briefly surpassed Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nThe chip heavyweight gave back that title as the three-day sell-off commenced.\n\n\"I think it's way overblown. I don't think people should be nervous about what's happening with Nvidia,\" Kenny Polcari, managing partner at Kace Capital Advisors, told Yahoo Finance on Tuesday.\n\n“I would use this weakness as an opportunity,\" he added, noting the timing of the decline.\n\n“We’re at the end of the quarter, so it’s a quarter-marking period. You’ve got a lot of big assets that are trying to reshuffle and rebalance,\" he said.\n\nPolcari added he wouldn't be surprised if the stock slid \"another 5% or 8%.”\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia's market cap climbed back to hover around the $3 trillion level, though it was still below the valuations of Microsoft or Apple (AAPL).\n\nNvidia has played a pivotal role in buoying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) to repeated record highs in 2024.

        "title": "A small group of tech stocks is driving the market rally — why that's 'not a flaw'",
        "content": "This year's stock market rally has been led by just a few large tech names.\n\nWhile it might seem concerning to have too much riding on a handful of stocks, strategists say the trend may not be a bad thing for markets.\n\n\"We see a small group of tech winners leading stock gains as a feature of the artificial intelligence (AI) theme — not a flaw,\" Jean Boivin, head of BlackRock Investment Institute, wrote in a research note on Monday. \"We stay overweight U.S. stocks.\"\n\nAI darling Nvidia (NVDA) has accounted for nearly one-third of the S&P 500's gains this year, and outperformance in quarterly results from large-cap tech continues to be a reason why earnings for the S&P 500 are growing year over year.\n\nAs of Monday's close, Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Broadcom (AVGO) had also contributed more than a quarter of the major index's gains.\n\nOne potential concern is that the market could be at risk if a few large tech companies that have driven a lion's share of the gains stop surprising to the upside.\n\nHowever, research from Morgan Stanley's chief investment officer, Mike Wilson, shows this might not be an issue.\n\nWilson found roughly 20% of the top 500 stocks are outperforming the broader index over a rolling one-month period. This is the lowest percentage of companies outperforming in Wilson's dataset dating back to 1965.\n\nWilson's work noted that after similar narrow breadth readings where less than 35% of companies are outperforming the index on a one-month basis, the S&P 500 rose about 4% on average over the next six months.\n\n\"Narrow breadth can persist but it's not necessarily a headwind to forward returns in and of itself,\" Wilson said. \"We believe broadening is likely to be limited to high quality/large cap pockets for now.\"\n\nWilson argued that when considering the impact of high interest rates on corporations, this makes sense. Investors have flooded large-market-cap stocks that have held up well in the higher rate environment and are seeing earnings grow more than their smaller peers.\n\nAnd a slew of recent upgrades to year-end S&P 500 targets reflect similar sentiment. Three Wall Street firms cited tech outperformance as part of the reason the index is doing better than they initially thought this year.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his target to 6,000 from 4,750, citing the \"early innings of AI\" and a market supported by the \"persistence of AI exuberance.\" Citi's Scott Chronert bumped his year-end target to 5,600 from 5,100 noting \"the weighting effect of the mega cap growth cohort is exerting an outsized influence on index price action.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200, highlighting that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nGoldman Sachs laid out an alternative scenario to their base case call for 5,600 on the S&P 500, where the benchmark skyrockets to 6,300 by the end of the year. This, Goldman's team wrote, would be driven by \"further mega-cap exceptionalism.\"\n\nSnider told Yahoo Finance this possibility would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\" Snider added that such a scenario leaves investors \"vulnerable\" to a few stocks beating expectations. But it still comes with an upside.\n\n\"The beauty of the S&P 500 index ownership in general, which is when a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now. So I think most investors who own the S&P 500 are very happy with what's happened, even if it means their underlying portfolios are more concentrated,\" Snider said.

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Buy if You Are Looking to Build Wealth",
        "content": "If you’re scouting for fintech stocks to buy, now is the right time to hop in.\n\nThe fintech space is ripe with potential. Digital banks are at the forefront, transforming how we interact with our finances through easy-to-use interfaces. This shift is not just a technological one. It is about creating opportunities for investors willing to get on the board of a wave of significant development.\n\nAccording to Fortune Business Insights, the global fintech market is projected to skyrocket from $294.74 billion in 2023 to an astounding $1.15 trillion by 2032, marking a 16.5% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2024 to 2032. This growth shows how sizzling the fintech industry is, making it a cash cow for investors.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInvesting wisely is crucial, though. Global interest rates are predicted to fall through 2024 and 2025, creating a conducive environment for fintech. High-growth companies have unique products and services and solid business strategies. Therefore, consider buying these three fintech stocks, as they stand out from the rest of the crowd.\n\nFintech Stocks to Buy: Visa (V) Visa logo outside of an office building\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is a juggernaut in the electronic payment industry that offers fast and effective credit and debit card services for cross-border transactions. The company boasts an impressive annual growth rate of 21% and a reliable dividend yield that has grown for 15 consecutive years, making it ideal for long-term investors.\n\nFinancially, Visa is highly profitable, with a trailing twelve-month (TTM) gross profit margin of over 97.8% and a net income margin of over 50%. The company continues to impress with a 10% year-over-year (YOY) net income and revenue increase in the second quarter of 2024. Additionally, Visa has showcased commitment to its shareholders, earmarking a large $3.8 billion for share buybacks and dividends.\n\nVisa is also actively diversifying its market presence and adjusting to new trends, like cryptocurrency. It has collaborated with different crypto firms to add these choices to its payment system. This progressive strategy puts Visa in the right place for future growth.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nPayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), one of the most popular fintech stocks, has fallen from its high of nearly $300 in 2021 to around $60. Nevertheless, analysts are looking for the silver lining and expect the company to gain 23% from its current value. While competing with other giants in the technology industry, such as Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), PayPal achieved a 9% YOY bump in its Q1 2024 revenues.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe business is already branching out, particularly into the cryptocurrency realm. Its latest offering, the PayPal USD (PYUSD-USD) stablecoin that integrates with the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain, indicates that there may be more opportunities for creative expansion in the years ahead. With $17.7 billion in cash, cash equivalents, and investments, PayPal is well-positioned to handle these expanding horizons.\n\nAdditionally, PayPal has proved its stability by repurchasing $5.1 billion in stock in the past year. The business intends to buy back an additional $5 billion of PYPL shares this year. Investors gain from this tactic, highlighting PayPal’s resilience in a cutthroat market.\n\nBlock (SQ) Square Stock May Be Due for a Cooling Off Period\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlock (NYSE:SQ) has faced its fair share of market turbulence, with its stock price falling roughly 80% from its 2021 high. However, the robust Q1 2024 results highlight the company’s resilience. Cash App, Block’s peer-to-peer payment service generated gross profit of $1.26 billion, marking a 25% increase YOY. Similarly, Square’s merchant payment solution rose by 19% to $820 million. This indicates steady growth fueled by an expanding user base and product adoption.\n\nAdditionally, Block is operating at full throttle with earnings-per-share (EPS) of 86 cents, outpacing estimates by 12 cents, and revenue soaring 19.38% to $5.96 billion. This performance can be attributed to the company’s right strategy and efficient implementation.\n\nOne of the key components of Block’s strategy is its anticipated foray into the Bitcoin (BTC-USD) business. Block diversifies its assets and improves its position in the cryptocurrency market by reinvesting 10% of its gross income from Bitcoin-related products in Bitcoin. Utilizing Cash App’s flexibility, this move positions Block for increased market share and future development.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nabeel Bukhari did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL): The Best Undervalued AI Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nAs mega-cap technology stocks continue to soar to new highs, the number of Wall Street analysts highlighting the “concentration of gains” problem are increasing. It’s more than evident now that just a handful of technology companies account for most of the gains in the market, thanks to the AI-fueled rally that is favoring only those companies that are leading in the AI arms race. Barclays analyst Venu Krishna recently said in a report that “Big Tech” has  “largely carried the broader U.S. equity market through 1Q24 earnings results.” Krishna said that Q1 results showed the “ongoing dominance” of Big Tech over earnings revisions and margin upside.\n\n“This makes it difficult to argue for a broadening of overweight allocations,” Krishna added. The analyst said this dominance comes at the expense of other sectors as funds cut their exposure to cyclical sectors like industrials, financials and discretionary to go overweight on tech.\n\nBillionaire Steve Cohen’s New AI Fund\n\nBillionaires and VCs are now planning to create their own AI-focused funds to attract money from investors and tap into the unprecedented opportunities unlocked by AI. Bloomberg recently reported that Steve Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management is planning to raise about $1 billion to make a new AI-focused hedge fund. The fund will bet “on and against” companies in AI hardware and semiconductor industries. The report said that billionaire Cohen will be overseeing the fund along with Eric Sanchez. The fund’s expected launch date is later this year or early 2025.\n\nBillionaire Cohen is already ramping up his bets on AI. To see his AI investments this year, click 10 Best AI Stock Picks of Billionaire Steve Cohen.\n\nSince Krishna of Barclays talked about the rise of big tech funds and their concentration into AI, in this article we will take a look at the major AI stocks that form the portfolios of these funds and discuss their growth catalysts and long-term outlook. For that we first listed down all holdings of major tech funds like Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund and iShares Global Tech ETF and picked 10 AI stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors.\n\nWhy are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Are Big Tech Funds Buying Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI Stock?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally entered the AI party with a bang, announcing new AI plans that many believe would create a strong ecosystem around the company’s software and hardware products. As a result, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a competitive edge over peers with its on-device AI.\n\n“Consumers may find purchasing Microsoft’s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,” Kuo said.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is also one of the stocks Big Tech funds are buying like crazy, according to Barclays.\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a report last month that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could benefit from the rise of AI PCs. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth expectation of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled Big Tech Funds are Buying These 10 AI Stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has rallied roughly 22% over the last three months thanks to strong earnings and excitement surrounding artificial intelligence initiatives. The company's most recent annual DEF14A filing, which shows how many shares of stock large investors own, shows that CEO Tim Cook's stock position is worth more than $690 million. But at least one other person owns far more Apple stock.\n\nWho owns more of Apple than Tim Cook?\n\nAs of Apple's most recent public filing, board chairman Ari Levinson owned more than 4.59 million shares of the company's stock. This position means that he holds more shares of Apple stock directly than any other individually listed shareholder. For comparison, Tim Cook owned a little over 3.28 million shares of his company's stock per the most recent disclosure.\n\nBut another high-profile money man may have an even bigger Apple stake. When Apple published its DEF14A showing institutional ownership as of Jan. 31, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A) (NYSE: BRK.B) and its CEO Warren Buffett owned 915.6 million shares of the company's stock. Even after a subsequent disclosure filing from Berkshire showed that it sold roughly 116 million Apple shares in this year's first quarter, Buffett's company still held roughly 790 million shares of the iPhone maker's stock.\n\nBerkshire and Buffett's holdings are combined in Apple's filings, and Buffett's individual stock ownership is not detailed in Berkshire's disclosures. Because of this, it's not clear how much the investment conglomerate's CEO owns directly. But is clear that his indirect investment in Apple is massive. As of Berkshire's most recent 13F filing, Buffett owned 38.4% of his own company's stock. Accordingly, giving him a corresponding ownership position in Berkshire's Apple holdings in addition to any shares in the tech stock that he may hold privately.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Record-Breaking Stocks With More Room to Run",
        "content": "U.S. markets continued to set all-time highs in June, with record-breaking stocks boosting major indices to new records last week. Even the traditionally slower DJIA logged two consecutive record peaks in two days.\n\nThe market appears to favor the surge in artificial intelligence (AI) greatly as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) battle for the highest market capitalization in the world. Such lofty heights in the market typically provoke fears of a correction, but pulling back may not be the case just yet.\r\n\r\nBullish bets from traders are also hitting record highs, especially on the top-performing stocks. Options trading reveals the number of calls exceeds the number of puts by 4.5 million contracts, the highest in history. Not surprisingly, a large portion of calls support the mega caps that have been outperforming so far this year. However, it strongly suggests that traders feel the current bullish run has more room to run. This points to a rising interest in betting on record-breaking stocks.\r\n\r\nWhen seeking those with more room to run, there are multiple alternatives to examine. One way to distinguish the strong performers from the rest is to vet analyst recommendations. The following three record-breaking stocks with a high number of analysts recommending a buy could have further growth potential.\n\nLife360 (LIF) An image of a man typing on a laptop overlayed with lines of code.\n\nThe family safety app Life360 (NASDAQ:LIF) came to market only earlier this month. It is a reasonable choice as one of the record-breaking stocks with more to run due to its post-IPO success. After first trading at $27 per share, the price steadily increased throughout the month and now changes hands at $31.21 per share.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlthough the company is not yet profitable and has not released earnings results as a public firm, analysts have been highly positive in their coverage. Thirteen analysts have issued reports on Life360 so far, with 11 recommending the stock as a Buy. The average target price given is $52.07 per share, representing a potential upside of 67%.\r\n\r\nIt is not surprising that a newly public company sees strong bullish momentum, especially in the social media sector.\n\nLife360 offers both a free and paid app for tracking the location of loved ones and their belongings. It boasts a staggering 66 million active users to date.\n\nBoston Scientific (BSX) a zoom-in on the Boston Scientific logo (BSX) on a web page\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nBoston Scientific (NYSE:BSX) has experienced long-term success in medical device markets. It is renowned for developing the Taxus Stent, which is used to treat blocked arteries. However, the company also creates a wide array of sophisticated devices across medical specialties.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs healthcare is a perpetually necessary industry, Boston Scientific is well-positioned for continued growth. Heart attacks remain the main cause of death in the United States, ensuring demand for preventative products over the long run.\n\nBSX stock price reached a record high last week following the announcement of an acquisition of carotid artery disease firm Silk Road Medical (NASDAQ:SILK). Not unexpectedly, after setting a new record, the price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio increased substantially to 65.3x. Still, biotech has a high average P/E ratio, rendering Boston Scientific’s figure relatively consistent with the sector’s 58.5x.\n\nAnalysts anticipate ongoing expansion, with an average price target of $82.93 representing a modest projected upside of 6.7%. The forecast suggests the recent record high will unlikely cap the company’s performance, making Boston one of the record-breaking stocks with more room to run.\n\nCrane NXT (CXT) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks to sell\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrane NXT (NYSE:CXT) is the final selection of record-breaking stocks with more room to run. It provides micro-optic security products widely used without notice, as well as special marks on currency that allow for authentication and protection.\n\nThe company recently completed the acquisition of OpSec Security to enhance its portfolio of online protection and product authentication solutions.\n\nCrane achieved record stock prices after appointing a new head of its payments division, which accounts for two-thirds of total revenue. Michael Mahan’s appointment will become effective on July 8.\r\n\r\nDespite a 14% year-to-date growth exceeding the average for S&P 500 firms, CXT stock trades at a peer-comparable P/E ratio of 20x. Given its involvement in technology, this is in line with industrial companies.\n\nAnalyst coverage remains strongly favorable, with five of six rating it a Buy. The average price target represents a 52% upside at $98.20 per share as the company continues beating EPS estimates.\n\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Billionaires Just Poured About $67 Billion Into These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has the power to revolutionize our lives -- at least if big tech is to be believed. Plenty of products already hit the market, like ChatGPT, and while they have made a splash, the technology's true impact has yet to be felt. That promise of more to come is driving incredible growth for companies involved in AI.\n\nTop fund managers are snapping up shares of these businesses as they try to capture as much value from the technology's explosive growth as possible. Funds with more than $100 million in assets under management need to report their trades every quarter to the Securities and Exchange Commission on form 13F. Lucky for us, it's public knowledge.\n\nKnowing where the \"smart money\" is flowing can help you make sound decisions, but it should only be part of your information gathering. It turns out that the smart money isn't always so smart -- and besides, there are plenty of managers selling shares of all of the following five stocks.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nTo perhaps no one's surprise, the company with the most hedge-fund buys was Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA). It captured the investing world's imagination after positioning itself as the go-to chipmaker for all things AI.\n\nIts revenue growth has been incredible, and it's done it all while keeping costs relatively low. The chart below measuring the growth of its net income over the past three years shows the point where AI took off. NVDA Net Income (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $15.9 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $6.2 billion from Vanguard and $1.8 billion by BlackRock.\n\n2. Amazon\n\nOne of my favorite AI plays, Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), runs the largest cloud computing operation in the world, Amazon Web Service (AWS), controlling over 30% of the cloud market and is investing heavily to maintain this share. It partners with Nvidia to outfit its data centers with the latest and most powerful chips, and it put $4 billion into OpenAI competitor Anthropic.\n\nFund managers bought $14.4 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.5 billion (Vanguard) and $1.9 billion (BlackRock).\n\n3. Microsoft\n\nAnother solid AI play, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT), backs OpenAI, the maker of the most popular AI application, ChatGPT. When OpenAI released ChatGPT-3 to the public, it became the most quickly adopted technology in history. For much of the public, ChatGPT is as far as their knowledge of AI goes, unaware of Anthropic's offering or Alphabet's.\n\nMicrosoft is No. 2 in the cloud and has been slowly eating into AWS' market share. Its partnership with OpenAI means Microsoft has the most-used AI application in the world on its servers. And Microsoft is also outfitting them with Nvidia chips.\n\nStory continues\n\nFund managers bought $13.1 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $2.8 billion (BlackRock) and $1.3 billion from Geode Capital Management.\n\n4. Apple\n\nThis one is different from the previous three. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) shares slid for much of last year as investors worried it had fallen behind in AI.\n\nBut the company finally jumped on board this month, unveiling Apple Intelligence, its cleverly named AI offering. Its products will have all sorts of AI enhancements (maybe now Siri will actually know what I ask her to do).\n\nCrucially, the enhancements will require too much computing power for many older products in Apple's lineup, forcing users to upgrade to the latest (and most expensive) models. This will help boost the company's sagging iPhone sales, an essential part of its bottom line.\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.3 billion (Geode Capital) and $983.9 million by Lazard.\n\n5. Broadcom\n\nLike Nvidia, Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO) supplies hardware to the AI industry. They don't compete head to head, leaving Nvidia to dominate the core chip market. But one of the most crucial components in AI data centers is the one that allows all of those chips to talk to one another fast enough and seamlessly, which is where Broadcom comes in. Broadcom is a top designer, manufacturer, and supplier of semiconductor and infrastructure software products. Its product offerings serve the data center, networking, software, broadband, wireless, storage, and industrial markets.\n\nThe company also made some key acquisitions that have driven immense growth, as the revenue chart below shows. (It also indicates an inflection point close to the one in Nvidia's chart above.) AVGO Revenue (Quarterly) Chart\n\nFund managers bought $11.8 billion worth of shares last quarter. The biggest purchases were $1.6 billion (Vanguard) and $1.5 billion from Jennison Associates.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Zacks Analyst Blog Highlights Vistra, NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft and Macy's",
        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 25, 2024 – Zacks.com announces the list of stocks featured in the Analyst Blog. Every day the Zacks Equity Research analysts discuss the latest news and events impacting stocks and the financial markets. Stocks recently featured in the blog include: Vistra Energy Corp. VST, NVIDIA NVDA, Apple AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Macy's M.\n\nHere are highlights from Monday’s Analyst Blog:\n\nTop Wall Street Stories from 1H 2024/Predictions for 2H\n\nWith just a few trading days left, Wall Street has been on a remarkable rally, buoyed by a surge in technology stocks. The artificial intelligence (AI) craze, hopes of rate cuts, optimism over a resilient economy, improving corporate earnings and the rising share of the \"Magnificent Seven\" have been driving the space. Notably, the technology sector is the clear leader of the 2024 market rally so far.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite emerged as an outperformer, gaining 17.8%. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial have risen 14.6% and 3.9%, respectively. The strong trend is likely to continue in the second half as well.\n\nLet’s discuss these events in detail below with the stocks:\n\nAI Boom to Stay\n\nThe AI boom will continue to fuel the rally in the broad market, with companies investing huge sums in the technology sector and beyond. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh growth opportunities. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030.\n\nAI is bolstering electricity demand, as data centers require tons of energy for computing and cooling power. A simple ChatGPT task uses 10 times the energy a normal Google search does. So, data centers with a capacity of 30 megawatts are boosting capacity to handle 300 megawatts of power. This has made the traditional utilities sector of the market most appealing. Though technology seems to have become expensive, utilities remain an untapped area.\n\nInvestors seeking to make the most of the next leg in the AI industrial revolution should consider utility stocks. Vistra Energy Corp., having a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), is one of the best-performing stocks of the first half. The stock saw a solid earnings estimate revision of 47 cents for this year over the past month, with an estimated growth rate of 13.7%. Vistra Energy has a Growth Score of B, indicating that it is poised for more growth. You can see the complete list of today’s Zacks #1 Rank stocks here.\n\nStory continues\n\nRace for Most Valuable Company\n\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the technology sector and the S&P 500 as a whole. It now accounts for 31% of weightage in the S&P 500. The three stocks — NVIDIA, Apple and Microsoft — in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group are in a race to become the world’s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities.\n\nNVIDIA has been at the forefront of building AI into its products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI’s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media. NVIDIA has a Zacks Rank #1 and a Growth Score of A.\n\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple.\n\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses. Demand for generative AI will continue to fuel Microsoft's cloud business.\n\nApple and Microsoft have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) each.\n\nS&P 500 to Hit New Milestone\n\nThe S&P 500 is on track to record its best first-half performance during an election year since 1976, as well as the second-best performance in an election year in its history, according to Dow Jones Market Data. The index has achieved multiple records and gained at least 500 points in the first six months. The index topped the 5,500 level for the first time last week after hitting the 5,400 threshold earlier this month and 5,300 last month, underscoring strong confidence. It broke the milestones of 5,100 and 5,200 in February.\n\nWall Street analysts continue to be bullish on the stock market. An analyst at Stifel expects the S&P 500 to reach the 6,000 mark before the end of 2024, up from just below 5,500, as investors keep piling in. This month, an analyst at Goldman boosted the year-end target price for the S&P 500 Index to 5,600 from 5,200 for the third time, citing an optimistic outlook for earnings growth and the U.S. economy.\n\nMeanwhile, Evercore ISI, one of the prominent bear analysts, turned bullish and raised its year-end S&P 500 price target from 4,750 to 6,000 — a new high on Wall Street. The analyst stated that the \"AI revolution is in the early innings\" and should lead to continued strength in earnings growth. Evercore ISI forecasts S&P 500 EPS growth of 8% and 5% in 2024 and 2025, respectively.\n\nMarket veteran Ed Yardeni expects the bull market to roar further until the end of this decade, with the S&P 500 on track to hit 6,000 by the end of 2025 and 8,000 by the end of the decade. Tom Lee, the founder of Fundstrat, expects that the S&P 500 could hit 15,000 by the end of this decade.\n\nRate Cuts in the Cards\n\nIn the latest FOMC meeting, U.S. policymakers penciled in one rate cut for this year and foresee four cuts for 2025. The Fed altered language in its statement, noting there has been “modest further progress toward the committee’s 2% inflation objective.” Previously, the statement pointed to a “lack” of further progress.\n\nLow rates reduce the cost of borrowing, which is often needed to finance the expansion of companies, thereby driving growth. This can positively impact sectors like real estate, consumer discretionary and financial services, which are typically sensitive to interest rate changes.\n\nIn real estate, lower rates can boost housing market activity by making mortgages more affordable. For consumer discretionary sectors, reduced borrowing costs can lead to increased consumer spending. In the financial sector, while lower rates can compress net interest margins for banks, they can also encourage lending and potentially lead to increased consumer and business loan activity.\n\nAs a result, investors could bet on any of these sectors to magnify gains for the rest of the year. In particular, the most beaten-down stocks of the first half could outperform in the second half. One exciting option could be Macy's, which sells a range of merchandise, such as apparel and accessories for men, women, and kids, cosmetics; home furnishings, and other consumer goods under the Macy's, Bloomingdale's and Bluemercury brands.\n\nThe stock is down about 9% so far this year but has the potential to move higher in the second half of the year, given its Zacks Rank #2 and a Value Score of A. Additionally, Macy's saw a positive earnings estimate revision of 4 cents over the past 30 days for the fiscal year (ending January 2025).\n\nWhy Haven’t You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe stock market in 2024 has been defined by one theme: AI.\n\nAnd not just because people only want to talk about AI, but the market's performance has hinged on it too.\n\nIn a weekly note to clients published Monday, strategists at the BlackRock Investment Institute led by Jean Boivin highlighted the following chart, which shows just how much tech has dominated the market's performance since 2023.\n\nSince the start of last year, the S&P 500 is up a robust 42%. This return is nothing to scoff at, with the annualized rate of that return standing near 26%, almost triple the index's average annual gain over time.\n\nBut if we isolate the performance of tech stocks, we see a clearer picture emerge.\n\nOver that same period, the S&P 500 Tech index, which houses Nvidia (NVDA), the market's main character at the moment, as well as Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL), and two other key AI beneficiaries — Broadcom (AVGO) and AMD (AMD) — is up 100%. (As Jared Blikre flagged last week, however, investors buying the most popular tech ETF have missed out on some of this performance.)\n\nExcluding the tech sector, the S&P 500 is up a respectable, but much closer to historically average, 24% over that period.\n\n\"The concentration in US tech stocks is a feature, not a flaw, of the AI theme,\" BlackRock wrote.\n\nAs the analysts noted, stocks in the tech sector collectively grew their earnings 23% over last year in the first quarter. According to data from FactSet, earnings for the S&P 500 as a whole grew 5.9% over the prior year in Q1.\n\nOver the long run, corporate earnings are the most important driver of stock prices. And with tech companies currently growing their profits at a rate far exceeding the index's average, this outperformance hardly looks exceptional.\n\n\"Strong balance sheets are also a reason we like tech, and we are less concerned about valuation metrics,\" BlackRock added.\n\n\"Free cash flows — excluding operational costs — as a share of sales are nearly double for tech than for the broader market, and tech has the largest profit margins across sectors, LSEG Datastream data show. Plus, many top tech names are highly profitable and cash-flush, allowing them to fund the buildout of AI infrastructure such as data centers.\" Nvidia's CEO Jensen Huang delivers his keystone speech ahead of Computex 2024 in Taipei on June 2, 2024. (SAM YEH/AFP via Getty Images) (SAM YEH via Getty Images)\n\nAs we highlighted over the weekend, one of the key themes the equity strategy team at JPMorgan flagged coming out of first quarter earnings was an emphasis from corporate management teams on continuing AI investments.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll of this is part of why last week, no fewer than three Wall Street banks raised their price targets for the S&P 500, citing AI enthusiasm as the catalyst.\n\nOf course, this dynamic does not come without potential pitfalls. BlackRock flagged AI investments falling out of favor, regulatory changes, or unexpected action from the Fed as potential risks for AI's predominance.\n\nStill, the firm maintains an Overweight recommendation on US stocks with an emphasis on AI.\n\n\"In a world where mega forces — big structural shifts — drive returns now and in the future,\" the firm wrote, \"we eye the short- and long-term impacts of AI on earnings.\"\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Go Parabolic",
        "content": "The artificial intelligence (AI) market has surged since the start of 2023. The debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT illustrated key advances in generative AI technology and demonstrated its potential to change all aspects of tech.\n\nAs a result, an array of companies have ventured into the AI space, attempting to take slices of a pie that was worth close to $200 billion last year, and that Grand View Research forecasts will grow at a compound annual rate of 37% through 2030. And even though many stocks involved have already experienced meteoric rises, the potential of AI suggests it's not too late to invest in the trend and accrue major gains over the long term.\n\nTech giants have barely scratched the surface of what's possible with AI, suggesting now could be the best time to invest in the companies pushing the industry forward. So, here are two artificial intelligence stocks that could go parabolic.\n\n1. Intel\n\nYou might be surprised to see me recommending Intel(NASDAQ: INTC), given that its stock is down 39% year to date. However, the company appears to be staging a comeback that could send its share price soaring in the coming years.\n\nAfter a challenging decade, Intel is restructuring its business to regain its competitive edge. The company is investing heavily in AI, debuting a range of new AI processors this year. Meanwhile, the chip giant is expanding its manufacturing division, a move that it believes will help it reach non-GAAP gross margins of 60% and save it between $8 billion and $10 billion by 2025.\n\nRestructuring is costly, and it will take time for Intel to see significant returns on its investment. However, recent results indicate the company is on the right track. In the first quarter, its revenue increased 9% year over year to $13 billion -- a sharp contrast to the 16% decline in sales it posted in 2023. The chipmaker also delivered non-GAAP earnings of $0.18 per share, beating expectations by about $0.04 per share.\n\nIntel has a lot of work ahead as it goes up against Nvidia in the AI chip market and expands its foundry division. However, it's on a promising growth trajectory. In addition to positive earnings, the company's trailing 12-month free cash flow has increased by about $2 billion since January.\n\nTrading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of about 28 and a stock price that's near its lowest point in months, Intel is a screaming buy this month.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) share price has popped by more than 10% since last month as Wall Street grew bullish on the company again. The iPhone maker hit some speed bumps over the past year, when tumbling product sales led to declines in revenue. However, recent developments gave investors a peek into Apple's plan to boost product revenue with the help of AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn June 10, the company unveiled Apple Intelligence, a platform that will bring generative AI features to its devices. However, the catch is that to take advantage, users will need at least an iPhone 15 Pro, or a Mac or iPad equipped with an M1 to M4 processor. The move could drive millions of consumers to upgrade to the company's latest devices.\n\nDespite recent challenges, Apple remains a behemoth in consumer tech. The company has built up nearly unrivaled brand loyalty within its user base, which could see it become a major growth driver in the public's adoption of AI. While companies like Microsoft and Amazon prioritized catering to the business sector's AI needs, Apple's focus on consumers could position it to dominate that part of the AI space.\n\nIn addition to its products, Apple has a booming services business that could also be bolstered by AI. The company has entered into a partnership with OpenAI that will see Siri hand off users to ChatGPT for answers to specific questions. However, this appears to be only the start. Down the line, OpenAI's technology could help Apple offer a range of paid-for AI services to improve the usability of its products. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nMoreover, Apple's stock is trading at a bargain forward P/E level compared to some of its rivals in AI. The company's gradual expansion in AI has induced a more moderate stock price rise than Microsoft and Amazon have experienced over the last year. Yet, the iPhone maker far outperforms both of them on free cash flow, indicating it could be better equipped to keep investing in its business.\n\nAs a result, Apple is a no-brainer right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia stock falls more than 6% as investors rotate out of the chip heavyweight. (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia has shed more than $500bn (£433bn) in market value since briefly becoming the world’s most valuable company last week after shares fell almost 7% on Monday and were in the red during pre-trading hours.\n\nMany investors are thought to be taking profits after the semiconductor manufacturer’s valuation surged.\n\nDavid Morrison, senior market analyst at Trade Nation, said: “Some profit-taking seems entirely reasonable given NVIDIA’s meteoric rise. The stock was up over 180% this year alone. But if it continues to lose ground, then there’s a danger of contagion, with selling spreading to other big tech names. If that were the case, then the market could be in for a deeper and more protracted pull-back.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“Yet, there are few indications that investors are even thinking along these lines.”\n\nAnother factor weighing on Nvidia is that CEO Jensen Huang has been selling stock this month, through a trading plan. That has focused attention on whether the stock was somewhat overvalued.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stocks open mixed as $550bn wiped off Nvidia\n\nRichard Hunter, head of markets at Interactive Investor, said: “The stellar rise of tech and AI-related stocks in particular inevitably gets to the stage where investors pause for breath and recalculate valuation levels.”\n\nThe AI darling recently became the third company ever to achieve a market valuation of more than $3tn, surpassing Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT) to become the most valued company in the world.\n\nIts market capitalisation has now dropped to $2.91trn (£2.29trn).\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nOutflows from US Bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs) reached $1.3bn over the last two weeks as the price of the cryptocurrency continues to decline.\n\nBitcoin is stable above $61,000, after dropping to $59,200 during the early hours of the Asian trading day. The digital asset is now down 11% in June, but remains up 42% for the year-to-date, with the gains largely concentrated around the ETF approval.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, according to data from Farside Investors quoted by the cointelegraph, the total outflow for Bitcoin ETFs hit $1.298bn over the last two trading weeks with Grayscale leading outflows at $517.3 million in the same period.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nBlackRock’s Bitcoin ETF has been the only fund to post positive results, raking in $43.1mn worth of inflows over the last two weeks.\n\nBitcoin is not only under pressure from cooling demand for its ETFs but there is also growing uncertainty about the US Federal Reserve’s scope to cut interest rates quickly from a two-decade high.\n\nCrypto analysts are giving a 14% chance of Bitcoin rebounding to $65K by the end of the week.\n\nTrump Media (DJT)\n\nShares of Trump Media & Technology Group are higher in pre-market trading, ahead of Thursday's debate between President Biden and former President Donald Trump.\n\nTrump Media stock is up by 21%, currently trading at $33.70 a share. The stock closed Friday at just over $27.\n\nThe company behind Truth Social has seen its stock price fall by nearly 50% in the roughly three weeks since a New York jury found Trump guilty of 34 felony counts of falsifying business records.\n\nRead more: How to invest in AI as the rally continues\n\nTrump owns 114,750,000, or about 64.9%, of the company’s stock. He cannot sell any of his shares until the end of September, when a post-merger lock-up period expires.\n\nAirbus (AIR.PA)\n\nShares in Airbus tumbled over 10% in early morning trading after the plane maker cut its annual profit forecast because of persistent supply chain disruptions and challenges in its space business.\n\nThe manufacturer expects to deliver 770 aircraft this year – down from the earlier forecast of 800 – while its production target of 75 A320neos monthly has slipped from 2026 to 2027.\n\nAirbus said it is facing “persistent” and “specific” supply-chain issues, primarily affecting engines, aerostructures and cabin equipment.\n\nIt is also taking a €900m charge at its Space Systems, after discovering “further commercial and technical” challenges.\n\nAs a result, the aerospace and defence group now expects adjusted earnings before interest and tax of €5.5bn this year, down from a previous forecast of as much as €7bn.\n\n\"It might not have much impact on airlines, who have already indicated that Airbus has reduced scheduled deliveries. But aircraft manufacturing is proving tricky – just ask Boeing,\" Neil Wilson, chief market analyst at Finalto, said.\n\n\"Demand is not the problem; quite the reverse. But if supply can’t keep pace and competition is so constrained, it ought to mean airline capacity doesn’t increase too much, which could keep fares higher for longer.\"\n\nWatch: Kenny Polcari to investors: Look for weakness to put more money to work\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "title": "Evercore says AI could help Apple crush 2025 iPhone growth estimates",
        "content": "Evercore ISI analysts believe Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock price has room to grow, citing the potential for significantly higher iPhone sales in fiscal year 2025 (FY25) driven by Artificial Intelligence (AI) features.\n\nThe investment firm lifted its price target for the stock from $220 to $250, maintaining an Outperform rating.\n\nEvercore points to Apple's decision to limit \"Apple Intelligence\" features to its higher-end iPhone 15 Pro and upcoming iPhone 16 models, believing this will create a strong incentive for upgrades.\n\n\"If Apple can deliver on the features demonstrated at WWDC, we think consumers will find Apple Intelligence compelling enough to shorten the replacement cycle and induce iPhone 13/14 Pro and iPhone 15 owners to upgrade more quickly,\" says Evercore.\n\nEvercore believes the current consensus forecast of 3% iPhone revenue growth in FY25 is too low. They estimate that even a one-month reduction in the typical upgrade cycle could result in an additional $14 billion in iPhone sales, representing a 7% increase over current FY25 expectations.\n\nEvercore highlights Apple's staggered rollout of AI features, with some functionality delayed until later in the calendar year 2025 (CY25). They argue that this will extend the upgrade cycle as positive word-of-mouth and new features continue to emerge.\n\nBased on this, Evercore is raising its FY25 iPhone revenue growth estimate from 4% to 7%, with the potential for growth to reach double digits. They increased their price target to $250 per share to reflect their bullish outlook.\n\n\"Can Apple Intelligence Drive Upgrades?\" is a key question for Evercore, but early investor reaction since Apple's WWDC event suggests growing optimism about a potential iPhone \"super cycle.\" Evercore believes that if Apple delivers on its promises, AI will be a compelling reason for users to upgrade. They also acknowledge a growing appreciation for Apple's AI strategy.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEvercore says AI could help Apple crush 2025 iPhone growth estimates\n\nNovo Nordisk's Wegovy weight-loss drug approved in China\n\nVenezuela international bondholders hire legal advisors for restructuring\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. rejected overtures by Meta Platforms Inc. to integrate the social networking company’s AI chatbot into the iPhone months ago, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHow Long Can High Rates Last? Bond Markets Say Maybe Forever Jain Global Raises $5.3 Billion, Secures Cash From Abu Dhabi BuzzFeed Struggles to Sell Owner of Hit YouTube Show ‘Hot Ones’ Nvidia Sales Grow So Fast That Wall Street Can’t Keep Up Tech Hits Stocks as Nvidia Extends Selloff to 13%: Markets Wrap\n\nThe two companies aren’t in discussions about using Meta’s Llama chatbot in an AI partnership and only held brief talks in March, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the situation is private. The dialogue about a partnership didn’t reach any formal stage, and Apple has no active plans to integrate Llama.\n\nThe preliminary talks occurred around the time Apple started hashing out deals to use OpenAI’s ChatGPT and Alphabet Inc.’s Gemini in its products. The iPhone maker announced the ChatGPT agreement earlier this month and said it was expecting to offer Gemini in the future.\n\nApple decided not to move forward with formal Meta discussions in part because it doesn’t see that company’s privacy practices as stringent enough, according to the people. Apple has spent years criticizing Meta’s technology, and integrating Llama into the iPhone would have been a stark about-face.\n\nApple also sees ChatGPT as a superior offering. Google, meanwhile, is already a partner for search in Apple’s Safari web browser, so a future Gemini deal would build on that relationship.\n\nSpokespeople for Apple and Meta declined to comment. The Wall Street Journal reported on Sunday that the two companies were in talks about an AI partnership.\n\nApple unveiled a suite of artificial intelligence features at its Worldwide Developers Conference on June 10. The new technology — called Apple Intelligence — includes homegrown tools for summarizing notifications, transcribing voice memos and generating custom emoji.\n\nBut Apple’s chatbot technology isn’t as advanced as that of rivals, prompting it to seek out partners. The company also believes that customers will want the ability to switch between different chatbots depending on their needs, similar to how they might hop between Google and Microsoft Corp.’s Bing for searches.\n\nApple continues to talk to AI startup Anthropic about eventually adding that company’s chatbot as an option, the people said. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year as part of operating systems for the iPhone, iPad and Mac.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe current deal with OpenAI doesn’t involve money swapping hands, but Apple will allow paying ChatGPT customers to access their subscriptions within the iOS operating system. That could generate revenue for OpenAI, a percentage of which could be headed to Apple in the form of App Store commissions.\n\nMeta and Apple were on friendlier terms a decade ago, when the iPhone maker was integrating Facebook into iOS. But the companies have become fierce rivals in recent years, competing over AI, home devices and mixed-reality headsets.\n\n--With assistance from Kurt Wagner.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election Corporate Women’s Gains Fall Victim to Anti-Woke Backlash How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

The session marked the third consecutive day of losses for shares of the chip heavyweight.\n\nThe stock declined more than 12% from its all-time closing high of $135.58 last Tuesday when Nvidia's market cap temporarily dethroned Microsoft (MSFT) as the most valuable company.\n\nThe chipmaker has since given back the crown with its market capitalization at around $2.9 trillion, below Microsoft's and Apple's (AAPL) valuations of more than $3 trillion each.\n\nUp until Thursday of last week, Nvidia played a pivotal role in buoying the S&P 500 (^GSPC) and the Nasdaq (^IXIC) to repeated record highs in 2024.\n\nThe Santa Clara, Calif.-based company completed a 10-for-1 stock split on June 10.\n\nAs Yahoo Finance's Allie Canal recently reported, Wall Street is mixed on whether the recent selloff signals long-term concerns with the stock.\n\n\"The stock's steep climb makes it vulnerable to profit taking, but we argue any volatility [is] likely to be short-lived,\" Bank of America analysts stated in a note last week, reiterating a Buy rating and $150 price target while calling Nvidia a \"top pick.\"\n\nOver the weekend Jefferies analysts maintained a Buy rating on the stock and raised their price target to $150 from $135, calling Nvidia the \"king and kingmaker.\"\n\nMeanwhile Patrick Moorhead, Moor Insights & Strategy founder and CEO, told Yahoo Finance on Friday that investors should be watchful for signs a pullback is here to stay.\n\nWhile he doesn't see the status quo of Nvidia's dominance changing over the next six to nine months, investors should focus on \"the downstream profitability that people in the ecosystem are making or not making.\"\n\n\"These are the software companies like Adobe, Salesforce, SAP, and ServiceNow. Because if those enterprises and those consumers aren't paying more for these new AI features, then this whole gravy train comes to a screeching halt, like we saw in the internet bust,\" he explained.

        "title": "3 China Stocks to Buy on the Dip: June 2024",
        "content": "Many times, companies go through times of crisis before, eventually stepping back out stronger than ever. These events lead to multiple investors losing faith in the company and pulling their shares out. However, if the company reverses the negative trend it’s stuck in, investors who keep their shares have the potential to make a large return on their investment.\n\nOne of the best metrics used to decide whether a company is a “growth” stock or not is to use analyst price targets. These price targets, which are generally a year out, define what analysts believe are suitable price ranges for said company. A relatively high price target means the company will see considerable growth in the stock price, making it a worthy investment. Here are three China stocks to buy based on my analysis.\n\nAlibaba Group Holding (BABA) The Alibaba (BABA) logo featured outside of an office building with bushes in the background\n\nSource: zhu difeng / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlibaba Group Holding (NYSE:BABA) is a Chinese multinational conglomerate specializing in e-commerce, cloud computing, digital media and logistics. It operates platforms like Taobao and Tmall, offers cloud services through Alibaba Cloud and provides digital payments via its affiliate, Ant Group’s Alipay.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBABA stock is currently trading at $73.67, with a market cap of $178.4 billion. It has gone down 56% in the past 5 years. Despite this decline, analysts predict a target price estimate of $107.51 — suggesting a potential growth rate of 46% over the next year. The company maintains positive financials, with a profit and operating margin of 8.50% and 13.35%, respectively. Additionally, an operating cash flow of $183 billion is also a positive indicator.\n\nAlibaba has strong growth prospects, with the group just introducing its first AI programmer, powered by its proprietary large language model (LLM). Additionally, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has added Alibaba, along with JD.com (NASDAQ:JD), to one of the apps used on their Vision Pro, launching in China on June 28. These advancements position BABA as a compelling China stock to buy on the dip, with strong potential for future growth and innovation.\n\nJD.com (JD) JD stock, Jd.com, Tiger Global is a major investor in JD\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nJD.com is a Chinese e-commerce giant providing a wide range of products, including electronics, apparel and groceries. Known for its robust logistics network, JD.com ensures fast, reliable delivery and also offers services like JD Logistics, JD Health and JD Cloud.\n\nThe stock is currently trading at $28.10, with a market cap of $43 billion. It has gone down 19.5% in the past years. Despite this decline, analysts predict a target price estimate of $42.51 — suggesting a potential growth rate of 51% over the next year. It has consistently beaten EPS predictions, with an average surprise of 17.5% over the past year. Multiple financial institutions have rated JD stock as Overweight and Outperform.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock has been profitable and has crossed revenue of $1 trillion for the past two years. Plus, recent expansions — like adding four new 737-800 Boeing Converted Freighter (BCF) aircraft to its fleet — indicate strong growth prospects. A high potential growth rate and resilient financials make JD.com a definite China stock to buy on the dip.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nPDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) operates a multinational e-commerce portfolio, including Pinduoduo and Temu marketplaces. It connects businesses and consumers digitally, offering diverse product categories like apparel, electronics and more. The company generates revenue through commissions and fees from sellers on its platforms.\n\nPDD stock is currently trading at $143.86 with a market cap of almost $200 billion. The stock is down 4% this month, but I expect this negative trend to reverse at any time. Analysts have predicted a one-year target price estimate of $202.64, indicating a growth potential of 40.8%.\n\nA year-on-year quarterly earnings growth of 245.60%, combined with the fact that this stock has consistently beaten EPS predictions over the past year, underscores its strong operational performance.\n\nAs e-commerce continues to expand globally, particularly in emerging markets, PDD is well-positioned to capitalize on this growth trajectory. In Q1 2024, the Temu app boasted 167 million monthly active users globally, a significant surge from 23.4 million users in Q1 2023, marking a remarkable 614% year-over-year growth. This explosive growth, combined with positive analyst feedback and stellar financials make PDD a stock to buy, especially on the dip.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) legal headaches mounted Monday with the news that European Union regulators found it violated a new law designed to rein in tech giants.\n\nThe EU’s European Commission said it informed Apple that the rules of Apple's lucrative App Store violated the Digital Markets Act by illegally blocking software developers from telling customers how to access content outside the app store.\n\nThe regulator also announced it had opened a separate investigation into Apple’s practice of charging a \"core technology fee\" for iOS apps available in the EU.\n\nThe heightened scrutiny overseas comes as Apple defends itself in the US against antitrust charges from the US Justice Department and 16 state attorneys general. They sued Apple in March, alleging that it used illegal tactics to hold onto a monopoly in the smartphone market.\n\nApple is fighting the US lawsuit; it has yet to comment on the new EU actions.\n\nInvestors shrugged off the news, sending Apple’s stock up more than 1%.\n\nThe law that the EU claims Apple violated went into effect in March. It targets six Big Tech companies that the EU considers to be \"gatekeepers\" — Apple, Amazon (AMZN), Alphabet (GOOG, GOOGL), ByteDance, Microsoft (MSFT) and Meta (META) — and imposes more restrictive rules around competition.\n\nThe law’s purpose is to keep the most dominant tech companies from blocking smaller rivals from entering certain markets.\n\nApple is the first tech giant to receive a claim from the EC alleging that it breached the DMA.\n\nThe DMA allows Apple to charge developers a fee for new customers who sign up through the App Store.\n\nHowever, the law prevents Apple from blocking developers from communicating alternative ways to purchase their content.\n\nAnd that’s what regulators said Apple did. The logo of Apple is illuminated at a store in Munich, Germany, in 2020. (AP Photo/Matthias Schrader) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n\"Under the DMA, developers distributing their apps via Apple's App Store should be able, free of charge, to inform their customers of alternative cheaper purchasing possibilities, steer them to those offers and allow them to make purchases,\" the commission said in an announcement explaining its findings.\n\nViolations of the DMA carry hefty consequences, permitting fines up to 10% of a company’s global annual revenue. In Apple’s case, global revenues reached $383 billion in 2023.\n\nApple doesn’t segregate its App Store revenue in its financial filings. However, its growing services category that includes the store’s revenue reached $85 billion that same year.\n\nThe EC’s announcement significantly broadened financial risks that Apple faces from global antitrust regulators.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Commission said it had undertaken another probe to determine if Apple’s charge, which assesses developers 0.50 Euros for app downloads exceeding 1 million, is in breach of the DMA.\n\nAnd earlier this year, the EC revealed a fine against Apple for another lawsuit it brought on antitrust grounds.\n\nThe case, which was originated by Spotify, targeted Apple’s rules that precluded streaming music apps from directing their users to pay for content outside the app store.\n\nThe EC fined Apple $1.95 billion for the practice. Apple is appealing that decision.\n\nClick here for the latest technology news that will impact the stock market\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of the 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst.Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives has said in a fresh note that major tech giants are now running in a “race” to capture the $4 trillion AI market, calling GPUs the new “oil” or “gold” in the technology sector. Ives said that the AI “party” is just getting started and the clock is showing “9p.m. in a party going till 4 a.m. with the rest of the tech world now joining.” Ives thinks spending on GPUs and data centers is the “only game in town.” Ives thinks the “first wave” of AI benefited major technology giants leading the AI race, with the second, third and fourth “derivatives” beginning to show trickle-down effects on other companies.\n\nIn a separate investing event, Ives recently predicted that the AI-led bull run can last for another two to three years, saying in a year from now investors will be looking at $3 trillion to $4 trillion market caps for major tech companies.\n\n“The tech bull market is just starting,” Ives reportedly said.\n\nIn his latest note Ives highlighted several stocks which he believes can benefit from the AI revolution. In this article we take a detailed look at these stocks and discuss their AI-related growth catalysts and see whether or not they are sound long-term investments. With each stock we have mentioned hedge fund sentiment. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) Best AI Stock Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst?\n\n10 Smartphones with the Best Cameras and Battery Life\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush has been a big believer in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL). In a fresh note he said that while NVDA is leading the three-horse race between Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVDA and MSFT, the iPhone maker has a strong upside because of its AI plans. Ives thinks the “holy grail” for Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is twofold: a new iPhone refresh cycle and AI apps. Ives thinks Apple’s AI strategy could infuse a new iPhone upgrade cycle that could see 270 million of the total 1.5 billion iPhones in the world getting refreshed. On the other hand, Ives is expecting app developers to build “hundreds of apps” using Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI stack so that consumers could interact with AI on their iPhones.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nMar Vista Focus strategy stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock was pressured in the quarter as investors fretted over softening demand for smartphones, regulatory action from the US Department of Justice, and the Chinese government mandates restricting iPhone use by government officials. Despite these near-term headwinds, we continue to believe the company remains competitively advantaged and benefits from the Apple ecosystem, which has an installed base of over 2 billion devices and over 1 billion paying subscribers. We believe the Apple ecosystem will support a more predictable cash flow stream, which should grow intrinsic value high-single-digits over our investment horizon.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 6th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 12 Best AI Stocks Leading the ‘Big Tech Race’ to $4 Trillion According to a Famous Wall Street Analyst. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion “Opportunity” for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Apple's strategic shift: From BNPL to installment loans",
        "content": "Investing.com - Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) has decided to discontinue its buy-now-pay-later (BNPL) service, Apple Pay Later, just a little over a year since its launch in March 2023. This decision comes amidst heightened regulatory scrutiny and competition within the sector.\n\nNotably, the Australian government has recently raised regulatory standards by introducing new consumer protection laws for BNPL platforms, categorizing them as consumer credit.\n\nReplacing its BNPL service, Apple is introducing third-party installment loans through Apple Pay. This move will enable users worldwide to apply for these loans when conducting transactions with Apple Pay.\n\nIn the US, Apple Pay users will now be able to apply for loans directly through Affirm, and soon, installments from credit and debit cards with Apple Pay will be available across the country with Citi, Synchrony, and issuers with Fiserv (NYSE:FI). Importantly, existing Apple Pay Later loans and purchases remain unaffected by this shift.\n\nAnalysts at Macquarie have weighed in on this development, noting that it could have a dual effect. On the positive side, it lessens competitive pressure in the BNPL space, which is beneficial for companies like PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL) and Block Inc (NYSE:SQ) that have direct exposure to this market.\n\nConversely, the shift to a third-party dynamic might result in fewer loans, which could potentially have a minor impact. However, this impact is not expected to be significant.\n\nThe analysts also highlight the increasing regulatory pressure and scrutiny faced by BNPL providers globally, which might have prompted Apple to step back from offering a service explicitly labeled as BNPL. This move can be seen as Apple's strategy to mitigate potential risks.\n\nThe recent Australian legislation, which essentially regulates BNPL operators as consumer credit, underscores the risk of compliance becoming increasingly complex for BNPL operators.\n\nThe saturation and competitiveness of the BNPL landscape might have also influenced Apple's decision, as the company may see better use of resources elsewhere.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's strategic shift: From BNPL to installment loans\n\nNvidia stock sinks another 6.7%, shedding over $400B in market cap over 3-day slide\n\nAfter-hours movers: Birkenstock, SolarEdge, MicroAlgo and more\n\nView comments",

        "title": "While Nvidia stock captivates the investing masses, don't forget this other exciting thing about the market",
        "content": "More exciting things are happening inside the market than Nvidia stock (NVDA) going up almost every day.\n\nVeteran New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) floor trader and co-founder of Wall Street Global Trading Academy Peter Tuchman pointed to the bull market in stocks ushering in 40 million new retail investors into the market over the past few years as very \"exciting.\"\n\nAs a result of this influx, household net worth remains on the ascent.\n\nUS household wealth rose to a record of more than $160 trillion in the first quarter, according to the latest data out of the Federal Reserve. During that time, household net worth rose by 3.2%, or $5.1 trillion, with the appreciation in stock prices accounting for $3.8 trillion of the gain.\n\n“We are at the crossroads,” Tuchman said on Yahoo Finance’s Opening Bid podcast (see video above or listen here). “We are in an extraordinary time and history.\"\n\nThese new retail investors have broadened their exposure beyond popular meme names such as GameStop (GME) and AMC (AMC), which dominated Robinhood (HOOD) trading accounts in 2021.\n\nThe latest Robinhood Investor Index, which tracks the performance of the top 100 most owned investments on the trading platform, shows that retail investors have plowed into companies they understand and that impact their daily lives, such as Apple (AAPL) and Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nAnd yes, Nvidia.\n\nMaking investing more accessible to more people is a good thing to see, Tuchman added.\n\n“All those barriers to entry that were really significant and kept this a very exclusive place, those days are over,” he said. “I think that’s a really great thing. Suddenly everyone’s been invited to this party.”\n\nTuchman has traded through a lot of market parties through the decades. He is known for iconic images taken of him on the NYSE trading floor, and his wild hairstyles and savvy ways garnered him the nickname “Einstein of Wall Street,” for valid reasons.\n\nHis résumé includes guarding the velvet ropes and being Mr. “No” outside the door of Studio 54, owning a jazz record store, and working at a jazz club.\n\n“My approach to the market was different than your normal person analyzing the market,” he said. Stock trader Peter Tuchman works on the floor of the New York Stock Exchange during afternoon trading on August 29, 2022, in New York City. (Michael M. Santiago/Getty Images) (Michael M. Santiago via Getty Images)\n\nIn the mid-1980s, he took a summer job as a teletypist on the exchange floor and eventually worked his way up to broker.\n\n“The energy, the adrenaline, for me, the minute I walked onto the floor, I knew this was for me,” he reflected.\n\nTuchman’s career overlapped with many significant down market events including Black Monday, 9/11, and the Great Recession. “You saw people losing futures,” he said. “But I also saw the capacity and resilience of human beings in the workplace.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThis past week, there was plenty of resilience, energy, and adrenaline on hand as markets hit new highs.\n\nInvestors saw Nvidia rise to a $3.34 trillion market cap, making it briefly the most valuable company in the world, beating Apple at $3.29 trillion and Microsoft at $3.32 trillion before the stock lost ground.\n\nThis enthusiasm for Nvidia points to its sound position in artificial intelligence going forward — something for 40 million new investors to consider.\n\nDespite the market being hot, it's still important to do your homework and seek out value.

        "title": "Apple’s war with the EU heats up with new antitrust charges and an AI threat",
        "content": "As predicted earlier this month, Apple has become the first firm to face preliminary charges under the European Union’s new Digital Markets Act, a blockbuster package of antitrust rules for Big Tech.\n\nInterestingly, this isn’t about the contentious “core technology fee” that companies like Microsoft and Meta say Apple is using to stymie the development of third-party app stores on iOS. The DMA forces Apple to allow such app stores on its mobile platform, but developers taking this option must pay Apple a $0.54 fee for every first installation of their apps.\n\nThe Commission did say today that it was now formally investigating the core technology fee—so that could result in further charges down the line. But its initial charges against Apple are about the inability of developers freely “steer” users to cheaper offers outside iOS, where Apple can’t claim its usual revenue cut.\n\nAccording to the Commission, Apple prohibits developers from telling iOS users about cheaper deals off Apple’s platform. Apple lets developers use links to steer users from their iOS apps to external websites, but then it hits the developers with more fees—requiring, for example, a payment for purchases the user makes in the first seven days after clicking through to the developer’s website. The Commission says the level of these fees is unjustified.\n\nApple now must defend itself, but, if it can’t convince the Commission that its terms are kosher, the company will face a final non-compliance decision by March 25 next year. Apple did not respond to a request for comment about the preliminary charges.\n\nBut wait, I hear you say, didn’t the Commission already hit Apple with a $2 billion antitrust fine over its anti-steering restrictions, just a few months ago? Yes it did, but that was under the EU’s older, more general antitrust rules (the tech-specific Digital Markets Act allows fines of up to 10% of global annual revenues) and it was also specific to Apple’s restrictions on music-streaming rivals like Spotify.\n\nAs I wrote at the time of that fine, Apple and the Commission are now clearly at war with one another. Today’s European salvo comes just a couple of days after Apple took a shot of its own, declaring on Friday that it won’t roll out its new “Apple Intelligence” AI features in the EU this year, because doing so under the DMA rules could harm users. It’s also holding back from Europe the iPhone Mirroring and SharePlay Screen Sharing features (which aid remote tech support) that it recently announced.\n\n“We are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,” the company said in a statement.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt’s unclear what the DMA’s interoperability provisions—which focus on messaging—have to do with Apple’s ability to roll out a smarter Siri. Also, as journalist Ian Betteridge pointed out over the weekend, EU countries were already unlikely to get Apple Intelligence this year, as it will only be available in U.S. English at first.\n\nThat makes Apple’s AI threat look like an attempt at leverage against the European Commission, but, if so, today’s announcement suggest it didn’t work. And why would it? Apple is counting on its AI features to drive mass upgrades of iPhones later this year, as only the latest iPhones (and last year’s iPhone Pros) will be able to run them. Europe accounts for more than a quarter of Apple’s revenues, so it seems unlikely that the company really intends to shoot itself in the foot by depressing sales there.\n\nIn related news, the Wall Street Journal reports that Apple has been talking to Meta about integrating Meta AI into Apple Intelligence. Of course, Meta also isn’t rolling out its AI in Europe, because privacy regulators won’t let it train its models on users’ personal data without their express consent. So if Meta and Apple do strike that deal, that will be a veritable turducken of AI functionality that Europeans won’t be able to access anytime soon.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space",
        "content": "Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) (NASDAQ:GOOG) is the second-largest holding in my portfolio. Part of the reason why is that I deem it to offer exceptional value whilst also exposing me to the high-growth field of artificial intelligence. While I consider the shares to be well-valued at this time against their intrinsic value, I think there is some opportunity for investor sentiment surrounding the stock to increase as AI becomes further commercialized and adopted around the world.\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 6 Warning Sign with CROX.\n\nIn effect, this could drive up the valuation multiples. Part of the reason I believe this is also likely to happen is that Alphabet's Google could be one of the first major beneficiaries of margin expansion based on the internal adoption of AI and robotics practices more prominently over the next decade.\n\nIn addition, one of the core reasons I hold shares is that I believe CEO Sundar Pichai manages the company very well, and I think while he operates the business with efficiency, I have noticed he is not ruthless in the name of profits like some other big tech companies. To me, this is very important, as I like to know my investments are helping to support people well both inside and outside of the companies.\n\nAlphabet's future position in AI\n\nThe tech giant has an extremely strong position in AI at the moment, with its dedicated research division known for its cutting-edge work in machine learning, natural language processing and other AI technologies. A lot of people do not know that Google's Transformer architecture, which powers models like GPT-3, originated here.\n\nIn addition, Alphabet acquired DeepMind in 2015, which is one of the leading AI research labs globally. It is renowned for its progression in reinforcement learning, where AlphaGo (designed to play the board game Go) and AlphaFold (designed to predict protein structures) became particularly successful.\n\nAlphabet also has an open-source machine learning framework developed by Google called TensorFlow, which is widely used by researchers and developers globally. In addition, the company's custom-built hardware accelerators, called Tensor Processing Units, or TPUs, are designed to speed up machine learning tasks, which enable more efficiency in AI.\n\nThe company has been very clever in its AI efforts in that it has integrated these developments into its products, including search and advertising, Google Assistant and Google Cloud. In my opinion, these areas are likely to evolve much further in the coming years, and I think we are going to see much more heightened use of Gemini and other AI capabilities within Google Docs, Google Calendar and all other cloud services. I also believe at some point the search engine is likely to iterate toward a heavier emphasis on AI. While Alphabet has been clear that it does not want to remove the links in search, it might need to adapt its current model more rigorously to stay competitive with the likes of OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nPichai has also mentioned that Alphabet is reallocating a lot of its workforce, which is going to involve reskilling people because a lot of the old work functions are going to become automated. This is already happening in its advertising division, where significant layoffs have occurred. Many new roles are going to open in AI and machine learning. Therefore, the employees who are willing to start learning these skills now will be well rewarded in the future.\n\nFundamental and competitive analysis\n\nDespite Alphabet's clearly strong position in AI, it should not be underestimated how much competition there is. In my opinion, there are three major competitors to the company in the field of AI models.\n\nFirst is Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), which has a strong partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT, and is also developing AI in-house for use within its Azure cloud platform and for integration with Bing. Second is Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services, or AWS. It has extensive machine learning and AI services, including Amazon SageMaker, which allows developers to build, train and deploy machine learning models. It also uses AI in retail and logistics. Finally, Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) performs leading AI research through its Facebook AI Research, or FAIR, lab. It has helped to advanced computer vision, natural language processing and robotics. It also uses AI for content moderation and user personalization on its platforms.\n\nAWS has much more of a focus on infrastructure for AI model development and deployment and for use internally, whereas Alphabet and Microsoft offer more of a front-end set of services. Therefore, I think Google and Microsoft may end up largely equal in their respective approaches to AI and machine learning over the coming years, with AWS potentially getting larger overall sales due to its development of an ecosystem that supports third-party AI more acutely. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nAlphabet has delivered the lowest compound annual growth rate over the past decade of all four companies. However, I think it should not be underestimated how much more secure the investment is due to its more favorable valuation compared to peers.\n\nWhat is particularly promising about Alphabet, which is different from Amazon, is that it is not very capital-intensive. This is a result of the fact it is not an infrastructure builder or a warehouser like Amazon predominantly is. As Alphabet generates a significant portion of its revenue from software, its free cash flow growth is much more stable. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nIn my opinion, this stability in free cash flow and less of a need for heavy infrastructure buildouts at Alphabet is going to significantly inform its future share price stability. Amazon has had multiple moments of heavy earnings volatility, which has had a direct impact on the stock price. In my investment style, I favor the investments that offer slow, non-volatile returns over the companies that offer more rapid growth at the expense of short-term stability. Part of what allows Alphabet to command this steady growth is that it is fortunate to have consolidated such an extensive moat through its reputation in software services, primarily a result of its size, which means it also benefits from crucial economies of scale.\n\nAlphabet has a very strong balance sheet, with an equity-to-asset ratio of 0.72 at the time of writing. Over the past decade, the ratio has been as high as 0.83 in 2016 and even higher at 0.89 in 2009. In my opinion, the company is managed extremely well financially and its structure is a careful mixture of the closed ecosystem approach of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) along with the diversified portfolio approach of Microsoft. This allows Alphabet to keep many of its customers for long periods of time due to them being heavily embedded in its services, but also to develop risk mitigation through other smaller, diversified bets outside of the core Google projects, like self-driving cars with Waymo and Verily Life Sciences.\n\nValuation analysis\n\nIn my opinion, the most appealing part of the investment case for Alphabet right now is its valuation. It is incredibly rare for a big tech company to trade below intrinsic value. However, in this instance I believe this to be the case.\n\nFor my discounted earnings model, I used Alphabet's weighted average cost of capital, which was 10.57% at the time of writing, for the discount rate. I also estimated the company will deliver 20% annual earnings per share without non-recurring items growth from 2024 to 2034 and 4% annual earnings per share without NRI growth for the terminal stage. The result indicates the stock could be approximately 17.50% undervalued based on this conservative model. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nOver the past 10 years, the annualized earnings per share growth rates for Alphabet have grown from 21.80% to 32.30%. This is a significant expansion, and due to the coming higher utilization of AI internally and the use of robotics in many projects under Alphabet, I believe its margins could expand further, which would likely continue to boost earnings growth even though the company has already well saturated its core markets.\n\nWe should not forget this model is not all that counts, as increased market sentiment over the long term would also be needed to make the present investment worth the current price. The GF Value chart shows Alphabet to be modestly overvalued, and there is further evidence of this from the expansion of its price-sales multiple from the 10-year median of 6.38 to 7.22 currently and the expansion of its price-to-free cash flow ratio from 29.89 as a 10-year median to 33.51. Its earnings tell a different story, with a 10-year median price-earnings ratio without NRI being 27.28 and its current price-earnings ratio without NRI being 26.85. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nThis calls me to do a discounted cash flow model on Alphabet as well to ascertain whether the undervaluation estimate from my discounted earnings model may be too optimistic. In this case, Alphabet looks more fairly valued, with my estimate of 20% annual free cash flow growth from 2024 to 2034 and my estimate of 4% annual FCF growth for the terminal stage. I retained the discount rate as Alphabet's present WACC. The result is a margin of safety of -2.85%. Alphabet Is Undervalued in the AI Space\n\nTherefore, I think shareholders need to ask themselves what metric the broader investing public deems as the most important for ascertaining fair value. Free cash flow is considered the best input for a discount model by professionals, but my experience tells me the broader mainstream news and public puts more emphasis on earnings beats and earnings growth.\n\nTherefore, Alphabet may be fairly valued based on true intrinsic value using free cash flow, but perhaps undervalued when using earnings, a metric more reflective of investor sentiment. Also, the company's earnings could grow more than anticipated with heightened automation capabilities, further elucidating the opportunity here.\n\nRisk analysis\n\nOne of the risks I believe is being overlooked slightly at the moment with companies heavily involved with AI is the negative effects of these technologies, which could become prevalent later on. While each company is doing its best to navigate privacy and security in models and infrastructures, the race toward artificial general intelligence, also known as AGI, is highly competitive. I believe some companies are prone to cut corners to stay ahead. AGI is defined as a superintelligence that can outperform almost any human at any cognitive task.\n\nThe risk of a fast-growth emphasis from Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta and other AI players at this time is that if security and misinformation issues become widespread in dangerous ways, for example, surrounding public health, their reputations could be significantly damaged. With AI in particular, I believe the reputation of these companies is absolutely vital to cultivate and maintain with caution. As many people will use AI for jobs they depend on their incomes for, any issues arising within models that negatively affect users' personal reputations may cause extensive user defection.\n\nAdditionally, the failure to properly integrate AI within search over the long term to provide proper competitive mitigation against other chatbots taking market share from Google needs to be properly understood. If Alphabet fails to restructure its offerings accordingly, I think it is quite possible it will lose a lot of users over the long term to OpenAI.\n\nConclusion\n\nDepending on how investors assess it, Alphabet's stock is either fairly valued or undervalued. However, when you factor in the likeliness of higher margins on the horizon from deeper internal implementations of AI and robotics, I think the investment is very likely undervalued at this time. The company's position in AI is formidable, and I believe it is highly unlikely that it will lose its position as one of the leaders in the field over the next few decades. There is lots of stability in the operational model, which includes stable free cash flow growth as a result of low capital expenditures, making the company more secure of an investment than some other big tech companies like Amazon, where the valuation is more largely dependent on investor sentiment to sustain it.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How to invest in AI as the rally continues",
        "content": "Nvidia became the most valuable company in the world on the back of the AI rally. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) continues to significantly influence equity market gains, with major players like Microsoft (MSFT), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet (GOOG), Amazon (AMZN), and Meta (META) contributing to 64% of the global equity market’s growth in total return terms in the past 18 months.\n\nNotably, chipmaker Nvidia became the largest listed company globally in June. Additionally, 40% of S&P 500 (^GSPC) companies mentioned “AI” in their first-quarter earnings calls, according to FactSet data. Here’s how investors can seize the AI opportunity, according to UBS.\n\nNvidia recently executed a 10-for-1 stock split to reset its share price, which had surged 725% during the preceding 18 months.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nWhile the split increases the number of outstanding shares in circulation, it does not change the company’s overall value. “Splitting the stock shouldn’t create economic value in theory, but it will make the company more accessible to smaller investors,” Morningstar technology equity strategist Brian Colello, explained.\n\nMark Haefele, chief investment officer at UBS global wealth management, said: “AI looks set to remain a key driver of equity market returns. We see opportunities in the enabling layer of the AI value chain and in vertically integrated megacaps.”\n\nSignificant investments are being directed towards AI, particularly at semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Microsoft, Alphabet, Meta, and Amazon are projected to spend approximately $200bn (£158bn) in the sector, a 35% increase over 2023, according to FactSet consensus. For this level of capital expenditure to be justified, AI use cases need to scale up significantly, UBS said.\n\nRead more: What is a stock split and why are big tech companies opting for it?\n\nPotential applications span advertising, customer service, personal and coding assistants, R&D, cybersecurity, and more. However, AI-linked revenue streams are still in the early stages of development.\n\nStory continues\n\nWill AI justify the hype?\n\nUBS expects robust capital investment in AI to continue, driving strong earnings growth for companies within the enabling layer of the value chain. For instance, the Swiss bank expects earnings in the global semiconductor industry to rise by 50% this year and 25% in 2025. As the AI ecosystem expands, annual capital expenditure for the enabling layer could reach $331bn by 2027.\n\nRead more: Trending tickers: Apple, Bitcoin, Target and PepsiCo\n\nHowever, potential risks include the possibility of overcapacity in components like graphics processing units, custom chips, or memory if there’s a lack of significant model advancements or consumer/business uptake.\n\nThe AI value chain: three critical layers\n\nTo understand AI’s potential, UBS breaks down its value chain, comprising of three layers:\n\nEnabling Layer: Includes semiconductors, cloud, data centres, and power supply. Intelligence Layer: Consists of large language models. Application Layer: Encompasses companies providing AI services for specific use cases, such as copilots and coding assistants.\n\nThe tech capex surge has primarily benefited the enabling layer. While fears of overcapacity could introduce volatility, this segment currently enjoys strong investment rates, offering a mix of attractive earnings growth profiles, competitive positioning, and a reinvestment runway. UBS suggests focusing on semiconductor companies leading the AI infrastructure investments at data centres.\n\nMoreover, the AI investment landscape is increasingly dominated by a few major players.\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\n“Over time, we expect the AI market to be dominated by an oligopoly of vertically integrated “foundries” and monolithic players along the value chain. So, alongside semiconductors, we also think investors should position in the oligopolies that are present across the entire technology stack, covering chips, cloud computing, and generative AI models and applications. We think these companies will be well positioned to navigate potential shifts in the competitive landscape in different parts of the value chain,” UBS wrote in its CIO 2H outlook.\n\nAI rally: China or US?\n\nWhile the US has seen the greatest benefits from the AI rally, UBS notes that China's tech giants remain undervalued, trading at similar levels as before ChatGPT's launch. Despite challenges like tariffs, export controls, and local regulations, China’s tech leaders are heavily investing in AI.\n\n“Ultimately, we expect China to develop an AI ecosystem that is distinct from that in much of the rest of the world. This should lead to significant monetisation potential for China’s AI giants,” UBS said.\n\nIs a company riskier than a country?\n\nThe market capitalisation of AI chipmaker Nvidia recently surpassed $3.3trn, more than double Switzerland’s entire blue-chip stock index and significantly more than China’s CSI 300. This raises questions about the risks of holding a single company versus a country-level index.\n\nWhile individual companies are generally more volatile, not participating in the returns these companies generate could pose a greater risk to investors’ wealth over time, according to the Swiss bank.\n\nInvestors should seek quality growth\n\nFinally, UBS said investors should focus on global quality wealth compounders—companies with a competitive edge, pricing power, and high barriers to entry. Such businesses, with a track record of disciplined capital allocation, strong balance sheets, and consistent profit growth, offer long-term sustainable value.\n\nQuality growth, often driven by structural growth themes like sustainable development, energy transition, and water scarcity, should be a core component of investors’ equity holdings, UBS added.\n\nWatch: Nvidia will remain dominant for next 3-5 years: Analyst<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/\\\">NVDA</a>) has reached<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-became-3t-company-133118501.html\\\"> a $3 trillion market capitalization,</a> surpassing Apple (<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/\\\">AAPL</a>) to become the second most valuable company in the US.

        "title": "3 Top Stocks to Tap into Fintech’s Unstoppable Rise",
        "content": "Fintech stocks to buy is our topic for today. The financial technology (fintech) sector is experiencing a surge in growth, in part driven by technological advancements. As a result the global fintech market size is projected to rise from $340 billion in 2024 to $1.15 trillion by 2032. Such a notable growth would translate into a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of over 16%.\n\nSo far in 2024, the benchmark S&P 500 index has gained 15%. Conversely, the widely followed ARK Fintech Innovation ETF (NYSEARCA:ARKF) has underperformed, gaining only 2% year-to-date (YTD). This disparity suggests the potential for a catch-up rally within the fintech sector. With that said, here are three top fintech stocks to buy to tap into the sector’s rapid growth.\n\nADYEN (ADYEY) ADYEY - Adyen headquarters in Amsterdam\n\nSource: www.hollandfoto.net / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst up on our list of fintech stocks to buy is Adyen (OTCMKTS:ADYEY), a global payment processing platform based in the Netherlands. The company facilitates online transactions, serving as a bridge between merchants and consumers.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn late April, Adyen published its first-quarter 2024 business update, showcasing impressive growth metrics. The company’s process volume reached 297.8 million euros, marking a 46% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Net revenue jumped 21% YOY to 438 million euros.\n\nInvestors are noting that Adyen has been active in forming strategic partnerships. For example, Decathlon Hong Kong has selected Adyen’s Unified Commerce solution and Prada SPA (OTCMKTS:PRDSF) integrated Adyen’s platform across its retail channels. Moreover, Adyen has partnered with Nelly Solutions to digitize medical practices. It has also launched Tap to Pay on iPhone in Canada, enabling businesses to accept contactless payments directly on iPhones without extra hardware.\n\nDespite these steps, Adyen shares have declined over 4% YTD. Meanwhile, the current valuation still appears high at 40.3x forward earnings and 19.8x sales. Despite the decline in Adyen’s share price, analysts expect a potential advance of around 43% in the next 12 months. Therefore, interested readers can regard a potential dip in the share price as an opportunity to buy Adyen stock.\n\nNu Holdings (NU) A Nubank sign outside of an office building.\n\nSource: Jo Galvao / Shutterstock.com\n\nDisrupting the traditional financial landscape, Nu Holdings (NYSE:NU) is the next name among today’s fintech stocks to buy. The digital banking platform operates primarily in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia. Nu offers an app that allows customers to open accounts, manage finances, make payments and invest from their smartphones.\n\nStory continues\n\nNu management’s most recent quarterly earnings showcased the company’s robust performance and growth trajectory. Revenue came in at $2.74 billion for the first quarter of 2024, marking a 64% YOY increase, while adjusted net income was $443 million.\n\nInvestors are pleased that Nubank, a subsidiary of Nu Holdings, has surpassed 100 million customers in Brazil, Mexico and Colombia, becoming the first digital banking platform outside of Asia to achieve this milestone. In addition, it recently introduced cryptocurrency transfer functionality, further enhancing its service offerings.\n\nSo far in 2024, NU stock has surged more than 50%. Shares are trading at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 27.1x and a price-to-book (P/B) ratio of 8.2x. Wall Street has a 12-month median price forecast of $12.80 for NU, implying a 7% upside potential.\n\nPayPal (PYPL) Closeup of the PayPal app icon seen on a Google Pixel smartphone. PayPal Holdings, Inc. (PYPL) is a global financial technology company operating an online payment system.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe round up today’s exploration of top fintech stocks to buy with PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL). A pioneer in online payments, PayPal operates a global digital payment platform, facilitating transactions between individuals and businesses. PayPal has also been expanding into cryptocurrency transactions, allowing users to buy, hold and sell cryptocurrencies within their accounts. Recently, PayPal has announcedPYUSD (PYUSD-USD), its own stablecoin, on the Solana (SOL-USD) blockchain.\n\nIn the first quarter of 2024, PayPal delivered a solid performance. Revenue grew 10% YOY on a currency-neutral basis to $7.7 billion. Adjusted net income rose 13% YOY to $1.5 billion, with diluted net income per share up 20% to $1.40. The company’s strong performance came from branded checkout, large enterprises and international markets.\n\nSince January, PYPL stock has declined nearly 3% YTD. PayPal stock in part came under pressure after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) unveiled new features, including Wallet’s Tap to Cash. Meanwhile, PayPal shares currently trade at a favorable valuation of 14 times forward earnings and 2.1 times sales. Analysts are optimistic, setting a 12-month price target of $75 for PYPL. Such a potential increase would suggest a 25% upside, underscoring confidence in PayPal’s growth outlook.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "In recent years, stock investors faced heightened volatility. An economic downturn in 2022 erased gains. Last year, the Nasdaq Composite saw a 43% increase due to AI and tech drivers, which broke previous patterns. Although investors are now seeing an 8% increase in 2024, volatility is still certainly the name of the game. Some of the hyper-growth stocks that have soared the most have AI catalysts many don’t necessarily 100% believe in.\n\nThat said, there are a number of hyper-growth stocks to buy that don’t require the AI backstory to be successful. These companies can survive and thrive with or without this current market tailwind. Let’s dive into why now may be a reasonable time to consider adding these names.\n\nCelsius Holdings (CELH) CELH stock: A view of several cases of Celsius energy drinks, on display at a local big box grocery store.\n\nSource: The Image Party / Shutterstock\n\nFirst on the list is Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH). Known for developing and selling functional drinks and supplements, this company is one of the hyper-growth stocks to buy over the long term. Its energy drinks are widely popular, driving strong share price appreciation after the company’s Q1 2024 results that exceeded market expectations. Analysts are bullish on the company’s long-term prospects, considering its recent successful partnerships with other soft drink companies.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCelsius’ products are not only your average energy drinks, but they are actually healthy. Its Live Fit drinks contain 90% of Vitamin C, 130% of Riboflavin, and 120% for Vitamin B6. Although the market remains hesitant due to its slowing growth, investors are optimistic due to its strong retail demand.\n\n34 hedge fund portfolios held CELH at the end of Q1, indicating room to run higher. Revenue reached $355.7 million, representing a 37% year-over-year increase. Moreover, a new partnership with Ferrari racing positions Celsius to potentially gain market share in the energy and soft drink industry.\n\nCrocs Inc. (CROX) The front of a Crocs (CROX) store in Chiang Mai, Thailand.\n\nSource: Wannee_photographer / Shutterstock.com\n\nKnown for their remarkable design and comfort-forward shoes, Crocs (NASDAQ:CROX) still continues to see strong demand from its customers. Currently, the brand operates in 85 countries and has wholesalers, retail stores, e-commerce platforms, and third-party marketplaces as their platforms. Listed under Nasdaq, the company has robust business and is expected to move well above the $145 per share level, and stay there, moving forward.\n\nThe company’s Q1 results highlighted strong demand, with revenue increasing 6% and earnings per share surging 5%. Brand sales reached $744 million despite HEYDUDE revenue falling and reaching only $195 million. However, the company’s brand portfolio is expected to grow 9% in 2024, despite a decline in HEYDUDE.\n\nStory continues\n\nCurrently, the stock is trading at bargain levels. I think this company could be among the most undervalued in its sector right now.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Matterport company logo on a website with blurry stock market developments in the background, seen on a computer screen through a magnifying glass. MTTR stock.\n\nSource: Dennis Diatel / Shutterstock\n\nSpecializing in detailed 3D models bolstered by property tech, Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR) is another one of the top hyper-growth stocks to buy. With advancing technologies like Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro, accessing digital property tours becomes more seamless and appealing particularly to clients in hospitality and commercial real estate sectors.\n\nRecently, the company launched an emissions reporting tool for select enterprise customers, measuring carbon savings from using its digital twin platform. Developed with carbon accounting experts, this platform helps companies understand emissions avoided by remote collaboration. As corporations increasingly commit to reducing their carbon footprint, this tool supports alignment with the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals and science-based climate targets.\n\nIn other related news, CoStar Group revealed its acquisition of Matterport primarily for real estate. The acquisition, valued at $1.6 billion, includes a split of cash and stock, offering shareholders $2.75 per share in cash and $2.75 in CoStar Group shares. Matterport had previously gone public through a SPAC in 2021.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

The fines can rise to 20% in the event the offence is repeated, the EU said.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: London tepid and Europe in the green as traders look for inflation clues\n\nThis is the first time the commission has levelled a formal accusation against a tech firm under the new rules, after opening the first Digital Markets Act (DMA) probes into Apple, Google (GOOG) and Meta (META) in March.\n\nBitcoin (BTC-USD)\n\nBitcoin was trading lower on Monday as the crypto market recorded its second-worst weekly drop of 2024 amid cooling demand for crypto ETFs.\n\nBitcoin has now fallen below $63,000 (£49,750), nursing steep losses over the past week as traders grew sceptical over the timing of interest rate cuts by the Federal Reserve.\n\nFor some analysts, the retreat in digital assets is a warning sign for broader risk appetite, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe cryptocurrency is at a more than one-month low, hurt by a six-day streak of outflows from US ETFs for the token.\n\nBitcoin hit a record of $73,798 in March but is trailing traditional assets such stocks, bonds and gold this quarter.\n\nTarget (TGT)\n\nShares in Target were higher in pre-market trading as investors welcomed the announcement that the retailer plans to rolls out a new AI tool to improve productivity and growth.\n\nThe retailer said it would roll out its gen AI-powered chatbot, Store Companion, by August, giving its associates at its early 2,000 stores a tool that can “answer on-the-job process questions, coach new team members, support store operations management and more.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe chatbot will be accessible via an app on handheld devices issued to store personnel, offering instant answers to procedural questions.\n\nRead more: 'How I built £100m bathroom business Plumbworld'\n\nTarget is the latest US retailer to announce that it plans to use AI to support its customers and frontline workers.

The latest offer valued the company at £3.1bn.\n\nCarlsberg now has until 19 July to make a firm offer for the tonic maker or walk away from the deal.\n\nWatch: Amazon is a top pick: Wedbush analyst on digital advertising<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN\\\">AMZN</a>) could be going through its own post-COVID \\\"Renaissance period,\\\" according to Wedbush Securities Equity Research <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:2;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/why-wedbush-bullish-trade-desks-202748336.html\\\">Managing Director Scott Devitt</a>.</p>\\n<p>Devitt joins Yahoo Finance's Market Domination, commenting on Amazon's reaccelerating growth in the digital advertising space. </p>\\n<p>\\\"What you're finding is these data repositories of media content are now being brought to life,\\\" Devitt tells Yahoo Finance. \\\"And that's going to continue to enhance the advertising models as these retail companies — some of which do it directly, like Amazon — providing their own demand-side platform for their retail media inventory to third party advertisers and many retailers that don't have the capacity to do that.\\\"</p>\\n<p>Yahoo Finance has been interviewing the top executives in advertising and creative marketing across industries at the 2024 <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:3;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/videos/event/cannes/\\\">Cannes Lions International Festival of Creativity</a>.</p>\\n<p>For more expert insight and the latest market action, click <a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:4;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/video/mortgage-rates-slip-ai-stocks-173711756.html\\\">here</a> to watch this full episode of Market Domination.</p>\\n<p><em>This post was written by </em><a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:5;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://www.yahoo.com/author/luke-carberry-mogan/\\\"><em>Luke Carberry Mogan</em></a><em>.</em>\",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/MhjMqI35nKwmWN_tc4B6DA--~B/aD0zMzEzO3c9NTg4NDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2024-06/1cc62730-2fe1-11ef-aa5b-305cef7d4833\",\"duration\":\"PT1M51S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/59a2bfe2-b155-3bea-8ead-73692323d694.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/amazon-top-pick-wedbush-analyst-120037979.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"59a2bfe2-b155-3bea-8ead-73692323d694\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

Archrival JD.com Inc. launched a JD.Vision app that promises to help people virtually place products in their homes, aided by an AI chatbot.\n\nApp support is critical for the $3,500 Vision Pro’s market success, after the new Apple gadget got off to a rocky start in the US. Netflix Inc. decided against creating a bespoke app, and its website directs users to navigate via Apple’s Safari browser if they want to watch movies on the headset. Apple has said its Chinese equivalent, Tencent Video, will support the device. Amazon.com Inc. has also not produced a tailored app, whereas Alibaba and JD.com are jumping on board.\n\nThe headset is slated to debut in China, Japan and Singapore on June 28, in an expansion following its US launch in February. After spurring a major sales premium for imported units in overseas markets, the gadget quickly lost steam and was available for less than its US retail price in Hong Kong stores within weeks. It has failed to generate significant sales so far.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nHow Jeff Yass Became One of the Most Influential Billionaires in the 2024 Election How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Ilya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Wedbush analysts believe the market is starting to recognize that with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Intelligence on the horizon, Apple’s “AI-driven super cycle is about to begin.”\n\nAccording to the investment firm, tech giants like Meta (NASDAQ:META) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) will likely need to integrate their AI models into Apple Intelligence, as Apple's iOS ecosystem, encompassing 2.2 billion devices and 1.5 billion iPhones, holds the keys to this vast market.\n\n“We expect developers over the next 6 to 12 months will build hundreds of generative AI-driven apps that will be key ingredients in the recipe for success for Apple as its technology stack creates the core building blocks of the consumer AI tidal wave we see coming starting with iPhone 16 in mid-September,” analysts wrote.\n\nApple’s partnership with OpenAI paves the way for developers worldwide to focus on iOS 18, creating numerous monetization opportunities for the iPhone maker, analysts noted.\n\nThey believe the market is underestimating the potential impact, estimating incremental high-margin Services growth of $10 billion annually for Apple. This partnership is expected to launch a new multi-pronged AI revenue stream, driven by both hardware and software.\n\nWedbush also pointed out that signs of iPhone stabilization are emerging based on recent supply chain checks in Asia, which bodes well for the upcoming iPhone 16 upgrade cycle. After a better-than-expected March quarter, optimism for iPhone growth is appearing in various markets.\n\nThe firm expects that June will mark the last negative growth quarter for China, with a growth turnaround expected to begin in the September quarter.\n\n“China remains the linchpin of growth for Apple and now this key region is set to see growth once again starting with iPhone 16 in our view,” it said in a note, reiterating an Outperform rating and a $275 price target on the stock.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWedbush: Apple AI-driven super cycle about to begin\n\nRXO to buy UPSâ€™s Coyote Logistics for $1 billion, shares surge\n\nItaly's Eni likely to finalise Enilive stake sale by year-end, CEO says\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple's EU issues, Broadcom's chips, talks over EV tariffs - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Wall Street looks set to start the new week on a positive note, although the Fed's inflation gauge, due at the end of the week, could determine near-term direction. Apple has run foul of European Union rules, while Broadcom is working with Chinese firm ByteDance over the supply of AI chips.\n\n1. Futures just higher ahead of key inflation release\n\nU.S. stock futures edged higher Monday, starting the last week of the first half of the year near record highs, largely boosted by the enthusiasm surrounding artificial intelligence.\n\nBy 04:20 ET (08:20 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 70 points, or 0.2%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 12 points, or 0.2%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 45 points, or 0.2%.\n\nThe S&P 500, a broad-based benchmark index, hit a new intraday record late last week, and is up almost 15% so far this year, while the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite has gained almost 18%.\n\nThe blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average has lagged, by contrast, gaining just under 4% in the first half of the year.\n\nThe main focus this week will be Friday’s release of the May personal consumption expenditure data, the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge.\n\nInvestors have been trying to gauge when the U.S. central bank will start cutting interest rates, with Fed officials expressing their desire for more inflation data confirming the easing of prices before agreeing to a reduction.\n\nThere are also a number of key companies earnings this week, including FedEx (NYSE:FDX), Micron (NASDAQ:MU), Walgreens Boots Alliance (NASDAQ:WBA) and Nike (NYSE:NKE).\n\n2. Apple has breached EU rules - EC\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has run into regulatory difficulties in the European Union.\n\nThe European Commission, which also acts as the EU antitrust and technology regulator, said Monday the iPhone maker's App Store rules breach EU tech rules because they prevent app developers from steering consumers to alternative offers.\n\nThe EU executive said it was also opening an investigation into Apple over its new contractual requirements for third-party app developers and app stores.\n\n\"None of these business terms allow developers to freely steer their customers. For example, developers cannot provide pricing information within the app or communicate in any other way with their customers to promote offers available on alternative distribution channels,\" the EU watchdog said.\n\nThe EU opened an investigation into the U.S. tech giants in March under a landmark new law known as the Digital Markets Act.\n\nSo-called anti-steering rules were one of the big areas of focus of the probe. Under the DMA, tech firms are not allowed to block businesses from telling their users about cheaper options for their products or about subscriptions outside of an app store.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. ByteDance working with chipmaker Broadcom - Reuters\n\nChinese technology firm ByteDance is working with U.S. chipmaker Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) to develop an advanced artificial intelligence processor, even as the U.S. is attempting to restrict the export of these vital chips to its main economic rival.\n\nA deepening of the partnership between the two companies, which Reuters reported on Monday, represents more efforts by Chinese technology firms to secure the supply of advanced AI chips, after the U.S. blocked several major chipmakers, most notably NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), from selling their most advanced AI technology to China.\n\nThe 5 nanometre chip will be compliant with U.S. export curbs and is likely to be outsourced for manufacturing to TSMC, the world’s biggest contract chipmaker.\n\nBytedance and Broadcom already have partnerships in place, with the TikTok owner having purchased several AI-linked chips from the firm over the past couple of years.\n\nThis follows a broad push into generative AI over the past year, which has served as a major source of demand for global chipmaking firms.\n\n4. EU to hold EV trade talks with China\n\nChina and the European Union have agreed to start talks on the planned imposition of tariffs on Chinese-made electric vehicles (EVs) being imported into the European market.\n\nThe European Commission announced earlier this month that it is planning to impose provisional duties on EVs produced in China of up to 38.1%, on top of its standard 10% tariff for car imports.\n\nThe duties are due to apply by July 4.\n\nThe news prompted the ire of Beijing, with Chinese authorities hinting at the possibility of retaliatory measures.\n\nThe state-aligned Global Times newspaper reported on Sunday that China wants the European Union to revoke its decision to impose provisional tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles.\n\nWhile the talks hint at the possibility of a de-escalation of this trade conflict, the United States also hike tariffs on Chinese cars in May, suggesting coordination in the West's trade war with Beijing.\n\n5. Yen intervention talk on the rise\n\nIntervention talk is on the rise in foreign exchange markets Monday, after the Japanese yen weakened to its lowest level against the dollar since April 29 earlier Monday, with the USD/JPY pair climbing to a high of 159.93.\n\nIn April the pair touched a 34-year low of 160.245, leading to Japanese authorities spending roughly 9.8 trillion yen to support the currency.\n\nThe yen has come under renewed pressure after the Bank of Japan's decision this month to hold off on reducing bond-buying stimulus until its July meeting.\n\nThe yen losses prompted Japan's top currency diplomat Masato Kanda to say on Monday that authorities will take appropriate steps if there is excessive foreign exchange movement.\n\n\"We will firmly respond to moves that are too rapid or driven by speculators,\" Kanda said, while noting that the authorities have no specific levels in mind on when to intervene.\n\nKanda said that the addition of Japan to the U.S. Treasury's foreign exchange manipulation monitoring list had \"absolutely no impact\" on Tokyo's policy options.\n\nA U.S. Treasury report issued last week added Japan to its foreign exchange monitoring list alongside six countries that were on the previous list.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple's EU issues, Broadcom's chips, talks over EV tariffs - what's moving markets\n\nEU has solution to use frozen Russian funds for Ukraine, Borrell says\n\nSome Indian rate panelists see growth risks from tight policy\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia, Microsoft, or Apple: Which Will Be the First to Reach a $4 Trillion Market Cap?",
        "content": "Three artificial intelligence-fueled stocks currently dominate the top of the market. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has rocketed higher over the past 18 months, briefly surpassing both Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) as the most valuable company in the world.\n\nAfter Friday's close, Microsoft had the highest market cap at $3.34 trillion, followed by Apple at $3.18 trillion and Nvidia at $3.11 trillion.\n\nAll three are within striking distance of $4 trillion, but investors may be wondering which stock has the best chance of getting there first.\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia's financial results have been fueled by the ongoing artificial intelligence (AL) arms race. Big tech companies are buying up as many of Nvidia's chips as they can get their hands on, which has pushed Nvidia to raise prices as supply struggles to keep up with demand.\n\nNvidia's first-quarter revenue of $26 billion is up 262% from a year ago, and its gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to 78.4%. That fueled a massive 629% increase in earnings per share (EPS).\n\nThere aren't many signs of slowing down over the next few months either. Management's Q2 outlook for $28 billion in revenue and 74.8% gross margin suggest another strong earnings result. Meanwhile, big tech companies including Microsoft, Meta Platforms, and Tesla all shared plans to increase their spending on AI data-center expenditures, which include large purchases from Nvidia.\n\nBut the long-term outlook is less certain. Nvidia receives a large concentration of its sales from just a handful of customers. One customer accounts for 13% of its direct sales, and one indirect customer accounts for 19% of total revenue. Meanwhile, those big customers, including Microsoft, Meta, and others, are all designing and deploying their own AI chips for their data centers. Once they scale manufacturing, those chips may ultimately provide a more cost-efficient solution for their data centers, reducing their orders from Nvidia.\n\nThe short-term potential for Nvidia remains high, but the long-term is murky at best.\n\nThe case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft has consistently found itself to be one of the largest companies in the world since the 1990s. It's kept up with the changing technology landscape throughout its history, and it made an early bet on generative AI leader OpenAI that helped cement its position in artificial intelligence.\n\nMicrosoft's early bet on OpenAI and integration with its Azure cloud-computing platform made it the defacto choice among developers looking to use its large language models (LLMs). Azure OpenAI Service has helped fuel Microsoft's cloud-computing revenue 31% higher year over year in the most recent quarter, with 7 points of growth coming directly from AI services.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft's also using OpenAI's models to power its Copilot feature across its enterprise-software offerings. The service has seen strong adoption with over 1.8 million paid subscribers, growing 35% quarter over quarter. It surpassed 400 million paid Office 365 seats earlier this year, so there's still a massive runway for it to grow the service.\n\nAs the leading enterprise software company and one of the few hyperscale cloud platforms, Microsoft's revenue looks secure. It's investing heavily in building out Azure data centers as demand for AI compute continues to grow, and it should see a strong return on capital since it's also integrating AI features across its entire suite of software. Its position as a leading player in two massive markets should make it a shoo-in to reach a $4 trillion market cap eventually.\n\nThe case for Apple\n\nApple unveiled its AI efforts earlier this month during its annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). CEO Tim Cook promised to \"break new ground\" in AI this year. Whether Apple's new AI features constitute groundbreaking innovations is up for debate, but one thing everyone seems to agree on is that Apple did something only Apple can do.\n\nApple seamlessly integrates its new generative AI features into the iPhone and its other devices. Siri will be far more capable than in the past, acting more like a personal assistant to help remind you of things and schedule appointments. Other generative AI features will make workflow on Apple's devices faster and more efficient. Apple also developed a way to integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into the service without sharing any user data, and it's working on adding new partners in the same way.\n\nHere's the big kicker: Apple's latest AI-powered features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, or the next generation of iPhones set to be released this fall. That could fuel a massive upgrade cycle. Over 93% of existing iPhone users don't have a compatible device right now, according to estimates.\n\nI think it's unlikely to see hundreds of millions of additional upgrades this year, though. Apple's AI won't be available outside of the United States to start. But it could see a small boost in sales and average selling price, and that boost could be sustained for several years as Apple improves its AI features and makes its new devices more enticing.\n\nA bigger upgrade cycle than anticipated this fall could push Apple's stock to a $4 trillion market cap. Combining strong iPhone and service revenue with its massive share-repurchase program should produce strong EPS growth supporting a higher stock price.\n\nWhich one will reach $4 trillion first?\n\nIf I had to bet on one company reaching a $4 trillion market cap, it would be Microsoft. The company's position in enterprise software is unmatched, giving it a massive platform to sell new AI features. What's more, its partnership with OpenAI makes it a top choice for developers looking to access its large language models and create new AI applications. There's a long runway of growth ahead for Microsoft despite its already massive size.\n\nBut either Nvidia or Apple could reach $4 trillion faster if they produce better-than-expected results in the near term. Despite long-term challenges for Nvidia, the near term looks strong. But there's already a lot of upside built into its share price with its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio above 50 times. Apple, meanwhile, is more stable and could benefit from further growth catalysts of strong iPhone sales and additional AI partnerships.\n\nI think Apple has a good chance to reach $4 trillion first, but it's far from guaranteed. Both it and Microsoft look like great investments, even at this price. Nvidia is a lot riskier given its customer concentration and its current valuation.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Because he has one of the most successful track records, Warren Buffett is a legend in the finance world. The investing moves he makes as head of Berkshire Hathaway are watched by both amateurs and pros.\n\nMore recently, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) has arguably been the best stock the conglomerate has owned. Berkshire initially bought shares in the first quarter of 2016. From the start of that quarter to June 18, 2024, shares of this consumer tech titan have soared 714%. That monster gain has made Apple into Berkshire's largest holding, representing a jaw-dropping 43% of the massive $390 billion portfolio.\n\nA lot can be learned by looking at Buffett's decision-making process when he first chose to buy the \"Magnificent Seven\" stock. Investors should then view things with a fresh perspective to see if these factors still hold true and could make Apple a smart buy today.\n\nThe Apple of Buffett's eye\n\nRunning through case studies to try to figure out why Warren Buffett first decided to buy Apple can reveal insights that the average investor can use in their own process. By looking at Berkshire's purchase of the tech stock back then, I can identify some key attributes that might have swayed the Oracle of Omaha.\n\nApple was a smaller business nearly a decade ago, but it still possessed one of the world's strongest brands. The company's popular hardware products, most notably the iPhone, promoted customer loyalty. But thanks to Apple's software and services, a powerful ecosystem was created that discouraged customers from leaving for competing platforms.\n\nThat brand recognition and customer loyalty helped drive tremendous pricing power. This was indicated by Apple's fiscal 2015 gross margin of 40.1%. It seemed like customers were willing to pay up for the expensive products.\n\nApple's financials were in pristine shape when Buffett first bought the stock. In fiscal 2015, the business raked in $53 billion in net income, good for a stellar profit margin of 22.8%. And Apple was sitting on $206 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, compared to $56 billion of long-term debt (as of Sept. 26, 2015). This was not a financially struggling enterprise.\n\nWarren Buffett loves buying high-quality businesses. But he will only do so if the price is right. During Q1 2016, shares of Apple traded at an average price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just 10.6. No, that's not a typo. This looks like an absolute steal in hindsight.\n\nIs it too late to buy Apple stock?\n\nClearly, Apple worked out to be a fantastic investment decision for the Oracle of Omaha. And today, it represents a large chunk of Berkshire Hathaway's public equities portfolio. But investors shouldn't automatically buy the stock. The current setup isn't the same as when Buffett first bought shares.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple is a more mature company in 2024 than it was in 2016. This means that its growth prospects are a bit more limited. Sales declined 2.8% in fiscal 2023, and they fell again in the second quarter of fiscal 2024.\n\nFor these lower growth trends, investors are being asked to pay a price-to-earnings ratio of 32.7. That's a ridiculously steep valuation which is 53% higher than Apple stock's trailing 10-year average P/E multiple. And the current valuation is three times more than when Buffett first added Apple to the Berkshire portfolio.\n\nAccording to the valuation, expectations remain high for this company and its future.

        "title": "Apple, Microsoft, or Nvidia: Which Will Be the World's Most Valuable Company a Year From Now?",
        "content": "Although Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) held the title for a few months, Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) briefly regained its crown as the world's largest company by market cap this month. But then this week, Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) passed it for the first time. As of Thursday, the Windows maker was back in first place again, but with all three companies holding market caps of around $3.2 trillion, in the near term, their rankings within the top three could shift often.\n\nBut what will matter more to investors is where stocks are heading over the medium and long terms. So which of them is most likely to hold the title a year from now?\n\nThe case for Apple\n\nApple was significantly trailing Microsoft until its Worldwide Developer Conference a couple of weeks ago. Although it announced several things during the event, the biggest launch by far was Apple Intelligence -- essentially, Apple's take on artificial intelligence (AI). Those features won't directly generate more revenue for Apple, but the thing to note is the generative AI features will only be available on its latest model smartphones, the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max -- and of course, on the generations that follow.\n\nThis is huge. The current estimates are that more than 90% of active iPhones are older models. So, if Apple Intelligence turns out to be a game changer, it will drive an upgrade cycle stronger than any Apple has experienced since early in the pandemic.\n\nIf that new demand wave arrives, Apple's sales and profits will rocket. That's a compelling argument for the proposition that it will once again be the world's largest company a year from now.\n\nThe case for Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft overtook Apple as the world's largest company due to its heavy involvement with generative AI. Once Microsoft realized the impact this technology could have, it quickly developed an integration with the market leader, OpenAI's ChatGPT, for its Microsoft Office products. To access these features, businesses or consumers need to pay an extra fee, which has boosted Microsoft's revenue stream.\n\nIn addition to Copilot, Microsoft's cloud computing wing has been on fire. Most companies don't have the in-house capacity to run AI workloads, and would rather not spend a fortune to build out that infrastructure. Instead, they rent computing power from cloud computing providers like Microsoft Azure, which gives them access to the hardware they need.\n\nThe wave of demand this has generated has been huge for Microsoft and will likely continue. However, the effect it's having is already apparent to investors, and it's unlikely to get any better from this point on.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe case for Nvidia\n\nNvidia has been an absolute rocket ship since the start of 2023. The massive demand for AI has driven a parallel surge in demand for the most powerful graphics processing units (GPUs), which can provide the high-speed computational power that software requires. This has caused a surge in revenue and profits for Nvidia -- the leading maker of those cutting-edge chips -- taking it from a company worth less than $500 million to one of the world's largest in a year and a half. AAPL Market Cap data by YCharts.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns about Nvidia's ability to maintain its valuation. Chipmaking is a cyclical business, and some investors are worried that demand for those GPUs will drop, and that the bottom will fall out of the stock.\n\nThis is, in my view, a misguided notion. Nvidia is still seeing demand for its GPUs grow. Furthermore, it recently launched the H200 GPU, which supersedes the incredibly popular H100 with better efficiency and performance. Additionally, the lifespan of a data center GPU is estimated to be between three and five years. As such, investors should expect a refresh cycle will likely kick off relatively soon, driving continued demand for Nvidia's GPUs.\n\nThis argument may be a bit more shaky than the other two, but there's still a strong case to expect that a year from now, Nvidia will be the world's largest company.\n\nThe verdict\n\nThe answer to the question of which of these three will be the biggest depends on how \"must-have\" consumers deem the Apple Intelligence features to be. I'd guess Apple will hold the No. 1 spot a year from now unless Apple Intelligence is an absolute flop. Its revenue streams have remained steady despite sliding demand for its iPhones. This new catalyst could kick-start their sales and the stock to new levels.\n\nIf it's not Apple, I'd say Microsoft is a more likely leader than Nvidia. However, Nvidia is the biggest wildcard here, as it could see the already incredible demand for its GPUs go higher, which could ignite another run-up in the stock.\n\nMicrosoft would be the most conservative pick, but it would still be a good one if the AI buzz wears off.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nI came to one important realization at France's Cannes Lions Festival this week as I watched Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Apple (AAPL) duke it out for the most valuable company on our stellar app.\n\nSimilar to most millennials, I have no clue about the wealth of my baby boomer parents. Like, zero idea. None. Zilch. Nada.\n\nNow I suspect neither own the surging shares of Apple or Nvidia (I don't think stocks have ever been their thing), but I fancy other baby boomer parents do, and may very well hold on to their positions until they die.\n\nWhat should a millennial do with these lucrative positions? How do they get into their parents' trading and investment accounts? Have our parents thought all these things through? What exactly do I need to know about their wealth today?\n\nThe generational transfer of wealth from boomers to their millennial offspring is starting — so prep now, JPMorgan's chief marketing officer Carla Hassan reminded Rachelle Akuffo and me at Cannes Lions.\n\n\"It's completely uncomfortable. It's also intimidating,\" Hassan said of the money conversations between boomers and millennials.\n\nTo start, JPMorgan offers up a good template on how to think through planning for generational wealth transfers here.\n\nThe impact of generational wealth transfer on markets and the economy in the decades ahead should not be understated.\n\nCerulli Associates estimates that wealth transferred through 2045 will tally a staggering $84.4 trillion. Broken down, that consists of $72.6 trillion that will be transferred to heirs, while $11.9 trillion will be donated to charities.\n\nMore than $53 trillion will be passed down from baby boomer households, representing 63% of all transfers.\n\n\"Family money conversations can be emotional and fraught (as the buzzword of the day seems to be), but they don’t have to be, especially if everyone is on the same playing field,\" Yahoo Finance's personal finance and retirement expert Kerry Hannon told me.\n\n\"It can even start with talking about special objects that your parents have that are meaningful to you, say, a grandfather clock that has been passed down for generations, or a certain painting you know they bought in Paris on a trip when they were newly married.”\n\nTake me.\n\nIn my brain, I have sketched out the case that my parents will be around forever and there is no need to have The Talk. I also remember getting yelled at by my dad when I asked for an allowance — so somewhere in my head that is an emotional blocker.\n\nStory continues\n\nI also have no idea where to find anything of importance for them should something happen. I don't even know where my dad lives in Florida — haven't seen him since he moved there more than five years ago! My mom lives five miles from me, but I still have to knock on her door to enter the house — no key!\n\nKerry's advice is something to keep in mind as I work on that starter conversation with Mom and Dad.\n\nBut as they say, it's a two-way street!\n\n\"More and more clients are opting to make wealth transfers to their children while they are living instead of waiting until they pass, because they can enjoy seeing the impact of their gifts when the kids need it most,\" said Hemington Wealth Management founder and CEO Eileen O'Connor.\n\nThe clock is ticking.\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "title": "Best Stock to Buy Right Now: Apple vs. Amazon",
        "content": "Perhaps no two tech-oriented, consumer product companies are ingrained in U.S. consumers' everyday lives as much as Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nAmazon is the leader of e-commerce, controlling a nearly 38% market share in the U.S. It's next closest competitor is Walmart, which has a less than 7% market share.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is estimated to hold a more than 59% market share in the smartphone market in the U.S.; Samsung is a distant second at 23%.\n\nWhile both companies have dominant market positions in the U.S. in their respective fields, the question is which stock is the better buy at the moment?\n\nGrowth and future prospects\n\nAmazon has been solidly outperforming Apple on the revenue growth front the past few quarters. The e-commerce giant has been able to grow its revenue by double digits each of the past four quarters, including by 13% last quarter to $143.3 billion.\n\nApple, on the other hand, has been struggling with growth. The company has only seen its revenue increase once in the past four quarters, a scant 2% gain in its December quarter. Last quarter, meanwhile, revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion. The company has been hampered by struggling iPhone sales in China and a lengthening replacement cycle.\n\nBoth companies are looking toward artificial intelligence (AI) to help spur growth.\n\nWhile not growing as quickly as its two main cloud computing competitors, Amazon's Amazon Web Services (AWS) segment is still showing solid revenue growth, up 17% last quarter. The company plans to increase capital expenditures to expand its data center operations in order to meet the increasing demand for generative AI. The company believes this upfront investment will lead to strong free cash flow and better operating margins down the road.\n\nThe company is also helping customers build out their own AI solutions through its Bedrock and SageMaker platforms. With BedRock, the company is providing foundational large language models (LLMs) from both itself and AI start-ups, while SageMaker helps customers create their own AI models.\n\nApple, meanwhile, has just jumped into the AI race with a number of AI features that will be powered by its Apple Intelligence solution. Apple Intelligence will be incorporated into its latest operating systems and be able to be used within its own and third-party apps while maintaining user privacy. It will also be added to its voice assistant, Siri, to help with various tasks such as finding a specific photo or hotel booking information.\n\nThe big hope for Apple is that the new AI features will help spur a hardware upgrade cycle, as later versions of its devices are generally needed to run these AI-related functions. The company has seen upgrade cycles start to lengthen, so these new features and future AI capabilities could spur people to more quickly upgrade their smartphones and computers.\n\nStory continues Image source: Getty Images\n\nValuations\n\nApple stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of under 33, lower than Amazon's forward P/E of over 40. AAPL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nHowever, Amazon has been growing its revenue at a much faster clip than Apple, which has struggled to grow its revenue over the past 12 months. Amazon has also been seeing more earnings growth, as the company leverages fixed costs to grow its bottom line.\n\nBoth companies have solid balance sheets. Amazon carries about $8 billion in net cash, while Apple has a whopping $68.6 billion in net cash on its balance sheet. Apple's large cash position and prolific free cash flow give it a lot of flexibility to buy back shares, and the company recently announced an additional $110 billion share repurchase program.\n\nThe winner\n\nAmazon and Apple have proven to be two of the most successful companies in the world, and both should be long-term winners for investors. If I had to choose only one, I'd pick Amazon at this time given its higher growth. The company has also shown a willingness to spend a lot of cash in order to win in the past, and combined with the potential of AI, I think this will be a winning strategy.\n\nHowever, considering the potential of a hardware upgrade cycle due to AI, a cheaper valuation, and a boatload of cash, I wouldn't just toss Apple aside. Fortunately, investors can own both of these solid stocks if they choose.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Nvidia and Microsoft Will Make Up Over 40% of This Popular ETF. Here's Why This Alternative ETF Could Be a Better Option.",
        "content": "The three largest tech companies right now (as measured by market cap) are 1. Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), 2. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and 3. Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL), with each valued relatively close to the other, and all three valued over $3.25 trillion. Not surprisingly, these stocks are the top three holdings of the popular State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSEMKT: XLK), which tracks the S&P Technology Select Sector index.\n\nThe holdings in the fund are rebalanced quarterly to account for changing valuations, and that has created a situation. In an unusual quirk, the top two holdings in this exchange-traded fund (ETF) (Microsoft and Apple) now account for the bulk of its portfolio, far outstripping its third-largest holding (Nvidia). The reason why is that the index has a rule that caps holdings with over 5% allocations so that the top two cannot exceed 50% of the index's combined portfolio. There is another rule in effect saying that once the 50% allocation is breached, no other stock in the portfolio (including No. 3) can exceed 4.5% of the index. It sounds complicated because these investing rules often are. Suffice it to say the rules exist for some useful reason, but they are creating an unforeseen situation because of some unusually strong stock performance by these three stocks.\n\nThese rules have resulted in Microsoft and Apple each representing over 20% of the index at the moment, while the No. 3 holding (Nvidia) represents less than 6%. However, Nvidia's market cap exceeded Apple's on the day chosen to determine the index's next quarterly rebalancing, So the chipmaker will jump up to represent over 20% of the index when the rebalancing happens while Apple's weighting is expected to drop to around 4.5%.\n\nThis will cause the $71 billion ETF to buy a lot of Nvidia shares (at elevated prices) while subsequently dumping a bunch of Apple shares (also at elevated prices). That's not necessarily a smart investing move to make right now, but rules are rules.\n\nIs it time to buy a different ETF?\n\nAn ETF dominated by Microsoft and Nvidia, two of the companies most benefiting from artificial intelligence (AI), doesn't seem like a bad idea on the surface.\n\nNvidia has been the biggest AI winner thus far with its graphic processing units (GPUs) being the choice for the infrastructure needed for AI model training and inference. The company isn't the only producer of GPUs, but programmers have long been trained on Nvidia's Cuda software platform, which has led it to become the de facto GPU leader in the space, with a wide moat. As a result, its first-quarter revenue surged 262% to $26 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicrosoft, meanwhile, has been an early adopter of AI through its large investment and partnership with OpenAI. The company's Azure cloud computing business has been the biggest beneficiary so far, as customers build their own AI solutions using its Azure platform. Microsoft has also benefited from AI in other areas, including the adoption of its AI assistant Copilot. Its developer platform GitHub grew revenue by 45% year over year last quarter with more companies embracing its GitHub Copilot. And Microsoft 365 saw revenue jump 14% helped by the early success of Copilot in that platform.\n\nAs Nvidia and Microsoft stocks perform, so will the ETF given the large weighting in these names.\n\nHowever, the dramatic weighting shift between Nvidia and Apple shows the risk associated with the ETF. It also missed out on some of Nvidia's earlier gains because of its allocation rules. Meanwhile, one poor quarterly showing from Nvidia could dramatically knock down its weighting. It seems these rules intended to benefit shareholders might actually be hurting them. Image source: Getty Images\n\nA better alternative?\n\nGiven these issues, I think there is a better alternative for investors who like the idea of an ETF with very large positions in Nvidia and Microsoft. It could be a better choice in the long run than the State Street Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF.\n\nOne great option for investors is the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT). Like the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund ETF, it has large positions in Nvidia and Microsoft. But its top three positions are more balanced.\n\nAt the end of May, Microsoft was its largest position at 16.7%, followed by Apple at 15.9%, and Nvidia at 14%. Given Nvidia's strong June performance so far, it could very well be its top position currently.\n\nOther holdings have much smaller weightings, including Broadcom at 4.2%, Advanced Micro Devices at 1.9%, and Qualcomm at 1.6%.\n\nThe Vanguard ETF has been a strong performer, averaging a 20.3% annual return over the past decade. It has a comparable average return to the State Street fund. And because the Vanguard ETF does not have the same rebalancing quirk, I think it is the better option for investors looking for some nice tech exposure with heavy weightings toward AI leaders Nvidia and Microsoft without certain buying and selling rules that force some questionable stock transactions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Select Sector SPDR Trust - The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Palantir downgraded, Micron PT hiked ahead of earnings",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nMicrosoft is ‘best way to play AI in our coverage,’ Truist says\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains “the best way to play AI in our coverage,” Truist Securities analysts said in a note released this week.\n\n“We believe that many of the key themes that are driving the business under the hood at Microsoft are indicative of the major currents in both our infrastructure and security coverage,” the firm states.\n\n“In particular, we see the company’s evolving AI strategy driving a leadership position in the software industry.”\n\nWhile there will ultimately be multiple winners in the generative AI model space, OpenAI is the clear leader in the LLM space, analysts said.\n\nThey assert that the first-mover advantage with enterprise AI applications will be durable due to the significant consideration being given to architecture and governance decisions.\n\nThe analysts continue to believe that the partnership between Microsoft and OpenAI will drive incremental benefits for MSFT compared to other cloud providers.\n\nPalantir downgraded to Sell at Monnes, Crespi and Hardt\n\nMonness, Crespi, and Hardt analysts have downgraded Palantir Technologies Inc (NYSE:PLTR) shares from Neutral to Sell, setting a target price of $20.\n\nPLTR shares fell nearly 5% following the market open Friday.\n\nThis decision follows a disappointing earnings season for enterprise software and the failure of the 18-month generative AI hype cycle to yield substantial revenue for most industry players. Analysts noted that the market is likely to steer clear of software stocks with excessive valuations.\n\n“After surging 167% in 2023, Palantir’s stock was already rich upon entering 2024 and, with a 49% rally YTD, we believe valuation has now reached a gluttonous extreme,” they wrote.\n\nWhile Monnes believes that Palantir remains well-positioned to benefit from the AI trend and volatile geopolitics in the long term, the firm notes that the stock’s current valuation has reached extreme levels.\n\nCombined with the pressured software industry and irregular revenue from government contracts, “the darkest days of this economic quagmire are ahead of us,” analysts said.\n\nBernstein hikes AAPL price target: Apple ‘can be leader in AI, not a laggard’\n\nInvestment firm Bernstein raised its target price on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), voicing confidence that investors now see the iPhone maker “can be a leader in AI, not a laggard.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe 12-month price target was increased from $195 to $240, suggesting almost 15% upside from the current levels.\n\nWith over 1 billion customers compared to ChatGPT's 100 million, Apple has significant potential to bring AI to a vast audience, improving everyday utility, Bernstein analysts noted. Remarkably, Apple does not pay ChatGPT, “highlighting the power that it holds.”\n\nBernstein also said that investors are growing more optimistic about the upcoming iPhone 16, anticipating a robust product cycle, partly because AI features will only be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and higher models.\n\n“While we are increasingly convinced that Apple will be an AI beneficiary, we see risk that the benefits could take longer to materialize than some bulls appear to believe,” the analysts cautioned.\n\n“Many features for Apple Intelligence will roll out over the next year, and will only work in English, potentially pushing out some upgrades to the iPhone 17 cycle,” they added.\n\nWedbush raises Micron PT to $170 ahead of earnings report\n\nEarlier in the week, Wedbush Securities analysts reiterated a Buy rating on memory chipmaker Micron Technology Inc (NASDAQ:MU) and hiked their price target from $130 to $170, ahead of the company’s earnings report next week.\n\n“In our view, the primary question with MU is history suggests the stock is expensive vs. asset levels,” the firm’s analysts noted.\n\nAnalysts acknowledge that while memory remains a cyclical industry, they believe it will stay in undersupply through this year and likely much of 2025. This is due to a lack of new investment in NAND and DDR5, partly driven by increased capacity requirements for High Bandwidth Memory (HBM).\n\n“As such, we believe Average Selling Prices (ASPs), revenues, margins, and EPS are all destined to cycle higher, with book also set to lift as FCF flows on to MU's balance sheet,” they noted.\n\n“Net, we expect only positive news for MU's financials for some time to come, and expect the stock will continue to lift until we see a change in industry investment plans.”\n\nRosenblatt: Adeia is ‘the most undervalued AI play in the market’\n\nRosenblatt Securities said intellectual property (IP) licensing company Adeia Inc (NASDAQ:ADEA) is “the most undervalued AI play in the market,” reiterating a Buy rating on its stock.\n\nFollowing discussions with Adeia's CEO, CFO, and VP of Investor Relations, Rosenblatt emphasized the company's \"under the radar\" status despite its leadership in key AI growth sectors.\n\nThe firm’s analysts highlighted the significant opportunity in semiconductors, noting that transistor limitations are bringing Moore's Law to its end. \"Adeia's hybrid bonding and chiplet IP offer a solution\" to these challenges, they remarked.\n\nIn the media sector, Rosenblatt recognized Adeia as \"the leader in digital entertainment IP,\" positioning it well for the ongoing rise of video across various devices.\n\nOn the financial front, Rosenblatt praised Adeia's \"60+% operating margin\" and its valuation.\n\n\"We view Adeia as the most undervalued AI play in the market,\" they stressed. \"We recommend investors take a deeper look at the company.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Palantir downgraded, Micron PT hiked ahead of earnings\n\nYaccarino shakes up X amid Musk's pressure on costs, FT says\n\nGroup claiming CDK systems hack demands millions of dollars, Bloomberg News reports\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Apple Inc. (AAPL)",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hedge fund-approved stocks.\n\nInvesting, broadly speaking, narrows down to two strategies. These see an investor decide whether to buy a stock for the short term and make quick profits or hold it for years to patiently wait for the returns to accrue. One of the most successful investor of our times, Warren Buffett (see his latest portfolio), is an ardent follower of the latter approach, and his wealth bears testament to his success.\n\nOf course, deciding to pick the right stocks to sit on for years isn't easy or else everyone would be rich by now. However, there are ways in which one can gain an edge over others. One such way is to see what the professionals are doing and then emulate their strategy. At Insider Monkey, we get right at the heart of investing by picking out the top stocks that hedge funds are investing in. Why hedge fund stock picks? Well, these professionals, who almost often charge an arm and a leg for their services, conduct extensive due diligence to pick out the right set of stocks. After all, no one would invest with a hedge fund if the fund was simply picking stocks by flipping a coin.\n\nYet, while due diligence is great and necessary to protect investors, investing, at the end of the day, is all about returns. By the looks of it, the funds do seem to know what they're doing. Last year, the top ten hedge fund stock picks ended up outperforming the S&P benchmark stock index by 48.9 percentage points. In other words, while the index returned 26.1% in 2023, the top ten stocks returned 75.1% through price gains. This trend is also present in the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2023 as these posted 53.2% in gains to outperform the S&P by 27 percentage points. Unsurprisingly, year to May 29th, the top 30 hedge fund stocks of 2024 led the S&P's 11% and posted 20.2% in gains.\n\nUnfortunately, though, data shows that as of 2021 end, 14% of the stock market was made of active funds while 16% was accounted for by passive funds. Compared to passive funds accounting for 8% of the market a decade ago with 20% belonging to active funds, it's clear that the broader public believes that shifting to passive is a safer investment approach. After all, while everyone wants to make money, no one wants to lose it either.\n\nBut what if one could make their own investing decisions and gain an inside track to investing by figuring out what stocks most hedge funds have invested in? Well, at Insider Monkey we regularly compile data from more than 900 hedge funds to see where the smart money is headed. This is how we know that the top hedge fund stocks outperformed the benchmark index last year, and it's also a strategy that's helped us beat the market over the last 10 years. Compared to the SPY's 235.6% in returns between 2014 and May 2024, the 10 most popular stocks among hedge funds returned 463.7%.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut wait. At this point, you could argue that since hedge fund SEC filings come with a 45 day lag, perhaps they aren't that important. After all, it might be more important to know what the funds are doing now. Well, since we've been compiling top hedge fund stocks since 2012 in our quarterly newsletter, we can guarantee you that the top hedge fund stocks haven't changed by much since 2018. So not only isn't the time lag that significant, but by subscribing to our newsletter, you can gain an early track to see which stocks are falling out of favor among the funds as well.\n\nSo, all this talk about the top hedge fund stocks might make you wonder about the stocks themselves. Curious? Check out the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds. We also cover legendary investors through pieces such as Warren Buffett’s 12 Longest Held Stocks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top ten hedge fund stocks, we scanned Insider Monkey's database of 900+ hedge fund filings for Q1 2024 and picked out the stocks with the highest number of investors.\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors In Q1 2024: 150\n\nOne of the largest technology companies in the world, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) needs no introduction. However, its place at the top of the tech market value chain has been in a constant state of flux in 2024, which also shows the changing trends on Wall Street and in the technology industry. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the biggest companies in terms of revenue, but its shares remained lackluster in 2024 before a slew of AI announcements at its WWDC conference. Before the AI announcements, the shares had gained a mere 4% in the year, but since then, the stock is up by more than 8%. While AI might have injected fresh life into Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares, another key determinant of its future is iPhone sales performance.\n\nThe iPhone is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s largest product in terms of revenue, and the shares have been lackluster as investors have been worried about slowing growth in China. These concerns were also on the mind of Aristotle Atlantic Partners, whose Q1 2024 investor letter (shared before WWDC) outlined:\n\nApple contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy’s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset. Apple has yet to demonstrate a competitive AI product, which could present further competitive headwinds for the company.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 8th on our list of the best hedge fund-approved stocks to buy. You can visit 10 Stocks Hedge Funds Are Crazy About Right Now to see the other hedge fund-approved stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) stock has finally joined the artificial intelligence (AI) race.\n\nAnnouncing a tie-up with OpenAI earlier this month, the iEverything giant said it will integrate ChatGPT artificial intelligence into future high-end models of its iPhones, iPads, and Mac computers. The stock is up roughly 9% already in response to the news, and according to wealth management firm Bernstein, Apple could be worth even more.\n\nOn Friday, Bernstein raised its price target on Apple stock to $240 a share, implying a 15% price gain over the next 12 months.\n\nIs Apple stock a buy?\n\nBernstein sees four ways Apple could benefit from the AI megatrend:\n\nBecause older iPhones won't be capable of running on-device AI, people will need to buy newer, more expensive Apple devices. For every 1% acceleration in the upgrade cycle, Bernstein calculates Apple's revenue will grow by 1.8%. Apple should be able to grow high-margin advertising revenue from AI searches on these new iPhones. AI apps downloaded on these new iPhones will generate high-margin app sales. With Apple serving as the gatekeeper to these apps, it will generate commission revenue on e-commerce with these apps.\n\nSo far, so good. But here's where Bernstein's Apple logic turns weird.\n\nBernstein raised its price target by $45 to the new $240 target and continues to recommend buying Apple at $209 a share. Granted, Bernstein's old target was only $195, so it had to raise its price target somewhat to justify recommending the shares. But Bernstein admits that even at its current share price of $209, Apple stock is already \"no longer inexpensive.\"\n\nAnd Bernstein is right. Apple stock already costs more than 32.5 times trailing earnings, and 32.5 times free cash flow as well. But most analysts see it growing profits more slowly than 12% annually over the next five years, even with the boost from \"Apple Intelligence\" -- assuming that boost even materializes.\n\nBernstein is right that Apple stock is expensive. It's wrong to tell investors to buy Apple stock at this time.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Winners and 2 Losers From Apple's Latest Artificial Intelligence (AI) Announcement",
        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) last week sparked a new interest in the stock and caused it to notch fresh all-time highs. However, there are a few winners and losers associated with its primary announcement about Apple Intelligence and its general take on artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo, who are the winners and losers of this conference? The answers may surprise you.\n\nWinner 1: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\n\nTo me, there is a clear winner in this announcement: Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM). Taiwan Semi's business is already doing well, but it just got a catalyst. In 2021, 2022, and 2023, sales from Apple made up 26%, 23%, and 25% of TSMC's revenue, respectively. The smartphone business has struggled recently, but that could turn around quickly.\n\nBecause Apple Intelligence will only be available for iPhone 15 models and newer, it isolates about 90% of iPhone users with an older generation. If Apple Intelligence becomes the latest must-have technology, it could ignite a new demand for iPhones.\n\nWith a large chunk of Taiwan Semi's revenue coming from this business, it would stand to benefit.\n\nWinner 2: Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) is also a huge beneficiary of this announcement. Because Apple chose to partner with OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT), it selected the company that Microsoft has heavily invested in. This also validates its use of ChatGPT throughout its Microsoft Office suite, as it will create a fairly seamless experience for the millions of people who use Office products and iPhones daily.\n\nWhile the plan is for iPhones to run most of these workloads on the smartphones themselves, some of it may have to be outsourced to servers due to the arduous nature of the AI model. When that occurs, it will happen on Microsoft Azure servers because that's where OpenAI has run its technology. This will also serve as an increased revenue stream for Microsoft.\n\nLoser 1: Alphabet\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL), Google's parent company, finds itself on the wrong side. Alphabet's generative AI model, Gemini, competes with ChatGPT. Apple could have chosen Gemini as the model to run its Apple Intelligence on, as it would have been a logical continuation of its partnership.\n\nThis breaks a tradition of Google and Alphabet working together -- the Google search engine is the default one on Apple products because Alphabet pays for it. Recently, this was the subject of an antitrust lawsuit, which may have influenced Apple's decision to choose ChatGPT over Gemini.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegardless, Gemini isn't Apple's pick for its Apple Intelligence, and that's a lost opportunity for Alphabet.\n\nLoser 2: Apple\n\nMy last loser is Apple, which may come as a surprise. Apple will likely see a surge in demand for its iPhones, which will increase sales. But that's not the point I'm trying to make.\n\nApple is a massive company with resources few can dream of having. It has armies of software engineers and more than $60 billion in cash and marketable securities on its balance sheet as of the end of its fiscal second quarter (ended March 30). Yet, it couldn't make its own generative AI model in-house?\n\nThis shows how far behind Apple is in the AI race, as it was caught completely off guard. Because of its partnership with an external company, there will always be questions about data security and what information is being shared with other companies. If it kept that in-house, those questions wouldn't be as relevant.\n\nInstead, this could be the Achilles' heel of a product that otherwise seems solid.

        "title": "Chinese consumers love AI smartphones but Apple faces localisation challenges, report says",
        "content": "Chinese consumers show the strongest interest globally in smartphones with artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities, but foreign handset makers such as Apple will face localisation challenges in the market due to regulatory requirements, according to a new report.\n\nAccording to a report published by market research firm Canalys on Friday, 43 per cent of consumers in China - the world's largest smartphone market - expressed high to very high interest in AI smartphones, a greater percentage than in India and the US, the second and third biggest global smartphone market, respectively.\n\nThe report found that 71 per cent of Chinese consumers were willing to pay extra for AI features, which offered brands a good foundation for establishing a business model and achieving profitability, Canalys wrote.\n\nDo you have questions about the biggest topics and trends from around the world? Get the answers with SCMP Knowledge, our new platform of curated content with explainers, FAQs, analyses and infographics brought to you by our award-winning team.\n\nThe Chinese market, however, also presents challenges to global AI smartphone makers thanks in part to local regulations for large language models and data sovereignty, the firm noted.\n\n\"All AI-capable smartphones shipping in mainland China's market are likely to be mandated to use one of the commercial LLMs approved by the government,\" the Canalys report said.\n\nApple, for instance, may not be able to offer its virtual assistant Siri in China using ChatGPT, the popular chatbot launched by US start-up OpenAI in 2022, according to Canalys. Apple announced earlier this month that it is partnering with OpenAI, which will make its chatbot available for free on several Apple platforms later this year.\n\nThe Canalys report found that 71 per cent of Chinese consumers were willing to pay extra for AI features.

Alibaba owns the South China Morning Post.\n\nApple may also need to set up local servers in China for mainland Chinese user data as part of its Private Cloud Compute system, which was launched earlier this month for private AI processing, Canalys said.\n\nApple's plans to add AI capabilities to its iPhones have received mixed reactions in China, where consumers are unsure about when such features will be available locally, and as cheaper handsets from Chinese brands have been aggressive in integrating AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese smartphone makers including Honor, Oppo, Vivo and Xiaomi have all started to introduce AI features since last year, Canalys said.\n\nHuawei Technologies, on the other hand, has been \"keeping a relatively low profile\" in its generative AI investments, despite being one of the earliest smartphone vendors to use AI chips for tasks such as image optimisation, according to the research firm.\n\nHuawei, similar to Apple and Google, has the advantage of being what it calls a \"full stack player\", with solutions spanning software, cloud infrastructure and end user devices, it said.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the South China Morning Post (SCMP), the most authoritative voice reporting on China and Asia for more than a century.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) closed the most recent trading day at $207.49, moving -1.04% from the previous trading session. This change lagged the S&P 500's 0.16% loss on the day. On the other hand, the Dow registered a gain of 0.04%, and the technology-centric Nasdaq decreased by 0.18%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's shares have seen an increase of 12.2% over the last month, surpassing the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.77% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.15%.\n\nThe investment community will be closely monitoring the performance of Apple in its forthcoming earnings report. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.33, showcasing a 5.56% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, our latest consensus estimate is calling for revenue of $83.07 billion, up 1.55% from the prior-year quarter.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.58 per share and a revenue of $384.68 billion, representing changes of +7.34% and +0.36%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nInvestors should also pay attention to any latest changes in analyst estimates for Apple. These latest adjustments often mirror the shifting dynamics of short-term business patterns. Hence, positive alterations in estimates signify analyst optimism regarding the company's business and profitability.\n\nOur research suggests that these changes in estimates have a direct relationship with upcoming stock price performance. Investors can capitalize on this by using the Zacks Rank. This model considers these estimate changes and provides a simple, actionable rating system.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which ranges from #1 (Strong Buy) to #5 (Strong Sell), has an impressive outside-audited track record of outperformance, with #1 stocks generating an average annual return of +25% since 1988. Over the past month, there's been a 0.17% rise in the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate. At present, Apple boasts a Zacks Rank of #3 (Hold).\n\nLooking at valuation, Apple is presently trading at a Forward P/E ratio of 31.85. This valuation marks a premium compared to its industry's average Forward P/E of 12.3.\n\nAlso, we should mention that AAPL has a PEG ratio of 2.55. The PEG ratio is similar to the widely-used P/E ratio, but this metric also takes the company's expected earnings growth rate into account. The Computer - Mini computers industry currently had an average PEG ratio of 2.31 as of yesterday's close.\n\nThe Computer - Mini computers industry is part of the Computer and Technology sector. This group has a Zacks Industry Rank of 52, putting it in the top 21% of all 250+ industries.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Zacks Industry Rank gauges the strength of our individual industry groups by measuring the average Zacks Rank of the individual stocks within the groups. Our research shows that the top 50% rated industries outperform the bottom half by a factor of 2 to 1.\n\nTo follow AAPL in the coming trading sessions, be sure to utilize Zacks.com.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "S&amp;P 500 Trading Volume Spikes at Wall Street Close: Markets Wrap",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Wall Street’s massive expiration of options not only left stock traders more cautious, it also drove one of the leaders of the bull market to a roller-coaster ride. Volume soared at the close of trading.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt Blackstone’s $339 Billion Property Arm, the Honeymoon Is Over Car Dealers Reel From Cyberattack on $1.2 Trillion Market CDK Tells Car Dealers Their Systems Will Likely Be Down for Days United Airlines Jet Turns Back After Engine Piece Falls Off Apple Won’t Roll Out AI Tech In EU Market Over Regulatory Concerns\n\nIt was estimated that $5.5 trillion expired during the quarterly event ominously known as “triple witching” in which derivatives contracts tied to equities, index options and futures mature. Nearly 18 billion shares changed hands on US exchanges Friday. That’s over 55% above the three-month average.\n\nThis time around, Nvidia Corp. played an added role. The value of contracts tied to the chipmaker due Friday was the second-largest of any underlying asset, lagging only the S&P 500. And the expiration coincided with index rebalancing by S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nTo Steve Sosnick at Interactive Brokers, the “key” rebalance was set to occur in the Technology Select Sector Index — which is the benchmark for the roughly $80 billion XLK exchange-traded fund.\n\n“Nvidia’s index weight will rise dramatically, mostly at the expense of Apple’s,” he noted. “Considering the outsized importance of megacap tech overall — and Nvidia in particular — upon broad market indices, it is not unreasonable for traders to be wary about outsized movements late in the day.”\n\nAs the contracts disappear, investors adjust their positions, adding a burst of volume capable of swinging individual holdings. The S&P 500 edged lower to around 5,465. Nvidia almost erased a plunge of about 5% before pushing lower again. It erased over $220 billion in value in two days. Apple Inc. also fell.\n\nTreasury 10-year yields were little changed at 4.25%. France’s risk premium over Germany closed at the highest since 2012.\n\nThe artificial-intelligence frenzy that briefly made Nvidia the world’s most-valuable company this week also drove record inflows into tech funds, said Bank of America Corp. strategists.\n\nAbout $8.7 billion flowed into tech funds in the week through June 19, according to a note from the bank citing EPFR Global data.\n\n“The ‘all roads lead to Nvidia’ trade is once again bolstered” as Europe falters amid the political turmoil in France, strategist Michael Hartnett said. Still, while investors still feel they need more exposure to AI-related plays, “all asset allocators are concerned about the equity concentration risk.”\n\nStory continues\n\nKeith Lerner at Truist Advisory Services says the firm is downgrading the technology sector to “neutral” after the industry largely outperformed the S&P 500 since their “overweight” call in November.\n\n“Although we still have a favorable long-term view of technology, on a shorter-term basis the sector appears extended, and we would not be chasing the sector,” Lerner noted. “That said, the sector appears far from ‘bubble’ territory, and we believe secular tailwinds will persist around artificial intelligence.”\n\nFriday’s options event came at a critical juncture for markets positioning for the second half of 2024 and the Federal Reserve’s next steps. Data showed US services activity picked up early this month to the fastest pace in more than two years. Separately, sales of existing homes fell for a third straight month.\n\n“Investors should brace for drama,” said Solita Marcelli at UBS Global Wealth Management. “The second half of 2024 is shaping up to be a time of transition and volatility. The decisions that investors make now will be key to navigating this period effectively.”\n\nJohn Stoltzfus at Oppenheimer Asset Management says he remains positive in the outlook for stocks as prospects for improved fundamentals this year show potential to be realized.\n\n“That said, history shows us that stocks and other asset class prices don’t go up in a straight line but rather tend to climb the proverbial ‘wall of worry,’ requiring prudent diversification, patience, and a sense of one’s tolerance to risk and fluctuation for private investors and discipline tied to an institution’s mandate for professional investors,” he noted.\n\nCorporate Highlights:\n\nApple Inc. is withholding a raft of new technologies from hundreds of millions of consumers in the European Union, citing concerns posed by the bloc’s regulatory attempts to rein in Big Tech. AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc. is holding confidential talks with some of its lenders about lowering its debt load and extending near-term maturities, according to people with knowledge of the matter. Airbus SE is edging closer to an agreement with Spirit AeroSystems Holdings Inc. to take over parts of the aerospace supplier’s business, paving the way for an acquisition of the bulk of the company by arch-rival Boeing Co. as early as next week. American Airlines Group Inc. is suspending training for new pilots through the end of this year, the latest pullback by a major US carrier in the face of uneven travel demand and delayed aircraft. A top US Food and Drug Administration official overrode reviewers to give broad approval to Sarepta Therapeutics Inc.’s gene therapy for a rare muscle disease in children, despite a lack of data showing it actually slows overall progression of the disease.\n\nSome of the main moves in markets:\n\nStocks\n\nThe S&P 500 fell 0.2% as of 4 p.m. New York time The Nasdaq 100 fell 0.3% The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed The MSCI World Index fell 0.3%\n\nCurrencies\n\nThe Bloomberg Dollar Spot Index was little changed The euro was little changed at $1.0692 The British pound was little changed at $1.2649 The Japanese yen fell 0.4% to 159.58 per dollar\n\nCryptocurrencies\n\nBitcoin fell 1.2% to $64,301.01 Ether rose 0.4% to $3,538.53\n\nBonds\n\nThe yield on 10-year Treasuries was little changed at 4.25% Germany’s 10-year yield declined two basis points to 2.41% Britain’s 10-year yield advanced three basis points to 4.08%\n\nCommodities\n\nWest Texas Intermediate crude fell 0.8% to $80.63 a barrel Spot gold fell 1.6% to $2,322.32 an ounce\n\nThis story was produced with the assistance of Bloomberg Automation.\n\n--With assistance from Carly Wanna, Sagarika Jaisinghani, Cecile Gutscher, Divya Patil, Matthew Burgess and Winnie Hsu.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Documents Show How Musk’s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "How Worried Should PayPal Stock Investors Be About Apple’s Latest Fintech Moves?",
        "content": "Given PayPal’s (NASDAQ:PYPL) continued, strong growth and its large user base, along with the low valuation of PayPal stock, I continue to believe that the shares will deliver strong returns over the long term. What’s more, the macroec0omic picture, although far from perfect for the company, should enable it to keep posting fairly strong financial results going forward.\n\nBut PayPal will face steeper competition from Apple  (NASDAQ:AAPL) going forward. Although I don’t expect these developments to negatively affect its performance to a great extent, the company’s growth could decelerate somewhat in the wake of these changes. Also importantly, Wall Street seems to have lost confidence in PayPal following Apple’s moves, so PayPal stock is likely to fall further in the short- to medium-term. All in all, I currently view PayPal’s shares as a hold.\n\nContinued Strong Metrics\n\nIn the first quarter, PayPal’s top line climbed 9.4% versus the same period a year earlier to $7.7 billion while its total payment volume jumped 14% year-over-year to $404 billion. Even more impressively, its payment transactions per active account climbed 13% year-over-year (YOY) to 60, showing that user utilization of the company’s services is meaningfully rising. Finally, its earnings per share, excluding certain items, soared 27% YOY to $1.08, while the active monthly user base of just its Venmo service in the U.S. came in at an impressive 60 million.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso encouragingly, the number of first-time users of its debit cards rose 38% YOY last quarter, CEO Alex Chriss reported on its Q1 earnings call. Debit card users, on average, produce nearly 20% more revenue for the firm than accounts which don’t use debit cards, Chriss noted.\n\nIn a note to investors on May 31, research firm New Street Research started coverage of PayPal stock with a “buy” rating. New Street expects the company’s new guest checkout system, Fastlane, to lift its payments volume and it predicts the company will raise the prices on Fastlane in the future. Further, the firm expects PayPal to improve its monetization of Venmo and raise its debit card adoption rates in the medium term. And New Street predicts the company’s profit margins will beat analyst average estimates in 2025.\n\nA Decent Macro Setup and a Low Valuation\n\nU.S. retail sales only edged up 0.1% in May compared to April. But Marketwatch stated, “Sales are still rising at a pace consistent with stable growth.” Moreover, according to a survey conducted by well-respected consulting firm McKinsey, sizeable numbers of consumers expect to “splurge” in many categories going forward. For example, 39% of those polled anticipate they will splurge on restaurants, while a third intend to spend a great deal on apparel. Another third say they’ll splurge on travel. Also importantly, inflation did not rise at all last month. If that trend continues, investors may feel freer to spend more on discretionary items going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the valuation front, PayPal has a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 14 times. Given its strong growth, that’s a very low P/E ratio.\n\nApple’s Moves Have the Street Worried\n\nEarlier this month Apple introduced Tap to Cash which allows iPhone users to transfer funds by tapping their devices against other iPhones. The tech giant also disclosed that it would allow iPhone owners to “access installment loans offered through credit and debit cards, as well as lenders, when checking out with Apple Pay.” And finally, the company will allow consumers to use Apple Pay on desktop browsers other than just Safari.\n\nWall Street appears to be meaningfully less upbeat on PayPal stock in the wake of Apple’s annoucement, as the shares fell about 10% in the week following the software giant’s news.\n\nNot a Game Changer\n\nI don’t expect Apple’s initiatives to be a game changer for PayPal. First of all, according to one estimate, PayPal’s market share of online payments was 56% last year while Apple’s was just 12.6%. So even if the changes boost Apple’s market share by 20 percentage points, all at PayPal’s expense, the latter company would lose less than five percentage points of its share.\r\n\r\nBut I don’t expect that scenario to materialize. Most consumers don’t exchange money with their peers in person so the Tap to Cash feature probably won’t be too popular. And PayPal has a big first-mover advantage on Apple when it comes to exchanging money on desktops. Finally, Apple has partnered with credit card issuers in the past and PayPal already faces multiple competitors that offer online loans, including SoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) and Zelle. As a result, I don’t expect Apple’s new partnerships with card issuers and lenders to be much of a negative needle-mover for PayPal.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAlthough I don’t expect PayPal to take a big hit from Apple’s moves, the fintech firm could suffer market share losses of a few percentage points, further spooking the Street in the process.\n\nWhat’s more, due to PayPal stock’s negative momentum, the shares are likely to keep falling for a while longer. As a result, I believe that investors will have an opportunity to buy the shares for significantly below their current price relatively soon. That’s why I view the shares as a hold rather than a buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nLarry Ramer has conducted research and written articles on U.S. stocks for 15 years.

        "title": "Tech Funds’ Record Cash Injection Is Traced to ‘Messy’ Rebalance",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- On the surface, technology-focused stock funds just enjoyed a week of record inflows, the latest sign of the AI craze. A look under the hood, however, showed almost all the money went into a single fund — and it had little to do with the industry’s fundamentals.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt Blackstone’s $339 Billion Property Arm, the Honeymoon Is Over Car Dealers Reel From Cyberattack on $1.2 Trillion Market CDK Tells Car Dealers Their Systems Will Likely Be Down for Days United Airlines Jet Turns Back After Engine Piece Falls Off Car Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack\n\nThe Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) attracted more than $8 billion of fresh money during the week through Wednesday, accounting for the bulk of the inflows into the sector, according to data compiled by EPFR. The fund also made up a third of the total inflows to US equities, the data shows.\n\nThe sudden spike came right before XLK’s widely watched quarterly rebalance, in which more than $10 billion of Apple Inc. shares are estimated to be sold to make room for Nvidia Corp. The huge inflow is likely part of a transaction where the fund is looking to get rid of Apple shares that have appreciated in value, without incurring taxes, according to Todd Sohn, managing director of ETF and technical strategy at Strategas Securities.\n\nA practice that’s fairly common within the ETF industry known as a heartbeat trade, inflows and outflows are made via a market maker who by design swaps assets for shares rather than transacting in cash. With a heartbeat, a friendly bank is pumping extra assets into a given fund so that extra withdrawals can be made — allowing more equity gains to be washed out.\n\n“ETFs have the in-kind mechanism as their secret power,” said Sohn. “Every quarter the flows data gets real messy because of this — just huge numbers on both sides for a few days.”\n\nState Street Global Advisor, which oversees XLK, didn’t immediately respond to an email seeking comment. The fund’s underlying benchmark, designed by S&P Dow Jones Indices, is scheduled to carry out its quarterly rebalance at Friday’s close.\n\nWith Nvidia catching up to Apple and Microsoft Corp. in size during recent weeks, the shuffling in XLK holdings has garnered Wall Street interest given the prospect of volatility-inducing weight additions and reductions to some of the world’s most closely watched tech companies.\n\nThanks to diversification rules, XLK has held way fewer Nvidia shares for months despite a market-crushing rally. The expected inflow from the rebalance provides a tailwind for the chip pioneer that’s large for technical-flow standards but modest for a company that’s added trillions to its value. After a 174% rally this year through Tuesday, shares of Nvidia have since dropped more than 6%.\n\nStory continues\n\nXLK is likely to experience big outflows as a second part of the heartbeat trade, according to Mohit Bajaj, director of ETFs at WallachBeth Capital.\n\n“There will be a redeem hitting soon today or Monday,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Documents Show How Musk’s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple will delay launching three new artificial intelligence features because landmark European Union tech rules require it to ensure that rival products and services can function with its devices, the U.S. tech group said on Friday.\n\nApple underscored its AI push earlier this month with a slew of new features and software enhancements for its iPhone and other devices to bolster sagging sales.\n\nIt said Apple Intelligence, which uses AI to conjure text, images and other content on command, would be available on iPhone 15 Pro, iPhone 15 Pro Max, and iPad and Mac with its M1 chip and later versions. IPhone Mirroring on MacOS Sequoia allows the phone's screen to be viewed and interacted with on Mac computers.\n\nThe company said on Friday three features - Phone Mirroring, SharePlay Screen Sharing enhancements, and Apple Intelligence - will not be rolled out to EU users this year because of regulatory uncertainties due to the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA).\n\n\"Specifically, we are concerned that the interoperability requirements of the DMA could force us to compromise the integrity of our products in ways that risk user privacy and data security,\" Apple said in an email.\n\n\"We are committed to collaborating with the European Commission in an attempt to find a solution that would enable us to deliver these features to our EU customers without compromising their safety.\"\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jane Merriman and Richard Chang)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Nvidia, Microsoft and Apple all jockeyed this week for the title of world’s most valuable company as investors bet big on the future of AI.\n\nThe moves coincide as one of the biggest tech exchange-traded funds, State Street’s Technology Select Sector SPDR with assets near $80 billion, prepares for a monster rebalance.\n\n\"It is an anomalous event where you have three securities, a market capitalization greater than $3 trillion, all at the same time, all within one sector. That is unprecedented. Never happened before,\" Matthew Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas research at State Street Global Advisors, told FOX Business.\n\nNvidia on Tuesday unseated Microsoft as the world’s most valuable company for the first time, though ongoing volatility this week still has the two – and Apple – neck and neck.\n\nThe chipmaker represents just under 6% of the XLK ETF, while Apple and Microsoft are over 21% each, according to the firm. After the rebalance, Nvidia will leapfrog Apple.\n\n\"Right now, because the fund hasn't rebalanced, Apple is the second-largest security. So that means you have to rebalance and sell Apple shares to buy Nvidia shares,\" Bartolini said.\n\nREAD ON THE FOX BUSINESS APP\n\nThe rebalancing will take place on Friday after the close of trading, with the fund’s changes visible on Monday.\n\nNvidia has seen its shares skyrocket nearly 160% this year as it continues to lead the race for AI chips. Last quarter, it posted a record $26 billion in revenue, a 262% jump from the year-ago period. The company also completed its 10-for-1 stock split, which began trading on June 10, and it also boosted its quarterly dividend payout 150% to 10 cents per share.\n\nConstellation Research founder R \"Ray\" Wang is betting shares will top $200 this year.\n\n\"They are the dominant one in market share, competitors are barely catching up and of course their product roadmap, we are only seeing one-tenth of what they’re able to deliver, and they’ve made the GPU the standard in AI, and the growth numbers don’t lie,\" Wang said during an appearance on \"Varney & Co.\" \"If you look at sales, they are there, even if the P/E numbers are crazy, they are catching up with the sales numbers and, of course, they have a visionary founder.\"\n\nCEO Jensen Huang, whose signature look is a black leather jacket, has a cult following that is growing around the globe as the company fires on all cylinders. During a recent trip to Taiwan, his birth country, he got the rock star treatment. Jensen Huang, co-founder and CEO of Nvidia Corp., gives a talk in Taipei, Taiwan.\n\nHe even threw out ceremonial first pitches, including one before a game between the CTBC Brothers and Wei Chuan Dragons at Taipei Dome.\n\nStory continues\n\nOriginal article source:Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple about to rock big tech ETF\n\nView comments",

Though with COST stock trading at 53.5 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), the retail behemoth may need more than membership price increases to continue its nearly parabolic run into the second half of the year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nA membership fee hike hasn’t been announced yet, but it’s overdue. Such a move could help jolt Costco’s bottom line. Considering Costco’s substantial value to its members, any fee hikes would likely meet with minimal consumer complaints.\n\nBeyond price hikes, Costco has an opportunity to further embrace automation to save on labor costs. Costco pays its employees better than the average, so any moves to streamline its workforce could be a huge long-term margin booster. Doubling down on tech at the self-checkout stations could cut down on theft while freeing employees to do other work, not to mention improving the customer experience.\n\nCostco has several avenues to increase profitability. It is also at the top of its game in a sector that will continue to see stability even as the economy fluctuates. This makes COST one of the solid Nasdaq stocks to buy now.\n\nNetflix (NFLX) Netflix (NFLX) logo displayed on smartphone on top of pile of money.\n\nSource: izzuanroslan / Shutterstock.com\n\nNetflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) is starting to get expensive again after outpacing the Nasdaq 100 to an impressive gain of 45% YTD. With all-time highs in sight again, the big question is if there’s enough enthusiasm or catalysts to power such a breakout.\n\nUndoubtedly, live sports is a major growth pathway that Netflix has focused on. Though the widely anticipated boxing match between Mike Tyson and Jake Paul is off due to Tyson’s health scare, Netflix doesn’t seem content with hitting the brakes on its sports-streaming push.\n\nStory continues\n\nReportedly, the company is close to striking a deal to air NFL games on Christmas. Combined with the WWE deal, which kicks off in January 2025, and the possibility of giving the sport of boxing another hit, it’s clear Netflix is serious about its sports push.\n\nHowever, it remains to be seen whether the sports expansion will generate increased growth. Either way, NFLX stock is a top Nasdaq momentum play, even at 47.1 times trailing P/E.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) With 5G Already Priced in, You Can Do Better Than Qualcomm Stock\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock exploded higher in recent months as investors rushed into the neglected edge artificial intelligence (AI) play. Even after a 53% surge so far this year, QCOM stock still looks quite cheap at 28.8 times trailing P/E.\n\nWith shares recently nosediving 5% on Thursday on reports that some of the new Qualcomm Snapdragon-powered AI PCs are having issues running popular software applications and video games, questions linger as to whether Qualcomm is still the best way to play an AI hardware refresh cycle.\n\nIndeed, it can be quite frustrating that some applications aren’t running smoothly on new computers. However, such compatibility woes will likely be resolved in due time. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) survived after it went through the same transition when it moved from Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) to its M-series chips. If software compatibility issues extend a further pullback, investors who missed QCOM on the way up may have another shot.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of APPL.

        "title": "Nvidia is carrying the S&amp;P 500 like no company since possibly IBM 4 decades ago, expert says: ‘It’s unheard of’",
        "content": "The astounding performance of a few tech companies is masking an otherwise mediocre stock market. The S&P 500 Index broke its 31st record of the year on Tuesday, closing at 5,487.03, according to Bloomberg data. While the index is up over 15% this year, that growth is by no means evenly shared.\n\nLooking at year-to-date data through June 18, shares of Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Google, Amazon, and Broadcom have on average soared by 25.3%, while the remaining 493 companies have grown by just 2.7%. In June alone, the \"Magnificent Seven\" (the previously cited list, swapping in Broadcom for Tesla) are on average up 7.5%, but the rest of the index is down -0.5%, according to Howard Silverblatt, senior index analyst at S&P. On Tuesday, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple stock equated to half of the index’s total returns, he adds.\n\nThis unprecedented level of concentration is leaving some portfolio managers nervous. “They're biting their nails. Because the bottom line is, if you are not in this, you're not getting your return,” Silverblatt told Fortune.\n\nhttps://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/B7gnW/4/\n\nThat’s because the version of the index that makes no distinction between the market cap of the companies has grown just 4% this year. Moreover, the share of the S&P 500 stocks trading above their 50-day moving averages is declining, down to 47% on Monday from 92% in January, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe darling of tech darlings remains Nvidia, which briefly became the world’s most valuable company this week. With a market capitalization of about $3.1 trillion as of Friday morning, its stock is up over 170% year to date. At the peak of its frenzy on Tuesday, it was more valuable than the entire stock market of France or that of the U.K., or the whole oil and gas industry. That same day, one-third of the index’s returns were from the company alone. “It’s unheard of,” says Silverblatt. “The closest we can get to that level of impact [on the index] from one company is IBM in the 1980s, when that new product, PCs, were coming out.\"\n\nSo, how long can this growth last? Silverblatt says he wouldn’t bet his money on Nvidia generating these types of returns every year. For him, it’s not a question of if it loses its chip monopoly, it's a matter of when. But, ultimately, whoever eventually usurps Nvidia is likely to be another tech company that needs chips: “It's going to stay in the family, shall we say.”\n\nLooking more closely at IBM, in the early 1980s, it was topping the index and towering over competitors at a two-to-one ratio, according to the New York Times. By 1985, its portion of the index was 6.4%—about equal to Apple’s today. The company began to lose its monopoly over personal computers once Apple announced the Macintosh in 1984. Today, IBM ranks about 51st on the index, and represents just 0.35% of the weight. Its market cap is 5% that of Apple’s.\n\nStory continues\n\nAdam Kobeissi, editor-in-chief of The Kobeissi Letter, told Fortune all waves of internet innovation “typically come with a bubble,” and he anticipates there will be a pullback period in which weaker players are “weeded out.” Nonetheless, he predicts that the large-scale tech stocks are to remain the leaders of the market, and doesn't envision anyone dethroning Nvidia in the near term.\n\nSo, in the near term, is this level of disproportionality concerning?\n\nWell, the top three stocks alone can move the market significantly. \"Concentration is a risky situation” and that makes “everybody nervous,” adds Silverblatt. If, for example, Nvidia were to lose the gains it has made this year overnight, the S&P 500 would have to come down approximately 4.5%, according to his calculations. “The market's going to have to absorb that.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nasdaq ETFs Set for Further Growth in 2024",
        "content": "The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite Index has been hitting a series of record highs in recent weeks, powered by technology stocks on artificial intelligence (AI) optimism and NVIDIA’s NVDA relentless rally. Renewed rate cut bets add to the momentum.\r\n\r\nAs such, the ETFs tracking the index are in focus. These include Invesco QQQ QQQ, Invesco NASDAQ 100 ETF QQQM, First Trust NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Fund QQEW, Invesco NASDAQ Next Gen 100 ETF QQQJ and Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares QQQE.\n\nMore Rally Ahead?\n\nMost of the rally is driven by \"Magnificent Seven.\" The three stocks — NVIDIA, Apple (AAPL), and Microsoft (MSFT) — in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group are in a race to become the world’s most valuable company and hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion on surging enthusiasm over AI capabilities (read: ETFs to Tap as NVIDIA Becomes the Most Valuable Company).\r\n\r\nThe expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh growth opportunities. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030. NVIDIA has been at the forefront of building AI into its products and services. Its success is largely attributed to its leadership in developing advanced graphics processing units (GPUs), which are unmatched in producing processors that power artificial intelligence systems, including generative AI, the technology backing OpenAI’s ChatGPT that can create text, images and other media.\r\n\r\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs at its recent Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses. Demand for generative AI will continue to fuel Microsoft's cloud business. The software maker is now emphasizing AI transformation through its new offerings like Microsoft Copilot. “Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,\" Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\r\n\r\nThe Fed, in its latest meeting, penciled in one rate cut for this year and foresees four cuts in 2025. The central bank has altered the language in its statement, noting that there has been “modest further progress toward the committee’s 2% inflation objective.” Previously, the statement pointed to a “lack” of further progress. This signals a period of higher interest rates for a while. Tech titans have shown strong resilience amid such a scenario. And, when the Fed starts cutting rates later this year, technology stocks will receive a boost. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nInvesco QQQ (QQQ)\r\n\r\nInvesco QQQ provides exposure to the 101 largest domestic and international non-financial companies listed on the Nasdaq by tracking the Nasdaq 100 Index.

        "content": "Here's How Much Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway Earns In Dividends Annually From Its Stake In Apple Stock\n\nWarren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK) owns 789,368,450 shares of Apple (NYSE:AAPL) stock, which is roughly 5.1% of the company. And it's a significant stake for Berkshire, representing over 40% of its portfolio.\n\nApple is one of the world's leading technology companies and it currently rewards its shareholders with an annual dividend of $1 per share, not to mention its consistent share repurchase activity. Let's find out how much Berkshire will earn in dividends from its stake in Apple.\n\nTo determine the total annual dividend income from this investment, we multiply the number of shares by the annual dividend per share:\n\nTotal Annual Dividend = Number of Shares x Annual Dividend per Share\n\nDon't Miss:\n\nIf there was a new fund backed by Jeff Bezos offering a 7-9% target yield with monthly dividends would you invest in it? Elon Musk and Jeff Bezos are bullish on one city that could dethrone New York and become the new financial capital of the US.\n\nSo...\n\nBerkshire shares of Apple: 789,368,450\n\nApple annual dividend per share: $1.00\n\nTotal Annual Dividend = 789,368,450 x 1.00\n\nResult: $789,368,450\n\nBerkshire Hathaway will receive about $789.4 million in dividends annually from its investment in Apple, which does not include reinvesting those dividends. If those dividends were reinvested, the annual dividend income would grow along with its total share count in its portfolio.\n\nThe income Apple offers aligns with Buffett’s investment philosophy, which emphasizes steady, predictable returns – and it's also worth noting that Apple has raised its annual dividend payment for 13 consecutive years, so Berkshire's annual income will likely grow year after year.\n\nKeep Reading:\n\nThe average millionaire has 7 sources of income.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s record-breaking rally has invited skepticism as to whether its artificial intelligence strategy justifies the stock’s valuation.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nCDK Tells Car Dealers Their Systems Will Likely Be Down for Days Car Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack Putin’s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO’s Eastern Border At Blackstone's $339 Billion Property Arm, the Honeymoon Is Over United Airlines Jet Turns Back After Engine Piece Falls Off\n\nThe shares surged to a fresh all-time high last week, briefly taking Apple back above Microsoft Corp. as the world’s most valuable company after it unveiled new AI features that investors hope will spur a massive upgrade cycle among users.\n\nThat’s pushed the valuation to around 30 times forward earnings, a level that the stock has struggled to sustain in the past. While Apple’s plans were cheered by investors seeking faster revenue growth and higher returns on capital at the firm, questions remain as to when exactly that boost will arrive.\n\n“I hope the market is right, but so far we haven’t seen enough to be sure,” said David Daglio, who manages $7.9 billion as chief investment officer at TwinFocus Capital Partners LLC. “I wouldn’t put new money to work here. The risk-reward is negative at best.”\n\nThe timing of when Apple’s AI strategy will deliver a meaningful boost to revenue is key. The rollout of new AI offerings may be slower than investors want, stretching into 2025. The stock fell 2% Thursday, the most in about two months.\n\nWall Street expects Apple’s revenue growth to tick back up in the second half of 2024, but end the year at just 1% before accelerating to 7% in 2025. In the iPhone segment, revenue is forecast to slip in the last two quarters of 2024, when compared to the same period a year earlier.\n\nClimbing valuations are top of mind for investors considering how to play the next leg of the AI rally. Other than Apple, gains to record highs in shares of Microsoft and Nvidia Corp. have pushed the broader market higher, but have also pushed up price-to-earnings ratios for the stocks. Microsoft trades at about 34 times forward earnings, while Nvidia trades at 43 times. The Nasdaq 100 index trades at about 27 times forward earnings.\n\nSome see room for Apple shares to run, even near all-time highs. JPMorgan analysts led by Samik Chatterjee this week boosted their price target to $245 from $225, saying that new AI features should kick off an iPhone upgrade cycle and drive earnings.\n\nStill, Nancy Tengler, chief executive officer at Laffer Tengler Investments Inc., says she has removed Apple from her best ideas list because of its valuation.\n\nStory continues\n\n“There’s more growth visibility in other names, like Microsoft, Amazon, Oracle, Broadcom,” she said. “There are other opportunities we’re taking advantage of, and places where valuations aren’t as stretched.”\n\nTop Tech News\n\nHuawei Technologies Co. is closing in on a billion active consumer devices, underscoring how the US-sanctioned company is taking the battle to Apple Inc. in the pivotal Chinese market. SoftBank Group Corp.’s big-talking founder Masayoshi Son is back, this time with plans to bring about an era of artificial super-intelligence. Ant Group Co. is considering selling its stake in Baihang Credit Co., a personal credit reporting company, as it awaits a license approval for another similar entity, according to a person familiar with the matter. Apple Inc. unfairly fired an employee for making racist comments that were part of a toxic workplace culture at one of its London stores, according to a UK court ruling.

        "content": "Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you’ve heard about Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) “One More Thing”– an advanced implementation of artificial intelligence (AI) set to launch with iOS 18. This revolutionizes Apple as a company, and has skyrocketed investor confidence in the company, with AAPL stock being up 6.5% since the news broke. While taking this announcement on face value adds immense value to Apple stock, the logistics of fulfilling the new demand for this advent in AI will boost several other companies.\n\nThese companies are going to be in the “back end” of the AI space serving supporting roles and taking home immense gains because of it. The three companies that fulfill this role, and are likely to provide investors with massive gains, are listed below.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) logo on a microchip\n\nSource: Antonio Baccardi / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is a semiconductor sector heavyweight. While it started as a gaming company, due to the power of its chips and their usage in tech/AI, NVDA quickly became the world’s most valuable semiconductor company and reached a market cap of $3.33 trillion. While it may seem like it has peaked, I believe that NVDA stock still has a ways to go.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNVDA stock is currently trading at $131.88 and is the most valuable company on the stock market. It has consistently beaten EPS estimates and is reporting high positive profit and operating margins. A quarterly earnings growth of 628.40% is nothing short of absurd and goes to show the prowess of this company.\n\nApple’s new AI depends on a collaboration with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. OpenAI is reported to be run on NVDA chips. As the strain on OpenAI’s servers grows, the demand for new chips will too. It isn’t hard to see how NVDA could make a significant profit off of the new demand for AI chips. Thus, this tech stock is a buy, especially given this new circumstance.\n\nConstellation Energy (CEG) Environmental protection, renewable, sustainable energy sources. Plant growing in the bulb concept. renewable energy stocks to buy\n\nSource: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nConstellation Energy (NASDAQ:CEG) operates through the generation and sale of electricity in the U.S. and also has five international segments. CEG has a varied product base, selling energy made from natural gas, energy-related products and sustainable solutions. Combined, these sources generate upwards of  33,000 megawatts of generating capacity.\n\nCEG stock is currently trading at $214.90 with a market cap of $67.7 billion, It has seen fairly good profit and operating margins, 10.25% and 13.24%, respectively. The year-over-year (YOY) quarterly earnings growth rate is a whopping 819.80%, which is due to strong operational performance and favorable market conditions. It has also beaten EPS predictions in the past quarter.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple focuses a lot on its sustainability initiatives. With this new AI model, more energy would be required to make it work and CEG might provide clean energy to Apple for their AI initiatives, generating revenue for the company. Plus, news of major technological advancements from a leading company like Apple often generates overall positive market sentiment, further making it a tech stock to buy.\n\nEmerson Electric (EMR) An office building with an Emerson Electric sign on it.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nEmerson Electric (NYSE:EMR) is a global technology and software as a service (SaaS) company that offers a wide range of solutions in both the business-to-business and business-to-consumer market. It has diversified itself into six distinct segments, including final control, control systems & software, measurement & analytical, AspenTech, discrete automation, and safety & productivity.\n\nEMR stock has seen great profit and operating margins, at 64.97% and 22.58% respectively. It has seen YOY quarterly revenue growth of 16.50%. Analysts have set an average price target of $130.89, indicating a growth potential of 22.94%. It has also consistently beaten EPS predictions in the past two quarters.\n\nAs mentioned before, positive news about Apple’s AI developments can enhance overall investor confidence in tech and industrial automation stocks, potentially boosting EMR’s stock value. Also, Emerson’s expertise in integrating advanced technologies could position it as a key supplier or partner in Apple’s AI-driven projects.\n\nOn the date of publication, Achintya Pasricha did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "I guess it’s okay to stop worrying about Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. While the stock market continued climbing to new all-time highs as we moved from possibly six cuts this year to three, then to one, new reports of much higher-than-expected industrial production in May suggests we may not get any cuts until next year. Still, that’s apparently a risk-off event and the stock market rose yet again.\n\nWhile a rising tide lifts all boats, some growth stocks to buy now look better than others because they have catalysts that are driving them higher. That’s what investors should look for in a frothy market, businesses with fundamental reasons for growing.\n\nThese three growth stocks below should be on your shopping list this month. They all have valid, business-related reasons for their growth trajectories. Although each is trading at or near record highs of their own, they could rise much higher very fast.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) An image of the top half of a black smartphone with a white screen displaying a blue \"Qualcomm\" logo, with a blurry white \"Qualcomm\" logo on a blue design in the background.\n\nSource: nikkimeel / Shutterstock.com\n\nMobile handset chipmaker Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is increasingly immersing itself into artificial intelligence (AI). Its Snapdragon 8S Gen 3 chip has the necessary power to handle the complex processing chores the technology demands.\n\nThe 8S Gen 3 supports on-device generative AI and can run large language models (LLM) of up to 10 billion parameters, which includes Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) Llama 2 and Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini Nano from Google.\n\nThe chipset is featured on Samsung’s Galaxy S24 and Qualcomm may become the exclusive provider for the smartphone maker’s new Galaxy S25. Analysts believe the chipmaker’s next chip iteration, the 8S Gen 4, is also in line for a price hike by as much as 25% to 30%. That should significantly boost Qualcomm’s top and bottom lines.\n\nWhile a lot of attention was paid to Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) introducing AI to the iPhone, Samsung was happy to give its rival a John McClane-esque “welcome to the party, pal” greeting. In acknowledgment of Qualcomm’s chips giving the S24 AI capabilities last year, Samsung tweeted, “Adding ‘Apple’ doesn’t make it new or groundbreaking. Welcome to AI.”\n\nShares of the chipmaker are up 57% in 2024 and 85% higher over the past year. If this news of a Samsung partnership proves true, Qualcomm could be starting a new leg of higher growth.\n\nCoinbase (COIN) A close-up of the Coinbase (COIN) app install option.\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nI’ll be the first to admit that cryptocurrencies aren’t my thing. I don’t quite understand them and most seem more like penny stocks where traders look for the greater fool to sell to. There is no utility in most of the coins being bid up, which can only lead to disaster. That’s why investors should stick with cryptos that have actual utility, such as Bitcoin (BTC-USD). In that same vein, I’d prefer a picks-and-shovels crypto player that provides the tools investors need versus buying the actual coins themselves. It’s why Coinbase (NASDAQ:COIN) makes for a natural growth stock to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nIt offers a secure online platform for buying, selling, transferring and storing crypto. It is agnostic regarding which crypto you choose. Investors can use it even if they want to go out on a limb with some riskier coins out there. Not every coin is supported, of course. However, the site says it supports more than 260 digital assets and 300 different trading pairs. It also offers custody for more than 425 digital assets.\n\nAlthough I was skeptical of the staying power of crypto (I told a friend to sell the Bitcoin he bought for $600 when it hit $7,000 — fortunately he didn’t listen), it is clear it is a viable asset to buy, sell and hold. It will also grow in value. Even for a confused doubter like me, Coinbase is an obvious choice to grow even larger in size and value.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia Corporation logo on smartphone screen. Against stock prices, stock chart. Investments in securities.. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Trismegist san / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is now the most valuable stock on the market. Having blasted through the $1 trillion and $2 trillion market capitalization marks, it was only a matter of time before it crashed through $3 trillion, too. Then it set its sights on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and quickly achieved the top spot.\n\nSo it’s natural to think that after tripling in value in one year, Nvidia stock is poised for a fall. At the least, it might not have much more to add. I thought that once and was quickly proven wrong.\n\nThe rise of AI is what has Nvidia stock hurtling to new heights. Because the technology is so much in its infancy and the chipmaker is so far out in front of the competition, the increasing demands of the technology will keep powering Nvidia higher.\n\nNvidia also needs to keep innovating to maintain pace with the advances of AI. No sooner did it begin production of its Grace Blackwell superchip than it announced another new AI chip architecture, Rubin. It’s not due out until 2026 but we can see that Nvidia is continuously looking forward.\n\nIt is possible the announcement could hurt sales of the Grace Blackwell chip. Customers might wait for the new chip out of Nvidia instead of buying the “obsolete” technology. Yet it shows how rapidly the AI market is evolving. It also indicates just how far in front of the field Nvidia is. It makes the chipmaker the premiere growth stock to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Stocks Ready to Rev Up Returns With Buyback Boosts Like GM",
        "content": "Are you looking for stocks to buy for buyback boosts?\n\nOn June 11, General Motors (NYSE:GM) announced a new $6 billion stock buyback program. That was on top of the accelerated share repurchase it did last November, and there was $1.4 billion left from its previous share repurchase plan. It is certainly an option.\n\nIn terms of dividends and share repurchases, GM returned $2.8 billion to shareholders in 2022, plus $11.6 billion last year. It expects to return $1.7 billion in the first six months of 2024 through June 30.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWhile the auto maker is a big buyer of its stock, it’s not the largest in the S&P 500 by any means.\n\nWhat makes a good buyback? Generally, it’s when excess cash is returned to shareholders when all other levers have been exhausted, such as dividends, debt repayment, acquisitions and internal investments in its business operations.\n\nWho are the good share repurchasers? Here are three companies that are doing it right.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced its quarterly earnings May 2. They exceeded analyst expectations. However, it was the iPhone maker’s plan to buy back an additional $110 billion of its stock that got investors excited.\n\nNot only was it the largest buyback in U.S. history, it exceeded its own record of $100 billion set in May 2018. In fact, Apple accounts for six of the 10 largest. Apple’s six share repurchase announcements add up to $555 billion since 2018.\n\n“‘An astonishing number,’ said Steve Sosnick, chief strategist at Interactive Brokers LLC. ‘Apple may be acknowledging that they are becoming a value stock that returns money to shareholders rather than a high powered growth stock that needs its cash for R&D or expansion,’” Bloomberg reported on May 2.\n\nWhile we know it generates a ton of cash from its business, it’s vital that Apple be smart with its excess cash outlays for its shares.\n\nIn fiscal 2018 (September year-end), Apple bought back 405.1 million of its shares for $73.1 billion, an average price of $180.45. However, on a post-split basis — its shares split four-for-1 in August 2020 — it was $45.11. That’s a compound annual growth rate of 29.7% over the past six years.\n\nAAPL investors have been loving these buyback boosts. I would gladly take that kind of annual return on my investments.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) reported Q2 2024 results on June 13. They beat the analyst estimates with sales of $5.31 billion and earnings of $4.48 a share, which was 9 cents better than the consensus.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe quarter was so strong that it raised its outlook for the year to $18.10 a share in earnings on $21.45 billion in revenue. The earnings outlook is 10 cents above analyst expectations. Its shares jumped 15% on the news.\n\nOn March 14, Adobe announced a new stock repurchase plan for $25 billion, good through March 14, 2028. That’s approximately 11% of its outstanding shares.\n\n“Our new $25 billion share repurchase authorization underscores what a special company Adobe is, with the profitability and cash flows to drive growth and invest in innovation while returning significant capital to our shareholders,” said Dan Durn, executive vice president and CFO, Adobe.\n\nIn the second quarter, it repurchased $2.5 billion of its stock at an average price of $543.48, higher than its current share price. However, in fiscal 2023 (November year-end), it repurchased $4.61 billion of its stock at an average price of $400.87, a return of 30.3% in less than a year. This makes ADBE a stock to consider for buyback boosts.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) The back of a Caterpillar (CAT) work vehicle displaying company logo\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCaterpillar (NYSE:CAT) announced on June 12 that it was adding $20 billion to its 2022 share repurchase authorization, which has no expiry. It now has $21.8 billion to repurchase its shares.\n\nIn its announcement, the company said that it would return most of the free cash flow from its Machinery, Energy & Transportation (ME&T) segment to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Caterpillar has paid a dividend since 1933 and is a member of the S&P 500 Dividend Aristocrats Index.\n\nIn the first quarter, Caterpillar paid $5.1 billion in dividends and share repurchases. In 2023, it repurchased $4.98 billion of its stock and paid out $2.56 billion in dividends. The company’s average price paid for shares repurchased was $255.83. That’s a return on investment of over 27% in less than one year.\n\nThe $20 billion share repurchase added to its existing plan is nearly 13% of its shares outstanding.\n\nIts ME&T free cash flow in 2023 was $10.03 billion, nearly double what it was a year earlier. It paid 75% of that for dividends and share repurchases.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains one of the Magnificent 7 stocks long-term growth investors should continue to hold. That’s been my view for a long time, and it’s still true.\n\nHowever, after the company got dethroned by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and as I’m writing this, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) as well, the question is whether this dominance will continue?\n\nNow, it’s entirely possible all three could continue to race higher from here. In other words, whether you buy Microsoft, Apple or Nvidia, you could still win, even if one doesn’t keep pace with the rest.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut with that said, let’s dive into what may lead Microsoft to outperform relative to these peers moving forward.\n\nTesting Sharing Files to Android\n\nMicrosoft recently enhanced integration between Windows PCs and smartphones, enabling users to handle texts, calls, and notifications on their computers. The Phone Link app syncs Android and iPhones with Windows, facilitating file sharing. In the latest Windows Insider Preview, Microsoft introduced a streamlined feature for quick content sharing from PC to Android. Now, users can select a file and share it directly to a paired Android phone via a quick share window.\n\nMicrosoft stated that users need to pair their smartphone with their Windows PC using the Link to Windows app on Android and Phone Link on their PC for the feature to work. Currently, only paired Android phones appear in the share window, with no information on iPhone compatibility. Right-clicking a file on Windows and selecting Share now shows options to email or use Nearby Share.\n\nThis feature, part of the Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 22635.3785, is rolling out in the Beta Channel and may take time to reach all users.\n\nMicrosoft Will Still Be an AI Winner\n\nMost of the focus on the AI race is on Nvidia now, and for good reason. On this catalyst alone, it’s entirely possible Nvidia could break away from the pack. But I don’t think that means Microsoft will be a laggard, by any means.\n\nWedbush analysts predicted the AI boom for tech stocks is just starting, driving customer spending on Microsoft’s AI products. Analysts at Wedbush raised their price target on MSFT stock to $550, citing strong potential for monetizing its AI-powered Copilot tool and Azure cloud service based on recent customer checks.\n\nWedbush analysts observed accelerating deal conversions for enterprise AI deployments and maintained an outperform rating for Microsoft shares. They highlighted AI’s potential to transform Microsoft’s cloud growth, with over 70% of customers expected to adopt automated options. Rapid growth in AI usage is anticipated by 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts noted the stock has not yet fully priced in the upcoming AI and cloud growth wave. Microsoft shares, boosted by OpenAI investments, have risen over 19% this year, reaching a $3.29 trillion market cap. Wedbush also mentioned Microsoft’s race with Nvidia and Apple to achieve a $4 trillion valuation.\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm\n\nMicrosoft and Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) limited-time collaboration on the Copilot+ PC has entered the pre-order phase, marking a significant step in AI-powered PCs. This initiative is the first major result of their partnership.\n\nAt COMPUTEX 2024, Qualcomm representatives expressed optimism about the strong pre-order levels, which have exceeded Microsoft’s expectations. The momentum now depends on early adopter feedback. Qualcomm and other IC suppliers hope this trend continues through the year’s second half, establishing a solid foundation for AI PCs’ future.\n\nInitially met with skepticism, Microsoft’s exclusive use of the Snapdragon X series for Copilot+ PC challenged the x86 norm in Windows PCs. Qualcomm’s past PC market struggles added to doubts. Despite this, Microsoft’s aggressive strategy and partnerships with major notebook manufacturers helped overcome initial concerns, leading to higher-than-expected pre-orders.\n\nThe success of Copilot+ PC in the long run hinges on these early sales. The initial high pricing suggests realistic pre-order targets, making surpassing them a manageable feat.\n\nYes, MSFT is a Buy\n\nMicrosoft’s Azure cloud division gains ground, challenging Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) Web Services amid widespread business digitization. Investments in AI (and OpenAI specifically) position the company for robust long-term growth. Recent quarterly results showcased diversified growth, with cloud revenue up 23% to $35.1 billion and operating income rising 23% to $27.6 billion.\n\nWith the cloud market accelerating, MSFT stock stands out as a top tech investment to load up on right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "3 Top Stock Picks to Invest in the World’s Most Creative Companies",
        "content": "In March, GQ released its list of the 20 most creative companies worldwide. I’m going to turn those into top stock picks for the second half of 2024 and beyond.\n\n“We’re showcasing the companies around the world that are leveraging creativity in order to drive business and make the world a better place. What do we mean by creativity? Ingenuity. Innovation. Originality. Fearlessness,” GQ’s Alex Hoyt and Jaimie Ding wrote on March 27.\n\nOf the companies on the list, I believe 11 of them are listed on a stock exchange in the U.S. or elsewhere.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe names on the list I won’t recommend include Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), Prada (OTCMKTS:PRDSY), Nintendo (OTCMKTS:NTDOY), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). That’s three from Magnificent Seven and two other popular consumer brands.\n\nThe three names that I’m going with are great creators, but also brilliant business operators, whose shares will go up more often than down over the long haul.\n\nNew York Times Co. (NYT) A photo of a person reading the Feb. 16, 2020 issue of the New York Times.\n\nSource: pio3 / Shutterstock.com\n\nHaving worked in the publishing industry for over a decade, I marvel at how the New York Times Co. (NYSE:NYT) has managed to survive — and even thrive — while so many news outlets have gone belly up.\n\n“We think the Times should be the essential subscription for every curious English-speaking person around the world,” NYT Chief product officer Alex Hardiman told GQ.\n\nFull disclosure: I subscribe to the Times. While it’s primarily for my work endeavors, I do enjoy all the arts and leisure coverage, and we can’t forget the puzzles. But most importantly, as Hoyt and Ding wrote, it earns over $2 billion from its 10 million customers.\n\nHowever, beyond some headline numbers, I know very little about the company founded by Henry Jarvis Raymond and George Jones in 1851. In 1896, Adolph S. Ochs acquired the paper for $75,000.\n\nHe and his grandson, Arthur Ochs Sulzberger, who was publisher for nearly 30 years, from 1963 to 1992, made the paper the respected publication it is today.\n\nDue to the dual-class share structure, the company is controlled by the Ochs-Sulzerger Trust.\n\nImportantly, its adjusted operating profit margin in Q1 2024 was 12.8%, 320 basis points higher than a year ago.\n\nDeckers Outdoor (DECK) Deckers Outdoor (DECK) logo displayed on smartphone screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Piotr Swat\n\nDeckers Outdoor (NYSE:DECK) is one of my favorite companies, primarily because of its Hoka performance running shoes, not its UGG brand shoes.\n\nIn August 2022, I suggested that Deckers ought to split its stock to increase its liquidity and share count. At the time, it traded around $326. It’s now trading nearly $1,000. When Hoka was acquired in 2013, management thought the brand’s revenues might be able to hit $100 million some day.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn late May, it reported Q4 2024 results. Hoka’s revenues in the fourth quarter alone were $533 million. For the entire year they were $1.81 billion, 18x the company’s goal a decade ago.\n\n“Now, in addition to winning over athletes (Hoka is the official shoe of Ironman Triathlons), the brand is hot with the fashion set—they’re doling out buzzy collabs with streetwear darlings Brain Dead and lining the shelves of boutiques like Nepenthes in New York and The Broken Arm in Paris,” GQ reported.\n\nIf Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) can do a 10-for-1 split, Deckers should too. It’s a keeper.\n\nLVMH (LVMUY) The logo for the luxury goods holding company LVMH is seen through a magnifying glass on the company's website.\n\nSource: Postmodern Studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nBernard Arnault — the CEO of LVMH (OTCMKTS:LVMUY) and the world’s third-wealthiest person with a net worth of $199 billion — took a big risk in 1984, buying Christian Dior’s bankrupt parent, Boussac, for $60 million. $15 million of that came from his family’s construction business, and $45 million from Lazard Frères, a French financial institution.\n\nHe then went and cut 9,000 workers from the payroll, sold off non-core businesses for $500 million, and made Dior the foundation of his luxury empire.\n\n“In the 90s, I had the idea of a luxury group and at the time I was very much criticized for it. I remember people telling me it doesn’t make sense to put together so many brands. And it was a success … And for the last 10 years now, every competitor is trying to imitate, which is very rewarding for us. I think they are not successful but they try,” Arnault told CNBC in 2018.\n\nAs GQ points out, LVMH has moved beyond luxury fashion into luxury experiences such as its work with Accor (OTCMKTS:ACCYY) to build the Orient Express brand, which will include future hotels, trains and sailing ships.\n\nLVMH currently offers luxury experiences and hospitality through its Belmond brand, which it acquired for $3.2 billion, including the assumption of debt, in 2019.\n\nIt’s an amazing business.\n\nOn the date of publication, Will Ashworth did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nWill Ashworth has written about investments full-time since 2008.

He particularly enjoys creating model portfolios that stand the test of time.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is closing in on a billion active consumer devices, underscoring how the US-sanctioned company is taking the battle to Apple Inc. in the pivotal Chinese market.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nAt Blackstone's $339 Billion Property Arm, the Honeymoon Is Over CDK Tells Car Dealers Their Systems Will Likely Be Down for Days Car Dealerships Across US Halt Services After Cyberattack United Airlines Jet Turns Back After Engine Piece Falls Off Putin’s Hybrid War Opens a Second Front on NATO’s Eastern Border\n\nThere’re now some 900 million Huawei gadgets installed with its inhouse Harmony operating software, up significantly from just a few months ago, consumer business Chairman Richard Yu said. Sales of premium Huawei smartphones climbed 72% in the first five months of 2024, he told attendees at an annual developer forum Friday.\n\nThose numbers illustrate the phenomenal growth Huawei’s phones have enjoyed since it unveiled the Mate 60 Pro, which contained a 7-nanometer processor that Washington officials didn’t think Chinese firms capable of developing. Business has boomed since, helping Huawei more than quintuple profit during the March quarter and take market share from Apple and Chinese rivals.\n\n“No one can extinguish the starlight in the sky. Today, the future of HarmonyOS is set,” Yu told his audience. “Let’s enjoy the brilliant galaxy that belongs to us.”\n\nHuawei intends to release a successor to its marquee smartphone, the Mate 70, at the end of the year, Yu said. That’s likely to run on HarmonyOS Next, which will sever remaining ties to Google’s Android. Huawei plans to release a beta version for consumers around August, Yu said.\n\nHuawei has taken HarmonyOS beyond smartphones in past years and into products from watches to TVs. The Chinese company shipped about 11 million wearables in the first quarter, surpassing Samsung Electronics Co., according to IDC. That helped Harmony OS overtake Apple’s iOS in Chinese market share during the January-March period, according to Counterpoint Research. The main driver, however, remained the rising popularity of Huawei’s phones, Counterpoint added.\n\nHuawei is getting more aggressive at attempting to profit from HarmonyOS as its user base surge. It’s considering taking a cut of in-app purchases, underscoring a growing confidence in competing with the iPhone — though there’s likely to be at least one notable exception, Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat.\n\nIt’s also making progress on the AI front with the Ascend GPU, part of a growing portfolio of chips that prompted Nvidia Corp. Chief Executive Jensen Huang to call Huawei a formidable rival.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese firms including Huawei are developing local alternatives to the most powerful AI accelerators that the likes of Nvidia make, which Washington has barred from the country. That effort is considered key to Beijing’s broader ambitions of catching up with the US in AI and chipmaking.\n\nOn Friday, Yu said its Ascend processors are 1.1 times more effective in training AI models compared with mainstream offerings, though he stopped short of naming specific firms. His company has so far set up three AI data centers powered by Ascend chips in China, helping local firms develop and host artificial intelligence services.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nIlya Sutskever Has a New Plan for Safe Superintelligence JPMorgan Ignites $40 Billion Rush Into Indian Bonds More Disabled Americans Are Employed, Thanks to Remote Work How to Do a Four-Day Workweek That Actually Works Documents Show How Musk’s X Plans to Become the Next Venmo\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com – The battle between Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) for the title of the world's highest market capitalization has been ongoing since early January, when the iPhone maker ceded the crown to the company founded by Bill Gates, only to reclaim it on June 12. A few days later, NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) joined the race, and with the help of artificial intelligence, managed to occupy the top spot for market cap worldwide, albeit for a single session.\n\nAfter all this confusion, order has been restored and as of June 21, the ranking is:\n\nMicrosoft: $3.312 trillion Apple: $3.215 trillion Nvidia: $3.214 trillion\n\nDespite the absolute gap of almost $100 billion between the first and the third, at the exorbitant levels of these three US tech giants, the difference is actually minimal, to the point that the ranking could change again from one session to the next.\n\nMicrosoft among the first to believe in AI\n\nBeyond its historic and updated offering of software and digital services, one of Microsoft's strengths is that it was among the first to believe in the potential of Artificial Intelligence, heavily investing in OpenAI, a company that in the last six months has more than doubled its annualized revenue, rising to $3.4 billion from $1.6 billion at the end of 2023.\n\nApple continues to update its highs\n\nApple's growth over the years has been long and relentless, with its stock always overcoming temporary corrections and continuing to hit new all-time highs. The Cupertino company that revolutionized the communication world with the iPhone, has become much more than a smartphone manufacturer over the years and has successfully ridden the wave of artificial intelligence by integrating it seamlessly into its iOS operating system.\n\nNvidia, the queen of chips\n\nThe days when Nvidia was considered only a gaming company are long gone. Its revenues in the first quarter of 2024 rose by 265% compared to the same period last year, and its stock has soared by 170% in the last six months. In the semiconductor market, Nvidia is the absolute queen, and companies, including Microsoft and Apple, compete to secure its essential chips for training the language models that underpin generative artificial intelligence.\n\nThe target prices of Microsoft, Apple, and Nvidia\n\nIn short, all three companies have what it takes to remain where they are, but which of the three is favored at the moment?\n\nHere is the ranking based on the target price set by analysts:\n\nSource: InvestingPro\n\nAmong the three, analysts interviewed by InvestingPro show the most belief in Microsoft's potential. The target price is set at $480 per share, 7.7% higher than the $419.7 closing price on June 20.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the case of Apple, analysts estimate a target price slightly lower by 1.5% compared to the current value.\n\nFinally, Nvidia could lose the most with a target price of $126.75, 3.1% less than the price on June 20.

        "title": "Microsoft on top, Boeing's deal, UK public debt - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Microsoft regains its title as the world's most valuable company after Nvidia's stock retreated. Wall Street is set for a calm open, while Boeing is close to regaining control of Spirit AeroSystems.\n\n1. Microsoft takes back the lead, for now\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) has regained its title of the world’s most valuable company, after Nvidia’s shares declined over 3% on Thursday.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), whose market capitalization surpassed that of Microsoft on Tuesday, lost over $100 billion to register a closing market value of $3.21 trillion.\n\nMicrosoft's market value also slipped, to $3.31 trillion, as its shares fell marginally during Thursday’s session.\n\nNvidia, Microsoft and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) are in a three-horse race to become the world's most valuable company - with the iPhone maker's market capitalization at $3.22 trillion.\n\nHowever, this may prove to be a blip in Nvidia’s seemingly relentless rise, with its stock having nearly tripled so far this year.\n\nNvidia stands at the forefront of a massive technological shift as the dominant provider of chips to support artificial intelligence applications. Revenues are expected to double this fiscal year to $120 billion and rise to $160 billion in the following year.\n\nSoftware giant Microsoft, by comparison, is expected to grow revenues by about 16% for its fiscal year.\n\n“Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,” Wedbush analysts said in a note.\n\nThe investment firm notes that Nvidia's dominance in data center AI spending positions it as a pivotal player in the AI revolution, with all generative AI applications relying on its GPUs.\n\nWedbush predicts that over the next three years, more than 70% of enterprises will adopt AI use cases, leading to an estimated $1 trillion in incremental AI spending over the next decade.\n\n2. Futures flat ahead of key activity data\n\nU.S. stock futures traded largely unchanged Friday, but are on course for a winning week ahead of the release of widely-watched activity data.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 60 points, or 0.2%, lower, S&P 500 futures dropped 4 points, or 0.1%, while Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 10 points, or 0.1%.\n\nLosses in market darling Nvidia weighed on both the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq Composite on Thursday, with the former dropping 0.3% and the latter 0.8%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outperformer, gaining 0.8% - its best day this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat said, all three major averages are on pace for weekly gains. The S&P 500 is on track for a gain of 0.8%, the Nasdaq is up 0.2%, while the DJIA is set for a 1.4% rise.\n\nQuarterly earnings are due from used vehicle retailer CarMax (NYSE:KMX), while investors will also be looking toward manufacturing and services Purchasing Managers’ Index readings for June, for clues of the health of the U.S. economy.\n\nExisting home sales data for May is also slated for release.\n\n3. Boeing nears deal to buy back Spirit AeroSystems\n\nBoeing (NYSE:BA) is on the verge of agreeing to repurchase Spirit Aerosystems (NYSE:SPR), its former subsidiary, according to a report from Reuters.\n\nThe airplane manufacturer began negotiations to repurchase the supplier that it had spun off in 2005 earlier in this year, but ran into difficulties due to Spirit's work for Boeing’s main rival Airbus.\n\nThe European group had threatened to obstruct any deal that involved Boeing manufacturing parts for its latest models.\n\nHowever, there appears to have been progress made on this thorny issue, as Boeing and Airbus have broadly succeeded in dividing Spirit's programs into work that Boeing will take back, along with work that the European rival will take.\n\nBoeing’s move to reclaim Spirit is aimed at stabilizing a critical part of the supply chain for its best-selling jet after a mid-air blow out on a new 737 MAX in January.\n\n4. British public debt soars\n\nThe U.K. general election draws near, and a change of government looks more and more likely as Keir Starmer's Labour Party is far ahead of Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's Conservatives in the polls.\n\nHowever, the latest data shows the difficulties either party will have stabilizing the country’s finances as British public debt rose last month to its highest as a share of the economy since 1961.\n\nPublic sector net debt rose to 99.8% of gross domestic product in May, up from 96.1% a year earlier, the Office for National Statistics said Friday.\n\nPublic debt soared in Britain during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the public finances have also been hit by slow growth and a rise in Bank of England interest rates to a 16-year high.\n\nBoth political parties have said they intend to stick with existing budget rules, and have pledged not to raise the rate of income tax, value-added tax or other major levies.\n\n5. Crude set for weekly gains\n\nCrude prices traded marginally lower Friday, but were set to rise for a second week, helped by signs of improving demand in the U.S., the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nBy 04:00 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.3% lower at $81.09 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.3% to $85.50 per barrel.\n\nBoth benchmarks are on course to register gains of over 3% this week, trading close to the highest levels in over seven weeks.\n\nData released on Thursday by the Energy Information Administration showed a drawdown in U.S. crude stockpiles by 2.5 million barrels in the week ending June 14, more than the 2.2 million-barrel draw expected.\n\nAdditionally, U.S. government data showed total product supplied, a proxy for the country's demand, rose by 1.9 million barrels per day (bpd) on the week to 21.1 million bpd.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMicrosoft on top, Boeing's deal, UK public debt - what's moving markets\n\nGerman trade focus could pivot from China to US\n\nFedâ€™s Barkin wants more evidence on inflation before rate cuts\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Insider Monkey the Best Website to Research Stocks?",
        "content": "We recently created a list of 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks. Insider Monkey is one of them.\n\nWhen it comes to building a strong portfolio, retail investors conduct a great deal of research to learn about the macroeconomic climate, read up on the most recent stock market trends, become familiar with investing strategies, and observe the most notable actions of smart investors and elite hedge funds. A sizable portion of the investing community consists of retail investors, and they have access to a wealth of online information that can assist them in navigating the volatile stock market. According to Gallup’s survey, 162 million Americans, or 62% of adults in the United States, own shares in public companies. That is a 1% rise over 2023 and the highest percentage observed by Gallup since 2008. During the Great Recession, stock ownership declined and remained low for more than a decade, reaching lows of 52% in 2013 and 2016. Before 2008, the majority of Gallup surveys revealed that at least 60% of American adults owned stocks.\n\nToday, the stock market is very different from what existed at the time of the millennium. The internet has democratized information, resulting in increased  stock market involvement, which has been accelerated during the pandemic. Wall Street welcomed retail investors for the first time as a result of the pandemic, even though the global outbreak is primarily remembered for the deadly virus and lockdowns. In apoll, 15% of American stock market participants stated they started investing in 2020. The study additionally shows that these new investors tended to be more optimistic about their prospects for success in the stock market. A study revealed that 19.5% of all stock market shares exchanged in the first half of 2020 were made by individual investors. That is about twice as many trades by ordinary investors as there were in 2010, and it represents an increase of 4.5% over 2019. This occurred during the meme stock mania in 2021, which saw prominent businesses skyrocketing on the stock market as retail investors banded together on social media and purchased the shares in bulk.\n\nNotwithstanding the attraction of potential profits, new research from eToro indicates that many retail investors in the United States appear to be more afraid of losing money than they are of missing out on the next great opportunity. Rethinking Risk, research by eToro, finds that while 31% of US retail investors are driven by the fear of missing out on the next great thing, 61% of investors indicate that their investment strategy is shaped by the fear of losing money through immoderate risk. Their behaviors, however, reveal a different tale, as many retail investors continue to invest in risky assets, with 70% holding single stocks and 41% holding crypto assets in their portfolios. Additionally, this research shows that 62% of people who began investing in the markets now feel better about it.\n\nStory continues\n\nAmidst these developments, the demand for easily available, reliable information to aid retail investors in their decision-making is rising. According to a survey conducted by BNY Mellon and the World Economic Forum on global retail investment, three-quarters of current retail investors said they would trade more actively if they had more opportunities to learn about investing along with personalized, goal-oriented stock guidance. Here's where trustworthy websites for stock research would come in very handy.\n\nSo let's look at the Best Website To Research Stocks.  Is Insider Monkey the Best Website to Research Stocks?\n\nStocks\n\nMethodology:\n\nFor our list of the best websites to research stocks, we ranked them on the basis of consensus of several sources and reddit threads on the same topics.

One of those stocks is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), an American multinational corporation and technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California. Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway is a significant shareholder in the business. Warren Buffett had 789.36 million shares of the company in Q1, valued at $135.36 billion. 150 hedge funds held Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) as of the end of March, down from 131 funds in the previous quarter, according to data compiled by Insider Monkey. Moreover, the second-largest shareholder in Apple Inc. is Ken Fisher's Fisher Asset Management, with 55.88 million shares valued at $9.58 billion.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nInsider Monkey ranks 1st on our list, but if you want to check out what other websites are and where they rank, visit the 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks.  If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None. 15 Best Websites To Research Stocks is originally published on Insider Monkey.

        "title": "How Santa Clara chipmaker Nvidia became one of the world's most valuable companies in the AI boom",
        "content": "People gather in the Nvidia booth at the Mobile World Congress mobile phone trade show in 2014 in Barcelona, Spain. (Manu Fernandez / Associated Press)\n\nFor more than a decade, with only few interruptions, Apple held the title of the world's most valuable company, becoming the first to top $3 trillion in market cap — mostly due to the iPhone, a device millions of investors use daily.\n\nRecently, Apple was overtaken by Microsoft and this week there's was new king of Wall Street — once again a Bay Area company: Nvidia, which makes semiconductors in high demand for artificial intelligence applications. It's the hottest stock around and the company has a market cap that tops $3.2 trillion.\n\nRead more:California lawmakers are trying to regulate AI before it's too late. Here's how\n\nHere's what to know about the world's leading AI chipmaker:\n\nWhat role is Nvidia playing in the artificial intelligence industry?\n\nArtificial intelligence programs are complex computer applications that rely on massive databases and processing power to produce their results. OpenAI's ChatGPT-4, a much-talked about program released last year that generates text, is estimated to have 1.7 trillion \"parameters,\" or variables, about 10 times more than its 2020 predecessor — and the complexity is only growing. Nvidia makes a chip called the H100 accelerator that is able to process that data and is in high demand. This month it announced it is making an even more advanced chip.\n\nHas Nvdia always made chips for artificial intelligence?\n\nNvidia went public in 1999 and for years was seen largely as a manufacturer of premium graphics cards sought after by gamers for their clarity in rendering high speed visuals. The cards don't come cheap, with its top of the line GeForce RTX 4090 currently retailing around $1,700. But given its niche position in the industry, Nvidia stock lingered for years under $1 per share, adjusted for stock splits.\n\nWhen did its fortunes improve?\n\nDuring last decade's crypto boom, its powerful chips were sought by \"miners\" of Bitcoin, which employ computer banks to solve puzzles that reward them with cryptocurrency. The demand was so strong Nvidia launched a new chip specifically for miners as its stock surged from 89 cents in May 2016 to more than $7 in October 2018 — before the crypto bubble burst and shares fell under $4.\n\nThe fall prompted a shareholder lawsuit over accusations that the company hid how much revenue it was making on crypto-related sales. That suit is currently before the Supreme Court.\n\nWhat happened after the collapse of the crypto boom?\n\nNvidia enjoyed a resurgence during the pandemic as Americans confined at home turned to their gaming computers. Its annual revenue shot up more than 50% to $16.7 billion in the fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2021. The company's cloud computing platform also grew as customers relied on the networks to handle the shift to remote work. Nvidia's stock topped $19 a share in August 2022 before coming back to earth and trading below $12 later in the year as the pandemic waned.\n\nStory continues\n\nRead more:AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace?\n\nWhen did the current stock surge begin?\n\nNvidia shares have been on a steady upswing since 2021 as the hype over artificial intelligence has become a frenzy — supported by the company's strong sales growth. Nvidia's revenue hit $60.9 billion in its fiscal year ending Jan. 31, 2024. Shares started the year at $48.17 and closed Tuesday at $135.58, a 180% gain that gave it a market value of about $3.34 trillion, briefly surpassing Microsoft.\n\nCan the company keep it up?\n\nNvidia reported record fiscal fourth quarter revenue of $26 billion, up 262% from a year ago, as demand for its chips grew beyond cloud-service providers to include consumer internet companies, governments and automotive and healthcare customers. The company's revenue is projected to grow 44% annually in the near future, according to a FactSet poll of 60 analysts.\n\nWhat other companies are benefiting from AI?\n\nMicrosoft has seen its own stock gain about 20% this year. That's largely due to its partnership with OpenAI. Microsoft's Bing browser now offers a chat function powered by Chat GPT-4 that can write emails and perform other tasks. Apple stock also hit a record high this week after it announced its Apple Intelligence platform, which will be integrated into its iPhone, iPad, and Mac lineups.\n\nIs a lot of this just hype like crypto?\n\nMany on Wall Street believe that artificial intelligence is in a different league than blockchain and cryptocurrency, with far more concrete applications. Advanced Micro Devices and Intel Corp. are rolling out new chips to counter Nvidia's market dominance.\n\nHowever, there are dissenting voices. Rob Arnott, founder of Newport Beach investment company Research Affiliates, has called Nvidia a great company but warned even last year that its stock performance is unsustainable.\n\n“Overconfident markets paradoxically transform brilliant future business prospects into even more brilliant current stock price levels,” Arnott wrote in a research note. “Nvidia is today’s exemplar of that genre: a great company priced beyond perfection.”\n\nBloomberg News contributed to this report.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "The home improvement industry has faced some pretty rough headwinds over the past year. With inflation and high rates taking a toll on consumer budgets, it’s not hard to imagine many big-ticket discretionary purchases are being pushed out into the future, perhaps once rates are far lower.\n\nAfter all, home improvement projects and a new coat of paint on the house aren’t urgent, especially when grocery bills are going through the roof.\n\nAs inflation and rates settle, perhaps more homeowners will be able to commit to ambitious projects around the home. Additionally, Baby Boomers opting to age in place may be overdue for a kitchen remodel or something of the sort.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEither way, the macro landscape could become markedly better from here, especially if the second half of 2024 sees a rate cut or two. Here are three home improvement stocks to buy that could rebuild and recover to prior highs if the next home improvement cycle really is upon us.\n\nThe Home Depot (HD) Home Depot (HD) storefront on a sunny day\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Home Depot (NYSE:HD) is a remarkably well-run retailing play in the Dow Jones Industrial Average — it’s the Dow’s fourth-largest position. But it has also helped contribute to the Dow’s lagging year-to-date performance. At writing, HD stock is up just over 2% since the year began. Still down around 15% from its late-2021 all-time highs, the king of home improvement projects seems less timely and perhaps worthy of paring from a portfolio.\n\nDespite management’s impressive cost management, HD stock is still sensitive to those wild cyclical swings. After dragging for quite a while, there is hope that the next upswing may not be too far off, especially as lower rates pave the way for a drastic uptick in discretionary spending.\n\nFurther, Home Depot’s recent acquisition of SRS Distribution represents a move that could really jolt the Pro business.\n\nAt 23.7 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E), with a 2.54% dividend yield, HD stock looks like the ultimate value play that everyday investors seemed to have forgotten about amid the ferocious bull run in tech.\n\nSherwin Williams (SHW) A Sherwin-Williams (SHW) sign in Richfield, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nPaint, stain and coatings maker Sherwin-Williams (NYSE:SHW), whose slogan is “Cover the Earth,” recently corrected more than 13% after briefly flirting with new all-time highs earlier this year. I view the latest dip in SHW stock as nothing more than an opportunity for investors seeking to give their portfolios a new coat of paint ahead of what could be a drastic uptick in home improvement and remodels.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnlike more ambitious home remodels, paint jobs aren’t as painful to the budget. Indeed, in most cases, a loan just isn’t necessary to pick up a few buckets of paint to give the living room a new vibe or the patio deck a new stain. As the Fed gradually eases its foot off the pedal, with a slow trickle of rate cuts, perhaps the paint and stain plays could be first to lead the charge higher as consumers begin spending on improvements around the house.\n\nKeyBanc analyst Aleksey Yefremov thinks Sherwin has “the strongest pricing power in coatings.” Yefremov isn’t wrong; Sherwin’s strong brand has ample pricing power, even amid inflation. With a $400 high price target (representing over 33% upside from here), Yefremov is quite bullish on the stock.\n\nLowe’s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLowe’s (NYSE:LOW) stands out as a wonderful value option for investors looking to play a return in home improvement projects.\n\nAt writing, LOW stock goes for 18.2 times trailing P/E after recently correcting from 52-week highs of around $261 per share. That’s markedly cheaper than Home Depot. And though billionaire investor Bill Ackman sold most of his stake earlier this year, I’d not be so quick to book profits, especially ahead of the Fed’s first rate cut.\n\nThe company seems to be tapping into mixed reality (MR) to help customers visualize changes around the home before they commit to a purchase. Indeed, spatial computers such as the Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro may mark the next frontier in home projects. Of course, the device is incredibly expensive for most people.\n\nHowever, in a couple of years, once more devices are in more homes, perhaps it will be essential to strap on the headset well before heading to the local Lowe’s. For now, the retailer plans to bring Vision Pros to its stores to help customers visualize the perfect remodel.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Strong buy consumer stocks are a resilient option in the current economy. For the first four months of 2024, core retail sales, excluding cars, gas and restaurants, rose 3.8%. The National Retail Federation expects retail sales to rise 2.5% to 3.5% this year.\n\nIn addition, Vanguard Consumer Staples ETF (NYSEARCA:VDC) is up about 7% this year, while the S&P 500 index is up over 15%, meaning the consumer sector has not yet caught up to the growth that the “Magnificent Seven,” led by Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), are enjoying in 2024, leaving you plenty of upside to exploit.\n\nHowever, McKinsey worries inflation is making consumers more cautious, forcing them to prioritize essential items over luxury ones. Over the past eight years, the cost of acquiring a new customer has also gone up 222%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nInflation is still strong. The Consumer Price Index increased by 3.3% in the last year, with economists expecting it to stay at 3.4%. Even though it’s cooling after a high of 9.1% in 2022, it’s hot enough for the Federal Reserve to cancel its plans for three rate hikes. Instead, they have settled on one.\n\nWhat this means is that even though consumer stocks are in a good position to grow, it’s probably best to keep investing in strong buy ones just to play it safe.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Amazon LOGO ON THE SIDE OF A BUILDING.\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) is the most highly rated of all strong buy consumer stocks, with 42 out of 42 analysts covering the stock recommending a “Buy.” AMZN’s price target of $221.48 reflects a potential upside of over 21%.\n\nAmazon Web Services, which dominates the worldwide cloud infrastructure industry with a 31% market share, drives AMZN’s enthusiasm. Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure and Google Cloud are its closest rivals at 25% and 11%, respectively. AWS earned $22.1 billion in Q1 2024 and $90 billion in 2023.\n\nTo expand, the division will spend extensively on building new infrastructure in Saudi Arabia and Mexico. Plus, AWS’s $10 billion Mississippi data center construction will create at least 1,000 jobs.\n\nAWS’s creative artificial intelligence (AI) service Amazon Bedrock, is also integrating new Anthropic Claude 3 models. Many companies utilize Bedrock to develop AI in science and healthcare.\n\nMeanwhile, Amazon’s strategic partnership with Anthropic enhances its AI goals. As a result of the $4 billion deal, complex AI models are built and used utilizing AWS Tranium and Inferentia processors.\n\nFinally, for five consecutive quarters, AMZN has reported better-than-expected profits and sales. Most recently in the first quarter of 2024, it amassed a $73.9 billion cash war chest. there is no shortage of resources for AMZN to power forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is another favorite among strong-buy consumer stocks, with 20 buy ratings and an average price target of around $316, indicating 15% upside potential.\n\nMuch of Visa’s appeal as a payments processor comes from constant innovation, especially with new fintech startups trying to chip away at its more than 60% market share.\n\nAmong product innovations, the introduction of Visa Flexible Credential stands out. It is a new card that lets users select between debit, credit, “pay-in-four” with Buy Now Pay Later and rewards points. It’s currently accessible in Asia and Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) will help release it in the U.S. this summer.\n\nVisa is also introducing tap-to-pay functionality, so any device can be a cash register. Plus, it is automating and easing payments from one account to another. After being a hit in Europe, this service is now growing in the U.S. thanks to Visa’s purchase of Tink.\n\nAt the same time, Visa is investigating blockchain-based solutions to expand small- and medium-sized businesses’ global financial market access. Project partners include Agrotoken, Microsoft, and Sinqia.\n\nVisa also runs the Universal Payment Channel, a blockchain center. This project links blockchain networks to move digital assets across wallets and protocols. The UPC simplifies stablecoin, central bank digital coins and other crypto transactions.\n\nApplovin (APP) AppLovin (APP) logo and page displayed on phone and computer screen\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/T. Schneider\n\nApplovin (NASDAQ:APP) keeps growing its ecosystem, which is why it is fast becoming one of the best AI ad platforms. In Q1 2024, its income rose 91% year over year.\n\nAppLovin’s first quarter of 2024 financial results were strong, with EPS of 67 cents and sales of $1.06 billion, both higher than analyst expectations. However, the real excitement is with its product enhancements.\n\nThe most recent updates add support for Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) privacy files and new apps for game engines like Godot and Unreal, making it easier for developers to switch between engines. Applovin’s MAX Flutter driver also support native ads, making ad displays more consistent in apps built with it.\n\nCustom product pages and store listings let users create app store pages that are more relevant to their users and encourage them to buy. The platform also has new tools and A/B testing features that provide more detailed information and better chances to improve things.\n\nWhat’s more, APP keeps growing its partner ecosystem, which includesAdjust, SparkLabsandWurl.

        "title": "The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gift for Employees",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of 20 Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees, and in this article we will look at the best budget-friendly corporate gift for employees.\n\nImportance of Corporate Gifts\n\nAccording to a report by GlobalNewsWire, 68% of individuals state that receiving a memorable gift from their employer has enhanced their relationship with them. This underscores the capacity of gifts to foster positive connections, whether in personal or professional contexts. Data from a survey by Mrs Prindables indicates that 57% of surveyed employees are more likely to remain loyal to a company that provides gifts. In comparison, 62% do not anticipate receiving gifts from their employer this holiday season. This suggests an opportunity for employers to surprise their workers with tokens of appreciation, potentially fostering increased employee loyalty.\n\nThe WorldMetrics Report 2024 indicates that the global corporate gifting market is expected to grow to $242.9 billion. This means that companies worldwide are spending more on gifts for clients, employees, and partners. It shows how important giving gifts is for building good relationships and promoting brands. To make your employees feel valued and respected, your choice of gift is very important.\n\nGifts express gratitude and are more effective than mere objects. Marcel Mauss, a noted anthropologist, explored gift-giving in his 1925 study, “The Gift.” He revealed its complexity, highlighting its role in shaping relationships within workplaces and with clients. Mauss emphasized the multifaceted nature of gift-giving, involving legal, economic, spiritual, and moral obligations to give, receive, and reciprocate.\n\nGift-giving in the workplace often benefits the giver more than the receiver, yielding both tangible and intangible rewards. Many businesses, including giants like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Airbnb Inc. (NASDAQ:ABNB), recognize the importance of fostering a positive company culture through corporate gifting. By offering enticing gifts, benefits and perks, companies create an environment that promotes employee satisfaction, productivity, and creativity. Research, such as a Gallup poll, shows that employees who are actively engaged in their work tend to perform much better than their less engaged colleagues. This heightened level of engagement can lead to a significant increase in earnings per share, sometimes as much as 147%.\n\nTop Corporate Gifting Ideas for 2024\n\nIn 2024, corporate gifting trends are driven by technological innovation, personalization, and a strong focus on sustainability and well-being. Businesses increasingly opt for eco-friendly gifts to show their commitment to environmental responsibility, choosing items like reusable drinkware, eco-friendly office supplies, and products made from recycled materials with minimal packaging. Tech gadgets remain popular, with wireless chargers, Bluetooth headphones, and smart home devices being highly appreciated for their practicality and ability to enhance daily life. Personalization is key, with companies using advanced techniques to create unique, custom gifts that leave a lasting impression.\n\nStory continues\n\nExperience-based gifts are gaining traction, moving beyond traditional tangible items to offer memorable experiences like spa days, cooking classes, or event tickets. These gifts significantly boost employee morale and client loyalty while aligning with the company’s brand values and mission. Health and wellness gifts, such as fitness trackers, yoga mats, and customized health snack boxes, reflect a growing focus on promoting a healthy lifestyle. These options show the company’s commitment to the well-being of its employees and clients, fitting into broader corporate wellness trends.\n\nAdditionally, there is a strong appreciation for cultural and artisan gifts that support local businesses and artisans. Handcrafted items that reflect cultural significance or artisanal dedication are highly valued, offering a story that recipients can cherish. These gifts not only support local communities but also allow companies to showcase their local pride or global outreach, making them perfect for businesses looking to make a meaningful impact through their gifting choices.\n\nWith the dominance of e-commerce giants like Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), finding affordable options has become easier than ever. Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has exhibited steady revenue growth over recent quarters, with current quarter (June 2024) revenue estimated at $136.8 billion, marking a 1.8% increase from the same quarter last year ($134.38 billion). This growth continues into the next quarter (September 2024), where revenue is projected to be $145.7 billion, reflecting a 3% rise from the previous year’s $141.41 billion. Annually, Amazon’s revenue for 2024 is expected to reach $588.05 billion, a 2.3% increase from 2023’s $574.78 billion, with a potential jump to $653 billion in 2025, indicating an 11% growth. This growth is primarily driven by the company’s expanding market share in e-commerce, cloud computing (AWS), and various other services. However, the short-term growth rate shows a slight slowdown, likely due to market saturation and broader economic conditions.\n\nIn terms of earnings, Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) has consistently surpassed expectations, showcasing strong performance. For the quarter ending June 2023, the estimated EPS was $0.35, while the actual EPS was $0.65, an 85.7% surprise. This trend continued in September 2023, with an estimated EPS of $0.53 and an actual EPS of $0.86, a surprise of 62.3%. December 2023 also saw a positive earnings surprise, with actual EPS of $1.00 compared to the estimated $0.80, a 25% difference. For March 2024, the actual EPS was $0.90 against an estimated $0.77, a 16.9% surprise. Looking forward, the estimated EPS for the current quarter (June 2024) is $0.94, and for the next quarter (September 2024), it is $1.06. The full-year EPS for 2024 is projected at $4.18, with an expected rise to $5.31 in 2025.\n\nValuation measures for Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) reflect its premium valuation status. The trailing P/E ratio has decreased from 310.38 in Q1 2023 to 49.96, indicating improved earnings. The forward P/E ratio stands at 38.31, showing continued expectations of earnings growth. We should note that these estimates don’t tell much about whether Amazon is a cheap or expensive stock because Amazon has been shoveling its profits back into its business to subsidize either its growth or new initiatives. It isn’t a company that’s trying to maximize its short-term earnings. That’s why we believe Amazon shares will continue to perform better than the market. And we aren’t alone. AMZN is the #1 stock on our list of 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nWith this backdrop, let’s explore our list of affordable corporate gifts for employees. The Best Budget-Friendly Corporate Gifts for Employees\n\nMethodology\n\nTo identify affordable corporate gifts for employees, we implemented a consensus-based approach to collect information from various sources: including Social Imprints, Snappy, Meetings & Incentives, Babble for Business, Gemnote, and Hoppier. From these blogs we identified popular affordable gift items in 2024, and developed a systematic scoring system. Each gift item we found through our sources was listed, along with the number of times it appeared in sources. In order to refine our search, we checked and averaged out the prices of these gift items from Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Walmart Inc. (NYSE: WMT), as these platforms are typically deemed affordable.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points. (see more details here).\n\nWith this backdrop, let’s proceed to #1 budget-friendly corporate gifts for employees.\n\n1. T-Shirts\n\nAverage Price: $6.48\n\nAffordable and practical, corporate t-shirts are a great investment. The saying “less is more” is perfect for T-shirts; all you need is a solid color, and little to no design. Gifting an ‘Employee of the Month’ t-shirt sounds like pure motivation. This gift option creates a sense of unity and belonging among employees, fostering team spirit and camaraderie.\n\nWhile we acknowledge the potential of AMZN as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is as promising as Amazon but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about The Cheapest AI Stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: none.

        "title": "Mizuho: Apple-Affirm partnership could boost gross merchandise volume by 35%",
        "content": "Investing.com - Mizuho, a global financial services firm, released a promising analysis of the recent collaboration between Affirm Holdings (NASDAQ:AFRM), Inc. and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) Pay on Thursday, noting that the new partnership could drive an incremental Buy Now, Pay Later (BNPL) opportunity worth around $12 billion for Affirm, representing a potential growth of 35% compared to fiscal year 2025 consensus volume estimates.\n\nMizuho's analysis suggests that the recent surge in Affirm's stock price following the announcement of the Apple Pay partnership could be justified, as the potential upside is not currently reflected in the stock.\n\n⚠️Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to receive over 50% off!⚠️\n\nAnalysts estimate that Apple Pay represents about $265 billion of e-commerce payment volumes in the US. This estimation is based on a recent report by Worldpay, which stated that Digital Wallets accounted for around $750 billion in the US volume in 2023. The primary wallets included in the report were PayPal (NASDAQ:PYPL), Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Pay, and Apple Pay.\n\nAfter subtracting an estimate for PayPal US Branded Checkout TPV, Mizuho suggests that the remaining $450 billion in volumes is split between Apple Pay and Google Pay. Using the approximate iPhone/Android mix in the US of 60/40 as a proxy, they estimate that the remaining e-commerce volumes consist of around $265 billion from Apple Pay.\n\nWith Worldpay's estimate for BNPL mix at around 5%, this implies a potential opportunity of converted Apple Pay volumes worth around $12 billion. This represents a potential upside of 35% to Affirm's consensus' FY25 Gross Merchandise Volume (GMV) estimate.\n\nMizuho maintains a 'Buy' rating for Affirm, with a price target of $65.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMizuho: Apple-Affirm partnership could boost gross merchandise volume by 35%\n\nUnitedHealth issues breach notification on Change Healthcare hack\n\nExclusive-Boeing nearing deal with supplier Spirit Aero after months of talks, sources say\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - In a strategy update released on Thursday, Morgan Stanley made significant alterations to its US Model Portfolio.\n\nThe changes include adding Cummins Inc (NYSE:CMI) due to its cyclical leverage to improving order rates in transportation end markets and potential secular tailwinds from power generation demand due to advancements in artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThey have also decided to remove QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity.\n\n⚠️Track your favorite companies with InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to take advantage and accelerate your investments!⚠️\n\nCummins Inc (CMI) has been added to the portfolio for three main reasons. Firstly, CMI offers cyclical leverage from improvements in transportation end markets. Secondly, its exposure to the \"powering Gen AI\" theme provides secular growth tailwinds. Lastly, Morgan Stanley believes CMI trades at a reasonable valuation. As a large provider of power generation equipment, CMI is expected to benefit from increased content and structural demand tailwinds.\n\nMorgan Stanley is removing QUALCOMM Inc (QCOM) from its portfolio as they believe the company's valuation effectively prices the underlying improvement in cyclical end markets and Edge AI opportunity. Since its addition to the portfolio in March 2021, QCOM has gained 83%, outperforming the S&P 500 benchmark which was up by 46% over the same period.\n\nIn addition to these changes, Morgan Stanley has also made risk management-driven adjustments to its portfolio. It has increased its internally held portfolio weights in Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA), TransDigm Inc (TDG), Exxon Mobil Corp (NYSE:XOM), NVIDIA Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), Becton Dickinson & Co (NYSE:BDX), and decreased its internally held portfolio weights in BlackRock Inc (NYSE:BLK), Visa Inc (NYSE:V).\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMorgan Stanley adjusts its US Model Portfolio\n\nExclusive-Boeing nearing deal with supplier Spirit Aero after months of talks, sources say\n\nNvidia loses top spot to Microsoft after 3% drop\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Here's What You Need to Know About Tech ETF XLK's Shake-Up",
        "content": "The Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, the second-largest ETF in the sector, is poised for a big rebalance this week. This shake-up will increase the exposure to NVIDIA Corp. NVDA at the expense of Apple Inc. AAPL.\n\nA Major Shift\n\nThe change comes as NVIDIA has been on a relentless rally, driven by its prominence in the artificial intelligence (AI) space. The stock has surged 164% so far this year and surpassed Apple in market value earlier this month. If NVIDIA maintains its position as the world's second-largest company by the end of this week, then XLK will increase its allocation in NVIDIA stock to more than 20% and drop its allocation of Apple to just 4.5%. The shift will create a $10 billion trade to buy NVIDIA stock and about an $11 billion trade to sell Apple stock, according to Bloomberg (read: NVIDIA Overtakes Apple: ETFs to Tap the Incredible Growth Story).\r\n\r\nCurrently, the XLK ETF is heavily weighted toward its top holdings, which include Microsoft, Apple and NVIDIA. As of Jun 11, 2024, Microsoft had 22.4% weight in the ETF, Apple 22.1% and NVIDIA 5.7%. Notably, all three stocks are worth more than $3 trillion amid an ongoing AI boom. Due to concentration limits, the fund must ensure that the sum of companies with a weight of above 4.8% does not exceed 50% of its total holdings.\r\n\r\nThe concentration limits have weighed down the performance of XLK in recent months despite the meteoric rise in NVIDIA shares. In fact, XLK has underperformed the S&P 500 Information Technology Index, which has 21% weighting in NVDA, by 5 percentage points between April and June, the widest margin since 2001 (read: Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs. Microsoft).\r\n\r\nXLK tracks the Technology Select Sector Index, which is technically not a market cap-weighted index but a \"modified\" market cap-weighted index. This usually means that it can put certain caps or guidelines around the portfolio weighting methodology to address potential issues, such as overconcentration.\r\n\r\nThough NVIDIA and Apple will swap their places in the XLK portfolio, the number of stock holdings will remain at 65. Industry-wise, the ETF currently has the largest allocation in software, semiconductors & semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware, storage & peripherals. The fund has AUM of $71.1 billion and charges 9 bps in annual fees.\n\nNew XLK Offers Growth Opportunities\n\nThe change will provide a huge boost to XLK, capitalizing on the AI-fueled NVIDIA surge. The fund will continue to gain from strong sector fundamentals. The expansion of AI applications holds the promise of ushering in fresh opportunities for growth within the sector. According to a new report by Grand View Research, the global artificial intelligence market is expected to witness a CAGR (2024-2030) of 36.6% to reach $811.75 billion by 2030 (read: Here's Why Tech ETFs Will Continue Their Bull Run).\r\n\r\nThe Fed, in its latest meeting, penciled in one rate cut for this year and foresees four cuts in 2025. The central bank has altered the language in its statement, noting that there has been “modest further progress toward the committee’s 2% inflation objective.” Previously, the statement pointed to a “lack” of further progress. This signals a period of higher interest rates for a while. Tech titans have shown strong resilience amid such a scenario. And, when the Fed starts cutting rates later this year, technology stocks will receive a boost. As the tech sector relies on borrowing for superior growth, it is cheaper to borrow more money for further initiatives when interest rates are low.\n\nStory continues\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "My Apple Vision Pro turned me into a bona fide Glasshole, again",
        "content": "I was rooting for the Apple Vision Pro.\n\nI am still rooting for it, and for spatial computing and wearable computers overall. But, two weeks ago, as I packed up the device in its overpriced carrying case to demo it to my colleagues at our office, I had a stark realization. Just like every other headset that came before it (be it Oculus, Meta Quest, HTC Vive, PlayStation VR, Google Cardboard—the list goes on), the only real repeated use case that had emerged is showing it to people who’ve never seen it before. It was a devastating realization.\n\nI’m a futurist, not necessarily by choice, but by compulsion. I have an incurable case of severe optimism. But also, a very critical filter for hype. And four months ago, when I got my hands on the Vision Pro at launch, I believed I was glimpsing our collective future. VisionOS felt inevitable. It felt like, Of course this is how we’ll all be using computers soon.\n\nFinally, some of the core problems that had plagued previous generations of headsets (whether virtual, augmented, or mixed reality) were solved. The Vision Pro’s resolution, frame rate, and eye-tracking were revelatory. Gone was the near-constant fear of oncoming motion sickness. Gone was the need to manually map a “safe area” to avoid breaking furniture. Gone were the awkward controllers.\n\nI was a vocal supporter of Apple’s freshman foray into the blended world of physical and digital. I made counterarguments against the overwhelming chorus of why? Why so expensive? Why so heavy? Why so creepy?\n\nYet it’s four months later, and I honestly forgot the thing existed for two whole weeks. The reality of spatial computing is there’s almost no space for it in day-to-day life.\n\nHow did we get here?\n\nThe crux of the problem is the name and market positioning of this device. In reality, the Apple Vision Pro is a cumbersome, bulky, expensive, but ultimately groundbreaking developer kit. In that context, it’s a home run. But instead, Apple’s crack team of marketers billed it as a consumer-ready Pro product (despite Steve Jobs’s warning about what happens when marketing takes over a product-led company). And so, we’re forced to judge it through that lens.\n\nGoogle Glass suffered a similar fate to what I feared for Apple Vision V1. It was released with a bang, touted as the future of personal computing and promising to liberate people from the shackles of their neck-strain-causing smartphones, all while allowing die-hard futurist early adopters like me to behave more naturally among muggles. Yet, the opposite happened. Push past the horrible battery life, shockingly steep price point (about half of what the Vision Pro costs) and limited set of apps and functionality. What actually killed Google Glass was how people recoiled in disgust when they caught someone wearing it in public.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Vision Pro is no different. The straight shunning I face wearing it is a clear indicator that society has made its choice between the headset being a glimpse of our inevitable future, or an obtuse, repulsive technological folly. At least Google Glass was physically comfortable to wear. The Vision Pro is so heavy, unbalanced, and painful that in the first week, while trying to wear it as the productivity-forward device it was supposed to be, I barely lasted 2.5 days with it on. And that’s despite the face scan they performed during the ordering process to determine which light shield is my “perfect match.”\n\nHere’s the unfortunate truth: Other than when I’m showing the Vision Pro to people for the first time, I’ve become utterly indifferent and unbothered by the prospect of turning it on.\n\nIt didn’t have to be this way, and I can’t help but reflect on where this headset went wrong, along with the dozens of devices that litter the timeline before it, languishing away as dead trophies of progressive innovation. Apple has always been known to launch new devices with pared-down functionality and overly simplified controls, but the Vision Pro takes this to the extreme. And the supposedly next-generation visionOS 2, which Apple announced last week, renders incremental updates at best. The reports this week of Apple suspending its work on the next version of the device due to lack of demand and instead prioritizing a cheaper model shows the company is perhaps back-tracking, and that there is internal tension over this launch being a case of technology placed before customer experience (ironically).\n\nWhile the Vision Pro’s intuitiveness and design are certainly industry-defining standards, the public shame, the discomfort, the price tag, and the lacking functionality are very hard pills to swallow. It's unlikely the Vision Pro will achieve any significant market penetration or build up a base of content and experiences that deliver the lasting emotional impact needed to make it a “must have” investment for individual consumers.\n\nMy eyes are still lifting towards the horizon with hope. Hope for much lighter and cheaper hardware. Hope for a solution to the aching loneliness that sets in when you wear it around others and realize they can’t share in what you’re seeing. Hope for a killer app or use case around remote telepresence to catch fire and drive the vast improvements in the cost and miniaturization of the technology that are currently barriers to its mass appeal.\n\nAs I watched another slickly produced, uncannily sterile WWDC demo at Apple’s headquarters last week and saw all the inside jokes about software chief Craig Federighi’s hair, one thing was certain: No one high up at Apple is wearing this thing daily either.\n\nWith the pending launch of the Vision Pro in Canada in a couple of weeks (I’m based in Toronto), I’ve resigned to the fact that when friends, family, and colleagues ask if they should shell out a significant portion of their disposable income to get one, my answer will be, unfortunately, no.\n\nNot yet at least.\n\nMore must-read commentary published by Fortune:\n\nLos Angeles was overpriced so I moved to Tulsa, Oklahoma. My extended family followed me here, and we love it—and I’m a homeowner I won an AI image award with a real photo to show we’re not adapting to the technology fast enough. Then it was my turn to be surprised I’m a CEO and 12 of my employees are in ‘flextirement.’ With boomers opting not to retire, the arrangement will become more common Photoroom CEO: I’m watching AI change not just how we edit photos, but who edits them. The ‘who’ will change in other fields, too\n\nThe opinions expressed in Fortune.com commentary pieces are solely the views of their authors and do not necessarily reflect the opinions and beliefs of Fortune.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "7 Dividend Stocks That Follow Warren Buffett’s Cardinal Rule",
        "content": "Warren Buffett is continuously seeking stocks – dividend and non-dividend – with durable competitive advantages as they ultimately end up standing the test of time. That’s why their respective stocks make such good investments: Durable competitive advantages create strong pricing power. That leads to huge gains over time.\n\nHowever, maintaining competitive advantage in the fast-moving technology world is more difficult than in other sectors. The pace of innovation requires massive, sustained investments in research and development for one. Furthermore, there are always dozens of companies on the cusp of major innovation threatening to render leading tech firms obsolete, eliminating competitive advantage overnight.\n\nThe result is that maintaining an unbeatable competitive advantage in the tech world is very difficult.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBuffett is heavily invested in Apple but outside of that he’s not tech heavy in general. This article looks at mostly tech dividend stocks exhibiting Buffett’s cardinal rule.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) continues to exhibit very strong competitive advantages which make its stock consistently buy worthy.\n\nCompetitive advantage is simply the ability to produce goods and services better than one’s competitors. If that sounds a little bit subjective and touchy-feely it’s because it is. However, we can identify competitive advantages on the income statement. It always shows up as high gross margins. Maintain those gross margins over time and your company is said to exhibit durable competitive advantage.\n\n40% is the general cut off for gross margins indicating a competitive advantage. Microsoft has consistently been in the 68 to 69% range over the past 5 years. Gross margins exceeded 70% on the most recent earnings print for the period ended March 31.\n\nIt appears that Microsoft’s investment in artificial intelligence is having positive, appreciable effects on its competitive advantage.\n\nMicrosft exhibits durable competitive advantage and pays a modest dividend yielding 0.67%. Perhaps Buffett will buy it at some point in the future.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) arguably has an even better competitive advantage than Microsoft depending upon how you look at it. At the moment, Nvidia’s gross margin is even higher than Microsoft’s. That’s all a product of pricing power which Nvidia clearly benefits from.\n\nNvidia has cornered the market for artificial intelligence chips. It enjoys tremendous pricing power as a result. In turn, gross margins surged above 72% in 2023. The question really becomes whether Nvidia can continue to sell its chips at extraordinarily high prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts anticipate that the upcoming Blackwell chip will be on par with the Hopper chip that it supersedes. However, those same analysts also believe certain Blackwell superchip iterations could fetch prices in the range of $60,000 to $70,000 each. That all suggests Nvidia’s competitive advantage is only strengthening moving forward. Combine that with the recent stock split that has made shares more affordable and $150 share prices are easily within reach.\n\nNvidia has also been paying dividends for more than a decade which may surprise some.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) is well known to be one of the most important companies within the semiconductor supply chain globally. The company produces the majority of the world’s most advanced chips. Currently, the AI opportunity is sending its stock higher, up nearly 70% year-to-date.\n\nThere’s reason to believe that TSM shares are going to move higher. For one, the company may charge Nvidia higher prices to manufacture Nvidia’s AI chips. Recent comments from the CEO Andy Dinh have led many to speculate that the company intends to charge higher prices to Nvidia, which recently surpassed $3 trillion in market capitalization.\n\nHeadlines like that one should continue to impart the value of TSMC to the broader investment world. The company’s chips enabled the development of PCs, mobile phones, and now AI. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing exhibits massive competitive advantages that show up as consistently strong gross margins that suggest durable competitive advantages. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing is also a dividend stock yielding 1.4%.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) is another indispensable firm within the semiconductor supply chain. That continues to make its stock incredibly valuable and worth buying. The company continues to dominate the Extreme Ultraviolet (EUV) lithography market.\n\nThe EUV devices that ASML produces are approximately bus-sized machines used in the manufacturing of the most advanced semiconductors. The company will produce five such machines in 2024. All five of those have been sold to Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) at a cost of $370 million a piece.\n\nASML offers a modest dividend that seems to be somewhat of a focus for the firm. I say that because the company changed it from an annual to a semi-annual dividend in 2019. It then changed the semi-annual payment to a quarterly dividend in 2022.\n\nASML is the only company that can produce EUV machines. Clearly, those machines are extraordinarily rare. They’re also in high demand in light of the emergence of AI and the fact that it demands the highest technological capabilities in its manufacture. ASML is the sole producer of something in high demand for which extremely low quantities exist. That’s an obvious recipe for extreme pricing advantages and success. That’s exactly what is reflected in the company’s financial reports: gross margins consistently hovering around the 50% mark.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) continued success is predicated on the competitive advantage of its products, primarily the iPhone. So, as iPhone sales go, so goes Apple’s stock.\n\nUntil very recently that had been sideways at best. iPhone sales continue to fall per the most recent earnings report. The company has consistently been trying to supplant falling iPhone sales with services revenues but it has not made up the difference. The result is that overall sales continue to decline.\n\nWhy then has Apple stock turned around in the last few weeks? The unsurprising answer is AI. The markets continue to be forward-looking.\n\nSo, when Apple released its Apple Intelligence AI tools recently at its annual Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC), perception shifted. Apple is no longer an AI laggard. Instead, the markets now perceive Apple to be very strong as it relates to artificial intelligence. It is also widely expected that the integration of AI into its iPhones will spike sales as customers rush to upgrade.\n\nApple represents Buffett’s largest individual holding so it’s no surprise that it follows his cardinal rule. It does provide dividends and exhibits durable competitive advantages.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on the side of a building in San Jose, CA.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nQualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) stock is deeply connected to Apple but don’t let that confuse you, Apple needs Qualcomm as much as Qualcomm needs Apple. The company has long provided chips used in the iPhone. Apple has long tried to force Qualcomm to accept lower prices for those chips but Qualcomm has not budged.\n\nThe company recognizes the inherent strength it has due to its technological know-how. Qualcomm produces leading chips utilized for power management, connectivity, and computation. Beyond that, Qualcomm is also emerging as one of the better AI chip opportunities. Share prices have skyrocketed this year as a result. The markets are highly optimistic about Qualcomm’s Snapdragon chips.\n\nAlthough Qualcomm is clearly well positioned and rife with competitive advantage, there are real risks. Share prices have risen extraordinarily quickly this year. There’s an argument to be made that they are currently overpriced or fully priced. Furthermore, Qualcomm derives roughly 40% of its revenues from China. Qualcomm’s competitive advantages are strong but it does face the potential for political retribution which is something to be aware of as an investor.\n\nAnyway, it is a strong tech stock in relation to its dividend and is arguably a tech stock Warren Buffett would consider.\n\nCoca-Cola (KO) ko stock coca cola life\n\nSource: Coca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola (NYSE:KO) is another dividend stock that Warren Buffett is famously known to hold.\n\nThat is news to very few. However, have you ever wondered what Warren Buffett likes about Coca-Cola so much? After all, it is the fourth largest position in his portfolio.\n\nThe answer is durable competitive advantage and sustainable pricing power. Coca-Cola has massive gross margins: It costs the company very little to sell its products reative to its competition.\n\nThat means the company has a lot of money left over. Its competitors have to spend massive amounts of money for research and development. Coca-Cola doesn’t: The company has essentially perfected its recipe. It can sell products at high margins globally while competitors have to scramble to identify any openings. That costs them money, eroding their margins in the process.\n\nIf Coca-Cola wants to enter a new market it sets up manufacturing knowing margins will be high. The competition has no such benefit.\n\nFinally, there’s the dividend. It was last reduced in 1963. The durable competitive advantage I keep talking about manifests as an ultra-reliable dividend.\n\nOn the date of publication, Alex Sirois did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "On Tuesday, June 18, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) passed Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) to become the world's most valuable publicly traded company for the very first time. As of this writing, Nvidia stock is up more than 200% in the past year and is now worth over $3.3 trillion.\n\nNow that its stock is the world's most valuable (based on market cap), many investors likely are wondering if they should sell or continue holding. Some who are on the sidelines might even wonder if it's too late to buy. Perhaps history can be a guide to making these decisions.\n\nWhen it comes to the most valuable stock listed on a U.S. exchange, there have been four other companies that have worn the crown over the last 30 years: General Electric, which is now GE Aerospace(NYSE: GE), Microsoft, ExxonMobil(NYSE: XOM), and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). And investors might be pleasantly surprised by what happened to these stocks after reaching the top.\n\nNvidia could stay at the top for a while\n\nOn Sept. 15, 1998, Microsoft passed General Electric to become the most valuable stock for the first time. According to data from the nonprofit American Business History Center, General Electric had been the top company without interruption for several years.\n\nFor its part, Microsoft sat by itself at the top of the leaderboard for a couple of years. Moreover, the stock more than doubled less than two years after it initially passed General Electric.\n\nThis is the first lesson from history: Once a company reaches the top, it tends to stay at the top for multiple years. That was the case for General Electric and Microsoft.\n\nAnd it was also the case for ExxonMobil and Apple. Therefore, if it follows the historical pattern, Nvidia stock will also likely enjoy a prolonged period at the top.\n\nOnce a company initially becomes the most valuable, history shows the stock price usually hasn't peaked yet. For example, ExxonMobil topped General Electric in February 2005. From there, the oil company's stock would rise another 60% over the next couple of years and 75% over the following decade. XOM Chart\n\nApple passed ExxonMobil in August 2011. In the five years leading up to taking the top spot, the stock was up around 500%, which is spectacular. Many investors likely thought they had missed the boat. But the stock didn't stop there: It doubled again over the subsequent five years.\n\nTherefore, if history is any guide, Nvidia stock could enjoy multiple years at the top and continue increasing in value.\n\nHistory has one more thing to show investors\n\nPerhaps the most surprising thing from history is that the previous most valuable stocks outperformed the S&P 500 for the next five years after they reached the top.\n\nStory continues\n\nCompany Five-Year Performance After \r\nBecoming the Most Valuable Stock Comparable Performance \r\nof the S&P 500 Percentage Points \r\nof Alpha Microsoft 5% (2%) 7 ExxonMobil 11% (8%) 19 Apple 102% 86% 16 Nvidia ? ? ?\n\nReturn data according to YCharts. Chart by author. *Alpha refers to a stock's performance relative to a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500) and is designated in terms of percentage-point difference.\n\nIt's important to zoom out and consider why this is true. It's because a company doesn't just become the world's most valuable for no reason. Something good must be happening with the business. And whatever trends are in the company's favor tend to last for multiple years, at least.\n\nFor Microsoft, it rode the PC revolution to take the top spot. ExxonMobil benefited from an extreme and prolonged spike in oil prices. And Apple was at the front of the smartphone trend. These were material drivers of each business that played out over years, not days.\n\nNvidia is benefiting from the surging adoption of artificial intelligence (AI). Even if there's a lot of over-the-top hype with this trend, important things are happening in AI, and many businesses are likely to continue experimenting with the technology's application in the coming years. This means that business could stay good for Nvidia, leading to more market-beating gains.\n\nAs an investor who places a strong emphasis on value, the valuation of Nvidia stock personally makes me quite nervous. The market cap is over $3 trillion, and it trades at an extreme price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 42. In the history of the stock market, there has never been a company this big that sported a valuation this high. For perspective, Nvidia's valuation is currently triple the valuation of Microsoft in the second-place spot.\n\nMy discomfort with the valuation aside, I can't deny that history says Nvidia stock hasn't peaked yet. It could stay at the top for multiple years. And it could outperform the S&P 500 from here as the AI trend continues to play out.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AI crypto tokens rally after Nvidia posts record gains. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nAI-related cryptocurrency tokens have rallied in the past 24 hours, outperforming major digital assets, such as bitcoin (BTC-USD) and ether (ETH-USD). The artificial intelligence token market cap has increased by over 14%, to now stand at $29.9bn (£23.55bn), according to Coingecko data.\n\nThe rally comes in the wake of Nvidia (NVDA) becoming the world's most valuable company, as Wall Street investors get into artificial intelligence chip stocks.\n\nTop five AI-related tokens by market cap rally\n\nAccording to the Coingecko, the top five AI crypto tokens by market cap have all rallied in the past 24 hours. Fetch.ai (FET-USD) saw the largest rise of over 30%, Bittensor (TAO) climbed by over 5%, Render (RNDR-USD) jumped by over 4%, while NEAR Protocol (NEAR-USD) and Internet Computer (ICP-USD) saw gains of 5% and 6%, respectively.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nOther AI-related crypto tokens that sit just outside the top five by market cap, such as SingularityNET (AGIX-USD) and Ocean Protocol (OCEAN-USD) rallied over 26% and 23% respectively.\n\nRead more: Sovereign agents: Your own personal AI assistant? | The Crypto Mile\n\nIn contrast to the uptick in the AI-related token category, major cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoin, ether and solana, have traded either flat or down. Bitcoin has retraced recent gains to fall to levels not seen since mid-May, trading up slightly over the past day to now change hands for $65,800.\n\nOther crypto tokens, such as ether increased 1.7%, however, solana (SOL-USD) fell 2.7% in the same period, according to Coingecko data.\n\nNvidia now listed as world's most valuable company\n\nChipmaker Nvidia was listed as the world’s most valuable company after its share price climbed to an all-time high on Tuesday.\n\nIts remarkable growth can be attributed to its graphics chips (GPUs) designed for processing artificial intelligence workloads in data centres.\n\nRead more: Can AI revitalise the metaverse?\n\nWith a market capitalisation now exceeding $3.3trn, Nvidia's stock has nearly doubled since the beginning of 2024. Nvidia shares closed the Wednesday session at $135.58, up 3% in the days trading. The chipmakers market capitalisation has now surpassed that of Microsoft (MSFT), Apple (AAPL) and Amazon (AMZN).\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat are AI-related tokens?\n\nAI-related tokens are a subset of cryptocurrencies designed to leverage artificial intelligence technologies within their ecosystems. These tokens are typically used to power platforms and applications that integrate AI to enhance functionality, improve decision-making processes, and automate various tasks.\n\nCheck: Crypto live prices\n\nAI-related tokens can be associated with projects focusing on machine learning, data analysis, and decentralizsed AI networks, offering unique use cases that distinguish them from more traditional cryptocurrencies like bitcoin and ether.\n\nRead more: This AI tool ‘threatens human creativity’ and the art world is worried\n\nFor example, Fetch.ai utilises AI to create decentralised autonomous agents for various industries, while SingularityNET aims to build a decentralised AI marketplace where algorithms can be bought and sold.\n\nThese tokens not only facilitate transactions within their respective platforms but also provide holders with governance rights and access to advanced AI-driven services. As the integration of AI technology continues to grow, AI-related tokens represent a promising area within the cryptocurrency market, attracting increasing attention from investors and developers alike.\n\nWatch: AI needs blockchain technology to become more secure and democratic, analyst says\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nNvidia (NVDA) notched its 43rd record closing high on Tuesday, bringing its 2024 return close to 175%.\n\nUnfortunately, passive investors relying on mutual funds and ETFs as investment vehicles haven't been able to participate in all of these gains.\n\nMicron (MU), Qualcomm (QCOM), KLA Corp (KLAC), and Lam Research (LRCX) also closed at all-time highs on Tuesday, catapulting the broader S&P 500 Tech Index to its own record and bumping up its year-to-date return to an enviable 31%.\n\nBut the closest investable match — the Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) — is underperforming its tech sector benchmark by over 10 percentage points this year.\n\nAnd the issue arises from the very success of the largest tech names.\n\nThe heart of passive investing is premised on managing risk through diversification. In theory, a diversified tech index is \"safer\" than one in which three stocks dominate the index.\n\nBut over the last four years, Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), and Nvidia have so thoroughly trounced the rest of the market that ETFs are bumping up against rules and regulations that limit the weight of individual stocks in funds.\n\nIn theory, each of these three behemoths should be weighted at just over 20% of the XLK fund — if it matched the benchmark. However, many investors (including this author), were recently surprised to learn that Nvidia only comprises 5.9% of the ETF. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK) expected to rebalance June 21\n\nThis state of affairs will soon change — drastically. With it, however, will arise another complication: Apple's weight dropping sharply.\n\nAfter the close Friday, the XLK ETF will be rebalanced to drop Apple's 22% share down to 4.5% and increase Nvidia's 5.9% share up to 21.1%, based on Bloomberg estimates.\n\nAll of this stems from Great Depression-era investor protection laws, which require that indexes limit the concentration of individual stocks to earn the label \"diversified.\"\n\nInvestors who are fond of reading prospectuses might enjoy the wonky legalese that explains the need for these changes as expressed in this FAQ and corresponding index methodology published by S&P Dow Jones Indices.\n\nBriefly stated, there are four companies — Nvidia, Apple, Microsoft, and Broadcom — that overrun the critical 4.8% threshold for individual names in a diversified index. And because they collectively exceed 50% of the entire index by weight, the weights of the smallest members are reduced according to a formula until all of the legal thresholds are respected.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll told, Friday's rebalance should force $12.7 billion in Apple stock to be sold and $11 billion of Nvidia to be bought. President and CEO of Nvidia Corporation Jensen Huang delivers a speech during the Computex 2024 exhibition in Taipei, Taiwan, Sunday, June 2, 2024. (AP Photo/Chiang Ying-ying) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nThat's close to the dollar amount of Apple shares that trade any given day, and about one-quarter of the dollar amount that Nvidia trades daily. In other words, these are material amounts.\n\nFortunately for investors, these are highly liquid stocks, and the investment community will have had a full week to digest the scenario by the time the rebalancing goes into effect Friday.\n\nOf course, there are plenty of companies not in the trillion-dollar club — and companies that aren't exactly AI plays — that have rewarded investors handsomely this year.\n\nDow component Walmart (WMT) is up nearly 30%. GameStop (GME) is up 40%. And Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) stock has returned a whopping 110% this year.\n\nBut the rebalance does raise the issue of an overlooked risk for the passive investing strategy preferred by the masses, which is that they may miss out when only a few names are carrying the lot. morning brief image\n\nClick here for the latest stock market news and in-depth analysis, including events that move stocks\n\nRead the latest financial and business news from Yahoo Finance\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Prominent Billionaires Are Selling It and Piling Into These 4 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Instead",
        "content": "With all eyes on the Federal Reserve and earnings season, it's possible investors missed what was, arguably, the most-important data release of the quarter five weeks ago.\n\nOn May 15, institutions with at least $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission. A 13F provides a snapshot to investors of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors have been buying and selling. It's effectively a blueprint that allows investors to see what stocks, industries, and trends have been piquing the interest of top-tier money managers.\n\nAs should be no surprise, first-quarter 13Fs showed a lot of trading activity in artificial intelligence (AI) stocks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nCompanies involved in AI are using software and systems to handle tasks that would normally be overseen by humans. What gives AI such broad-reaching utility is the ability for software and AI-driven systems to learn without human intervention. This evolution of AI systems should improve efficiency and allow for new tasks to be learned.\n\nDespite the big-dollar potential associated with AI -- the analysts at PwC foresee AI adding close to $16 trillion to the global economy by 2030 -- Wall Street's billionaire investors have mixed views about the companies embracing this technology.\n\nBased on the latest round of 13Fs, which covers trading activity during the March-ended quarter, a number of prominent billionaires were active sellers of AI kingpin Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). At the same time, these very same billionaire money managers were buying shares of four other promising artificial intelligence stocks.\n\nTop-notch billionaire money managers dumped shares of Nvidia\n\nSince the start of 2023, shares of Nvidia have skyrocketed by 802%, as of the closing bell on June 14, which translates into nearly $2.9 trillion in added market value. This helps to explain why it was a no-brainer for the company's board to approve a 10-for-1 stock split, which was completed on June 7.\n\nNvidia's outperformance has everything to do with its graphics processing units (GPUs) dominating in high-compute data centers. According to semiconductor analysis firm TechInsights, Nvidia was responsible for 3.76 million of the 3.85 million AI-GPUs shipped last year.\n\nFurthermore, demand for Nvidia's AI-accelerated chips has completely overwhelmed supply. This has sent the selling price of Nvidia's GPUs skyward and meaningfully increased its adjusted gross margin.\n\nBut in spite of Nvidia's first-mover advantages, two prominent billionaires dumped more than 2 million shares of the company during the first quarter (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nStory continues\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares)\n\nWhile simple profit-taking might explain some of this selling activity, there may be other catalysts behind Laffont's and Griffin's decision to decisively reduce their respective stakes in Nvidia.\n\nAs I've pointed out numerous times before, history has not been kind to next-big-thing innovations over the last 30 years. Not one game-changing innovation has avoided a bubble-bursting event. Investors commonly overestimate how quickly a new technology or innovation will become mainstream, and they're likely doing it again with artificial intelligence. Since no company has benefited more directly from AI, Nvidia would probably be the hardest hit if the AI bubble bursts.\n\nIt's also going to be increasingly difficult for Nvidia to sustain its growth trajectory and adjusted gross margin with competition coming at it from all angles. Since it can't meet all of its orders, external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Intel can be market share winners by default.\n\nTo add to this point, Nvidia's top customers are all working on AI-GPUs of their own. Even if these chips are simply to complement Nvidia's prized H100 GPU, it signals a purposeful lessening of reliance on the company's data center GPU architecture over time. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBillionaire Philippe Laffont piled into AI networking and cloud companies\n\nBut while Philippe Laffont was reducing Coatue's stake in Nvidia by 68% during the first quarter, he and his team were simultaneously gobbling up shares of AI networking solutions company Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO), as well as cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider Salesforce(NYSE: CRM). Coatue purchased 416,460 shares of Broadcom and 2,556,774 shares of Salesforce.\n\nBroadcom, which announced a 10-for-1 forward-stock split of its own last week, is a rising star in AI-accelerated networking solutions. The company's Jericho 3 chip has the ability to connect up to 32,000 GPUs, which can optimize processing speeds and reduce tail latency. In plainer English, Broadcom's AI solutions are expediting the processing needs of enterprise data centers responsible for training large language models (LLMs) and running generative AI solutions.\n\nBut Broadcom has plenty of momentum outside of the AI arena, too. It's still a dominant player in next-generation wireless chips and accessories used in smartphones, and also provides an assortment of connectivity solutions and sensors for industrial equipment and new vehicles. The company's backlog and cash-flow consistency are tough to top in the tech sector.\n\nMeanwhile, Salesforce is harnessing the power of AI to personalize its marketing efforts, automate certain repetitive tasks (e.g., data entry), and help it target new customers to boost its own sales. CRM software is, after all, designed to enhance existing customer relationships and grow sales. Predicting which existing clients might purchase a new product or service can be improved with AI.\n\nThere's little doubt Salesforce's long-term success has to do with its dominance in the CRM space. A recent report from IDC found that Salesforce accounted for a whopping 21.7% of global cloud-based CRM spending in 2023. With over three times the market share of its next-closest competitor (Microsoft at 5.9%), it should have no trouble retaining this competitive edge for many years to come.\n\nBillionaire Ken Griffin chose something a little more \"Magnificent\"\n\nSince its inception in 1990, Ken Griffin's hedge fund has generated $74 billion in total gains. No other hedge fund has come close to matching this mark. That's what makes Citadel selling roughly 2.46 million shares of Nvidia all the more interesting -- as well as Griffin and his teams' decision to buy two AI-inspired \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks.\n\nDuring the March-ended quarter, Citadel Advisors added 352,453 shares of e-commerce titan Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN), as well as 747,887 shares of tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nIn addition to designing its own AI chips, Amazon is aggressively deploying generative AI solutions across its various operating segments. For instance, it's made generative AI solutions available to its Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers, who are able to use the technology to do everything from customize AI virtual assistants to train LLMs. AWS is one of Amazon's fastest-growing segments, and is often responsible for the lion's share of its operating income.\n\nDon't overlook subscription services or advertising, either. Amazon attracts in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion visitors to its site each month, which yields quite a bit of ad revenue. Meanwhile, the company surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021 and has more than likely added to this total since becoming the exclusive streaming partner of Thursday Night Football.\n\nAs for Apple, it made waves during its 2024 developer conference when it introduced \"Apple Intelligence\" -- the company's collective term for a series of AI-inspired upgrades to its various products and services. This includes everything from emoji generation based on entered text to the integration of OpenAI's virtual chatbot ChatGPT-4o later this year.\n\nMore so than any of the companies mentioned here, Apple brings cash-flow predictability to the table. It has an extremely loyal customer base, a well-known brand, and has often led with innovation. Apple has also repurchased $674 billion worth of its common stock since 2013 began, which is more than any other public company. These buybacks have undoubtedly helped to increase its earnings per share and made the company more attractive to fundamentally focused investors.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

The stock would need to rise just over 36% to get there. NVDA Market Cap Chart\n\nLet's look at three reasons why Alphabet looks poised to be the next stock to join the $3 trillion club.\n\n1. Alphabet companies maintain dominant market positions\n\nAlphabet is the dominant leader in search with Google having an approximate 90% global market share. Search is a huge business that is still growing robustly, with Google search revenue up 14% year over year in the first quarter this year to $46.2 billion. While Microsoft has tried to challenge Google's dominance by adding new artificial intelligence (AI) features to its Bing search engine, so far this has not made a dent in Google's dominance.\n\nAt the same time, YouTube is also a video content leader with one of the most attractive models in the space. Given its user-generated content, the company doesn't have to pay the large upfront content fees of streaming services, instead sharing revenue with its creators. Despite a lackluster advertising market, YouTube's first-quarter revenue jumped 21% year over year to $8.1 billion. The company is just starting to better monetize its short-form videos, which is competing with the likes of ByteDance's TikTok and has a long runway to keep growing.\n\nMeanwhile, Google's fastest-growing segment is its cloud service business, which grew its revenue 28% year over year to $9.6 billion in Q1. Google Cloud holds the No. 3 position in market share for cloud services (behind 2. Microsoft's Azure and 1. Amazon Web Services) and the business has been a beneficiary of increased AI spending in the broader economy. As a business with a lot of fixed costs, Google Cloud just became profitable in 2023 and is now set to grow its profitability more quickly than revenue as the segment shows operating leverage.\n\n2. Alphabet is seeing an AI upside\n\nWhile Google Cloud has already been a big beneficiary of the increased interest in all things AI, other parts of its business are also benefitting. The company is incorporating its Gemini large language model (LLM) into various products including its Pixel smartphones and Workspace product suite. Gemini for Workspace, for example, will start as a $20-a-month add-on subscription built into Gmail, Docs, and Sheets that will act as an AI assistant that can do such tasks as monitor and track projects, organize information, help write proposals, and generate images and designs.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile the company has scaled back its use of AI search overlays for the time being due to some early flubs, it still represents a future opportunity. Google currently only serves ads for about 20% of its searches where the inclusion of ads is relevant to the search, so new ad forms for AI searches will be a big potential opportunity. The technology still needs to improve, but AI and AI-powered search are still very much in their infancy.\n\n3. Alphabet is an undervalued stock\n\nCompared to the stocks already in the $3 trillion club, Alphabet trades at the lowest valuation by far with a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of just over 23. Given its current growth and future prospects, the stock currently looks very undervalued. GOOGL PE Ratio (Forward) Chart\n\nIf Alphabet traded at the same 32.5 forward P/E multiple as Apple, its Class A shares would cost $245 and it would have a market cap of $3 trillion. Notably, Alphabet has been showing stronger revenue growth than Apple. In their most recent quarters, Apple saw its revenue decline 4% year over year, while Alphabet grew revenue 15%. Thus, it looks like it should only be a matter of time before Alphabet stock joins the $3 trillion club.\n\nOverall, Alphabet is an undervalued stock with dominant market positions and strong growth prospects ahead. The stock looks like a solid buy for long-term investors at current levels.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) became the world’s most valuable company this week, surpassing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earlier in the month. Wedbush analysts believe that the race to a $4 trillion market cap in tech will be a key focus over the next year, primarily between those three companies.\n\n“Nvidia's GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,” Wedbush analysts said in a note.\n\nThe investment firm notes that Nvidia's dominance in data center AI spending positions it as a pivotal player in the AI revolution, with all generative AI applications relying on its GPUs. Nvidia and Microsoft are seen as the primary beneficiaries of this trend, with secondary and tertiary impacts beginning to emerge, supporting their tech bull thesis for 2024/2025.\n\nWedbush predicts that over the next three years, more than 70% of enterprises will adopt AI use cases, leading to an estimated $1 trillion in incremental AI spending over the next decade.\n\nFor Apple, the AI opportunity is twofold, according to Wedbush’s analysts.\n\nThe rollout of its AI strategy could trigger a significant iPhone upgrade cycle among its massive user base, and developers will create numerous apps on Apple's AI platform, effectively building a new AI App Store in the coming years. Analysts believe this \"will be the main way that consumers interact with generative AI.”\n\n“While Apple has been late to the game on AI with the biggest consumer installed base in the world, Cook&Co. have a unique advantage to monetize the AI Party in this 1995 Moment,” wrote Wedbush’s team.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia now ahead in Big Tech race to $4 trillion - Wedbush\n\nHoneywell to buy aerospace and defense firm CAES Systems for $1.9 billion\n\nNvidia set to solidify position as world's most valuable company\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Why Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) Looks Enticing after 15% Surge",
        "content": "Adobe, a leading creative software giant (NASDAQ:ADBE), faced significant market rejection earlier this year, causing its stock to plunge. However, investor sentiment has turned positive as Adobe’s shares surged more than 15% following strong Fiscal Q2 results, which included robust growth in key metrics, increased guidance, and enhanced clarity regarding the company’s AI strategy. Looking ahead, Adobe continues to trade at discounted multiples from its peak, still presenting an attractive buying opportunity.\n\nThis positive outlook supports my bullish stance on Adobe’s prospects for the remainder of the year.\n\nWhy Is ADBE Underperforming This Year?\n\nAdobe has encountered a few challenges this year that have contributed to its downward spiral. First, Adobe faces stiff competition from Canva, an intuitive editing platform that consistently launches new tools. This competition has made it increasingly difficult for Adobe to maintain its dominance, especially at the lower end of the market.\n\nAdditionally, Adobe faced customer backlash over privacy concerns when it announced it would give all users free access to their projects.\n\nHowever, the primary issue that overshadows Adobe is the uncertainty regarding its AI strategy. Concerns about how Adobe plans to integrate AI into its software have caused apprehension among investors. As a result, Adobe has struggled to meet Wall Street’s expectations in recent quarters. The market focus has shifted mainly to AI infrastructure companies like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), leaving Adobe perceived as lagging in the AI race.\n\nThis perception has sidelined Adobe, as market participants may view the company as falling behind its competitors in the AI arena.\n\nIs Optimism Justified Following Fiscal Q2 Results?\n\nAdobe’s recent Fiscal Q2 results have provided investors with reasons to feel optimistic, with shares jumping around 15% following the release of the figures.\n\nAdobe reported revenue growth of 10% year-over-year, totaling $5.31 billion and also delivered solid results on the bottom line, with GAAP EPS reaching $3.49, a 24% increase year-over-year. The fiscal second quarter showcased double-digit bottom-line growth in its Digital Media segment (responsible for 74% of the company’s total revenues), which grew 11% year-over-year, while the Digital Experience segment (25% of total revenues) grew 8.7% year-over-year.\n\nIn both cases, Digital Media’s ARR (annualized recurring revenue) jumped by 13%, and Digital Experience’s subscription revenue increased by 9%, highlighting the robustness and predictability of Adobe’s recurring business model.\n\nStory continues\n\nRegarding margins, Adobe’s GAAP operating margin stood at 35.5%, a year-over-year increase of 1.8 percentage points. Despite this improvement, Adobe reported an operating cash flow decrease of 9% year-over-year at $1.94 billion. Over the past year, this decline in cash generation has been impacted by the $1 billion acquisition termination fee payout to Figma.\n\nHowever, Adobe continues to generate robust free cash flow ($6.49 billion over the last 12 months) and has repurchased shares totaling $2.5 billion in Q2.\n\nFurthermore, another significant development of the quarter was the upgrade in the company’s full-year 2024 guidance, which includes an increase of $50 million in digital media net new ARR and a raise in the lower end of revenue expectations from $21.3 billion to $21.4 billion.\n\nManagement attributes this success to growing customer value through an innovative product roadmap. Adobe has made substantial strides in enhancing its product offerings, making them more valuable to customers and increasing market interest in Adobe’s services. The infusion of artificial intelligence (AI) into Adobe’s products has further enhanced their utility for creators, positioning the company at the forefront of technological advancement in the creative software industry.\n\nFor example, Adobe has introduced new features on Acrobat aimed at boosting productivity in handling multiple documents, powered by Adobe Firefly. This allows users to generate images using text prompts. Additionally, the Firefly AI image tool is closely integrated with Photoshop and Lightroom offerings, enhancing upsell potential. I believe this is exactly the type of news Wall Street wanted to hear.\n\nWhat Is Not Priced Into Adobe’s Investment Thesis?\n\nEven though Q2 has given Wall Street a new lease on life, I think what’s not yet priced into Adobe stock is the complexity of projecting the next two years based on what generative AI can achieve.\n\nIf Adobe can effectively implement its AI strategy and demonstrate that its customers are not switching to other AI tools, it will be challenging to bet against a leading company in its segment. This is particularly true for a company with a large user base strengthened by AI capabilities, similar to the situation faced by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) this year.\n\nDespite a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 28x, Adobe is still not up for the year, remaining below its price at the beginning of 2024. It is also 20% below its five-year average, and I believe this scenario presents an interesting opportunity for investors. While ADBE stock has rebounded slightly from earlier lows of around $430 per share, it is still trailing the major indexes significantly for the year.\n\nThis slight rebound, driven by excellent earnings announcements, has not pushed the stock into overvalued territory. In fact, I consider Adobe’s current trading price reasonable, given the company’s solid fundamentals and growth prospects.\n\nAdditionally, management’s confidence in the company’s future is further underscored by its decision to repurchase shares. Stock buybacks are typically a strong signal that the company believes its shares are undervalued.\n\nIs ADBE Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe consensus among Wall Street analysts regarding ADBE is a Moderate Buy. This is based on 21 Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average ADBE stock price target is $618.28 among 27 analysts, implying an upside potential of 18.4%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nAdobe’s Fiscal Q2 results not only demonstrated the company’s solidity but also alleviated some concerns regarding its AI capabilities, helping the stock partially regain momentum. ADBE is currently trading below its historical valuation average, making it a compelling opportunity to invest in a robust business on a dip.\n\nGiven these factors, I believe that as Adobe continues to execute its AI strategy, its position as a market leader in creative software should strengthen and significantly enhance its value, thereby garnering better appreciation from Wall Street. Therefore, I am bullish on ADBE stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Tech stocks look set to drive Wall Street higher, with chipmaker Nvidia leading the way. The Bank of England is widely expected to keep interest rates unchanged, yet the Swiss National Bank cuts rates again.\n\n1. Futures just higher with techs leading the way\n\nU.S. stock futures traded marginally higher Thursday, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite leading the way.\n\nBy 08:08 ET (13:08 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 6 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 22 points, or 0.4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 140 points, or 0.7%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices are all on course for a winning week, with both the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite reaching fresh records on Tuesday. The stock market was closed Wednesday for the Juneteenth holiday.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has led the way, becoming the most valuable company in the world earlier this week [see below], with enthusiasm towards all things AI driving the gains.\n\nThe economic data slate includes initial jobless claims figures and housing starts data later in the session, as investors look for more clues towards when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates.\n\n2. Bank of England set to hold rates unchanged\n\nThe Bank of England holds its latest policy meeting later Thursday, with the central bank widely expected to hold interest rates unchanged.\n\nU.K. inflation returned to its 2% target for the first time in nearly three years in May, data released on Wednesday showed, but wage growth and underlying pricing pressure remain a concern for the central bank.\n\nBank of England Governor Andrew Bailey opened the door early last month to a rate cut, saying he was \"optimistic that things are moving in the right direction\", but not quite yet.\n\nMost economists in a Reuters poll last week thought the central bank would start to cut rates in August, but markets see only a 30% chance of an August rate cut and think a first move is more likely in September or November.\n\nEarlier Thursday, the Swiss National Bank trimmed its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 1.25%, its second cut in a row.\n\nThe SNB surprised markets with a cut in March, with inflation remaining within the central bank's target of 0%-2%.\n\n3. Nvidia still in spotlight\n\nNvidia is likely to remain in the spotlight Thursday, after the chipmaker became the world’s most valuable company earlier this week, as it has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of artificial intelligence.\n\nIt is now worth $3.34 trillion, having ended trading on Tuesday at nearly $136, making it more valuable than fellow tech giant Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), having overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) earlier this month.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts at Stifel lifted their price target for Nvidia's shares to $165 from $114, citing the company’s longer-term growth prospects and profitability metrics.\n\n\"We expect the majority of near-to-medium term opportunities will come from high performance computing, hyperscale and cloud data center, and enterprise and edge computing,\" they argued. \"While we continue to view Nvidia’s exposure to Gaming, Automotive and Professional Visualization favorably, the shift from general purpose compute to accelerated compute represents the company’s most significant revenue and profitability growth opportunity over the next several years.\"\n\nBut they noted several risks to the updated price target, including a \"potential digestion period following several quarters of significant investment\", unforeseen tightening of U.S. trade restrictions on technology shipped to China and \"general macro[economic] events.\"\n\n4. Tesla’s EU sales slumped in May\n\nTesla’s sales slumped in the European Union in May, falling 34.2%, as part of a sharp drop in demand for new battery-electric cars in the region.\n\nDemand for EVs in Europe has cooled in recent months, after rising strongly for several years, while competition to produce more affordable models has grown.\n\nTo shield domestic automakers from an influx of cheap EV imports, the European Commission said last week it would impose provisional duties of up to 38.1% on China-made EVs starting July.\n\nThis prompted Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), a U.S. electric carmaker, to state that it was likely to increase the price of its China-made Model 3 when the EU measures come into effect.\n\nTotal EV sales in the European Union dropped 12% in May from a year earlier, data from the European Automobile Manufacturers Association showed on Thursday.\n\nThis drop was led by a sharp 30% reduction in Germany, the bloc's largest electric vehicle market, after the country ended late last year subsidies for buying EVs.\n\n5. Crude awaits official US inventories\n\nCrude prices were stable Thursday, ahead of the release of the official U.S. inventory data.\n\nBy 04:10 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.1% lower at $80.61 a barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.1% to $85.18 per barrel.\n\nThere was no WTI settlement on Wednesday due to a U.S. holiday, which kept trading largely subdued.\n\nData released on Tuesday by the American Petroleum Institute showed U.S. crude stocks rose by just over 2 million barrels in the week ended June 14, suggesting weakening demand even during the important summer driving season.\n\nThe Energy Information Administration releases the official figures later Thursday, a day later than usual due to Wednesday’s Juneteenth holiday.\n\nThe continued unrest in the oil-rich Middle East has provided a degree of support for the market, with Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz warning of a possible \"all out war\" with Lebanon's Hezbollah, even as his country continues to battle Hamas in Gaza.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nBOE policy meeting, tech stocks, Tesla's EU sales - what's moving markets\n\nAnalysis-China's key plenum aims to fix decades-old tax revenue imbalance\n\nSwiss National Bank continues rate cuts, points to lower inflation\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The Largest Company in the US",
        "content": "We recently compiled a report on the 50 Largest Companies in Every State in the US, and in this article we will look at the largest company.\n\nEconomy of  US\n\nThe United States holds the title of the largest economy in the world, according to the IMF in 2024 the United States had a GDP of approximately $28.78 trillion, a GDP per capita of around $85,370, and an annual GDP growth rate of 2.7%. In 2025, GDP is expected to rise to $29.84 trillion whereas GDP per capita is expected to rise around $87,980. The United States possesses a large and skilled labor force, a culture of innovation and entrepreneurial spirit along with highly diversified companies in technology, finance, manufacturing, healthcare, and entertainment which generate productivity and economic growth. Additionally, the U.S. dollar serves as the world's primary reserve currency and is used to facilitate international trade and investment.\n\nCertain regions in the United States stand out as hubs of economic power and innovation. Silicon Valley in the San Franciso Bay Area, California has long been the hub of technological innovation in software, hardware, and biotechnology. Some of the largest tech giants such as Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms, Inc. (NASDAQ:META), Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOG) among many others are headquartered in Silicon Valley. Wall Street, the financial district in Lower Manhattan in New York City on the other side is home to major financial institutions such as JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM), The Goldman Sachs Group, Inc. (NYSE:GS), and Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS). Wall Street serves as the center of the world's financial markets and facilitates the flow of capital, investments, and trading activities on a massive scale. In recent years, there has been a notable trend of companies relocating from high-tax states to low-tax states in pursuit of cost savings and favorable business environments. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) are some of the largest companies that moved their incorporations from California to Texas. According to CNBC, more than 60% of Fortune 500 companies are headquartered in Delaware. Delaware is one of the top choices for corporations due to their business-friendly policies, lower taxes, reduced regulation, and incentives for relocation. Delaware has a strategic location and its corporate law is highly developed, the state's Court of Chancery, a specialized court for business disputes, is known for its efficient resolution of legal cases. It allows businesses to maintain confidentiality and offers incentives for relocation such as tax credits, grants, and loans. Delaware does not have a state sales tax, and its corporate income tax of 8.7% is considered one of the lowest in the United States. You can also take a look at 15 States with No or Lowest Sales Tax Rates in the US.\n\nStory continues\n\nLargest Company in the US\n\nFounded in 1975, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains a globally recognized company known for its software products, such as the Windows operating system and Office productivity tools. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) Azure AI has also continued to lead in innovation by offering advanced APIs and models that are revolutionizing industries with its responsible AI solutions that facilitate the creation, reception, and interaction with images, videos, and audio. Azure's market share is expanding due to its extensive portfolio of AI and cloud services. Over 65% of Fortune 500 companies and 53,000 customers now use the Azure OpenAI Service. The introduction of the Models as a Service API and partnerships with Nvidia and AMD for AI hardware accelerators are significantly boosting the growth of Microsoft's cloud business. Additionally, Microsoft's Copilot offerings, integrated into Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, and GitHub, are transforming productivity and democratizing AI-powered capabilities, further increasing Microsoft's share in office productivity tools.\n\nAzure AI Services has also impacted the legal industry by efficiently managing and analyzing vast amounts of data in the fast-paced legal environment and the legal field is highly exposed to the effects of new AI technologies. With traditional data sources like emails and documents now supplemented by complex data types such as chat data and video recordings, legal teams face significant challenges. AI is increasingly used to streamline processes, reduce risks, and boost efficiency. Companies like Icertis, Relativity, and Clifford Chance are at the forefront of integrating AI into their operations by leveraging Azure AI Services to enhance contract management, e-discovery, and overall legal service delivery. Microsoft Corporation’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) commitment to responsible AI, ensuring data privacy, security, and governance highlights how AI advancements are driving growth, productivity, and innovation across industries.\n\nOn April 25, Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) reported that its revenue for the three months ended March 31, increased by 17% year over year to $61.9 billion and net income increased by 20% year over year to $21.9 billion. The company’s Azure and cloud services revenue increased 31% year over year and Microsoft Cloud revenue amounted to $35.1 billion.\n\nWhile Silicon Valley, leads the world in technology and innovation and New York’s Wall Street serves as the global hub for banking, investments, and trading, each state in the United States possesses its own unique strengths and specialties. With this context, let’s take a look at the list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US. The Largest Company in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the 50 largest companies in every state in the US, we scanned the Finviz and Yahoo Finance stock screeners to find the largest companies by market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024. Then we checked where the headquarters of these companies are located. To quantify the \"value\" or \"size\" of private companies, we selected either the estimated valuation, the annual revenue available for the most recent fiscal year, or the number of employees, subject to the availability of data. The estimated valuation was sourced from major media reports based on the private companies' latest funding round. The annual revenue or number of employees was sourced from official statements by the company and the company's website. We have ranked the 50 largest companies in every state in the US in ascending order of largest companies incorporated in that state according to their market capitalization, as of June 11, 2024.\n\nAt Insider Monkey we are obsessed with the stocks that hedge funds pile into.

Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nState: Washington\n\nMarket Cap: $3.18 Trillion\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) is known for its dominance in the software industry and is diversified into cloud computing, gaming with Xbox, and hardware such as surface devices.

        "content": "Nvidia, the US computer chip firm, has moved ahead of tech giants Microsoft and Apple to become the most valuable company in the world.\n\nHere is a look at how the California-based company achieved this.\n\n– What has happened?\n\nOn Tuesday, Nvidia’s share price hit nearly 136 US dollars (£107), giving the company an overall valuation of 3.34 US trillion dollars (£2.63 trillion).\n\nThis made the company more valuable than Microsoft, having also overtaken fellow tech giant Apple earlier this month, and become the most valuable company in the world. Jensen Huang is chief executive at Nvidia (Chiang Ying-ying/AP)\n\n– Why has the firm become so valuable?\n\nA computer chip giant previously best known for making graphics cards, Nvidia has in recent years come to dominate the market in artificial intelligence (AI) chips – specifically those needed to train and run the powerful AI models that run generative AI software such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGenerative AI has become the key battleground in the tech space over the last 18 months, with some experts saying it could be as pivotal an innovation as the internet itself in the years to come.\n\nThe excitement around the technology has sparked a battle between some of the world’s biggest companies – Apple, Amazon, Google, Meta, Microsoft and others – to build new AI products.\n\nWith Nvidia as the key maker of AI chips, this has substantially boosted the firm’s sales and profits, with its stock price further helped by some investors believing it could go higher, with demand for AI expected to increase further.\n\n– How fast has Nvidia’s value grown?\n\nWhile its share price has been steadily rising for several years now, it has only been this year that it truly took off. Nvidia makes AI chips – specifically those needed to train and run the powerful AI models that run generative AI software such as OpenAI’s ChatGPT (John Walton/PA)\n\nIts value has more than doubled in 2024 to now sit at nearly 136 US dollars a share.\n\nIn contrast, at the beginning of 2023, it was priced at less than 15 US dollars a share, and five years ago it was less than four US dollars.\n\n– Is it likely to keep growing?\n\nMany investors believe the demand for AI is only going to increase, meaning Nvidia’s value could rise still further, with some believing the company is now in a direct race with Microsoft and Apple to be the first to reach a four trillion US dollar valuation over the next year.\n\nBut others have questioned whether further big gains in the future are likely, given the increasing competition it is and will likely face in the months and years to come as tech giants begin to build and use their own AI chips, existing rivals catch up and new firms emerge as key players in the AI chip market.",

Due to U.S. government funding and immersive technology expenditures, North America is expected to dominate the industry.\n\nCompanies are increasingly adding AR to a wide range of products and services. As an example, ActiveLookhas connected its micro-projection technology to the CrewNerd app so that rowers can see their real-time AR success data. The official AmazeVR Concerts app also launched with a special concert by Zara Larsson, showing how AR can be used in entertainment.​\n\nFurthermore, during its Worldwide Developers Conference 2024 event, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) recently showed off new features for its Vision Pro AR device. These features could help the gadget become more popular with regular people; Apple thinks that between 500,000 and 600,000 Vision Pros will sell this year.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAt the same time, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is updating HoloLens with AR functionality and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) continues innovating in AR by overhauling its Quest 3 headset.\n\nThe latest industry moves and multi-billion dollar market size will inevitably lead to more investors searching for AR stocks. Itt’s a savvy move, so let’s explore some that are getting plenty of analyst love.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Microchip GPU with Nvidia logo in the background. High quality photo. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Rokas Tenys / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), one of the Magnificent Seven equities, is now the most valuable firm in the world after growing 239% in 2023 and 181% this year. NVDA has numerous business lines, including AR.\n\nAt Computex 2024, NVDA demonstrated better AR immersion with RTX computers powered by artificial intelligence (AI). With these advancements, developers may leverage Nvidia’s AI-AR technique to create more engaging AR applications.\n\nNvidia’s Omniverse offers CloudXR virtual reality (VR) add-ons. AR devices provide and receive 3D data and position virtual objects in real life. Professionals may immerse themselves with graphics and industrial AR. Foxconn builds digital twins and improves robotic facilities utilizing Nvidia’s Omniverse, Isaac and Metropolis platforms to further industrial digitalization.\n\nNvidia’s CloudXR software allows mobile devices to enjoy high-fidelity AR and VR. GPU virtualization and Nvidia RTX servers let CloudXR distribute complex AR applications across 5G and Wi-Fi.\n\nStory continues\n\nTop PC manufacturers are building AI factories using Nvidia’s MGX flexible reference design tool. Spectrum-X Ethernet improved the AI task network, speeding AI solution processing and delivery. Furthermore, Nvidia microservices improve gene analysis, pictures and surgical robots with AI.\n\nOverall, creative AI applications are simpler to design and utilize with NVIDIA NIM. Building AI applications is simpler with its inference APIs, which execute models effectively in containers, making NVDA one of the best AR stocks out there.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet Inc.

The Google stock split is happening today.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nGoogle’s parent Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) is coming off substantial momentum in recent months, thanks to declaring its first-ever dividend of 20 cents per share, greenlighting the buyback of an additional $70 billion in stock and posting better-than-expected first-quarter results. All the while it has been pursuing its AR ambitions, making it one of the top stocks in the field.\n\nAlphabet’s interest in AR is not new. It purchased Raxium to improve its AR capabilities and strengthen Google’s market position by integrating advanced display technology with its AR goods and services. In addition, Alphabet is actively working on providing high-fidelity AR experiences across devices for the company. These initiatives enable developers and companies to build more engaging AR applications.\n\nA recent strategic technical alliance between Magic Leap and Google has increased the commercial use of AR solutions based on Magic Leap’s excellent AR technology and Google’s software and cloud services. Google is also experimenting with YouTube’s creative AI, leveraging powerful AI to make videos easier to produce and view. Additionally, AI21 Labs and Google Cloud are adding creative AI tools to BigQuery to accelerate data processing.​\n\nSymbotic (SYM) Person holding smartphone with website of US robotics warehouse company Symbotic Inc. on screen with logo.

Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nSymbotic (NASDAQ:SYM), for the first time in a while, is trading at a very attractive valuation after falling 31% this year. Much of that loss came after posting weaker than expected earnings and outlook.\n\nHowever, investors who are bullish on AR stocks should remember that Symbotic made Fast Company’s list of the 2024 World’s Most Innovative Companies because of how it uses robots and AI in the supply chain. This includes the self-driving SymBot robot, which makes things faster, more flexible and more efficient while also dropping costs. Other features include those that work with AR technology to make logistics processes easier to see and automate.\n\nSymbotic has persisted in growing its alliances, most notably via its joint venture with GreenBox. Although there are a number of risks and uncertainties associated with this project that might affect its performance, the goal is to improve their outsourcing skills.\n\nIt’s also worth pointing out that the earnings report that caused SYM to dip did have some notable positive beats, with second-quarter sales increasing to $424 million with adjusted EBITDA of $22 million. In the last four quarters, SYM has surpassed Wall Street estimates three times, cementing its place among top AR stocks.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "3 Metaverse Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "It’s been a few years since we heard about the metaverse as a hot theme of investment. Undoubtedly, virtual, augmented and mixed reality seems to have nothing on generative artificial intelligence (gen AI). And though the metaverse may very well represent the next big leap in computing, I’m still not sure just how many people will be willing to spend hundreds or, for higher-end headsets, thousands on a device that one may not even know how to utilize fully.\n\nFurther, we don’t know if we’ll be consistent users of headsets or if they’ll sit on the shelf all day as we continue to use devices we’ve grown used to over the past few decades. Undoubtedly, there’s a great deal of risk for consumers when shelling out a big chunk of cash on a device whose future is highly uncertain.\n\nIt’s up to the spatial computing pioneers to convince us to pay to plug into the metaverse. And until the hardware and software are in the right spot, the metaverse may be a somewhat abstract term for most people, perhaps akin to gen AI before ChatGPT. Regardless, here are some metaverse stocks to buy now for investors who believe that technology is the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMeta Platforms (META) In this photo illustration the Meta logo seen displayed on a smartphone and in the background the Facebook logo\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and its CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, still desire to invest in the future of the metaverse, even though gen AI and other priorities have taken hold in recent years. Undoubtedly, the company has invested billions in creating the metaverse and will need to contribute billions more before Meta Quest headsets become as used as PCs.\n\nThough the metaverse headlines have stopped coming in at a rapid pace, while investors cool on the trend at large, I still view the metaverse as one of the biggest growth drivers for Meta over the next 20 years. Perhaps Meta’s gen AI expertise and its vast trove of data resources could help accelerate progress on the metaverse in the next 10 years.\n\nIn any case, META stock stands out as thinking at least a decade ahead of the rest of us when it comes to mixed reality and the metaverse. When metaverse active users stand to really take off, though, remains the big unknown.\n\nFor now, it’s not yet certain that the metaverse will be the next big technological marvel. If it is, I expect Meta will play a big part in the new market, which could see the next generation plug into worlds we cannot even begin to fathom.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) An illustration of the Roblox game is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Miguel Lagoa / Shutterstock.com\n\nRoblox (NASDAQ:RBLX) is a popular video game developer recently touted as an attractive metaverse play by analysts over at Macquarie. With RBLX stock in a rough spot, down more than 73% from its 2021 all-time highs, the intriguing metaverse pure-play certainly seems intriguing while it’s still grounded.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, Macquarie is a fan of the socialization aspect. Undoubtedly, the metaverse isn’t just about gaming; it’s about interacting with friends in a so-called third space. And while third spaces may be declining realms of the physical, I do see their rise in the virtual realm as providing a long-term boon for Roblox.\n\nIndeed, Roblox’s social and experiential aspects are nothing new to investors. Arguably, Roblox and Meta Platforms are going after the same holy grail: becoming the go-to “place” to interact with friends and loved ones. With a modest $23 billion market cap, perhaps investors are underestimating the firm’s growth.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple store. Apple Inc. (AAPL) sells consumer electronics, computer software, services and personal computers.\n\nSource: Vytautas Kielaitis / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) just loves to give its unique take on various emerging technologies while steering clear of buzzwords. Whether we’re talking about limited use of the buzzy word “AI,” even during its latest unveiling of Apple Intelligence, or not using the term “metaverse” when referencing the potential of its Vision Pro spatial computer, Apple just loves to live up to its motto of thinking differently.\n\nWith regard to the metaverse, perhaps Apple is smart to distance itself from Meta Platforms, a firm that pretty much coined the term. Either way, Apple is an impressive play on mixed reality, even though we’re more hyped up about Apple Intelligence rather than the Vision Pro, a profound device many investors don’t seem to care much about any longer.\n\nWith the Apple Vision Pro device slated to hit new international markets this summer, it will be fascinating to see if the first iteration of the product will be met with upbeat demand. Specifically, China and Japan are top markets to watch closely as the device nears its launch.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "content": "Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang: So far this year Nvidia has gained 175%. (Chiang Ying-ying, Associated Press)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nNvidia's stellar run continued last night, climbing 3.5%, as it overtook Microsoft (MSFT) to be crowned the most valuable stock in the world. In pre-market trading on Wednesday it was 0.6% higher.\n\nShares eclipsed $135 (£106) per share giving the chipmaker a market capitalisation over $3.33trn. With a 0.4% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at nearly $3.32trn.\n\nIt comes just two weeks after Nvidia took the number two spot from Apple (AAPL).\n\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. This is thanks to the explosion in interest in generative AI that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT software in late 2022.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nYear to date, Nvidia has gained 175%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\n\nNvidia first crossed a $1trn market cap on June 13, 2023. The company's advance from a $1trn to a $3trn market cap was the fastest on record.\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\n\nBerkeley (BKG.L)\n\nHousebuilder Berkeley was in the red this morning despite lifting its earnings outlook for the current financial year by 5% to £525m.\n\nIt was the biggest loser on the FTSE 100 index as it reported a pre-tax profit of £557m for the year to 30 April, down from £604m last year.\n\nThe company said that it would plunge back into the private rental market for the first time in a decade by launching a build-to rent arm to tackle the “severe shortage” of properties in and around London.\n\nBerkeley, which built 3,500 homes for private sale last year, will establish a build-to-rent business, which aims to create 4,000 homes in London and the south-east over the next decade.\n\nIt plans to develop the properties across 17 brownfield sites and launch a dedicated online platform to manage them.\n\nBerkeley said: \"The operating environment has become increasingly uncertain over recent years as a high number of well-intended regulatory and policy changes came into effect.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"This contributed to a marked decrease in private and affordable homebuilding activity, with SME developers and housing associations particularly impacted.\n\n\"This significant decline in housing delivery has been acknowledged by policymakers at all levels and triggered a renewed focus on addressing barriers within the regulatory and planning system.\"\n\nRead more: UK inflation drops to Bank of England's 2% target\n\nGames Workshop (GAW.L)\n\nWarhammer maker Games Workshop rallied 8% in London after it said it expects a jump in annual pre-tax profits to at least £200m compared to £171m a year earlier.\n\nThe maker of miniature figurines for tabletop battle games posted annual profits growth of at least 17%, following an acceleration in the second half of the fiscal year.\n\nCore revenues came at above £490m for the 53 weeks to 2 June, up 10%, meanwhile, profit before tax is estimated to come in \"not less than £200m\", compared to £171m the year before.\n\nIn the first half of the year PBT grew 14% to £95.2m.\n\nIncluded in the profit estimate is the allowance for £18m of staff profit-share scheme, which is paid in cash on an equal basis to each employee, while £138m of dividends were shelled out and declared in the year, with 415p per share paid out.\n\nJust Eat (JET.L)\n\nShares in Just Eat rose more than 2% on Wednesday amid news that it has joined forces with Amazon (AMZN) in Germany, Austria and Spain.\n\nEurope's biggest food delivery firm said the move will allow it to offer free delivery of food orders above 15 euros ($16.13).\n\nThe deal, which marks its first collaboration with Amazon in Europe, comes with no financial terms to the partnership meaning it was \"mutually beneficial\" for both companies.\n\nThe initial deal between the two companies was struck in mid-2022.\n\nLast month, Amazon said its customers in the US can order from Just Eat-owned Grubhub directly on its shopping app and the website, extending a deal that already offers its Prime members a no-fee access to Grubhub+ membership.\n\nJamil Ghani, vice president at Amazon Prime, said: \"Giving Prime members no delivery fees from restaurants on Just Eat Takeaway.com is another way we help members save money every day.\n\n\"The value of a Prime membership continues to grow with this offer, and now is the best time to enjoy the convenience, savings, entertainment – and deliciousness – that the membership provides.\"\n\nWatch: What are SPACs?\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Get ready. You are about to discover three tech stocks to buy that have not participated in the broader tech sector’s upward momentum in 2024.\n\nAs a result, we believe these tech shares offer significant long-term profit potential. Year-to-date (YTD), the tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 index has advanced over 17%. Now it hovers near all-time highs. Tech giants like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) have led the rally. However, a number of tech stocks have been left behind.\n\nAs a result, these overlooked companies currently trade at a discount, providing attractive entry points for long-term investors. Despite the recent share price weakness, many of these companies have strong profitability metrics and positive analyst outlooks. With that information, let’s explore three tech stocks to buy, worthy of your attention in the second half of 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCustomer relationship management (CRM) technology heavyweight Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is first. The company’s Customer 360 platform brings companies and customers together. It offers a range of services from sales and service to marketing and commerce. Many of our readers follow CRM stocks as a member of the Dow Jones Industrial Average, or Dow 30.\n\nRecently, Salesforce reported financial results for Q1 of fiscal year 2025. The company delivered $9.13 billion in revenue, an 11% year-over-year (YOY) increase. Subscription and support revenue, a significant component of Salesforce’s business, grew by 12%.\n\nHowever, investors were not pleased Salesforce’s metrics fell short of Wall Street’s estimates. This was the first time since 2006 that Salesforce missed revenue expectations. Investors were concerned about Salesforce potentially being left behind in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. Yet, InvestorPlace.com contributor Alex Sirois has recently reported on this. Salesforce management has been investing in the AI safety and research company Anthropic, known for its large language model (LLM) Claude.\n\nIn addition, Salesforce has been actively pursuing strategic deals and partnerships to enhance its offerings and expand its reach. One notable development has been the creation of the Zero Copy Partner Network. This includes major tech players like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), privately-held Databricks, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), International Business Machines (NYSE:IBM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), and Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW).\n\nStory continues\n\nSo far in 2024, CRM stock has declined over 12%. The shares are trading at forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 23.4x and price-to-sales (P/S) ratio of 6.2x. Meanwhile, Wall Street remains optimistic with a 12-month median target that signals a 30% upside potential.\n\nKeysight Technologies (KEYS) A concept image of electricity flowing between two disconnected electric cables.\n\nSource: ESB Professional / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectronic design and test solutions provider Keysight Technologies (NYSE:KEYS) makes electronic equipment, instruments and components segments. It serves customers in a wide range of industries, including communications, government, automotive, industrial and semiconductor manufacturing.\n\nIn Q2 of 2024, Keysight Technologies reported revenue of $1.216 billion. Although the number was above the high end of their guidance, it represented a 13-14% decline on a core basis compared to the previous year. Orders for the quarter were $1.219 billion, down 8-9%. Looking ahead, Keysight’s management expects Q3 revenues to be between $1.180 billion and $1.200 billion.\n\nAlso, Keysight Technologies has been active in expanding its capabilities and market reach. Recently, the firm was designated as a technical service provider for the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE) in automotive cybersecurity and software regulations. Also, management introduced a pulse generator software for its FieldFox handheld analyzers, supporting numerous advanced applications.\n\nSince January, KEYS stock has lost around 14%. Currently, it is changing hands at 23.3 times forward earnings and 4.6 times sales. Despite the decline in Keysight share price, analysts expect a potential advance of around 19% in the next 12 months.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, SkyworkSolutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) specializes in the design and manufacture of high-performance analog and mixed-signal semiconductors. The company serves various end markets, including mobile, automotive, industrial, infrastructure and the IOT.\n\nRecent earnings showed revenues of close to $1.05 billion and earnings per share (EPS) of $1.55. The gross margin for the quarter was 45%, down 140 basis points sequentially, reflecting the seasonally weakest period for SWKS.\n\nLooking ahead, Skyworks Solutions expects revenue of $900 million for the June quarter. And the gross margin is projected to improve to 45-47%, with further expansion anticipated in the remainder of 2024.\n\nSkyworks Solutions has been actively expanding its pipeline and initiating new programs. For instance, management has secured several audio system-on-chip (SoC) designs with major players like Sony Group (NYSE:SONY)  and Samsung Electronics. Recently, it has also showcased several AI-enabled phones, highlighting the potential for AI to drive a meaningful replacement cycle in the smartphone market.\n\nYTD, SWKS shares are down over 5% and are changing hands at 17.9 times forward earnings and 3.7 times sales. Investors could regard any potential dip in SWKS stock as an opportunity to invest for the long term.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tezcan Gecgil did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Rivian Automotive has been charting a path toward recovery, making it one of the top EV stocks to buy now. It has bounced back impressively in recent quarters, fueled by promising developments and renewed investor interest.\n\nThe EV upstart has shown solid progress in ramping up delivery volumes and moving toward profitability. Additionally, it unveiled next-generation versions of its R1S SUV and R1T truck models, likely to be a major growth catalyst ahead. Moreover, rumors swirling over a potential partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and the anticipated launch of its more affordable R2 models are stoking investor enthusiasm.\n\nHowever, Rivian’s not the only EV stock that’s worth betting on at this time. The industry is up against multiple headwinds, but these three are among the best EV stocks to buy now. Coupled with Rivian, these dynamic EV stocks should build a superb portfolio poised for long-term growth and exciting returns ahead.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBYD (BYDDY) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nBYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY) is arguably the most compelling EV story. Defying current market headwinds, it has effectively transformed from a top-tier battery maker to a juggernaut in the EV space.\n\nThe firm’s strategy revolves around blending accessibility with affordability, allowing it to effectively dominate the Chinese market. However, it’s not stopping there. It’s set on dominating the global EV scene, revving its presence everywhere, from Europe to Southeast Asia.\n\nRecent results have been tremendous despite industry challenges. Sales of new energy vehicles were up 38.1%, totaling 331,817 units in May. This includes a 54.1% rise in plug-in hybrid sales and a 22.4% boost in battery electric vehicles.\n\nAlso, introducing new models like the ‘Shark’ pickup truck and the budget-friendly ‘Seagull’ EV underscores its stellar long-term bull case. BYD is effectively laying the groundwork for sustained dominance in the EV realm.\n\nLi Auto (LI) Li Auto electric car in store.

Unlike most of its peers domestically and globally, Li Auto has been consistently profitable on a gross profit basis since 2020. Moreover, it swung from a $292 million loss in 2022 to rake in a cool $1.65 billion net income last year.\n\nFurthermore, its recent financials underscore its stellar upward trajectory. Despite the relatively muted performance in Q1, it expects to deliver between 105,000 to 110,000 vehicles in the second quarter, roughly a 21.3% to 27.1% increase from the prior-year period. Last month’s results, in particular, underscore its bright outlook ahead. It posted a 23.8% increase in car deliveries year-over-year (YOY) to 35,020 vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs we advance, Li Auto is laser-focused on dominating the Chinese market through model innovation and next-generation autonomous driving technology. It also plans to invest over 6 billion yuan in building 5,000 charging stations, significantly boosting its service network while opening up a lucrative new income stream.\n\nGeneral Motors (GM) General Motors (GM) sign with blue and white logo and brick building in background\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nGeneral Motors (NYSE:GM) is one of the biggest names in the automotive industry, and it continues to navigate the weaknesses in the EV space. In doing so, the automotive giant is looking to advance its hybrid technologies effectively in tandem with its expansive EV and autonomous vehicle projects.\n\nIn 2023, the firm delivered over 75,000 EVs and projected a substantial increase between 200,000 and 300,000 EVs this year. Bolstering its commitment further, GM plans to invest a whopping $35 billion in its EV initiatives through the current year, along with major investments in its powerful Ultium EV platform, including enhancements in its connected vehicle services.\n\nFinancially, GM remains in excellent shape, marked by robust agility and growth potential. It reported an 8% YOY increase in sales for Q1, hitting $43 billion. This substantial growth was accompanied by a hefty 19% increase in adjusted earnings per share to $2.62, prompting an optimistic revision of its full-year financial outlook.\n\nOn the date of publication, Muslim Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines\n\nMuslim Farooque is a keen investor and an optimist at heart.

        "title": "3 Transportation Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "The transportation industry is one that will always exist, and there will never be a time when it will not grow. People are always looking to travel more efficiently, and the push for innovation will continue. Transportation stocks are the types that investors can feel comfortable to buy now for the long term. The global transportation services market, valued at $7.31 trillion in 2022, is expected to double to around $15.94 trillion by 2032, reflecting a robust CAGR of 8.11%. The transportation industry has seen challenges this year regarding supply chains, as auto production has been delayed and freight has been paused due to labor shortages.\n\nHowever, the companies I recommend below have healthy financials and the potential to dominate their respective markets. They have consistently shown financial performance despite the macroeconomic headwinds facing them. Lets take a look at three of the best transportation stocks to buy now.\n\nFord Motor Company (F) Ford dealership sign against a blue sky.\n\nSource: D K Grove / Shutterstock.com\n\nFord Motor Company (NYSE:F) is one of the largest U.S. automakers, and was the first to mass-produce vehicles.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company’s stock is down 2.55% year-to-date (YTD) as its losses have widened due to the price war in the EV market. In addition, Ford has faced shipments delays.\n\nHowever, Ford reported $42.8 billion in revenue for Q1 2024, a 3% increase year-over-year (YOY) despite fewer shipments. The Ford Pro segment outperformed by growing over 36% YOY to $18 billion. In addition, it saw its software subscriptions growing 43% YOY.\n\nFord’s famous brand, primarily the F-150, is the equivalent of Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPhone. Its popularity helps Ford grow even during tough times for the company. In addition, its rapid growth of software subscriptions represents a new revenue stream and promises higher margins compared to its labor-intensive manufacturing business.\n\nUber Technology (UBER) Uber sign on its headquarters building in San Francisco, California, USA - June 6, 2023. Uber Technologies is a transportation conglomerate.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nFrom a simple ride-share application, Uber Technology (NYSE:UBER) has expanded to food delivery and freight transportation. Its stock is up over 20% YTD due to strong revenue growth and increased profitability.\n\nIn Q1 2024 its revenue increased by 15% YOY to $10.13 billion. It showed strong profitability as adjusted EBITDA increased by 82% to $1.3 billion. It’s generating strong cash flow for investors, with free cash flow multiplying from $986 million to $4.17 billion in just a year.\n\nOne of the critical catalysts is Uber’s partnership with Instacart (NASDAQ:CART), which allows Uber’s deliveries to compete in the grocery delivery market. The U.S. market is expected to be worth $65.51 billion in 2031 and grow at a 9.31% CAGR from 2024. This partnership gives Uber at least 21.6% market share, just below Walmart (NYSE:WMT) and Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN). With Uber’s large base of existing delivery drivers, the partnership makes Uber a formidable competitor in a fast-growing market.\n\nStory continues\n\nUnion Pacific Corp (UNP) United Pacific (UNP) switch on tracks near Kansas City.\n\nSource: Michael Rosebrock / Shutterstock.com\n\nUnion Pacific Corp (NYSE:UNP) is a major owner of freight railroads in America. They are vital to the U.S. economy and move one third of all U.S. exports. Its stock is down over 9% this year due to decreased coal shipments and a soft economy.\n\nUnion Pacific Corp maintains a strong position in the U.S. freight industry with a 34.94% market share. The company pioneers itself as the second largest railroad in the U.S., sharing a duopoly with Burlington Northern Santa Fe Corporation. This has helped Union Pacific maintain its revenues and margins to outperform the rest of the sector.\n\nOperating income for Q1 2024 was $2.4 billion, up 3% YOY. Revenue declined by 1%, and net income increased by 1% YOY. Overall, despite headwinds, management has been strong in maintaining its financials.\n\nUnion Pacific Corp plans to invest $3.4 billion to upgrade its older trains to improve efficiency, maintain infrastructure and expand to newer high-growth areas. As a company with such a rich history and assets of rail networks, it’s stock drop this year could mean it’s an opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Michael Que did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple Intelligence Could Ignite a New iPhone SuperCycle",
        "content": "Apple stock (NASDAQ:AAPL) hit new 52-week highs recently after the Cupertino tech behemoth hosted an exciting Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple showcased many new features in the newer versions of iOS, macOS, watchOS, and iPadOS that will further refine its slick ecosystem. More importantly, though, Apple revealed its own AI platform, Apple Intelligence, which is set to revolutionize the user experience and initiate a new era of innovation. This could be the catalyst for a new iPhone sales supercycle. Thus, I am bullish on the stock.\n\nApple Intelligence: Solving Device Sales Stagnation\n\nApple Intelligence could potentially serve as the key solution to a longstanding challenge that Tim Cook and his team have been grappling with: the prolonged stagnation in device sales. Take the iPhone, for instance. Apple sold 231.8 million units in 2023, not far from the 231.2 million units it sold in 2015. Sure, significant price increases led to revenue growth during this period, but selling units more often has proven difficult so far.\n\nThe most significant reason for the relatively flat unit sales over the years is likely the increasing durability of Apple’s products. The company’s relentless commitment to quality and device robustness has resulted in devices that endure and perform exceptionally well over multiple years. Moreover, incremental progress in newer models has not always provided compelling reasons for immediate upgrades, further extending the replacement cycle. I still use my iPhone 13 Pro Max, and thus far, I have not had a good reason to upgrade.\n\nHowever, the introduction of Apple Intelligence may potentially serve as the catalyst that triggers an all-around trend of upgrades, potentially ushering in an iPhone sales supercycle. Let’s take a deeper look at how it solves the problem.\n\nHow Apple Intelligence Solves The Problem\n\nIf you are not familiar with how Apple’s ecosystem works, you may assume that Apple Intelligence will be just another AI product, maybe one that resembles ChatGPT. However, this is hardly the case. I think that Apple is on a whole different mission here. Apple Intelligence is special because its AI is integrated into iPhones, representing a significant leap in personalized technology. By leveraging access to user data within the iPhone, Apple Intelligence can deliver a highly tailored user experience, setting it apart from generic AI assistants.\n\nThis changes the game for several reasons. First, the personalization offered by Apple Intelligence can lead to unprecedented convenience and functionality. By knowing your habits, preferences, and routines, the AI can anticipate your needs and seamlessly automate your tasks. Did you forget to add that one item you usually include in your weekly grocery order? Imagine if Apple Intelligence would remind you just before you paid (with Apple Pay, of course).\n\nStory continues\n\nSecond, this is probably going to be the only AI platform with privacy and security at its core. While other AI services handle data on external servers, Apple ensures that all critical data is processed locally on your device, safeguarding your personal information. While I value the AI’s ability to understand my habits and optimize my daily routine, it’s crucial that this data never leaves my device. Apple is currently the sole provider, promising both a secure and personalized AI experience.\n\nOverall, if Apple Intelligence lives up to its promise, as demonstrated during the WWDC event, it’s fair to expect a significant surge in iPhone sales. Apple’s AI could be the compelling reason for iPhone users who typically upgrade every few generations to eagerly seek out the latest model. Moreover, it might be the catalyst for many Android users to switch to iPhones.\n\nPicture being an Android user and seeing your friend’s iPhone effortlessly solving daily challenges with Apple Intelligence, tailored perfectly to their needs. Meanwhile, your experience, switching from Samsung to Huawei to Xiaomi over the years, can never provide comparable functionality. It may become clear to these users that joining the Apple ecosystem may finally offer you the seamless integration and intuitive assistance you’ve been missing. This could further boost sales and widen Apple’s user base.\n\nWatch Apple’s Valuation, Nonetheless\n\nDespite the bullish momentum following Apple’s recent presentation, which could very well be justified for the reasons I just described, investors should carefully monitor the stock’s valuation. The recent rally led to Apple’s forward P/E surging to 32.2x based on FY2024’s earnings-per-share consensus estimate. This multiple is clearly too rich based on Apple’s recent earnings growth. Instead, it reflects Wall Street’s forecast for a significant earnings growth rebound—one that Apple’s AI platform could help power.\n\nStill, the current valuation heightens the stock’s risk profile. If Apple Intelligence doesn’t end up being the catalyst that ultimately powers a strong EPS growth trajectory, the stock could face significant headwinds as the market will have to re-rate Apple’s valuation.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nWall Street’s sentiment on Apple seems relatively mixed. The stock features a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 23 Buys, 11 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. However, at $210.86, the average AAPL stock price target implies 1.6% downside potential.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nApple’s unveiling of Apple Intelligence at WWDC seems to mark a pivotal moment poised to reshape its future. By integrating AI directly into its devices while prioritizing user privacy, Apple has positioned itself for a potential iPhone sales supercycle. However, while the prospects are promising, I think that investors must tread carefully, given Apple’s hefty valuation. The success of Apple Intelligence will be pivotal in justifying Wall Street’s lofty expectations and avoiding a sentiment reversal sell-off.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Best Buy Stock (NYSE:BBY): Still Attractive at New 52-Week High",
        "content": "Many investors have left retailers for dead, but shares of electronics retail giant Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) quietly hit a new 52-week high today. Not only that, but the stock looks like it has plenty of room for more upside ahead. I’m bullish on Best Buy based on its renewed momentum, inexpensive valuation, attractive dividend yield, and potential to benefit from an AI-driven refresh cycle for PCs.\n\nAnalysts are Coming Around to the Stock\n\nThe move hasn’t garnered much attention, but Best Buy is soaring to a brand new 52-week high after gaining a scorching 27.7% gain over the past month. The stock has now bounced 45.7% off of its 52-week low and is up 21% year-to-date.\n\nThe Minnesota-based company is enjoying considerable momentum with sell-side analysts. Earlier in June, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) analyst Steven Zaccone gave Best Buy a rare double upgrade from Sell to Buy based on a “tech replacement cycle” getting underway, AI-driven demand for new products, and improving margins. Zaccone increased his price target on the stock from $67 all the way up to $100.\n\nAnd Zaccone isn’t alone in upgrading the stock. Recently, UBS (NYSE:UBS) analyst Michael Lasser upgraded Best Buy from Neutral to Buy based on expectations that Best Buy should enjoy a “nice recovery” in sales in the latter half of 2025 and heading into 2026.\n\nLasser believes that Best Buy will benefit from a consumer appliance refresh cycle as well as new products coming onto the market. The analyst assigned a $106 price target to Best Buy, implying 13% upside potential from its current level.\n\nLet’s delve into the details of this product refresh cycle that both analysts are alluding to.\n\nAI Laptops Poised to Drive Growth\n\nZaccone highlighted the fact that Best Buy’s same-store sales are growing, driven in large part by demand for new laptops. Indeed, the growing capabilities of generative AI and rapid consumer adoption of these technologies are driving demand for AI-enabled PCs and laptops. Manufacturers like HP Inc. (NYSE:HPQ) and others are releasing new lines of AI-enabled laptops with greater computing power to satisfy this demand.\n\nThese new and improved laptops will also come with higher price tags. For example, HP’s two new AI-enabled models, the consumer-targeted HP OmniBook X AI and the enterprise-focused HP EliteBook Ultra AI, will feature price tags of $1,199 and $1,699, respectively.\n\nBest Buy CEO Corey Barrie believes the AI-driven refresh cycle is still in the early innings and said that with “roughly 40 SKUs in total, we expect to have the largest assortment…” of AI-enabled laptops “…at launch with more than 40% of the assortment retail exclusive to Best Buy.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBeyond these AI laptops, there are other exciting new products that Barrie says have the potential to fuel sales growth for Best Buy. These include new Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) iPads with M4 chips, Bose’s new open-ear headphones, and new headphones from Sonos (NASDAQ:SONO) as the high-end speaker company forays into this segment of the market for the first time.\n\nInexpensive Valuation\n\nWhile shares of Best Buy have enjoyed a nice run, they are still decidedly cheap. Shares trade at 14.9 times consensus January 2025 earnings and just 13.5 times January 2026 consensus earnings estimates.\n\nThe broader market trades at a much higher multiple. For comparison, the S&P 500 (SPX) currently fetches a multiple of 23.6 times earnings. Therefore, while Best Buy is setting new 52-week highs, one can hardly say that it is overextended or that shares look frothy. This reasonable multiple leaves plenty of room for upside ahead.\n\nGreat Dividend Stock\n\nIn addition to this inexpensive valuation, Best Buy also sports an attractive dividend yield of 4.2%. This yield is considerably higher than that of the S&P 500, which yields just 1.3%. Best Buy’s yield is also competitive with 10-year treasuries, which currently yield 4.2%.\n\nNot only does Best Buy feature a high yield, but it boasts a strong track record when it comes to paying a consistent dividend and increasing the size of its payouts over time. Best Buy has paid dividends for an impressive 20 years in a row and has increased its payout for 13 consecutive years. That’s the type of consistency investors can count on.\n\nIs Best Buy Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, BBY earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on eight Buys, five Holds, and one Sell rating assigned in the past three months. The average BBY stock price target of $90.55 implies 3.3% downside potential from current levels.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nI’m bullish on Best Buy stock based on its attractive valuation and 4.2% dividend yield, along with its consistent track record as a dividend stock. BBY is enjoying considerable momentum, and Wall Street analysts are coming around to it. Furthermore, the stock appears to be well-positioned to benefit from new demand for new AI-enabled PCs and laptops over the next year or more.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Huawei, Tencent Near Deal to Exclude WeChat From Revenue Sharing",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is nearing a deal to let Tencent Holdings Ltd.’s WeChat super app operate fully on its Harmony mobile platform without sharing any revenue, a concession designed to defend its newfound lead over Apple Inc. in China.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\n‘I Live in Hell’: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Nvidia’s 591,078% Rally to Most Valuable Stock Came in Waves Nvidia Becomes World’s Most Valuable Company as AI Rally Steams Ahead I Didn’t Think Biden Affected Crime Rates. I Was Wrong.\n\nThe deal, in which Huawei will agree not to charge Tencent any fee for in-app transactions within the WeChat universe, comes after months-long negotiations between the two Shenzhen-based tech behemoths, according to people with knowledge of the matter. They declined to be named discussing private corporate information.\n\nThe arrangement will likely make WeChat a rare exception in Huawei’s plan to start charging a fee for content and services on its app store. Huawei is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its Harmony platform, and it has been discussing a fee of about 20% with game developers, Bloomberg News reported earlier this week.\n\nIn return, Tencent will maintain and update the WeChat app that hundreds of millions of Chinese rely on daily for everything from payment to gaming, the people said.\n\nThe agreement, once sealed, would also be a boon for Tencent as it looks to drive more sales from WeChat’s mini programs, its platform for lite-versions of popular apps such as Didi. Tencent generated 1.5 trillion yuan ($207 billion) in gross merchandise value from its mini programs in the September quarter last year.\n\nCurrently users can download and use WeChat on Huawei handsets, but the two companies do not have a formal arrangement that obligates Tencent to provide regular updates to the app. The deal, which will not create a perceivable change for phone owners, also requires Huawei to continue to host and support WeChat.\n\nThe talks are ongoing and the two sides could still fail to agree on a deal, the people said. Huawei shifted to its in-house Harmony OS after US sanctions cut it off from working with Google, the proprietor of Android.\n\nStriking a deal is particularly crucial for Huawei because the company is moving to a new version of Harmony that may lose access to WeChat if Tencent didn’t continue to support the app. The agreement helps ensure that WeChat will be ready when Huawei makes its transition.\n\nHuawei has also reached out to ByteDance Ltd.’s Douyin in an attempt to discuss revenue sharing, but the Beijing-based social media company has not expressed any interest in opening talks, said one of the people.\n\nStory continues\n\nHuawei, Tencent and ByteDance did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\nHuawei’s negotiation with Tencent emerged from a broader effort to begin monetizing its smartphone platform, which just overtook Apple’s iOS in terms of market share in China. Apple also doesn’t take a cut of WeChat transactions but it does levy a 30% commission on purchases of WeChat Beans, a virtual currency users can spend on various in-app features such as tipping a livestreamer, according to the people with knowledge of the matter. Apple did not respond to requests seeking comment.\n\n--With assistance from Zheping Huang, Jessica Sui and Vlad Savov.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nCoke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "By Hannah Lang\n\n(Reuters) - Although Apple is discontinuing its buy now, pay later service launched last year, the company is sticking with the product, with a successor to the offering launching later this year via third-parties like Affirm.\n\nBuy now, pay later (BNPL) exploded in popularity as the COVID-19 pandemic forced more shoppers online, and the product has continued to resonate with consumers. BNPL loans drove $75 billion in online spending in 2023, up 14.3% from 2022, according to Adobe Analytics.\n\nIn a statement on Monday, Apple said its new solution \"will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe in collaboration with Apple Pay-enabled banks and lenders.\" It did not comment further about why it was ending its independent BNPL offering.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nExisting users of the BNPL service, Apple Pay Later will still be able to manage and pay open loans via the Wallet app, the company said.\n\nApple announced last week that Apple Pay users would be able to access new installment loan offerings this fall, including the ability to apply for BNPL loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay. Customers will also be able to access installments from credit and debit cards, the tech giant said.\n\nAnalysts had viewed Apple's original BNPL product as a competitor to BNPL providers like Affirm. It offered customers the ability to buy products and pay in four interest-free installments for items up to $1,000. Affirm offers users the option to pay for products in two or four installments, as well as monthly installments for higher-cost items.\n\n\"To me, this sounds a lot like what we see happening with debit cards,\" said Sean Gelles, director of payments intelligence at J.D. Power. \"Regardless of which debit card a consumer has funding their purchases, as long as they use Apple Pay, it’s Apple that owns the experience.\"\n\nGelles added that if Apple's new portfolio of BNPL products are delivered via Apple Pay there would be \"minimal risk for Apple as they will thereby retain the relationship with the customer.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nWhile Apple could choose to partner with additional BNPL providers in the future -- such as Affirm rival Klarna -- a source familiar with the matter highlighted Affirm's technology and underwriting expertise, as well as the company's choice to not charge users late fees.\n\nKlarna declined to comment.\n\nShares in Affirm were last down 0.7% on the day, a move that one analyst chalked up to weaker-than-expected retail sales data in May.\n\n(Reporting by Hannah Lang in New York; additional reporting by Ananya Mariam Rajesh; editing by Megan Davies and David Gregorio)",

        "content": "You aren’t alone if you’re nervous about where markets are going. Though economic and stock news alike points toward renewed national financial and monetary strength, on-the-ground vibes seem to negate the apparent facts. And, though we can’t always pick stocks to buy now on a vibes-based investment thesis, it’s important to keep the overall uneasy consumer sentiment in mind even as the stock market hits new all-time highs.\n\nThat’s why finding stocks to buy now isn’t easy – did you miss the boat on Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA)? Or will it keep ripping post-split? Is Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) OpenAI partnership a strategic blunder or the next step in consumer electronics?\n\nThere’s just too much uncertainty in today’s markets, but these diverse stocks to buy now offer a wider perspective while creating long-term speculative opportunities undergirded by a firm foundational of perennial winners.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTesla (TSLA) Elon Musk CEO and product architect of Tesla, Inc. (TSLA) Portrait on red background\n\nSource: kovop / Shutterstock.com\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is the easiest pick among the many stocks to buy now. It scored a win after the recent shareholder vote to approve Elon Musk’s 2018 pay package and move operations from Delaware to Texas. The stock didn’t react as many expected, though, and still trades well below even six-month highs.\n\nThe bull case for Tesla is widely stated and doesn’t bear repeating. Though I disagree with the price target, ARK Invest’ssummary of Tesla’s long-term potential is a great analysis of the overall market and Tesla’s unique positioning moving forward.\n\nMore importantly, though, Tesla’s shareholder vote win marks a major milestone in corporate law that makes the stock worth buying in its own right. Whether you agree or disagree with the pay package, having a judge legislate from the bench and calling the pay package “an unfathomable sum” before overriding existing board agreements is not how we want corporate governance managed.\n\nThink about it — much like presidential candidates promise to overturn past administrations’ decisions and create a cycle where little ultimately gets done year-to-year, we don’t want completely unrelated third parties (activist shareholders are a different story) stepping in to tell public companies how to do business. That introduces an element of risk and uncertainty that ultimately degrades all U.S.-based stock investing — which is why Musk’s big win is such a big deal and also makes Tesla one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nTilray Brands (TLRY) Close view of Tilray (TLRY) logo on a smart phone. Tilray specializes in cannabis research, cultivation, processing and distribution. TLRY stock\n\nSource: Lori Butcher / Shutterstock.com\n\nTilray Brands (NASDAQ:TLRY) stock is back in the gutter, trading nearly 25% below January’s per-share pricing. But I’m a perennial bull toward Tilray and think it’s the only standout company among cannabis stocks to buy now.\n\nStory continues\n\nSpecifically, I think that Tilray’s craft beer business is a huge deal that is overlooked by the wider investment class. Following its 2023 brand acquisitions from Anheuser-Busch (NYSE:BUD), Tilray’s alcohol sales surged more than 100%, providing a much-needed source of sale diversification in a crowded cannabis market.\n\nMoreover, many overlook the craft beer segment’s latent potential. When — not if — cannabis is recreationally legal to a wider extent, if not federally permissible, Tilray has a baked-in network of production, distribution, and operational facilities, including legal and marketing, that it can tap to push cannabis products nationally. This competitive advantage is huge and, again, mostly goes overlooked.\n\nTilray is looking to expand again, seeking $250 million to fund strategic acquisitions and peripheral business investments. Of course, the offering will be dilutive, but that makes the per-share pricing all the more sweet for long-term investors wanting to capture some sector upside among cannabis stocks to buy now.\n\nApple Hospitality REIT (APLE) REITs to buy Real estate investment trust REIT on an office desk.\n\nSource: Vitalii Vodolazskyi / Shutterstock\n\nImproved consumer sentiment and summer travel season are colliding, and few stocks to buy now are set to capture that unique investment intersection than Apple Hospitality REIT (NYSE:APLE). Apple Hospitality owns more than 200 hotel properties in America and leases them to top-tier hoteliers like Marriot (NASDAQ:MAR) and Hilton (NYSE:HLT). With a 6.5% dividend yield, Apple Hospitality is beating fixed-income options while offering upside to some of the priciest properties with the most reliable tenants in the business.\n\nThe company’s most recent quarterly report included a solid funds from operations boost to $83.24 million, up from $78.96 million the prior year. Funds from operations are a real estate investment trust-centric stand-in for earnings, so Apple Hospitality’s stat spiking over a relatively depressed travel cycle means big things moving forward.\n\nMoreover, Apple Hospitality is capturing upside from increased business travel rates, with midweek bookings increasing substantially over the quarter. This means that Apple Hospitality is set to take advantage of the summer leisure travel season while maintaining stability with business travel and keeping beds occupied throughout the workweek.\n\nAST SpaceMobile (ASTS) Mobile global internet communications.

ASTS stock\n\nSource: Andrey Suslov / Shutterstock.com\n\nSmall-cap space stock AST SpaceMobile (NASDAQ:ASTS) could be this year’s standout performer among stocks to buy now. This space-based telecommunications stock, dedicated to providing global data coverage directly to standard cell phones, surged over 300% in the past month, achieving a 104% gain year-to-date.\n\nThis remarkable rise follows the announcement of substantial contracts with established telecom giants AT&T (NYSE:T) and Verizon (NYSE:VZ) to extend cellular services to geographically isolated and remote areas globally. The Verizon contract alone is valued at $100 million, while AT&T’s deal builds on a January strategic investment of $20 million and six years of collaborative tech testing and prototyping.\n\nAdditionally, AST SpaceMobile has taken significant strides toward revenue generation, recording $500,000 in net sales from government contracts in the last quarter. Though modest considering its recent surge, this revenue is a crucial step toward profitability and signals the beginning of broader operational opportunities for the company.\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (GLDD) Container ships now carry about 90 of the world's cargo and the largest container ships can carry over 21,000 units. This one is operated by ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM stock)\n\nSource: Darryl Brooks / Shutterstock.com\n\nGreat Lakes Dredge & Dock (NASDAQ:GLDD) provides a vital service that often flies under the radar of most retail investors, making it an overlooked play among stocks to buy now. This company specializes in deepening, dredging, and expanding waterways along coasts and within ports, playing a crucial role in global trade and supply chains. This function positions it as a somewhat recession-proof investment, while its work in coastal beach reclamation ties it to efforts in climate change management.\n\nGreat Lakes’ recent financial report shows strength post-pandemic in a sector that suffered more than most and for longer. The company’s EBITDA hit $43 million, the highest since the end of 2021, and marks a period of imminent resurgence for the stock.\n\nLooking ahead, Great Lakes stands to benefit from a record-setting budget of $8.7 billion from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, which spells a robust bidding environment ripe for securing steady contract cash flows. With a dredging backlog of $879 million, the company can easily project future income, further stabilizing its financial outlook as supply chains stabilize.\n\nBuzzfeed (BZFD) Buzzfeed (BZFD) logo on a phone with a keyboard in the background. Buzzfeed layoffs\n\nSource: Meir Chaimowitz / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re surprised to see struggling media company Buzzfeed (NASDAQ:BZFD) listed among these stocks to buy now, let me explain. Buzzfeed faced its share of challenges, including declining quality and controversies over plagiarism, undue advertiser influence, and a series of unpopular political stances that have alienated many readers. These and other issues have led to its classification by Fairness & Accuracy in Reportingas having a political bias that is “borderline creepy.” This backdrop sets the stage for former presidential candidate and activist investor Vivek Ramaswamy, who recently acquired a 7.7% stake in Buzzfeed, aiming to enact significant changes — and I think he’s just the activist investor to re-right the ship.\n\nRamaswamy, a Republican, plans to engage with Buzzfeed’s board and management to discuss various operational and strategic opportunities to enhance shareholder value, including a strategic shift for the company. His move likely stems from a perceived lack of quality independent media outlets, and he is pushing for greater transparency, objectivity, and quality in media reporting. While Buzzfeed’s management has shown resistance, Ramaswamy’s Strive Asset Management, though a relatively new player, is quickly becoming influential in activist investing circles and may pave the way toward a new era in hyper-targeted media marketing.\n\nSharkninja (SN) a group of appliances in front of a blue wall, including a washing machine, a refrigerator, a microwave and more\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Digital Genetics\n\nConsidering the current economic conditions, labeling what seems like a typical consumer discretionary stock and appliance manufacturer as one of the best stocks to buy now may initially seem misplaced—until you examine Sharkninja’s (NYSE:SN) impressive long-term trading chart. With a consistent 20% compounded annual growth rate in sales since 2008, Sharkninja has successfully navigated through multiple economic downturns. Even “Downtown” Josh Brown, the CEO of Ritzholz Wealth Management,thinks that Sharkninja is one of today’s hottest stocks and recently added it to the firm’s holdings.\n\nSince its IPO last summer, Sharkninja’s stock already delivered a 77% return to its early investors, outstripping the S&P 500’s performance threefold during the same period and showing no signs of slowing down. The company’s most recent quarterly report highlighted a remarkable 25% increase in sales, particularly notable against the backdrop of significant sales drops from major retailers like Target (NYSE:TGT). With its solid market presence and extensive product lineup, Sharkninja stands out as one of today’s most viable long-term stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Jeremy Flint held no positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp.’s relentless rally has propelled the semiconductor giant’s market capitalization over its mega-cap tech peers, helping it clinch the title of the world’s most-valuable company as the artificial intelligence wave continues.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWhat to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan ‘I Live in Hell’: Anti-Growth Fervor Grips US South After Pandemic Boom Treasuries Rally After Solid $13 Billion US Sale: Markets Wrap Citi Pitches Money-Moving ‘Crown Jewel’ as Central to Revamp Ex-Trump Adviser Urges Him to Cut Ties With China, Restart Nuclear Tests\n\nShares rose as much as 3.4% to about $3.3 trillion on Tuesday, catapulting it over Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc. The top stocks have jockeyed all month for the pole position, with Nvidia edging past its big-tech peers.\n\nEarlier in the month, Nvidia capped Apple by market value for the first time since 2002, and the two went back and forth in rankings in recent days. Last week, Apple also overtook Microsoft to trade in the top spot briefly.\n\nThe ranking is yet another reminder that AI is the top focus of many investors. Nvidia is seen as the biggest and earliest beneficiary of the technology as it dominates the market with its highly sought-after chips that help power data centers running complex computing tasks required by AI applications. Demand for its H100 accelerators are surging and helped drive the chipmaker’s sales up by more than 125% last year.\n\nMicrosoft, for its part, is also seen as an early AI winner given its investment and partnership with OpenAI, which created ChatGPT. And, this week, Apple shares rallied after the iPhone maker finally unveiled its plan for using the technology, appeasing investors at long last.\n\n“We believe over the next year the race to $4 Trillion Market Cap in Tech will be front and center between Nvidia, Apple, and Microsoft,” Daniel Ives analyst at Wedbush Securities wrote in a note.\n\nInvestors and Nvidia Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang argue that Nvidia is more than a chipmaker.\n\n“They’re not just selling chips, they’re selling systems,” Michael Lippert, vice president and portfolio manager at the Baron Capital Inc., said in an interview, pointing to the company’s proprietary software and development ecosystem.\n\nNvidia’s swift climb to the top has been record breaking, as the company is one of the few firms to have demonstrated significant revenue growth from AI. Through last close, shares have risen more than 160% in 2024, adding more than $2 trillion to its market capitalization.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Nvidia’s GPU chips are in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector as more enterprises and consumers quickly head down this path with the 4th Industrial Revolution well underway,” said Ives.\n\n--With assistance from Bre Bradham.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Coke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "Investing.com - Analysts at Macquarie reiterated their outperform rating for Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP) on Monday while addressing concerns around the impact of Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) new app ad attribution tool.\n\nMacquarie believes that the negative reaction in AppLovin's stock following the unveiling of AdAttributionKit at Apple's WWDC conference is a case of misplaced headline risk.\n\nAnalysts noted, \"We think the overreaction by the market presents a buying opportunity, as AppLovin continues to outperform mobile adtech peers with its AI-driven Axon 2 bidding technology.\"\n\nAdAttributionKit essentially replaces Apple's SKAdNetwork4.0, offering improved features for measuring app ads.\n\nMacquarie analysts argue that this update does not hinder AppLovin's ability to buy ads, thereby dismissing concerns over its effect on the company's performance.\n\nThe report from AppLovin's Adjust division suggests that Apple's new measurement capabilities are in compliance with the EU's Digital Markets Act (DMA). It also indicates that AdAttributionKit provides significant improvements over SKAdNetwork4.0.\n\nDespite the constant worry about Apple's potential privacy-related moves in its app store, Macquarie analysts believe that just as Apple's IDFA restrictions did not negatively impact AppLovin's ad tech, AdAttributionKit will likewise not impede AppLovin's ability to buy ads on apps in the App Store.\n\nThe firm reiterated its Outperform rating for Applovin Corp (NASDAQ:APP), with a price target of $115.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMacquarie: Applovin's prospects strong despite Apple's new ad app attribution tool\n\nUS pushing Netherlands, Japan to restrict more chipmaking equipment to China, source says\n\nNvidia eclipses Microsoft as world's most valuable company\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia overtakes Microsoft as most valuable stock in the world",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) overtook Microsoft (MSFT) on Tuesday as the most valuable company in the world just two weeks after it took the number two spot from Apple (AAPL).\n\nNvidia's stock price rose more than 3.5% to north of $135 per share, giving the chipmaker a market capitalization just over $3.33 trillion. With a 0.3% slide on Tuesday, Microsoft's market cap stood at $3.32 trillion.\n\nShares of Nvidia are up more than 215% over the last 12 months and more than 3,400% over the last five years. Year to date, Nvidia has gained 173%; Microsoft stock is up just less than 19% in 2024.\n\nNvidia's surge has made it a top weighting in the S&P 500 (^GSPC), and the chipmaker has served a pivotal role in the benchmark index hitting record highs in 2024.\n\nUp until May, the S&P 500 had traded with a near-perfect correlation to Nvidia's price movement, meaning that as Nvidia's stock rose, so did the broader index. As of Monday, Nvidia's stock gains alone had contributed about one-third of the S&P 500's year-to-date rise, according to data from Citi's equity research team.\n\nNvidia completed a 10-for-1 split on June 10.\n\nThe company's rise comes amid the generative AI explosion that kicked off when OpenAI debuted its ChatGPT platform in late 2022. Nvidia's chips, modified graphics cards, and CUDA software platform are designed to both train and run AI programs, giving it a strategic advantage that experts say will take rivals AMD and Intel years to overcome.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nDuring a keynote at the Computex conference in Taiwan on June 2, CEO Jensen Huang announced that the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip — called the Blackwell Ultra — in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut AMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.

Instead, the company is pivoting its focus towards the development of a more budget-friendly Vision product that offers fewer features. This more cost-effective model is expected to hit the market by the end of 2025, as per individuals involved in the supply chain and manufacturing of the headsets.\n\nThe original plan for Apple's Vision line was to offer two distinct models, mirroring the standard and Pro versions of the iPhone. This strategy was shared by individuals involved in the supply chain and former Apple employees who had worked on the devices.\n\n⚠️Stay up to date with the latest company news using InvestingPro! CLICK HERE to unlock access to AI-powered ProPicks, ProTips, and more!⚠️\n\nDespite the halt in progress on the high-end Vision headset, the company still aims to bolster the sales of the existing $3,500 device. To achieve this, Apple plans to introduce the Vision Pro in eight new countries, including China and Japan.\n\nEarlier this month, Apple's annual developer conference saw the unveiling of its long-awaited AI strategy and the announcement of a partnership with OpenAI, the creator of ChatGPT. The event also spurred an increase in Apple's shares, which have now risen over 11% this year.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple suspends work on high-end headset, the Information reports\n\nMicrosoft's AI Copilot + PCs launch set to provide tailwind - Jefferies\n\nTrump Media says SEC's decision may help it get $247 million\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Fintech Stocks to Buy Now: June 2024",
        "content": "Investors looking for high-growth investments in the financial sector should consider the top fintech stocks to buy now for long-term returns.\n\nThe financial industry has seen a significant transformation in the last few years, marked by the emergence of fintech apps. Ranging from digital payments to peer-to-peer lending apps, these platforms have provided a more transparent and secure means of transacting. As a result, consumer trust in these platforms is on the rise with businesses benefitting from greater convenience and better connectivity with customers.\n\nThe rise of fintech apps has created a shift towards a largely cashless society and experts predict that nearly 91% of the transactions in the U.S. will be online this year. Keeping with this trend, the global fintech market is expected to exceed a $1,152 billion valuation by 2032.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe high growth potential of fintech apps serve as a tailwind for companies leading the charge. For investors, this optimistic outlook presents a great opportunity to get behind the top names in the sector.\n\nAffirm (AFRM) Smartphone with website of US financial technology company Affirm Holdings Inc (AFRM) on screen with logo Focus on top-left of phone display\n\nSource: Wirestock Creators / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s been a bumpy ride for Affirm (NASDAQ:AFRM) these last few years but several signs signal brighter days ahead.\n\nAs an early mover in the buy now, pay later (BNPL) space, the company saw its stock surge during the pandemic-induced lockdowns. However, a decline in digital spending and inflationary headwinds soon took center stage and sapped Affirm’s growth. In fiscal year 2023, the company’s revenue grew just 18% compared to a 55% spike in 2022 year-over-year (YOY).\n\nNevertheless, recent developments in the company give investors good reason to remain bullish on this stock. Shares of the company gained last week on news that Affirm’s BNPL loans will now be available on Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple Pay. AFRM stock was up 8% following the news.\n\nNow, taking a holistic view, this partnership will not have any short-term impact on its finances but it will certainly open doors for Affirm in the long-haul. The integration with Apple Pay will allow the company to expand geographically and branch out into additional service offerings.\n\nMoreover, things are also looking up for Affirm on the numbers front. After a slow 2023, the company’s revenue is up by 40% this year. Compound annual growth rate (CAGR) is also projected at 20% in the next five years. That’s a rosy outlook worth investing in.\n\nAffirm may not be at the top of its game right now. However, I think there are several tailwinds that make this one of the top fintech stocks to buy now for long-term returns.\n\nStory continues\n\nBlock (SQ) The Cash App (SQ) logo is displayed on an iPhone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother stock that’s worth investing in this month is Block (NYSE:SQ) — formerly known as Square. The company was no stranger to the post-pandemic decline and has struggled with profitability over the last few years. Shares of Block are down 78% from its highs in 2021. However, the company shines in one area that will fuel its growth in the coming years: digital payments.\n\nBlock has certainly expanded its offering since its Square days but it is still best known for its core products, Square and Cash App. The payment apps continue to generate income for the company with its Cash App segment seeing a 49% increase in gross profit YOY in Q1 this year.\n\nThe company is also heavily invested in this ecosystem and is constantly adding new features to its platform. According to Block’s management, it has barely scratched the surface of a total addressable market (TAM) of $130 billion in digital payments. This hints at endless growth opportunities for the company in this space.\n\nBlock’s current price presents a great entry point for investors looking to capitalize on the top fintech stocks to buy now for future returns.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhen it comes to fintech platforms, Visa (NYSE:V) is definitely at the top of my list. After a pandemic driven dip in 2021, the stock has been on the rise since- growing its revenue by 10% YOY. This spike can be attributed to several trends.\n\nFor one, Visa’s status as the largest card network in the world means that it has plenty to gain from an increasingly cashless society. In 2023, the company managed $12.3 trillion in payment volume. This number will only grow as more people switch to digital payments.\n\nSecondly, Visa will benefit from an increase in consumer spending. As global economies grow, the increase in spending will help the company maximize revenue. Visa is a high margin business and makes money on every small transaction. Its global presence and broad technology infrastructure across platforms presents a huge opportunity for revenue growth.\n\nMoreover, the company is actively expanding its ecosystem with the launch of several initiatives. This includes a partnership with Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) to streamline services for cloud-native institutions and a collaboration with DashSolutions to enhance the efficiency of instant payments.\n\nVisa stock is trading at a high multiple and isn’t a bargain buy by any means. However, its strong market position in a digitally-driven payment landscape makes this one of the best fintech stocks to buy now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Divya Premkumar did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Apple is discontinuing its buy now, pay later service known as Apple Pay Later barely a year after its initial launch in the U.S., and will rely on companies who already dominate the industry like Affirm and Klarna.\n\nIt's an acknowledgement from a company known for producing hit products that building a financial services business from scratch as Apple has been doing for several years is difficult and highly competitive.\n\nApple Pay Later launched with fanfare in March 2023 as a way for iPhone customers to split purchases of up to $1,000 into four equal payments with no fees or interest. The service was Apple's answer to the growing popularity of buy now, pay later services globally, and considered a sizeable threat to companies like Klarna, Affirm and others.\n\nBut Apple Pay Later was only available where Apple Pay was accepted whereas the other buy now, pay later companies had deeply integrated themselves into millions of merchant websites.\n\nIn an acknowledgement of how popular buy now, pay later services had become, Apple said at its developer's conference this month that it would start allowing banks to offer buy now, pay later plans to their customers through Apple Pay and Apple Wallet. Affirm would be integrated directly into Apple Wallet, and Apple customers would be able to open an Affirm account directly.\n\n“With the introduction of this new global installment loan offering, we will no longer offer Apple Pay Later in the U.S.,” Apple said late Monday. “Our focus continues to be on providing our users with access to easy, secure and private payment options with Apple Pay, and this solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe, in collaboration with Apple Pay enabled banks and lenders.”\n\nApple executives as recently as this month had indicated that the company still had plans for Apple Pay Later despite announcing plans to integrate Affirm directly into Apple Wallet.\n\nApple Pay Later was unique because Apple needed to create its own bank to offer the loans. The Apple Card is issued by Goldman Sachs, which means Goldman ultimately decides who gets approved and what spending limits are for each customer.\n\nApple has discontinued any new Apple Pay Later loans, but customers who have existing Apple Pay Later loans will be able to manage them inside Apple Pay.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential",
        "content": "Meta Platforms Inc. (NASDAQ:META) has experienced a significant surge so far this year, pushing the stock to nearly a 40% premium over its previous peak set in 2021, primarily due to its comeback in the social media advertising space after Apple's (NASDAQ:AAPL) App Tracking Transparency update, which had severely impacted its targeting capabilities.\n\nFigure 1: Meta Platforms' shares up 44% year to date\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 4 Warning Sign with META. AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nDespite this recovery, the first-quarter earnings season has generally been disappointing, and investors have found few reasons to chase market highs, resulting in Meta's stock plummeting by over 13% post-earnings report. The social media giant's decision to increase its capital expenditure outlook for the year without a corresponding uptick in growth led to investor skepticism about the efficiency of its spending. Meta's operational expenses are now projected to be between $96 billion and $99 billion, a $2 billion increase at the low end of the previous range of $94 billion to $99 billion. This new range represents a 9% year-over-year increase in operating expenses compared to $88.20 billion in 2023.\n\nRegardless of these challenges, I believe Meta's updated fundamentals and its position as a leader in adopting artificial intelligence transformation support a positive long-term growth and margin expansion trajectory. This outlook underpins its valuation prospects and maintains a robust outlook for the company, even with the unexpected capital expenditure increase. Although Meta's earnings dropped by double digits, the stock is still up more than 40% year to date. This recent dip presents a substantial opportunity for investors to buy into the Meta rally if they have not already.\n\nAdvertising business recovery fueled by AI investments\n\nMuch of Meta's $70 billion capital expenditure over the past two years, in addition to its research and development efforts, has been directed toward the development and deployment of AI technologies. These investments have paid off significantly. The recovery Meta experienced following Apple's ATT update in 2022 can be largely attributed to its AI initiatives, which helped restore its targeting capabilities and sustain its advertising business. As one of the tech giants with a market cap exceeding $1 trillion, Meta continues to grow its revenue at an impressive rate of over 20% annually. As a growth stock, it is logical for Meta to continue channeling resources into further growth initiatives.\n\nRecent industry data highlights the impact of Meta's AI investments. More than half of the content viewed by Instagram users is now recommended by AI algorithms. A survey revealed that 53% of Facebook and Instagram users spent more time on these apps compared to last year, whereas TikTok reported a 25% increase in user engagement over the same period. This underscores the effectiveness of Meta's AI in enhancing user engagement. Additionally, the company has consistently improved return on ad spend (ROAS) for advertisers through AI-enabled tools. The number of ad impressions served increased by 20% year over year and the average price per ad rose by 6%, reversing previous downward trends.\n\nStory continues\n\nFigure 2: Ad impressions growth year over year AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nFigure 3: Average price per ad growth year over year AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nLooking forward, Meta's ongoing commitment to AI developments is expected to bolster its strategy for monetizing its extensive user and merchant base. The company is also advancing its next-generation Meta Training and Inference Accelerator (MTIA), following in the footsteps of other tech giants who are enhancing their in-house silicon capabilities to reduce dependency on third-party hardware essential for AI advancements. This development complements Meta's AI investment cycle, which includes acquiring up to 350,000 Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) H100 GPUs. Continued vertical integration and diversified hardware reliance are anticipated to support the long-term success of its AI strategy and drive margin expansion at scale.\n\nCompetitive advantage\n\nMeta continues to see an increase in daily active users across its platforms, including WhatsApp, Facebook, Messenger and Instagram. With 3.24 billion daily users, the social media giant boasts one of the strongest network effects in the industry. The company has not only rebounded in user activity, but has also achieved robust growth. From first-quarter 2022 to first-quarter 2023, Meta's monthly active users grew by 15 million. From the first quarter of 2023 to the first quarter of 2024, this number increased by 22 million, marking almost a 50% rise in growth. This is particularly impressive considering the company already engages 40% of the global population as monthly active users, underscoring how integral its platforms are to daily life.\n\nFigure 4: Meta daily active people AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nNo competitor has been able to challenge Meta's dominance effectively. While companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) could develop their own social networks, the established user base of Facebook and Instagram creates a substantial barrier to entry. Google might integrate AI features into Bing and Apple might impose privacy settings to hinder Meta, but its investment in AI has allowed it to overcome these obstacles and continue to deliver personalized advertising. Even TikTok, Meta's closest competitor, faces significant operational challenges in the West with potential bans looming.\n\nDiversification potential\n\nMeta also has significant potential for diversification beyond its traditional revenue streams, particularly in the augmented reality and virtual reality markets. These efforts are encapsulated in the Reality Labs segment, which, despite being loss-making, represents a long-term investment.\n\nIn the most recent quarter, Reality Labs reported $3.8 billion in losses, a slight improvement year over year. Mark Zuckerberg has acknowledged the business will not be profitable until 2030, so immediate substantial cash flows are not expected. The Metaverse project, still in its early stages, requires years for consumer habits to adapt. Despite its current unprofitability, Meta holds a significant share of the AR and VR market. Few other companies are willing or able to invest as heavily in this space. Even Apple's entry with the Vision Pro has not made the expected impact, leaving Meta as a dominant player in the long-term development of these technologies.\n\nFinancial performance and outlook\n\nMeta has consistently demonstrated robust revenue growth, except in 2022 when its advertising business faced challenges due to Apple's ATT. The resurgence of Chinese e-commerce companies like Temu and Shein, which have heavily invested in Meta's ad solutions, has significantly boosted ad revenue over the past several quarters. The company's free cash flow margin currently stands at 35%, with the potential to exceed 40% if the capital expenditure is reduced in the coming years.\n\nFigure 5: Meta's financials recovery following slump in 2022  AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta's core social media business continues to perform well, particularly outside its primary markets, with revenue reaching $36.50 billion, up nearly 20% year over year. Notably, there was an almost 50% increase in revenue from the \"Rest of World\" segment. For 2024, I anticipate 16% year-over-year revenue growth to $156.60 billion, driven by sustained demand for advertising across the Family of Apps and the expansion of business messaging opportunities. Advertising will remain central to Meta's business as online ad demand grows and Facebook maintains its significant market share.\n\nFigure 6: Meta ad revenue by geography AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nDespite increased spending, Meta has significantly improved its operating margins. In the first quarter, the company reported $13.80 billion in operating profit, nearly doubling year over year, with operating margin rising from 25% in the prior year to 38% in the most recent quarter. However, the overall operating margin fell quarter over quarter, impacted by widening losses in the Reality Labs segment and a decline in the Family of Apps segment's operating margin, which constitutes 98.90% of total revenue. The decrease in operating margin is attributed to substantial investments in AI infrastructure.\n\nFor 2024, I expect profit margins to remain relatively flat compared to 2023, as margin expansion driven by strong ad demand will likely be offset by increased losses in Reality Labs and additional short-term investments in the AI roadmap.\n\nFigure 7: Meta's operating margin  AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nMETA Data by GuruFocus\n\nMeta's cash flow remains robust despite continued losses from Reality Labs. The company's annualized free cash flow has surpassed $50 billion, an impressive figure for a company with a market capitalization of nearly $1.20 trillion, equating to an almost 5% FCF yield. This is despite significant capital investments, which amounted to nearly $30 billion in 2023. Meta now projects capital expenditures of $35 billion to $40 billion, up from an earlier estimate of $30 billion to $37 billion. This is considerably higher than the average capex over the previous two years.\n\nIn the long term, I anticipate a reduction in these capital expenditures as the majority of these investments are one-time expenses aimed at building out AI infrastructure. Consequently, Meta's ability to generate cash flows is expected to strengthen significantly once these investments are completed.\n\nFigure 8: Meta's capex AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nSource: Meta Investor Relations\n\nMeta's financial performance underscores its resilience and growth potential, driven by strategic investments in AI and robust revenue growth from its core social media platforms. While current expenditures are high, they are largely one-off investments that will position Meta for stronger cash flow generation and sustained profitability in the long term. Despite some short-term margin pressures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive, making it a compelling investment opportunity.\n\nValuation perspective: Assessing Meta's growth potential\n\nI remain confident that Meta is well-positioned for an upside scenario, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and the 6% increase in average price per ad during the first quarter, despite the seasonal slowdown. Additionally, given its significant advancements with large language models, I believe Meta has a promising future in the AI market. The market seems to agree with this outlook, even after the post-earnings drop. Although current metrics suggest the market already values the stock at a premium for its robust business model, I believe the shares are still undervalued. Trading at about 8 times estimated sales and 24 times estimated earnings, Meta's valuation is lower than its mega-cap rivals by wide margins, yet remains consistent with its peers relative to their growth profiles.\n\nFigure 9: DCF Calculation AI-Driven Growth, Strategic Investments Propel Meta Platforms' Potential\n\nConsidering upside scenario cash flows while maintaining base case valuation assumptionsan 11.10% weighted average cost of capital and an expected earnings per share growth rate of 18.41% (achievable given that the expected 10-year earing per share without NRI growth rate is less than the historical 10-year earnings growth rate of 35.70%)I calculate Meta's margin of safety or upside potential at around 9%, with an intrinsic value of approximately $548.44 per share. This would take the stock to new record levels, which seems likely by year-end considering the upcoming cyclical tailwinds. Additionally, this model does not account for Meta's significant share buyback program. The company is spending tens of billions on share repurchases, which will positively impact the fair value per share. The company has a $50 billion authorized buyback program, enough to cover almost 5% of outstanding shares, potentially completing it in just one and a half years.\n\nConclusion\n\nMeta Platforms is well-positioned for substantial growth, supported by its leadership in social media advertising and strategic investments in AI. Despite some short-term challenges and increased expenditures, the company's long-term outlook remains positive. With robust revenue growth, strong cash flow generation and a significant share buyback program, Meta presents a compelling investment opportunity. The potential upside, driven by AI advancements and cyclical tailwinds, reinforces the company's promising future.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is It Too Late to Buy NVDA Stock?",
        "content": "Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) shares are riding high on the seas of artificial intelligence (AI). The chip designer took an early lead in the AI hardware race, leading to incredible business results and skyrocketing stock prices.\n\nThe stock traded at a split-adjusted $14 per share when OpenAI released the ChatGPT generative AI engine, powered by thousands of Nvidia AI accelerator chips. Today, Nvidia's share price has soared to $131. With a $3.2 trillion market cap, it's one of the three most valuable companies in the stock market.\n\nDid you miss the boat on Nvidia's AI-based opportunity, or can the stock continue to rise from this lofty plateau? Let's find out.\n\nNvidia's upsides\n\nNvidia's financial success is indisputable. Revenues more than tripled year-over-year in the last two earnings reports. Free cash flows are consistently growing by about 500% in the same time frame. Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) are still more profitable than Nvidia, but the chip expert is catching up.\n\nMany market observers like to point out that the generative AI revolution is only getting started. ChatGPT is less than two years old. Only a couple of tech giants have come up with comparably powerful large language models (LLMs) so far, though many are working on their own long-term generative AI plans. Until further notice, Nvidia's accelerator chips are the gold standard against which other solutions must be measured. If you're building a strong AI system, Nvidia's solutions are the default and the industry standard. Others must develop and then prove some sort of unique advantage before winning AI contracts against Nvidia's killer products.\n\nImagine Nvidia maintaining its lead as the generative AI market grows. It's not hard to see the stock soaring even higher over the next few years.\n\nNvidia's potential downsides\n\nOn the other hand, the good financial news and a whole lot of forward-looking expectations are already priced into Nvidia's stock. Shares are changing hands at glossy valuation ratios such as 82 times free cash flow and 40 times sales -- levels usually reserved for small-cap start-ups with more sizzle than substance.\n\nAt the same time, Nvidia doesn't stand unchallenged in the AI accelerator market. Arch rival Advanced Micro Devices(NASDAQ: AMD) has its Instinct line of cost-effective AI chips. The Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) Gaudi series boasts impressive performance per watt of electric power. And that's just the top of a large heap. There's more than one way to design an AI-crunching system, and rival solutions may offer compelling alternatives for specific use cases. Who's to say that Nvidia will hang on to its market-defining lead in the long run?\n\nStory continues\n\nSeparately, the issues of high valuation and strong competition should be enough to give most investors pause before slamming that \"buy\" button on Nvidia stock. Together, it's a high-wire act with a long way down. Nvidia's stock is priced for perfection and any misstep -- such as a major AI contract lost to Intel or AMD -- will probably result in a quick and painful price drop.\n\nShould you buy, sell, or hold Nvidia?\n\nI'm not saying you should sell every Nvidia share right now and never look back. The company could very well stave off the army of rivals and continue to innovate on a hard-to-match level. Indeed, a bit of Nvidia exposure could serve your portfolio well over the years.\n\nMeanwhile, I highly recommend taking some profits off the table by selling a portion of your long-term Nvidia holdings. The gains are more than substantial and I'm sure you can find more stable and secure ways to invest that money in the AI market.\n\nSo on the scale of buy, sell, or hold, I see Nvidia as a stock to hold for the long run. I'd rather sell a few shares than buy more at these nosebleed-inducing share prices. Your mileage may vary, depending on your appetite for market risk and AI-driven excitement. Feel free to do your own research and reach different conclusions. Just don't say I didn't warn you if or when Nvidia's big price correction comes.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "AI arrives in the French Riviera.\n\nThe annual Cannes Lions advertising confab officially kicked off Monday on the sunny beaches and posh backrooms of Cannes, France.\n\nAnd as no surprise, the speed of AI development and innovation was on the tip of the tongue for most advertising and marketing pros Yahoo Finance chatted up. If investors were worried about reaching peak AI amid record high stock prices for Apple (AAPL) and Nvidia (NVDA), this community was having none of it.\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) CMO Don McGuire told me on the Yahoo Speaker Series panel he is seeing \"strong\" preorder demand for Microsoft's (MSFT) new AI Surface tablet and laptop (releasing today). They're powered with Qualcomm's latest AI chip.\n\n\"I think AI will be a great compliment. I think it enables you to scale creativity,\" Spotify's (SPOT) global head of advertising Lee Brown said on Yahoo Finance.\n\nOthers also pushed back on the view that AI will eradicate jobs en masse.\n\nHere's the vibe on AI in the early going at Cannes Lions.\n\nAll together, one gets the sense that AI could unlock new profit streams — either via innovation or lower costs — for public companies in the years to come. And quite possibly, higher stock prices.\n\nDisney President of Global Advertising Rita Ferro\n\n\"We talk a lot about our streaming platform today, and I think you will see a transition to an immersive platform where streaming will underpin the basic core of the reason people come there. But you'll also think about how you interact on your social platforms, how gamification comes into that shopping experience all within one advertising experience.\n\nI use the example of sports because it's easiest, and as we reimagine and we further digitize our sports business, we've talked a lot about ESPN flagship in the last couple of months. But you can imagine a world where a sports fan will come to ESPN and they'll be able to do everything in one platform. Their sports betting opportunity through ESPN Bet, they'll be able to create their fantasy experience there. They'll be able to do shopping, interactivity, simulcast, watch, short form and share content.\" Disney advertising president Rita Ferro (left) shares how AI is going to change the media giant, especially in the business of streaming. Ferro speaks with Yahoo Finance executive editor Brian Sozzi and anchor Rachelle Akuffo at Cannes Lions 2024. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nSpotify Global Head of Advertising Lee Brown\n\n\"AI is not new for us. We've been leveraging it for a long time, obviously with the creation of playlists, personalization and discovery that we've had on the platform for so long ... I think there's just more that's coming.\n\nWe just released last year an AI DJ. Our listeners have responded so well to it. And this week we're releasing a few advertising tools related to AI, mostly around creative and creative assets. And so we have a new AI audio tool coming out that's called Quick Audio that enables you to do quick script generation as well as voiceovers to create an audio asset because so many marketers are looking to bring unbelievable creative and that's one of the biggest barriers to entry for the platform.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nTikTok President of Global Solutions Blake Chandlee\n\n\"We're really excited around avatars. We think it's a huge step forward in the creative process. So we've been working with creators and with brands for a while now to make sure that we're building something that really meets their needs. There's a lot of concerns about the role of avatars versus creative community. And, and the position we're taking is we want to amplify their voice.\n\nToday a creator, when they create a piece of content, they create a single piece of content, then they put that up on the platforms, and they look and see what happens, and they go create another piece of content. We've designed avatars to allow them to create a piece of content and then scale that globally. So you could create it in Spanish or in English, and you can scale it to 30 languages, which immediately gives our creator community the ability to reach audiences they've never been able to reach before.\"\n\nBrian Sozzi is Yahoo Finance's Executive Editor.

        "content": "An unfortunate aspect of the stock market is that certain companies can rapidly gain value as a result of bullish echo chambers. This can lead to a level of hype that sometimes obscures the real value or financial situation of a company. Thus, the result is some overvalued stocks to sell. While there are both objective and subjective ways to value a company, its share price can often come down to something as simple as investor interest or faith.\n\nHowever, investors interested in long-term returns need to avoid stocks that gain their value from conversations. Rather, investors should focus carefully on balance sheets, earnings reports and the metrics derived from them like price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios, EBITDA and cash flow. After all, the numbers may tell a different story than the news.\n\nAnd, while that story may not be 100% the opposite of mainstream attention, it might give clues about timing of a price correction.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nPlacing Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) among overvalued stocks to sell might sound harsh.\n\nHowever, this is a case for investors who want to avoid a potential crash in value. True, Apple is a sweetheart of the modern investing world and one of the Magnificent Seven. Yet, it starts to look small in comparison to the gains of companies like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). Also, AAPL could suffer due to artificial intelligence (AI) hype.\n\nHowever, it’s exactly this kind of energy that Apple is using to draw attention to its stock with its long-awaited announcement of OpenAI’s ChatGPT coming to Siri and its new Apple Intelligence platform. The company’s share price soared around 7% last week on the news. But it remains questionable whether this software integration will make up for lackluster sales growth. In the meantime, leaks of the iPhone 16’s relative similarity to the previous two generations have done little to generate more hype. This clues in a possible decrease in share value before its release.\n\nSuper Micro Computer (SMCI) Smartphone with webpage of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (Supermicro) in front of business logo. Focus on top-left of phone display. Unmodified photo. SMCI stock\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nDespite fervent attention and 200% growth in the last year, Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) might need a closer look. Putting aside its past sales to Iran and Chinese spyware, the company is well into its most recent price correction. And it likely has a ways to go before finding its new floor.\n\nFor starters, the company’s P/E ratio currently sits at around 47.39x at a price of nearly $840. That’s not cheap in the slightest for a company with a relatively narrow approach to the information technology sector. As a specialized provider of data center technology, SMCI is at the mercy of the rest of the industry continuing to go all in on AI. Should both institutional and retail investors begin to sour on the industry’s prospects, SMCI could continue to dip in price.\n\nStory continues\n\nTherefore, investors should sell SMCI while its price is still high before buying back into a correct position.\n\nReddit (RDDT) An iPhone Plus with a Reddit (RDDT) logo on the screen. Reddit IPO\n\nSource: oasisamuel / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) is a newfound member of the New York Stock Exchange as of March 2024. It has a lot to show off since it nearly doubled its valuation since its IPO three months ago. Despite this, the news has focused on Reddit’s deal with OpenAI to allow the company to use Reddit’s vast sea of conversational and informational data for AI training purposes.\n\nWhether or not this approach yields positive results remains uncertain. Yet, it does underscore a factor about Reddit that acts like a double-edged sword. On one hand, people in search of answers rely on search engine results. They may stumble across an old post that helps them. On the other, its niche application and roots in American millennials make it hard to adopt into other countries and cultures.\n\nWhile the stock may be fresh and exciting, it’s certainly difficult to grasp the reason a website platform for public forums and moderated discussion could grow its share value so rapidly. Thus, RDDT stock could be among overvalued stocks to sell.\n\nOn the date of publication, Viktor Zarev did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nViktor Zarev is a scientist, researcher, and writer specializing in explaining the complex world of technology stocks through dedication to accuracy and understanding.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Nvidia Insiders Cash In on Rally as Share Sales Top $700 Million",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Nvidia Corp. insiders have sold shares worth more than $700 million this year as the stock continues to push deeper into record territory amid unrelenting demand for its chips.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas What to Know About the Deadly Flesh-Eating Bacteria Spreading in Japan Ex-Trump Adviser Urges Him to Cut Ties With China, Restart Nuclear Tests\n\nExecutives and directors have unloaded about 770,000 Nvidia shares so far, excluding the effect of the company’s 10-for-1 stock split on June 10 for the sake of comparison. That’s the most in a half year period since the first six months of 2023 when about 848,000 shares were sold, according to data compiled by the Washington Service.\n\nThe dollar value of this year’s share sales dwarfs that of previous periods given the stock’s 164% gain in 2024. That run has been propelled by an arms race among companies to boost computing power, driving up demand for so-called AI accelerator chips, a market dominated by Nvidia.\n\nFor Mark Lehmann, chief executive officer at Citizens JMP Securities, the selling is worth bearing in mind but shouldn’t necessarily set off alarms considering some compensation is paid in stock and there appear to be no signs of slowing demand for the company’s products.\n\n“Anytime you see this kind of wealth being created and the type of market cap being created, I always look for who is coming and going and I have not seen an exodus of the people that got us to this market cap,” he said in an interview. “That would be more concerning.”\n\nThe chipmaker is now the third most valuable company in the world with a market capitalization of about $3.22 trillion, narrowly behind Microsoft Corp. and Apple Inc.\n\nMore than a third of the shares sold this year by insiders have come since Nvidia’s fiscal first quarter earnings report on May 22 when a better-than-expected revenue forecast for the current quarter and the stock split announcement sent the shares soaring anew. Among the biggest sellers have been directors Mark Stevens and Tench Coxe. On Monday, Chief Executive Officer Jensen Huang reported the sale of about $31 million in shares under a pre-arranged trading plan. A representative for Nvidia declined to comment.\n\nWhile there are plenty of insider sellers, there has been a dearth of buyers. Excluding the exercising of options, there hasn’t been an insider stock purchase at Nvidia since Chief Financial Officer Colette Kress bought $107,390 in shares in December 2020, according to Washington Service-compiled data.\n\nStory continues\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe artificial intelligence rally is showing signs of overheating. A further rally in megacap stocks including Nvidia and Broadcom Inc. on Monday helped push the Nasdaq 100 index to a fresh record high. Its 14-day relative strength index — a gauge of price momentum — is now at its most overbought level since 2018, meaning it may be poised for a pullback.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nApple Inc. is shutting down its Pay Later program, which let customers make purchases on an installment plan, marking a retreat from efforts to offer more financial services in-house. Terry Gou, the billionaire founder of iPhone assembler Foxconn Technology Group, has finally reached a goal that had eluded him for about eight years. The US Federal Trade Commission sued Adobe Inc., alleging the software company violated consumer protection laws by making it too difficult for consumers to cancel their subscriptions. Huawei Technologies Co. is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its Harmony mobile operating system, underscoring its growing confidence in competing with Apple Inc. in the world’s largest smartphone arena. CuspAI, a UK startup that makes algorithms for designing new materials, raised $30 million in its initial funding round and has recruited artificial intelligence pioneer Geoffrey Hinton to its advisory board.\n\nEarnings Due Tuesday\n\nPremarket\n\nComtech Telecom\n\n--With assistance from Jan-Patrick Barnert and Subrat Patnaik.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Coke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "title": "3 Top Stocks I'd Buy Today and Hold Forever Without Any Hesitation",
        "content": "Buying a stock with the intention of never selling it, or perhaps only selling it in a few decades, requires a level of conviction that most investments simply don't warrant. It's not enough to believe that a business is doing well today, or that its management team right now is doing an effective job.\n\nWhat's necessary is a rock-solid business model that's already withstood different turns of the market and different economic regimes. Here are three stocks that I'm comfortable buying today and holding until retirement at the very earliest.\n\n1. Vertex Pharmaceuticals\n\nWhile I don't own Vertex Pharmaceuticals (NASDAQ: VRTX), I'd be willing to buy it right now and then hold it forever if I had capital to spare.\n\nInvesting in Vertex means getting exposure to the upside from its research and development (R&D) programs, which is largely true for most pharmaceutical companies. The thing that makes Vertex different is that it has a lock on the market for cystic fibrosis (CF) therapies as a result of improving those therapies again and again over the course of years.\n\nRather than allow its market share to be eaten by generic medicines, the company is constantly advancing its candidates through clinical trials such that it has a new drug for CF coming out on a regular basis. Most of its CF medicines are now combinations of its previously commercialized medications, some of which are paired with newer molecules that are more effective. In the first quarter, sales of those drugs brought in nearly $2.7 billion, up 13% from a year prior.\n\nBecause other drugmakers lack a presence in the CF market, it's essentially Vertex's home territory. With such a deep understanding of CF, and plenty of medicines bringing in steady revenue from patients who need them on a perpetual basis, the business thus has extra income to devote to riskier forays into other markets.\n\nAnd that process serves as an insurance policy to guarantee the future growth of the business, which is another reason to be bullish.\n\n2. Costco Wholesale\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ: COST) makes up a large proportion of my portfolio, and I plan to keep adding to my position for at least the next two decades, assuming my investing thesis remains valid.\n\nThere are a lot of quantitative arguments for why Costco is a smart stock to buy and hold, most of which boil down to this chart: COST Net Income (TTM) Chart\n\nAs you can see, its trailing-12-month net income, which is currently $6.8 billion, has grown consistently, and more or less without interruption, for the company's entire tenure as a public entity. This is the kind of performance that Warren Buffett dreams of. It's all made possible by a dead-simple business model wherein Costco sells groceries and consumer goods in bulk at a very narrow profit to members, who pay for the right to shop at its warehouses.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut steady earnings growth doesn't occur in a vacuum. Costco is a rare business because it does right by its customers, its employees, and its shareholders.\n\nCustomers get low prices, membership benefits, and excellent customer service. Employees are better compensated than they would be at other retailers, and as the company prefers to promote from within, they tend to stick around and provide their experience for the long haul in progressively more important roles. And shareholders get a regular and steadily rising dividend, plenty of share repurchases, as well as a fat special dividend payout once every few years.\n\nWhat's not to like?\n\n3. Apple\n\nApple (NASDAQ: AAPL) is the last stock I'm willing to continue buying and holding for years and years.\n\nThe thesis for Apple is that its collection of revenue streams from its phones, tablets, computers, cloud services, and apps will continue to power the company's growth, as customers tend to become loyal and buy from it again and again.\n\nAlthough it's true that Apple products tend to be priced at a premium, that clearly hasn't been a major barrier to adoption for its iPhones or its Macs. Much like Costco, it has a history of steadily hiking its dividend, pursuing extensive share buybacks, and consistently adding to its earnings.\n\nApple's trailing-12-month net income is $100.4 billion, up 160% from 10 years ago. It has plenty of growth opportunities and tailwinds to keep the party going for years to come.\n\nFor one, it hasn't even begun to delve into implementing artificial intelligence (AI) in its products or operations in a serious way -- but, per its recent announcement regarding a collaboration with OpenAI, it soon will. Then, once it has captured billions in value from that, it will move on to the next thing, perhaps related to its augmented reality (AR) Apple Vision ecosystem.\n\nAnd it's that process of product innovation and capturing value for years afterward that gives me the confidence that the company will be around, and profitable to hold, for the foreseeable future and also beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vertex Pharmaceuticals right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vertex Pharmaceuticals, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vertex Pharmaceuticals wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "AAPL Picking: 3 Stocks to Buy Because of Their Apple Partnerships",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been one of the most remarkable investment success stories in the tech world over the past couple of decades. Yet, despite its behemoth status, Apple’s success is heavily reliant on a network of partners and suppliers. In fact, numerous external companies play crucial roles in powering Apple’s ecosystem. And, they inherently reap the benefits of Apple’s success through their collaboration.\n\nMore specifically, Apple conducts the majority of its research and development and in-house production. Also, it depends on third-party suppliers for necessary parts, cutting-edge technologies and other critical services.\n\nI can’t stress enough that these partnerships are indispensable. Without them, it’s safe to say that Apple’s flagship products, such as iPhones, iPads, MacBooks and Apple Watches, wouldn’t have achieved their remarkable success. Accordingly, as Apple keeps innovating and expanding its product lines, its partners are increasingly poised to grow in tandem.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s explore how Apple’s key partners are also set to reap substantial benefits.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne key partner benefiting from its close ties with Apple is Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). Broadcom plays a pivotal role in Apple’s supply chain by providing crucial semiconductor solutions that power pretty much every Apple device. From iPhones to iPads and Macs, Broadcom’s chips are indispensable. They enable Wi-Fi and Bluetooth connectivity, thus cementing Broadcom’s position as a vital partner for Apple.\n\nAnd, because of AVGO’s strategic partnership with AAPL, the company enjoys quite predictable cash flows. Since most device manufacturers utilize its connectivity solutions, Broadcom operates on a backlog basis in order to serve all of its customers. Therefore, its revenues tend to consistently grow over time despite the electronic devices industry itself being highly cyclical.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) advancements are likely to drive a new super cycle of electronic device sales. These include Apple rolling out Apple Intelligence along with iPhone 16. Thus, it seems that Broadcom remains well positioned for continued top and bottom-line growth. This catalyst should keep fueling its bullish case moving forward.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother significant company that powers Apple’s devices is Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSMC). The Taiwan-based semiconductor foundry giant is the primary manufacturer of Apple’s custom-designed chips. This includes the mighty A-series processors found in iPhones, iPads and the M-series chips powering Macs.\n\nStory continues\n\nInterestingly, Apple’s shift toward custom silicon has further strengthened TSMs’ already monopolistic position in the semiconductor industry. As the exclusive producer of Apple’s advanced chips, TSM has benefited tremendously in recent years. TSM’s role appears irreplaceable. It essentially runs a monopoly in the semiconductor foundry industry. Further, its revenues have risen at a rapid compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 13.7% over the past decade.\n\nTherefore, as Apple expands its product lineup and enhances chip performance, TSM’s expertise in advanced semiconductor manufacturing ensures it remains a critical partner in Apple’s supply chain.\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last pick on my list is Corning (NYSE:GLW). The specialty materials company plays an essential role in Apple’s product lineup. It supplies Gorilla Glass, the durable cover glass used in almost all of Apple’s devices with a screen.\n\nGiven Corning’s expertise in glass technology, I don’t think Apple is about to find another partner to replace Corning anytime soon. Therefore, Corning’s financials are likely to keep benefiting, especially with the iPhone 16 release potentially coinciding with a smartphone supercycle.\n\nEvidently, despite an 11.3% decline in Corning’s revenues to $12.6 billion last year due to weakened global smartphone sales, Wall Street remains optimistic about a robust recovery ahead. In particular, consensus estimates suggest revenues could rebound to about $14.0 billion and $14.8 billion in fiscal years 2024 and 2025, respectively. This aligns with industry-wide expectations of a new smartphone super cycle.\n\nAn interesting aspect of Corning’s investment case is that the stock could be a compelling dividend growth pick. The company has already increased its dividend for 13 consecutive years, while shares are currently attached to a dividend yield of 3%. While the dividend has grown at a rather modest CAGR of 5.3% over the past three years, dividend growth could re-accelerate, with sales expected to rebound notably in the coming years.\n\nOn the date of publication, Nikolaos Sismanis did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Asia is, of course, an incredibly vast continent. But most of the Asian companies in which Americans can and should invest are based in either China or India. Since the coronavirus pandemic, the Chinese economy has been stuck in a deep slump. And though it still has major problems, including a very weak real estate market, it is showing signs of rebounding.\n\nFor example, last month the country’s retail sales rose 3.7% versus May 2023 while its industrial production advanced 5.6% year-over-year. For its part, the Indian economy, boosted by the opening of many factories that have relocated from China, grew at a blistering 8.2% above inflation during its fiscal year that ended in March 2024. And the country’s central bank expects the economy to expand at a fast pace of 7.2% during the current fiscal year, up from its previous estimate of 7% growth.\n\nWith China’s economy showing signs of recovery and India looking like the “next big thing” from an investing standpoint, here are the three best Asian stocks to buy now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWisdomTree India Earnings Fund (EPI)\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nNot only is India’s economy growing at an extremely rapid pace but foreigners are investing large amounts into the country. As of May 11, U.S.-based ETFs that invest in Indian stocks benefited from almost $2.7 billion of net inflows since the beginning of the year. That trend paused briefly earlier this month amid doubts about whether Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi would be reelected. But after it became clear he would remain in office, the pattern resumed, with foreign investors buying $985.5 million of Indian stocks on June 7 and June 10, according to Bloomberg.\n\nAmong the key beneficiaries of foreign interest in Indian stocks has been The WisdomTree India Earnings Fund (NYSEARCA:EPI). Shares climbed 12% in the last three months and it should continue to advance as optimism about the Asian country’s economy increases.\n\nThe WisdomTree India Earnings Fund’s holdings are very diversified. Financial services companies account for 21.8% of its holdings while basic materials firms weigh in at 13.4%. Technology stands at 10.5% and industrials are at 9.6%.\n\nGiven the ETF’s well-diversified exposure to the rapidly growing Indian economy, it is one of the best Asian stocks to buy.\n\nMakeMyTrip (MMYT) A photo of an excited woman riding on the back of a bike a man is driving.\n\nSource: OPOLJA / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading Indian online travel agency MakeMyTrip (NASDAQ:MMYT), boosted by India’s rapidly expanding middle class, continued to grow very rapidly and quickly increase its profits.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast quarter its top line jumped 36.6% versus the same period a year earlier to $148.5 million, while operating profits, excluding certain items, soared 70.4% year-over-year to $19.03 million. For all of fiscal 2024, the company’s adjusted operating profit came in at a brisk $124 million, up from $70 million during the prior year.\n\nThe company is benefiting from the trend of increasing disposable income among Indians, spurred by the country’s strong economic growth, CEO Rajesh Magow reported last month. The company is also getting a big lift from an increasing desire by tourists to view India’s spiritual landmarks, Magow noted. Over the last two years, searches for spiritual destination on the company’s platform have nearly doubled, he stated.\n\nPDD Holdings (PDD) Orange Temu logo on smartphone with orange background behind it also displaying Temu logo, representing Temu, PDD Holdings and PDD stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Markus Mainka\n\nChinese e-commerce company PDD Holdings (NASDAQ:PDD) is continuing to grow incredibly rapidly, driven largely by the market share gains of its Temu marketplace. Temu caters to foreign consumers and its share of the U.S. retail market had reached a very impressive total of 17% in April.\n\nThe company’s prices tend to be cheaper than Amazon’s (NASDAQ:AMZN) and it became the top overall shopping app on Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) app store.\n\nIn Q1, PDD’s revenue soared 131% versus the same period a year earlier to $12 billion, while its operating profit jumped an incredible 275% year=-ver-year to $3.6 billion.\n\nOn May 24, Goldman Sachs responded to the firm’s Q1 results by upgrading PDD stock to “buy” from “neutral.” The bank reported that the company is benefiting from rising ad revenue along with the increased profitability of Temu. Goldman placed a $184 price target on PDD stock, well above the shares’ current price of around $150.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in EPI.

        "title": "AI enthusiasm prompts 3 Wall Street banks to raise stock market forecasts",
        "content": "The excitement surrounding artificial intelligence has yet to run its course on Wall Street.\n\nThree analysts recently upgraded their forecasts for the S&P 500 (^GSPC) amid early signs that investments in generative AI are driving earnings growth at large-cap tech companies.\n\nOn Sunday, Evercore ISI's Julian Emanuel boosted his year-end price target for the S&P 500 to 6,000 from 4,750, noting the \"AI revolution is in the early innings.\" Emanuel's target is the highest on Wall Street.\n\nGoldman Sachs' equity strategy team boosted its year-end target to 5,600 from 5,200 on Friday. Goldman highlighted that increasing earnings expectations for Alphabet (GOOGL, GOOG), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN), Meta (META), and Nvidia (NVDA) have \"offset the typical pattern of negative revisions to consensus EPS estimates.\"\n\n\"We underappreciated the degree to which those earnings would lift those few stocks and the degree to which those few stocks would drive the rest of the market, and that's basically what we're adjusting for,\" Goldman Sachs equity strategist Ben Snider told Yahoo Finance.\n\nCiti's equity strategy team, led by Scott Chronert, struck a similar tone, boosting its end target to 5,600 from 5,100 on Monday. The analysts noted that the market would have trended toward their prior target had it not been for outsized performance from large-cap tech.\n\n\"The generative AI influence as an ongoing incremental growth driver is permeating the US equity environment right now,\" Chronert wrote.\n\nMore than two-thirds of the S&P 500's nearly 15% gain this year is attributed to the \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks: Tesla (TSLA), Apple (AAPL), Alphabet, Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Nvidia, according to Citi.\n\nIf this \"megacap exceptionalism\" continues, Goldman's model shows the S&P 500 could end the year at 6,300. This would likely come from \"continued revenue beats from those companies relative to what analysts expect.\"\n\nBarclays head US equity strategist Venu Krishna currently holds a 5,300 call on the S&P 500 but also noted that continued outperformance from tech provides upside risk to his target and could result in a bull-case scenario with the S&P 500 ending the year above 6,000.\n\nKrishna told Yahoo Finance that he's been asked for more than a year whether a small group of stocks can continue to drive the market higher.\n\n\"The answer is yes, it is possible,\" Krishna said. \"We are in that environment.\" A sign for a Nvidia building is shown in Santa Clara, Calif., May 31, 2023. (AP Photo/Jeff Chiu, File) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\nMarket concentration\n\nThe top-heavy market has some concerned that the rally is too narrow. However, strategists say this shouldn't deter investors.\n\nStory continues\n\nSnider noted it's important for investors to remember that if the trend of large-cap tech leading the S&P 500 higher continues, a narrow rally with only a few stocks leading the market higher is a feature, not a bug, of the benchmark index.\n\n\"This is part of the beauty of the S&P 500 ... When a few companies perform really well, they can drag up the whole index,\" Snider said. \"And we're seeing that right now.\"\n\nThere is also risk AI enthusiasm has driven stock valuations too high. JPMorgan chief market strategist Marko Kolanovic, who has stuck by Wall Street's most bearish year-end S&P 500 target of 4,200, noted on June 3 that equity valuations are \"rich\" while sentiment is \"near highs.\"\n\nAnd Kolanovic has a point. Emanuel at Evercore ISI pointed out that with the S&P 500 trading above 20 times its forward earnings estimates, the index is \"expensive\" on a historical basis. But what sticks out to Emanuel is how long stocks can stay at those levels.\n\nThe S&P 500's forward price-to-earnings ratio crossed 20 143 days ago, per Emanuel. In the 2021 economic reopening frenzy, the S&P 500 traded at similar valuation levels for 614 days. During the dot-com boom, the S&P 500 lasted at those levels for 737 days.\n\nEmanuel notes this shows that \"high valuations can remain higher for longer.\" And with that could come further returns.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "3 EV Stocks to Sell in June Before They Crash &amp; Burn",
        "content": "Electric vehicles (EV) aren’t going away but they aren’t the growth industry they once were. Year-over-year sales are dramatically slowing with first-quarter sales rising just 2.6% from 2023. EVs accounted for 7.3% of all new-vehicle sales in the period, down from the fourth quarter, according to Kelley Blue Book. It was the first quarter-to-quarter decline since the pandemic.\n\nTo put it in perspective, first-quarter 2023 sales had soared 46% from the prior year, which itself had been over 81% higher than in 2021. What it indicates is the market has reached a plateau.\n\nAll the early adopters of the technology have purchased a car. The task now is to convince the vast remaining mass market they should also buy one. It won’t be easy. Although prices have trended lower, EV costs remain elevated over alternatives.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe average price of a new gas-powered vehicle in May costs $48,389, down 1.2% from last year. For EVs, the average cost was $56,648 an increase of 2.6% from the month before. Even factoring in potential tax credits, EVs cost more.\n\nWhile the EV industry is quickly resolving the range problem of batteries, buyers are still wary of the lack of infrastructure to support charging a vehicle. Drivers need to carefully map their route and allow sufficient time to top up their battery bank, which isn’t a consideration with gas vehicles. It’s one of the reasons hybrid cars are becoming the EV vehicle of choice. You can go partially green without worrying about getting stranded.\n\nThat suggests a shakeout in EVs is coming. Some manufacturers like hyper luxury EV maker Faraday Future Intelligent Electric (NASDAQ:FFIE) seem destined for bankruptcy. Others will just limp along. Buyouts don’t seem likely as everyone’s technology is proprietary and not easily integrated into a competitor’s platform.\n\nInvestors would be best-served avoiding most EV stocks. The three companies below are EV stocks to sell now before they crash and burn.\n\nRivian Automotive (RIVN) Rivian (RIVN) All Electric R1T Pickup Truck in a forest green color\n\nSource: Roschetzky Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nElectric SUV maker Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) has been the beneficiary of positive analyst chatter and speculation it might partner with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). Neither is enough to sustain Rivian stock because they don’t pertain to its core business of selling cars. Wall Street thinks it might be able to sell its software to others and the Apple rumor is just that, rumor. It might not amount to anything more than Rivian’s EVs getting Apple CarPlay.\n\nThe EV maker’s car-selling business is a shambles. It reportedly loses $38,000 on each vehicle made. Even though revenue doubled to $1.2 billion, losses widened from the year-ago period. Yet because Rivian has $6.8 billion in cash, equivalents and short-term investments, I wouldn’t short the stock. The SUV maker is not going out of business tomorrow. But its long-term growth is doubtful amid a dramatically slowing market.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhen Ford (NYSE:F) announced it was cutting the price on its Lightning F-150 electric pickup, Rivian shares tumbled because it will pressure sales and margins. Despite management maintaining it will achieve gross profits in the fourth quarter that does not improve the overall weakness in its business.\n\nLucid Group (LCID) Lucid Air car of Lucid Automotive (LCID) Manufacturer at the event, EV Lucid Car Showroom.\n\nSource: Khosro / Shutterstock.com\n\nLucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID) is an example of what is wrong in the EV industry. It is selling luxury EVs that by definition greatly narrows its potential car-buying market. With its EVs starting at just under $70,000 Lucid is going to be hard-pressed to move many off dealer lots.\n\nThere is already a massive backlog of unsold inventory that needs to be moved before dealers can or will accept new models. It previously had to cut prices to see just a modest bump in sales last quarter but still has thousands more to go.\n\nThat means Lucid will continue reporting massive losses from operations. It reported over $680 million in first-quarter losses last month. That might have been slightly better than the $780 million it recorded a year ago but still means it is on track to lose billions of dollars this year.\n\nYet Lucid Group is another EV stock to sell, not short. It has a pipeline of cash from the Saudi Arabian government that keeps it afloat. While the Public Investment Fund shoveling billions of dollars into Rivian means the EV maker won’t go under, it is not enough to prop up the stock as the underlying operations deteriorate.\n\nLiveWire Group (LVWR) The LiveWire electric motorcycle representing LVWR stock.\n\nSource: MaggioPH / Shutterstock.com\n\nLiveWire Group (NYSE:LVWR) is the third EV stock to sell. The electric motorcycle maker is arguably the most successful of the three stocks but EV two-wheelers are even more of a niche market than luxury EVs.\n\nThe Harley-Davidson (NYSE:HOG) spinoff saw sales plummet 36% in the first quarter to $5 million while operating losses widened 22% to $30 million. That was despite an 86% increase in the number of units sold, which rose to 117 from 63. Its youth-oriented STACYC business saw a 41% drop in revenue to $3.7 million.\n\nManagement maintains it will sell 1,000 to 1,500 electric motorcycles this year. It is a far cry from the 101,000 bikes it said it would sell by 2030 just two years ago. But these motorcycles are primarily good only for city driving. Their batteries have a claimed range of 146 miles city and 95 miles highway. You’re not going to be doing the kind of cruising you might enjoy when riding your Hog.\n\nThe LiveWire One also starts at under $23,000. That’s more competitive than it used to be, as you can easily find a Harley for twice that amount, but Harley also sells cruisers beginning at $17,000 and adventure touring bikes beginning at $20,000. So even though we’re in prime motorcycle sales season, there won’t be many EV bikes moving. It makes LiveWire an EV stock to sell now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Sales were “driven by improved UK trading and continued progress in Germany.”\n\nIts Premier Inn business in Germany reported a 15% increase in total sales.\n\nDominic Paul, chief executive of the hospitality group, said: “Whilst the normal booking pattern means our forward visibility remains limited, our forward booked position is positive and we remain confident in the full-year outlook.\n\n“This reflects a more encouraging trading performance in the UK, our strong commercial programme and increased cost efficiencies, as well as good progress in Germany.”\n\nPaul added that Whitbread is on track with the programme to restructure its food and beverage business announced earlier this year, which will close or convert more than 200 restaurants and cut about 1,500 jobs.\n\nIts £150m share buyback is on track, he said, with 3.2m shares purchased so far for £96m.\n\nWatch:Why a popular tech ETF is set to sell Apple and buy Nvidia<a data-i13n=\\\"cpos:1;pos:1\\\" href=\\\"https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/XLK\\\">XLK</a>) may be on the verge of a rebalancing due to concerns over market concentration.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Huawei Technologies Co. is considering taking a cut of in-app purchases on its Harmony mobile operating system, underscoring its growing confidence in competing with Apple Inc. in the world’s largest smartphone arena.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan S&P 500 Hits 30th Record of 2024 as Megacaps Rally: Markets Wrap These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid\n\nThe Shenzhen-based company is weighing a commission lower than the typical 30% cut that Apple and Alphabet Inc.’s Google take for payments made via their mobile stores for things like apps, games, movies and music subscriptions, according to people familiar with the matter. Huawei has kept Harmony OS fee-free until now, as an enticement to bring developers and publishers on board.\n\nFor games in particular, which account for the majority of mobile app store revenue, Huawei has been discussing a fee of about 20% with developers, the people said. They asked not to be identified as the information is private. Rival Android store operators in China, such as Xiaomi Corp., charge as much as 50% on in-game purchases. Huawei has not yet made a final decision and its plans could still change, according to the people.\n\nHuawei’s imminent move suggests the Chinese tech conglomerate feels it has grown its user and developer base to the point where it can begin collecting rent. The company shifted to its in-house Harmony OS after US sanctions cut it off from working with Google, the proprietor of Android.\n\nA company spokesperson did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nThe envisioned commissions would still place Huawei’s 4-year-old Harmony ecosystem below market competitors. The company has to convince both users and app makers to embrace its third option, after Apple’s iPhone software and Google’s Android, though it has made strong progress over the past year with its return to prominence in China’s premium market.\n\nHuawei has seen increased demand for its 5G smartphones after it released the Mate 60 Pro with an advanced China-made chip last year. Its net profit rose 564% in the first quarter as it took market share from Apple and others. Its Harmony OS also overtook iOS in terms of market share in China in the January-March period, according to Counterpoint Research.\n\n--With assistance from Jessica Sui, Zheping Huang and Ben Scent.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nStory continues\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump’s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn Coke—and Dozens of Others—Pledged to Quit Russia.

        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were broadly flat on Tuesday following a rally on Wall Street in the previous session that brought the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite up to new record-high closing levels. Monthly retail sales figures are due to be a key focus for investors, as they attempt to assess the state of the U.S. economy. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) begins a legal fight in Delaware over CEO Elon Musk's historic $56 billion pay package after the electric vehicle group's shareholders widely backed the compensation deal last week.\n\n1. Futures broadly flat\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Tuesday, as traders prepared for the release of key retail sales data.\n\nBy 03:13 ET (07:13 GMT), the Dow futures contract had edged higher by 30 points or 0.1%, while the S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were both widely unchanged.\n\nThe main averages on Wall Street jumped in the prior session, with the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite posting fresh record closing highs. Sentiment was boosted by analysts at Goldman Sachs and Evercore ISI both raising their year-end targets for the S&P 500.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) extended a rally that began last week after the iPhone-maker unveiled a raft of artificial intelligence-enhanced features at its annual developers conference.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philadelphia SE Semiconductor index, which tracks shares of chipmaking firms, touched an all-time peak, reflecting ongoing enthusiasm around the applications of AI. U.S.-listed shares in Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company -- the world's biggest contract chip supplier -- climbed 5.4%, while memory chip company Micron (NASDAQ:MU) also advanced following price-target upgrades by brokerages.\n\n2. Retail sales ahead\n\nThe momentum of U.S. consumer spending is projected to have sped up in May, pointing to resilience in a crucial section of the American economy.\n\nEconomists expect that retail sales grew by 0.3% on a month-on-month basis. The number would be an acceleration from 0.0% in April, when expenditures on many goods were tempered by elevated gasoline prices.\n\nDespite facing headwinds from sticky inflation and a steep uptick in interest rates, U.S. sales have largely remained strong thanks in part to a solid labor market. Consumers have chosen to focus much of their spending on essential items in response to these pressures, foregoing many purchases on pricier luxury goods.\n\nThe data may provide more insight into the state of the overall economy, which could impact how the Federal Reserve approaches potential interest rate reductions later this year.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn Monday, Philadephia Fed President Patrick Harker backed one 25-basis point cut in 2024, citing signs of easing but above-trend economic activity, some slackening in labor demand, and an ongoing slowdown in inflation. His comments echoed a median rate forecast for the rest of the year that was released by policymakers on Wednesday.\n\n3. Tesla opens legal fight in Delaware to reinstate Musk pay package\n\nTesla has initiated its battle for legal recognition of Chief Executive Elon Musk's massive $56 billion pay package after the electric carmaking giant's shareholders voted in favor of the compensation agreement.\n\nDelaware judge Kathaleen McCormick (NYSE:MKC) previously voided the pay earlier this year, calling the amount -- a record in U.S. corporate history -- \"unfathomable\" and raising doubts around the independence of the company's board.\n\nBut Musk's deal, as well as a plan to reincorporate Tesla in Texas from Delaware, received the support of 77% of the shareholder votes cast last week, according to a regulatory filing.\n\nIn a letter made available to the public on Monday, Tesla attorneys argued that the shareholder decision \"significantly impacts\" McCormick's prior ruling.\n\nHowever, Greg Varallo, a shareholder attorney against the pay package, said the ratification had \"no legal effect\" on the case, Reuters reported.\n\n4. Apple scraps \"buy now, pay later\" scheme\n\nApple has scrapped its \"buy now, pay later\" (BNPL) service in the U.S., bringing an end to the offering only a little over a year after it was first announced.\n\nThe California-based group's \"Apple Pay Later\" allowed users to purchase items in installments, rather than buying them in one up-front sum. The move, which was initially unveiled last March, was viewed as a push by Apple into a financial services space dominated by companies like Klarna and Affirm.\n\nBut Apple said it was now focusing on providing access to installment loans through third-party credit, debit cards and lenders. Apple said \"the solution will enable us to bring flexible payments to more users, in more places across the globe.\"\n\nCustomers with open loans on Apple's BNPL service will still be able to manage and pay for them via its Wallet app, the company said.\n\n5. Oil dips\n\nCrude prices edged lower Tuesday, handing back some of the previous session’s gains, as the global demand outlook remains uncertain amid plentiful supply.\n\nBy 03:11 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.2% lower at $79.56 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.2% to $84.09 a barrel. Both benchmarks added around 2% on Monday, closing at their highest since April.\n\nData released earlier this week showed that China, the world’s largest crude importer, was struggling to produce a solid economic recovery. Meanwhile, worries persist that the U.S. economy's prolonged exposure to high interest rates could weigh on crude demand in the world's biggest oil consumer.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nRetail sales ahead, Tesla's legal fight over Musk pay deal - what's moving markets\n\nAustralia's central bank stays the course on rates, alert to inflation risks\n\nUkraine's international bond rework derailed as deadline nears\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Big Reshuffle of $71 Billion ETF Looms as Nvidia Surpasses Apple",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- One of the world’s most prominent technology ETFs looks poised for a big rebalancing that would ramp up exposure to Nvidia Corp. at the expense of Apple Inc. – spurring billions of dollars in trading volume in one fell swoop.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nFlesh-Eating Bacteria That Can Kill in Two Days Spreads in Japan How the US Mopped Up a Third of Global Capital Flows Since Covid These Are the World’s Most Expensive Cities for Expats in 2024 Hedge Funds’ Secret Weapon to Fight the SEC Lives in Texas S&P 500 Set for Fresh Highs Amid Rally in Big Tech: Markets Wrap\n\nBarring an 11th-hour deviation from the methodology set out by index provider S&P Dow Jones Indices, State Street Global Advisors is on track to revamp the composition of its $71 billion Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund (ticker XLK) after Nvidia’s market value closed above Apple on Friday.\n\nFor months, XLK has held way fewer Nvidia shares even as the AI giant soared 166% year-to-date. When the chipmaker ranked in third place, it made up roughly 6% of the ETF’s assets, compared with 22% in the S&P 500 Information Technology Index. The ownership cap, imposed under diversification rules, has caused XLK to underperform massively this year.\n\nWhile S&P in theory reserves the right to make an exception, industry participants say the ETF is on track to be re-tooled when it enacts the quarterly rebalance near the end of June.\n\nOn that basis, Apple and Nvidia are set to reverse their positions in the ETF with the former’s weight dropping to 4.5% and the latter rising above 20%, according to calculations sent by the index provider to three market participants familiar with the matter.\n\nState Street stands to purchase $11 billion of Nvidia shares and dump $12 billion of Apple, one estimate shows. That’s not insignificant — the forecast sale in Apple shares is equal to the average daily trading value in the past three months.\n\n“By our calculation, the flip-flop between Nvidia and Apple will occur,” said Chris Harvey, head of equity strategy at Wells Fargo Securities. “This aligns the XLK ETF more closely with the momentum trade and semis. At the margin, it’s more dollars chasing a stock that does not need any additional help.”\n\nA spokesperson for S&P declined to comment on potential index changes and referred Bloomberg News to the methodology.\n\nMatt Bartolini, head of SPDR Americas Research at State Street, said XLK will rebalance according to its rules and the methodology. The ETF is obliged to track the S&P benchmark that is designed to stay in compliance with the diversification regulations.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe rules “have served investors well,” he said.\n\nS&P has left the door open to making an exception when it unveils sector weightings at the end of the month, judging by a document sent late last week and seen by Bloomberg News.\n\nThe index committee “reserves the right to make exceptions when applying the methodology if the need arises,” S&P wrote in a note regarding the June rebalance. “In any scenario where the treatment differs from the general rules stated in this document or supplemental documents, clients will receive notice, whenever possible.”\n\nS&P said it will send clients so-called proforma documents related to the rebalance for sector indexes each day through Friday.\n\nAny last-minute deviation from the public methodology would not be taken well by traders, who tend to take positions in anticipation of possible revisions in index rebalances like this. While it’s getting crowded, buying stocks that are entering major indexes and selling those that are exiting them has become one of the most reliable strategies for the hedge fund world.\n\nUnderpinning the massive adjustments in the duo’s weightings in the ETF are diversification rules dating back more than 80 years that were established to safeguard investors from concentrated bets. Under those rules, the combined representation of the largest companies — those making up roughly 5% or more of a diversified fund — can’t add up to more than 50%.\n\nSimilar restrictions last year spurred the overseer of the Nasdaq 100 to conduct a special rebalance to keep index-tracking funds in compliance with the rules. When this rule is breached, indexes such as the Nasdaq 100 tend to trim the top holdings proportionally. XLK’s methodology works differently. When a number of stocks are not in compliance, the smallest of those gets clipped.\n\nThis unique rule is why Nvidia has been massively under-owned by XLK, leading the fund to trail the traditional S&P 500 tech sub-index by more than 5 percentage points this quarter — the widest dispersion since 2001.\n\nWith the semiconductor pioneer catching up to Apple and Microsoft Corp. in size during recent weeks, XLK’s upcoming rebalances have garnered Wall Street interest given the prospect of volatility-inducing weight additions and reductions to some of the world’s most closely watched tech companies.\n\n“I am interested to see if they keep the rules the same through the next rebalance in September,” said James Seyffart, ETF analyst at Bloomberg Intelligence. “If Apple manages to surpass Nvidia or Microsoft by the next rebalance reference date — which is September 13th — we could have a mirror image massive rebalance where Apple is bought to the tune of billions and Nvidia or Apple are sold to the tune of billions.”\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nGoogle DeepMind Shifts From Research Lab to AI Product Factory Online Shopping Has Become a Giant Fake Product Machine Trump’s Planned Tariffs Would Tax US Households, Economists Warn Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy It Will Take More Than US Bargaining Power to Cut Drug Costs\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "What do Analysts Say about Apple Inc. (AAPL)’s AI Potential?",
        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds.In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hardware stocks.\n\nWith the first half of 2024 nearly over, artificial intelligence continues to play a dominant role in the stock market. Stocks that either design semiconductors that are used for AI applications, or those that use them to either streamline their internal operations such as coding or offer products to customers have also made significant gains. These show the optimism in Wall Street for accelerated computing technologies, which are collectively called artificial intelligence.\n\nIn fact, the impact of AI has been so strong that not only has it upended the status quo of the most valuable firms in terms of market capitalization, but it also allowed some of the top AI companies to post triple digit percentage share price returns over the course of the past twelve months. Some of the top performing AI stocks are up by 213% over the past twelve months and have appreciated by 773% since November 2022. Back then, the stock market was whimpering in the aftermath of rapid interest rate hikes by the Federal Reserve, which had hit technology stocks particularly hard since they benefit from a fast growth and low rate environment.\n\nHowever, AI's impact on the stock market has fueled the triple digit percentage gains in some stocks since then. At the same time, it has also meant that major indexes continue to demonstrate robust performance that is fueled by the share price performance of mega cap technology stocks.\n\nIn 2024, the market has moved forward from investing in AI companies that can change the world with their hardware or software to evaluating whether these firms are delivering. The first quarter of the 2024 earnings season was the clearest example of this phenomenon, and it saw Wall Street take an unforgiving approach to large and small firms that presented even the slightest hint of being unable to either grow their revenues by targeting AI or control the costs of investing in the new technologies.\n\nWithin the AI industry, there are different categories of firms. Most of these, such as OpenAI, operate on the software side. This industry subsegment develops applications such as chat bots and other assistants along with expanding the use of AI to existing software such as image editing tools. AI hardware companies power these applications, and when compared to the software firms, not only do they command stable valuations, but they also see investors take comfort in the fact that the demand for their products is far more stable and predictable when compared to software demand. Recently Goldman Sachs published a bullish report on hardware stocks due to AI, which we covered in 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman. In this article we are going to approach the same theme from a different angle and there are vast differences between both rankings of hardware stocks.\n\nStory continues\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top hedge fund hardware stock picks, we ranked personal computing, semiconductor, and computer hardware by the number of hedge funds that had bought the shares in Q1 2024. Out of these, the stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors were selected. Basically our article listed the best hardware stocks to buy according to the 900+ equity hedge funds tracked by Insider Monkey. Why do we care about what hedge funds do? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 150\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the world's biggest consumer technology company. Despite its limited actions on the front, Apple has been seeing a lot of coverage for its potential AI initiatives. Most of these have covered its Siri virtual assistant, and some quarters expect an AI revamp for Siri. The average of 39 one year analyst share price targets for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares is $204.31 and the stock is rated Buy on average. Well known Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) analyst Gene Munster shared optimism for Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s AI potential recently when he shared that the market was in \"denial\" about its AI potential. He was joined by Wedbush's Dan Ives, who believes that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stock could jump by as much as $40 because of AI.\n\nDuring Q1 2024, 150 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database were Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s stakeholders. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway owned the most valuable stake which was worth $135 billion.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth fund shared in its Q1 2024 investor letter that a strong installed user base is one of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s biggest strengths. According to the fund:\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.\n\nOverall AAPL ranks 2nd on our list of the best hardware stocks to buy. You can visit 15 Best Hardware Stocks According to Hedge Funds to see the other hardware stocks that are on hedge funds’ radar. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Analyst Sees a New $25 Billion \"Opportunity\" for NVIDIA and Jim Cramer is Recommending These 10 Stocks in June.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "Tech ETFs Faceoff: Apple Vs Microsoft",
        "content": "The technology sector has been the clear leader of the 2024 market rally so far, driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) craze, hopes of rate cuts and the rising share of the \"Magnificent Seven.\"  \r\n\r\nThe \"Magnificent Seven\" is the biggest engine of growth for the technology sector. In particular, Apple AAPL and Microsoft MSFT are racing for the spot of the most valuable company. Last week, Apple reclaimed the most valuable company title, edging out Microsoft, but is unable to sustain the momentum. The iPhone maker currently has a market cap of $3.26 trillion, whereas the software maker boasts $3.29 trillion.\r\n\r\nApple\r\n\r\nApple, which was way behind its competitors in adopting AI, is finally catching up following the launch of the latest AI features at its long-anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference. The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple (read: Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy).\r\n\r\nThe iPhone maker unveiled a brand-new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. Apple announced a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost.\r\n\r\nApple reported robust second-quarter fiscal 2024 results, beating both earnings and revenue estimates. The tech giant unveiled the largest buyback in the company's history and lifted its dividend payment.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft\r\n\r\nThe world's largest software maker also reported strong third-quarter fiscal 2024 results, beating earnings and revenue estimates, driven by the strong demand for cloud and artificial intelligence offerings.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft has invested billions of dollars into AI in a bid to turbocharge its growth, particularly its cloud computing services, and is now reaping the fruits. About 7% of the increase in Azure revenues came from AI. Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said on the last reported quarter’s earnings call that 65% of Fortune 500 companies are using the Azure service that delivers OpenAI's technology to businesses. Demand for generative AI will continue to fuel Microsoft's cloud business.\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is now emphasizing AI transformation through its new offerings like Microsoft Copilot. “Microsoft Copilot and Copilot stack are orchestrating a new era of AI transformation, driving better business outcomes across every role and industry,\" Nadella added.\n\nStory continues Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Vs. Microsoft\r\n\r\nMicrosoft is leading the way this year, having gained 17.7% versus Apple’s rise of 10.4%. Both stocks currently have a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) and a Momentum Score of A, along with a solid Zacks Industry Rank in the top 23%.\r\n\r\nThough Microsoft has a Growth Score of B, meaning that it is primed for strong growth, Apple looks relatively cheaper at the current levels as it is trading at a P/E ratio of 32.30 versus 37.60 for Microsoft. Apple’s earnings are expected to grow 7.3% for the fiscal year (ending Sep 2024), lower than the industry average of 30.68%. However, its revenues will likely increase 0.4%, much higher than the industry’s growth of 0.03% (read: Can Dow Jones ETFs Soar Even Higher After Hitting 40K Mark?). Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple currently has an average brokerage recommendation (ABR) of 1.75, up from 1.82 a month ago, made by 30 brokerage firms. Of those deriving the current ABR, 18 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 60% and 10% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 56.67%, whereas Buy represented 10%.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Microsoft has an ABR of 1.13 made by 39 brokerage firms. Of these deriving the current ABR, 35 are Strong Buy and three are Buy. Strong Buy and Buy, respectively, account for 89.74% and 7.69% of all recommendations. A month ago, Strong Buy made up 89.47%, whereas Buy represented 7.89%. The company’s earnings and revenues are estimated to grow 19.98% and 15.33%, respectively, for the current fiscal year (ending June 2024), much higher than the average industry growth of 11.50% and 6.67%.\n\nETFs to Bet On\n\nBased on the above discussion, Apple and Microsoft are in a tough battle and investors should include both stocks in their portfolios to tap growth. Good tidings are in the cards for Apple, given its cheap valuation, strong ABR and new AI innovations. Then again, Microsoft is poised for above-average growth, given its solid earnings and growth estimates (see: all the Technology ETFs here).\r\n\r\nAs such, investors seeking to invest in both companies at the same time could look at Select Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT and iShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW. XLK has the largest 44.1% share in both AAPL and MSFT, followed by 33.7% for IYW, 32.8% for FTEC and 32.6% for VGT. All four ETFs sport a Zacks ETF Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and have been hitting new highs lately.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Meta and Apple will likely be the first targets of Europe’s new antitrust powers",
        "content": "Meta already has a good reason to be mad at European tech regulators. On Friday, it had to effectively pause its rollout of Meta AI in Europe, at the request of its main privacy regulator in Ireland, after privacy advocates loudly complained that Meta can't train its AI on the personal data of European Facebook and Instagram users without their consent.\n\n“Without including local information we’d only be able to offer people a second-rate experience,” Meta griped, calling it “a step backwards for European innovation.” But that annoyance is nothing compared to what’s reportedly around the corner.\n\nAccording to Reuters, the European Commission is gearing up to make Meta and Apple the first targets of its new antitrust powers, based on the Digital Markets Act that took effect a few months ago. As also reported by the Financial Times, Apple’s charges will likely arrive first, followed by those for Meta.\n\nWe’ll get to the Apple issues in a moment, but those that will reportedly lead to Meta charges are not a million miles away from those holding up its European AI ambitions.\n\nIn the case of Meta AI, the problem is that the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) demands that any processing of personal data needs a solid legal basis—there’s a list of six potential options. Meta had been hoping that it could get away with claiming vaguely that its “legitimate interests” justify the use of European users’ data as model-training fodder, but that didn’t fly with the regulators, so its only plausible option is to get each user’s consent. For whatever reason, it isn’t taking that option just yet.\n\nMeta’s DMA woes are also down to data protection and the need for consent, only this time it’s about tracking users for ad-targeting purposes.\n\nOver the years, a succession of legal cases (initiated by the Austrian activist lawyer Max Schrems) has systemically removed the legal justifications that Meta can use for this tracking, again leaving it with valid consent as the only remaining option. But because few people would naturally choose to opt into online surveillance, Meta attempted a subscription gambit in which users could pay as much as $13 monthly to get ad-free Meta services, otherwise they would have to consent to tracking in order to use Facebook and Instagram.\n\nAs I wrote in April, Europe’s privacy regulators agreed with Schrems and other activists, deciding that Big Tech platforms generally can’t claim they have valid consent for tracking if the only alternative is paying a fee. And because antitrust and privacy law have been blurring into each other in recent years—regulators have realized that market-dominating companies maintain their positions partly through the accumulation of data—this tactic arguably manages to fall foul of both the GDPR and the DMA.\n\nStory continues\n\nMeta declined to comment on the Reuters report, saying it was speculative.\n\nAs for Apple, well, if you followed the drama of that company’s sullen attempts to comply with the letter of the DMA while trampling over its spirit, you can guess what those charges will likely be about. If you managed to stay blissfully unaware of the drama, here’s the gist: The DMA forced Apple to allow third-party iOS app stores in Europe, but when it did so, it introduced a €0.50 ($0.54) “core technology fee” for every first installation of each app published by a developer who chose to make its apps available in a third-party app store.\n\nIn other words, developers were finally free to steer clear of Apple’s distribution mechanism and the revenue cut that Apple demands, but they'd lose a ton of money if their app was free to download, as most are.\n\nCompanies with plans to introduce third-party app stores on iOS, like Meta and Microsoft, complained that Apple’s new fee made the concept unviable. As the DMA demands that platform “gatekeepers” like Apple apply “fair, reasonable, and nondiscriminatory general conditions of access” for other businesses, I wrote at the time that Apple was unlikely to get away with this tactic. And here we are—this is reportedly going to be the crux of the EU’s charges.\n\nLike Meta, Apple declined to comment on the report of this oncoming train, which will bring with it the threat of fines running to a maximum of 10% of global annual revenue.\n\nMore news below.\n\nDavid Meyer\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet? Drop a line here.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "title": "June Gloom? 3 Stocks to Sell Before They Plunge",
        "content": "U.S. equities are reaching new highs after May’s consumer price index (CPI) report indicated significant cooling in pricing pressures across the broad. The headline inflation figure came in flat, while the “core” reading, which excludes price volatility from food and energy, increased only 0.2% month-over-month. The year-over-year increase in prices landed at 3.3%, which represented the first significant cooling we have seen since the second quarter of 2021. These trends could contribute to market conditions that outline which stocks to sell.\n\nNonetheless, the U.S. Federal Reserve is keeping to its cautious stance and revised the rate forecast outlined in December. Instead of three rate cuts in 2024, the central bank has projected a single 0.25% reduction in the Federal Funds rate. This bit of bad news has not quelled markets though. The tech-heavy Nasdaq has rallied 15.5% on a year-to-date (YTD) basis, while the S&P500 has also enjoyed a 12.7% surge.\n\nHowever, all of this relatively good news does not mean there aren’t any stocks to avoid. Investors will not want any of these three stocks to sell in their portfolio unless they desire a gloomy June.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSentinelOne (S) The logo for SentinelOne (S) is seen on on an office building.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSentinelOne (NYSE:S), a once compelling way to play the cybersecurity space, has seen its share plummet in 2024. In particular, the cybersecurity software firm’s share price has fallen more than 34% on a YTD basis. This is in stark contrast to SentinelOne’s meteoric rally in 2023, wherein shares rose 88.1%. Despite having a platform that checks all the boxes for employing novel technologies, such as artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML), SentinelOne is struggling to spur top-line growth in a troubled global economic environment and highly competitive market.\n\nAt the beginning of the year, SentinelOne released its fourth-quarter earnings report for the company’s fiscal year 2024, which ended January 31, and despite a sizable earnings beat, investors were unimpressed with full-year guidance for the following fiscal year. Moreover, first-quarter results for fiscal year 2025 also beat Wall Street estimates but did not come with any upward revisions to guidance, again leaving investors underwhelmed.\n\nCompressing growth rates spell bad news for SentinelOne’s share price going forward, and in the meantime, competitor CrowdStrike (NASDAQ:CRWD) continues to see strong revenue and earnings figures while also enjoying a significant rally in its share price.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoundHound AI (SOUN) SoundHound Inc.'s (SOUN) Headquarters exterior. The company develops voice-recognition, natural language understanding, sound-recognition and search technologies.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nSoundHound AI (NASDAQ:SOUN) was supposed to be an unstoppable AI stock, but then a revealing short seller report from Capybara Research was released. The report asserted the start-up’s artificial intelligence solutions, which allow businesses to develop AI-driven conversational experiences for their customers, were predicated on speech-recognition technology already widely available. Not to mention, tech titans, including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG,NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) have rolled out similar voice-recognition products and features.\n\nEven with Nvidia being a notable investor in SoundHound AI, the company’s stock has plummeted from its stratospheric highs since then. In mid-March, SOUN had skyrocketed as much as 320.3% since the start of trading in 2024, but now the company’s share price is up 119.3%. Of course, this performance is nothing to snooze at, but a lack of interest or growth catalysts for the AI firm could lead to further losses in the future, making it one of the stocks to sell.\n\nIonQ (IONQ) IONQ logo\n\nThe quantum computing space has enjoyed much attention lately. The rise of generative artificial intelligence technologies has left investors to wonder what technological revolution could be next. Quantum computing, when scaled up, could affect significant change across various fields, including climate science and finance. The space of public quantum computing companies is full of legacy technology firms that have invested in the technology for decades as well as a handful of notable start-ups.\n\nIonQ (NYSE:IONQ) is one of those pure-play quantum computing startups that rose to prominence with its innovative ion-trapping technology that the firm has leveraged to build its quantum computers. The quantum computing firm’s Forte system takes advantage of 36 qubits and is IonQ’s “highest performing system to date.”\n\nIonQ’s first quarter results for fiscal year 2024 came in above Wall Street’s estimates, but unfortunately, shares are still down a significant 35.8% for the year. The lack of commercial practicality for quantum computing at this moment as well as IonQ’s sizable net losses will likely lead to more downward pressure on IonQ’s shares.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "3 Best Inverse/Leveraged ETF Areas of Last Week",
        "content": "Wall Street was moderately upbeat last week. The S&P 500 gained 1.6%, the Dow Jones lost 0.5% and the Nasdaq soared 3.2%. The tech rally mainly pushed up the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq. Softer inflation data mainly triggered the bets over a sooner-than-expected Fed rate cut.\n\nThe expectation itself, in turn, dragged down bond yields. The week started at 4.47% of the benchmark U.S. treasury yields and closed the week at 4.20%. The decline in benchmark treasury yields last week led to gains in growth sectors like technology.\n\nCooling Inflation\n\nInvestors should note that the annual inflation rate in the United States slowed to 3.3% in May 2024, the lowest in three months, compared to 3.4% in April and below the forecast of 3.4%. Core CPI hit 3.4%, below expectations of 3.5%. It marked the lowest rate since April 2021.\n\nWholesale inflation unexpectedly ticked down 0.2% last month, while economists polled by Dow Jones expected the gauge to increase 0.1%. This followed a consumer price index reading that was flat on a monthly basis in May. It was the biggest drop in producer prices since October (read: 3 Undervalued Growth ETF Winners With More Room to Run).\n\nFed Stays Put, September Rate Cut Possibility?\n\nThe Fed opted to maintain its benchmark interest rate within the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, a level it has maintained since July 2023. However, the Fed has revised its rate cut predictions. While previously predicting three rate cuts for the year, the Fed scaled back its estimate to just one due to sticky inflation.\n\nThe odds of a rate cut in September rose following the CPI report, but the decision hinges on continued improvement in inflation data. There is currently a 61.1% probability of a 25-bp rate cut in September, up from 50.7% recorded on May 16, 2024, per CME FedWatch Tool. The Fed retained its unemployment and GDP outlook for the year, while raising its neutral rate forecast.\n\nAny Downbeat Development?\n\nThe University of Michigan’s Survey of Consumers revealed that consumer sentiment fell to 65.6 in June from 69.1 in May. This reading also came below the 71.5 Dow Jones estimate.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, below we highlight a few winning inverse/leveraged ETFs of last week.\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nLeveraged NVIDIA ETFs\n\nDirexion Daily NVDA Bull 2X Shares NVDU – Up 18.8%\n\nT-Rex 2X Long NVIDIA Daily Target ETF NVDX – Up 18.6%\n\nNVIDIA is up 173.8% this year and added 9.5% last week due to the ongoing boom in artificial intelligence (AI).

        "content": "Investing.com -- The \"artificial intelligence party\" for technology stocks is \"just beginning\" and should lead to a wave of customer spending on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s AI-optimized products, according to analysts at Wedbush.\n\nIn a note to clients on Sunday raising their price target for Redmond, Washington-based Microsoft's stock to $550 from $500, the Wedbush analysts said that \"recent AI customer checks\" indicate that the monetization of Microsoft's AI-powered Copilot tool and its Azure cloud computing service is \"on the doorstep.\"\n\n\"We have seen deal conversions for broader enterprise scale AI deployments 'accelerating' in the field,\" the analysts said.\n\nThey maintained their \"Outperform\" rating of Microsoft shares, adding that AI is set to \"change the cloud growth trajectory\" of the company, with over 70% of its current customer base tipped to eventually use its automated options. The amount of consumers using Microsoft's AI offerings is also seen hitting an \"inflection point\" of rapid growth in the firm's 2025 fiscal period.\n\n\"[T]he stock still has yet to price in what we view as the next wave of cloud and AI growth,\" the Wedbush analysts said.\n\nShares in Microsoft, which has benefited from an investment from ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, have soared by more than 19% so far this year, giving the business a market capitalization of roughly $3.29 trillion. In a separate note, the Wedbush analysts said the company is now in a race with AI-chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to reach a $4 trillion valuation.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMicrosoft expected to see \"wave\" of customer spending on AI products - Wedbush\n\nBank of America: Oil demand on the rocks\n\nTesla kicks off legal fight to reinstate Musk's pay\n\nView comments",

        "title": "63% of Warren Buffett's $388 Billion Portfolio Is Invested in These 3 Magnificent Stocks",
        "content": "Among Wall Street's billionaire money managers, the affably named \"Oracle of Omaha\" is in a class of his own.\n\nSince becoming the CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) in 1965, Warren Buffett has overseen an aggregate return in his company's class A shares (BRK.A) of better than 4,940,000%, as of the closing bell on June 13. For the sake of comparison, the benchmark S&P 500 is nearing a total return, including dividends paid, of 36,000% since Buffett took the reins. When you outpace the most widely followed index by this much, you're going to draw attention.\n\nArguably no form 13F filing is more anticipated each quarter than that of Berkshire Hathaway. A 13F provides a detailed look at what Wall Street's brightest investment minds have been buying, selling, and holding, and is a required filing for institutions and money managers with at least $100 million in assets under management. In the March-ended quarter, Berkshire held 44 stocks and two exchange-traded funds. Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nWhile this might sound like a well-diversified portfolio, that couldn't be further from the truth. Buffett and his top investment aides, Todd Combs and Ted Weschler, oversee a highly concentrated portfolio. Berkshire's investment gurus strongly believe in putting a lot of capital to work in their top ideas -- and it absolutely shows.\n\nAs of the closing bell on June 13, 63% ($243.4 billion) of the $388 billion portfolio Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire Hathaway was invested in three magnificent stocks.\n\nApple: $169,114,296,728 (43.5% of invested assets)\n\nAs has been the case for some time now, tech stock Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) accounts for an otherworldly percentage of the invested assets Warren Buffett oversees at Berkshire. Even after selling nearly 116.2 million shares of Apple during the first quarter for tax purposes, the recent rally in its shares has increased its weighting in Berkshire's investment portfolio to almost 44%.\n\nThere look to be three key reasons Buffett favors Apple and has referred to it as \"a better business than any we own.\"\n\nThe first catalyst has everything to do with consumer behavior. Buffett has freely admitted that he doesn't understand the first thing about how an iPhone works, but he does have a good bead on consumer behavior.\n\nApple has an exceptionally loyal following that's seemingly always eager to buy its products. Since introducing a 5G-capable version of its iPhone during the fourth quarter of 2020, the company has maintained a 50% or greater share of the domestic smartphone market.\n\nStory continues\n\nSecondly, Buffett and his team likely appreciate the innovation and leadership that CEO Tim Cook has brought to the table. Beyond just the evolution of Apple's physical products (the iPhone, Mac, iPad, and Apple Watch), Cook is spearheading a multiyear transition that's seen the company pivot to higher-margin subscription services.\n\nLast week, at Apple's annual developer conference, the company unveiled an assortment of new artificial intelligence (AI) features that can allow it to get a piece of the multitrillion-dollar AI pie. These new features can help refresh the functionality of Apple's key product lines.\n\nThe third selling point on Apple for Warren Buffett is its world-leading capital-return program. On top of returning $15 billion to shareholders via dividends on an annual basis, the company has repurchased $674 billion of its common stock since the start of 2013. By simply sitting on his proverbial hands, Buffett has seen Berkshire's stake in Apple grow over time thanks to these aggressive buybacks. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBank of America: $40,549,769,756 (10.4% of invested assets)\n\nThe second magnificent stock that makes up a sizable percentage of Berkshire Hathaway's $388 billion investment portfolio is none other than money-center behemoth Bank of America(NYSE: BAC). The over 1 billion shares of BofA owned by Buffett's company equates to a market value of more than $40 billion.\n\nThere's not a sector of the market Warren Buffett loves more than financials, and there's a very simple reason why. I like to call it the \"numbers game.\"\n\nBuffett and his team are well aware that economic downturns and recessions are a normal part of the long-term economic cycle. But rather than foolishly (lowercase 'f') trying to time when these downturns will arise, Buffett, Combs, and Weschler have packed Berkshire's portfolio with cyclical businesses that can take advantage of long-winded expansions (i.e., the numbers game). Extended periods of economic growth allow bank stocks to grow their loan portfolios and reap the rewards of interest income.\n\nSpeaking of interest income, no money-center bank is more sensitive to changes in interest rates than Bank of America. With the Federal Reserve undertaking its most-aggressive rate-hiking cycle since the early 1980s, it's BofA that's seen its net-interest income climb more than any other money-center bank. As long as core inflation remains stubbornly high (looking at you, shelter expenses!), Bank of America should benefit from the Fed's current wait-and-see approach.\n\nA lesser-known catalyst that's been making waves for BofA is its investment in digitization. As of the end of March, digital banking adoption among households rose to 76%, up 6 percentage points from the comparable period in 2021. Meanwhile, 50% of consumer loans were completed online or via mobile app. Digital banking transactions are considerably cheaper for Bank of America than in-person or phone-based interactions and should provide a lift to its operating efficiency.\n\nBank of America also offers a robust capital-return program when the U.S. economy is healthy. Berkshire is collecting nearly $1 billion in annual dividend income from its stake in BofA.\n\nAmerican Express: $33,686,381,433 (8.7% of invested assets)\n\nThe third magnificent stock that, collectively with Apple and Bank of America, accounts for 63% of the $388 billion investment portfolio Warren Buffett puts to work at Berkshire Hathaway is credit-services goliath American Express(NYSE: AXP). AmEx has been a continuous holding by Buffett's company since 1991.\n\nThe bull thesis for AmEx, much like BofA, revolves around the business being cyclical. Out of the 12 U.S. recessions since the end of World War II, nine have resolved in less than a year, and none of the remaining three surpassed 18 months in duration.\n\nComparatively, a majority of expansions have stuck around for multiple years, with two periods of growth hitting the 10-year mark. Companies that depend on growth in consumer and enterprise spending, like AmEx, benefit immensely from this disparity between recessions and expansions (the \"numbers game\" in action).\n\nOne of the top reasons American Express has been such a phenomenal investment for so many decades is its willingness to take part in both sides of a transaction. It's currently the No. 3 payment processor by credit-card network purchase volume in the U.S. (the top market globally for consumption). This allows the company to generate predictable merchant fees in any economic climate.\n\nBut American Express is also a lender. It has the ability to generate annual fees and interest income from its cardholders. Although this does expose the company to the possibility of credit delinquencies and loan losses during recessions, these downturns, as noted, are short-lived.\n\nTo add to this point, American Express has historically done a fantastic job of attracting higher-income cardholders.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Best Undervalued AI Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of the 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nWhen the AI revolution began with the launch of ChatGPT, no one would have thought that down the road it would bring a huge growth catalyst for the PC industry, notorious for its cyclical nature and unpredictability. Fast forward to today, everyone is talking about PCs equipped with AI-focused equipment capable to process generative AI workloads. But in just a matter of few months why did the market feel the need for AI PCs? It all boils down to costs. GPT-4 costs $0.03 per 1,000 tokens for prompts and $0.06 for completion according to Microsoft’s estimates. Consider millions of users prompting LLMs from their phones and computers. The costs of scaling such systems are not feasible. That’s why the market thought allowing users to process AI-intensive workloads natively instead of using the Cloud is the future. And that caused the AI PC boom. Tech market analyst firm Canalys says AI PC shipments are expected to soar to 170 million in 2027, from 25 million in 2022. That would be a 60% share of the total PC market. The firm also expects AI PC shipments to double from 2023 to 2024 and double gain from 2024 to 2025.\n\nCanalys also expects vendors to ship 205 million AI-capable PCs in 2028, representing a CAGR of 44% from 2024 through 2028.\n\nFor this article we scanned Insider Monkey’s database of 919 hedge funds and picked 8 AI PC stocks with the highest number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best AI PC Stock to Buy Now?\n\nA wide view of an Apple store, showing the range of products the company offers.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nMorgan Stanley said in a report last month that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the stocks that could benefit from the rise of AI PCs. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) skeptics have long believed that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a laggard in the AI race, but experts say Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) almost always makes its own way and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will come roaring back in the AI competition and surpass Microsoft and Alphabet. The first signs of Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter the latest AI announcements at the WWDC event, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in “denial” about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 26X its 2025 EPS estimate ($7.22). This multiple, though higher than the industry average of 30, does not show the stock’s overvalued, given Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) sales growth of 6.40% for fiscal 2025 and 10.50% growth for the next five years on a per-annum basis.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list titled 8 Best AI PC Stocks to Buy Now. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "2 Hypergrowth Tech Stocks to Buy in 2024 and Beyond",
        "content": "The tech market is rapidly expanding. The Nasdaq-100Technology Sector is up 32% in the past 12 months, outperforming the S&P 500's growth of 24% in that period. The rise brings to mind the old proverb, \"The best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, but the second best time is now.\" The same sentiment applies to the stock market, especially tech stocks.\n\nThe tech industry has a reputation for delivering significant gains over the long term, benefiting from its innovative nature and consistent demand for upgraded products and software. Meanwhile, recent advances in markets such as artificial intelligence (AI), self-driving cars, and virtual/augmented (VR/AR) reality indicate the tech market is nowhere near hitting its ceiling. As a result, there's no time like the present to invest in tech.\n\nHere are two hypergrowth tech stocks to buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\n1. Nvidia\n\nShares in Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) have hit record heights over the last year, rising 207% alongside soaring earnings. Stellar growth has seen the company become the first chipmaker to achieve a market cap above $3 trillion, making it the world's third most valuable company this year, only after Microsoft and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nNvidia's success comes down to its dominant position in AI graphics processing units (GPUs), the chips crucial to performing AI tasks and running AI platforms. While competitors such as Intel and Advanced Micro Devices prioritized central processing units (CPUs) in recent years, Nvidia's focus on GPUs gave it a head start in AI and perfectly positioned it to become the go-to chip supplier for AI developers worldwide.\n\nIn its most recent quarter, the first quarter of fiscal 2025, Nvidia's revenue increased by 262% year over year while operating income rose nearly 700%. The company enjoyed impressive growth in its data center segment, which posted revenue gains of 427%, illustrating a healthy boost to AI GPU sales.\n\nHowever, its diverse business model is the best reason to invest in this hypergrowth tech stock. In addition to AI chips, Nvidia has positions in consumer PCs, video games, self-driving cars, and more.\n\nIn Q1 2025, revenue in the company's automotive segment increased by 17% sequentially and 11% year over year. Nvidia CFO Colette Kress has expressed massive potential in automotive as advances in self-driving cars increase chip demand. On a recent earnings call, Kress said that she expects automotive to be the \"largest enterprise vertical\" within the data center segment in 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia has delivered an impressive growth year but could have much more to offer investors as the tech market develops and the company continues to be a leading chipmaker. And with a price/earnings-to-growth ratio of less than 1, this hypergrowth tech stock is too good to pass up this year.\n\n2. Apple\n\nShares of Apple are up 341% over the past five years, while annual revenue and operating income have soared 47% and 79%. The company has often been praised as one of the best growth stocks to invest in over the long term.\n\nHowever, Apple has been in a slump over the past 12 months. The company has a reputation for consistently outperforming the S&P 500. Yet while the renowned index has risen 24% since last June, Apple's stock price has increased by 16%. Investors have grown weary of Apple's products business after repeated sales declines.\n\nMeanwhile, the emergence of AI has highlighted the disparity in Apple's AI technology compared with some of its rivals. The iPhone giant isn't leading in the AI space today. However, recent developments and its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) on June 10 have made Wall Street bullish again.\n\nApple's stock jumped 10% after the conference, where the company debuted new AI services that could boost product sales in the coming months. At WWDC, the tech giant unveiled Apple Intelligence, a new AI platform that will bring generative updates across its product lineup. iPhone 15 Pro models, Apple Silicon Macs, and iPads equipped with M1 through M4 chips will give users access to Apple Intelligence, including features such as image and language generation, editing tools, an updated Siri, and much more.\n\nApple Intelligence could motivate millions of consumers to upgrade to the company's more recent devices, providing the boost that its product business needs to overcome recent headwinds. AAPL Free Cash Flow Chart\n\nShares in Apple are trading at a premium, with its forward price-to-earnings ratio at 32. However, as the table shows, this figure is below the same metric for AI rivals Microsoft and Amazon, indicating that Apple's stock is a better value than both companies.\n\nApple also significantly outperforms both companies in free cash flow, which could mean it is better equipped to catch up with its competitors in AI and keep investing in its business. In addition to a solid growth history, Apple strikes me as a screaming buy in 2024 and beyond.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Microsoft, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) will be in a race over the next year to hit a market capitalization of $4 trillion thanks to surging enthusiasm over the capabilities of artificial intelligence, according to analysts at Wedbush.\n\nAt the end of trading on Friday, software titan Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s market value had stood at $3.29 trillion. The market cap of iPhone-maker Apple's, meanwhile, has reached $3.26 trillion, just outpacing AI-darling Nvidia's valuation of $3.24 trillion.\n\nIn a note to clients on Sunday, the Wedbush analysts laid out the case for optimism surrounding each company.\n\nFor Microsoft, the analysts argued that AI will help the firm monetize its \"massive\" base of installed enterprise users over the coming years. Microsoft, which has previously backed ChatGPT-maker OpenAI, has outlined plans to bring AI into a number of fields across the business world with its Copilot offering.\n\nDespite recently being widely considered to be a laggard in the AI race, Apple unveiled a string of AI-powered enhancements to its products at its annual developers conference last week that the Wedbush analysts said could trigger a \"super cycle\" in iPhone sales.\n\nFinally, the Wedbush analysts said Nvidia's AI-optimized chips are \"in essence the new gold or oil in the tech sector\" as an increasing number of businesses embrace the nascent technology.\n\nAlthough they flagged that AI could disrupt near-term sales cycles in some tech stocks, the analysts added the \"massive\" expected wave of expenditures will not only fuel a new \"industrial revolution\" in the tech industry but also underpin a broader market rally \"well in 2025.\"\n\n\"In a nutshell, we believe this tech bull market has legs that will ultimately broaden out to the rest of software, consumer tech, cyber security, semis, and infrastructure over the next 12 to 18 months,\" the Wedbush analysts said.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nMicrosoft, Apple, and Nvidia in race to hit $4 trillion market cap - Wedbush\n\nAnalysis-French election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget rout\n\nStanChart loses bid to cut US sanctions breach claims from UK lawsuit\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Futures muted, U.S. retail and Fedspeak ahead this week - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures were muted heading into the start of a new trading week, with traders awaiting new economic data and fresh interest rate commentary from a raft of Federal Reserve officials. Activist investor Starboard Value reportedly takes a stake in design-software group Autodesk (NASDAQ:ADSK) worth around $500 million, according to the Wall Street Journal. Elsewhere, Chinese industrial output growth cooled by more than expected in May, in an indication of the challenges facing Beijing's effort to fuel a recovery in the country's economy.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures were muted on Monday, as investors looked ahead to further economic data and comments from Federal Reserve policymakers this week that could impact how the central bank may approach potential interest rate reductions later in 2024 (more below).\n\nBy 03:15 ET (07:15 GMT), the Dow futures contract was mostly unchanged, Nasdaq 100 futures had added 31 points or 0.1%, and S&P 500 futures had inched up by 3 points or 0.1%.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite edged up slightly on Friday, giving the tech-heavy index a fifth-consecutive record close. The benchmark S&P 500 and blue-chip Dow Jones Industrial Average both ended the session slightly lower.\n\nIn individual stocks, shares in Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) spiked by more than 14% after the Photoshop-maker lifted its annual revenue forecast thanks to increasing demand for its artificial intelligence-fueled products. AI chipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), which briefly topped iPhone-manufacturer Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's second-largest company, also gained 1.8%.\n\n2. U.S. retail sales, Fedspeak ahead this week\n\nInvestors trying to get a handle on the strength of the U.S. economy -- and the timing of Fed rate cuts -- will be looking closely at Tuesday’s retail sales data for May.\n\nEconomists are expecting retail sales to have risen 0.3% month-on-month, after the figure came in at 0.0% in April, lower than projections.\n\nConsumer spending is an area of focus for Wall Street as investors seek to gauge the impact of higher interest rates on the economy. Last week, the Fed reiterated that it needs to see more evidence that inflation is sustainably cooling down to its stated 2% target before beginning to lower borrowing costs.\n\nTraders will also get the chance to hear from several Fed speakers during the week, including New York Fed President John Williams, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly and Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin. On Friday, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee said that while he felt \"a little bit of relief\" that price pressures in the U.S. showed signs of abating in May, he would like to see \"more months\" of similarly easing data prior to slashing rates.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Starboard Value takes stake in Autodesk - WSJ\n\nActivist investor Starboard Value has acquired a stake worth approximately $500 million in design-software manufacturer Autodesk and is now advocating for changes within the company, according to the Wall Street Journal.\n\nCiting sources familiar with the matter, the WSJ said Starboard has held meetings with Autodesk executives in the past few weeks to express their concerns and suggest changes, including enhancing its margins, implementing changes to its board and the management of a recent accounting investigation that negatively impacted the stock.\n\nStarboard criticized Autodesk for failing to disclose the probe and other significant updates until after the deadline for shareholders to nominate director candidates had passed in late March, the WSJ added.\n\nThe investor is reportedly contemplating legal action to request the reopening of Autodesk's director nomination window and to postpone the company's annual shareholder meeting, which is currently scheduled for July 16.\n\n4. Chinese industrial output slows\n\nChinese industrial production eased by more than exected in May, while property prices also dropped, in the latest sign of struggle in Beijing's effort to bolster the world's second-biggest economy.\n\nIndustrial output increased by 5.6% last month on an annualized basis, decelerating from 6.7% in April, according to data from the National Bureau of Statistics. Economists had seen the reading at 6.2%.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese new home prices slipped by 0.7% month-on-month, official data cited by Reuters showed. It was the sharpest decline since 2014. Property investment and residential property sales also tumbled.\n\nThe figures emphasize the challenges facing Chinese lawmakers as they look to reinvigorate the country's economy. Beijing has reportedly pushed to boost industrial production, particularly through exports, during a time of depressed real estate market activity.\n\n5. Oil steadies\n\nOil prices steadied on Monday, as traders digested the industrial production data out of China and a survey last week that suggested a slowdown in demand in top crude consumer the United States.\n\nOn Friday, U.S. consumer sentiment slumped to a seven-month low in June, as households continued to fret about elevated inflation and high borrowing costs.\n\nMeanwhile, the lower-than-predicted industrial production figures in May pointed to an uneven recovery in the world's biggest oil importer.\n\nBy 05:13 ET, Brent crude futures had gained 0.3% to $82.88 a barrel, while U.S. West Texas Intermediate crude futures had increased by 0.3% to $78.29 per barrel.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures muted, U.S. retail and Fedspeak ahead this week - what's moving markets\n\nECB's Lane plays down need for French bond rescue\n\nChina opens tit-for-tat anti-dumping probe into European pork\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently compiled a list of the 25 most powerful brands in the US and in this article we will talk about the Top Most Powerful Brand in the US.\n\nTech Titans Lead the Charge in Global Brand Value Growth\n\nThe global powerful brands market is dominated by technology giants, with Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) leading the pack as the world's most valuable brand. According to the Kantar BrandZ Top 100 Most Valuable Global Brands 2023 report, the total brand value of the world's top 100 brands stands at $6.9 trillion for 2023 which is a 20% drop from the previous year but still a 47% growth compared to pre-COVID levels in 2019. According to the Brand Finance US 500 2024 report, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL) regained its position as the most valuable brand in the US and globally, with a brand value of $516.6 billion, a staggering 74% increase from the previous year.\n\nMicrosoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) and NVIDIA have also experienced significant brand value growth, driven by their investments and innovations in artificial intelligence (AI). Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)'s brand value rose by 78% to $340.4 billion, making it the second most valuable brand in the US and the world. NVIDIA, which is a key supplier of chips in the AI space, achieved a remarkable 163% increase in brand value to $44.5 billion, making it the fastest-growing brand in the US.\n\nReviving Brand Loyalty Through Exceptional Customer Experiences and Rewards\n\nBrand loyalty has been on a decline in recent years, with only 9% of U.S. consumers considering themselves truly brand loyal, according to Nielsen research. However, iconic U.S. brands like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:APPL), Amazon, and Domino's have managed to retain a loyal customer base through exceptional customer experiences and personalized offerings. Apple has consistently ranked as the brand with the most loyal customers, overtaking Amazon in 2022.\n\nDelivering exceptional customer service is crucial for fostering brand loyalty. According to a survey by SAP Emarsys, 44% of respondents cited excellent customer experience as the reason for their loyalty to a brand in 2023, up 22% from the previous year. Brands that excel in customer service, offer discounts, incentives, and rewards, and provide diverse options for benefiting from such rewards are more likely to retain loyal customers. For instance, 52% of U.S. consumers switched brands in 2023 due to unfavorable encounters, an increase from 48% in 2022.\n\nConsumers demand tangible rewards for their loyalty, with 50% of U.S. respondents stating that having a loyalty card or account significantly influences their spending with a brand. Additionally, 43% expect better prices as loyal customers and 46% expect exclusive offers. Brand loyalty also has a significant financial impact on businesses. The Temkin Group found that companies earning $1 billion annually can expect an additional $700 million within three years of investing in customer experience.\n\nStory continues The Most Powerful Brand in the US\n\nPixabay/Public Domain\n\nOur Methodology\n\nFor our methodology, we have ranked the most powerful brands in the US based on their brand value as of 2024. For data accuracy, we relied on Brand Finance. The methodology for calculating brand value is a formula that is as follows: Brand Strength (BSI) x Brand Royalty Rate x Brand Revenues = Brand Value In general, the degree to which a brand produced money for the corporation determined its value. Brand Finance examined parent corporations and their subsidiaries, such as Meta, the owner of WhatsApp and Instagram.\n\nTop Most Powerful Brand in the US\n\n1. Apple\n\nBrand Value: $516.6 billion\n\nApple tops the list for being the most powerful brand in the US with a brand value of $516.6 billion. In Q1 2024, Apple’s total revenue was $119.6 billion, up 2% year-over-year and earnings per share (EPS) was $2.18, up 16% year-over-year, an all-time record. The iPhone accounts for around half of Apple's sales, but its services like Apple Pay, Apple TV, and others have become increasingly important. iPhone revenue stood at $69.7 billion in Q1, Mac Revenue stood at $7.78 billion and wearables, home & accessories revenue stood at $11.95 billion, up from $11.39 billion expected. Apple's hardware advances have powered consumer-facing breakthroughs in areas like computing speed and camera processing which is brought to life by its best-in-class marketing communications. Apple's services now account for a fifth of its total yearly sales revenue and command higher profit margins than its hardware business.\n\nTo learn about other most powerful brands in the US, you can check out our detailed report 25 Most Powerful Brands in the US.\n\nAt Insider Monkey, we delve into a variety of topics, ranging from the best online ESL courses to business aspects; however, our expertise lies in identifying the top-performing stocks.

        "title": "Apple and Oracle Helped Propel These 3 Vanguard ETFs to All-Time Highs. Here's My Favorite to Buy Now.",
        "content": "Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Oracle (NYSE: ORCL) blasted to all-time highs on Wednesday.\n\nApple is up over 14% in the last month -- the recent rally primarily fueled by a positive response to its annual Worldwide Developers Conference. Apple is integrating artificial intelligence (AI) across several key product categories. Meanwhile, Oracle is up 19% in the last month, getting an additional boost from its recent financial results and guidance.\n\nSince Oracle is listed on the New York Stock Exchange, you won't find it in the Nasdaq Composite or Nasdaq-focused exchange-traded funds (ETFs). But you will find both Apple and Oracle in the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF(NYSEMKT: VTI), the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF(NYSEMKT: VOO), and the Vanguard Information Technology ETF(NYSEMKT: VGT). Here's a primer on each fund, why all three funds just hit all-time highs, and the best one to buy now. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nDiversified exposure\n\nThe Total Stock Market ETF and S&P 500 ETF are the two largest Vanguard ETFs -- both featuring over $1 trillion in net assets. Both funds have 0.03% expense ratios -- or $3 in annual fees per $10,000 invested. The low cost and simplicity of these funds make them great choices for folks looking for a passive yet effective way to mirror the broader market's performance.\n\nThe Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF has 3,719 holdings compared to 504 holdings in the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF. However, the largest companies are so valuable that the S&P 500 represents approximately 80% of the market cap of the U.S. stock market. This dynamic makes the performance of the two ETFs very similar.\n\nThe Vanguard S&P 500 ETF will generally do better than the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if mega-cap and large-cap stocks are outperforming mid-cap and small-cap stocks. The last 18 months or so is a great example of what you can expect when megacaps are leading the market higher. MGK data by YCharts.\n\nAs you can see in the chart, mega-cap growth has crushed the S&P 500, while mega-cap stocks have done well, while mid and small caps have done poorly. But even under those circumstances, the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF has only outperformed the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF by a couple of percentage points.\n\nSo despite the significant difference in quantity of holdings between the two funds, both perform practically the same because the S&P 500 makes up such a large share of the broader market.\n\nAn inexpensive way to invest in the hottest stock market sector\n\nThe simplest way to invest in companies like Apple and Oracle without racking up large fees is through the Vanguard Information Technology ETF. It has a higher expense ratio at 0.1% compared to 0.03% for the larger Vanguard funds. But that's only a $7 difference per $10,000 invested.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe tech sector is chock-full of high-octane growth stocks -- including the three most valuable companies in the world -- Apple, Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT), and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA). But it also includes more pick-and-shovel plays -- like materials and component suppliers.\n\nStill, the fund is basically going to boom or bust according to the performance of its three largest holdings and the two largest industries, semiconductors and software.\n\nThe semiconductor industry has been a huge winner from the AI-induced run-up in the market. The two best examples are Nvidia, which became the third company valued at over $3 trillion, and Broadcom, which surpassed $800 billion in market cap on Friday after blowing earnings expectations out of the water.\n\nWith the tech sector contributing 30.6% of the S&P 500 and the semiconductor industry comprising 27.6% of the tech sector, some simple math tells us that the industry now makes up a whopping 8.5% or so of the entire S&P 500. For context, that means the semiconductor industry has about the same weighting as the entire industrial sector or energy, utilities, and materials combined.\n\nThe tech sector includes companies that provide the computing power needed to run complex AI models, as well as companies that are investing in ways to apply AI for enterprises and consumers. For that reason, it stands out as the best sector to invest in if you want exposure to the growing trend.\n\nA well-deserved premium valuation\n\nThe danger of buying red-hot tech stocks right now is valuation. The Vanguard Information Technology ETF has a 42.6 price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio. Earnings growth has been strong, but many of the gains have been due to a valuation expansion.\n\nApple's P/E ratio is up to 33.2 compared to its three-year median of 28.1. Microsoft has a 38.2 P/E, while its three-year median is 33.3. Oracle's P/E is 37 compared to a three-year median of 30.2. The list goes on and on.\n\nOver the long term, tech companies are perfectly positioned to deploy capital toward high-margin opportunities that lead to earnings growth. The sector is admittedly a little overextended at this point from a valuation standpoint, but it still has what it takes to be a good investment. And for that reason, the Vanguard Information Technology ETF is a better buy than the Vanguard S&P 500 ETF or the Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF if you have a high risk tolerance.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Vanguard World Fund - Vanguard Information Technology ETF wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "6 Artficial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Are Worth Over $1 Trillion. Here Are the 2 Most Likely to Join the Club Next.",
        "content": "Take a look at a list of the largest companies in the world based on market cap, and you might notice a common thread for most of them: The biggest members of the group have bet heavily on artificial intelligence (AI). And those bets seem to be paying off.\n\nCurrently, six AI stocks are worth over $1 trillion. They could have company in the not-too-distant future. Here are the top six -- and the two AI stocks most likely to join the club next.\n\nThe $1 trillion six-pack\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) are in a close race to be the world's biggest company. Both of their market caps hover around $3.3 trillion.\n\nFor a while, it looked like Apple could be left in the dust in the race to develop AI technology. Its Siri AI assistant seemed almost antiquated compared to new large language models (LLMs).\n\nHowever, Apple's recent launch of new generative AI capabilities has changed the narrative. Some think the new Apple Intelligence features might even spark an iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nMicrosoft has benefited tremendously from its relationship with ChatGPT creator OpenAI. The tech giant's cloud business has especially grown thanks to a huge generative AI tailwind. The company's introduction of AI-powered Copilot+ PCs should also provide a nice boost to its operating system sales.\n\nNvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) is nipping at Apple's and Microsoft's heels with a market cap of around $3.2 trillion. The maker of graphics processing units (GPUs) has been the poster child of the AI boom over the last 18 months. Nvidia's forthcoming rollout of its Blackwell GPU architecture could keep it at the top of the AI chip market.\n\nWe could say that Google parent Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) are in the second tier of megacap AI stocks. Alphabet's market cap is around $2.2 trillion, while Amazon's is slightly under $2 trillion.\n\nBoth companies, like Microsoft, are cloud service providers. Generative AI could be the strongest growth driver for the cloud so far. Both Alphabet and Amazon are using AI to increase revenue in their core non-cloud businesses (search for Alphabet and e-commerce for Amazon). They're also hoping to be winners in self-driving car technology -- Alphabet with its Waymo unit and Amazon with Zoox.\n\nMeta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) lags behind the other AI leaders with a market cap of close to $1.3 trillion. The company uses AI extensively throughout its social media apps, including Facebook and Instagram. CEO Mark Zuckerberg predicted in late 2023 that AI-powered business messaging will be \"the next major pillar\" of its business.\n\nStory continues\n\nNext in the club\n\nWhich AI companies are in the best position to join these six in the $1 trillion club? My votes go to Broadcom(NASDAQ: AVGO) and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM).\n\nBroadcom's market cap now stands close to $780 billion. The stock surged last week after the semiconductor maker reported great fiscal 2024 second-quarter results. Revenue jumped 43% year over year, driven primarily by its acquisition of VMware and strong demand for its networking products in AI data centers.\n\nThe company also announced plans to conduct a 10-for-1 stock split on July 15. Although this split won't impact Broadcom's underlying business, it could make the stock more attractive to retail investors.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing's market cap of around $740 billion isn't too far behind Broadcom's. The company makes chips for many of the top AI leaders, including Apple, Nvidia, and Broadcom.\n\nAs its name indicates, the company is based in Taiwan. However, it expects to begin production at its first advanced chip fabrication facility in Arizona next year. It's also building another fab plant in that state, with plans for a third. These investments could cement the company's status as the go-to chipmaker for the world's best AI companies.\n\nAre Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor smart picks?\n\nWhile I predict Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor will be the next AI stocks with market caps of $1 trillion or more, I don't know how long they will take to reach that threshold. But I think both are smart stocks to buy right now for aggressive growth investors.\n\nIncome investors and value investors will probably want to look elsewhere. Neither stock is cheap. Although both pay dividends, their yields are only in the ballpark of 1.4% -- not enough to entice many income investors.\n\nIf you're looking for growth, though, and don't mind potential volatility, Broadcom and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing could be great fits. I expect both stocks to continue to beat the market in the coming years as the adoption of AI increases.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Broadcom right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Broadcom, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Broadcom wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock recently hit an all-time high after it unveiled Apple Intelligence, its closely watched expansion into the generative artificial intelligence (AI) market. The sprawling update will add AI-powered tools to write, edit, and summarize messages; search photos and videos; and create images from circled text and typed prompts. It will also integrate OpenAI's ChatGPT into Siri and its other iOS, iPadOS, and MacOS applications.\n\nAll of those new features could tighten Apple's grip on its customers and help it keep pace with its big tech peers in the artificial intelligence (AI) race, but will they actually move the needle for the company and drive its stock even higher?\n\nLet's take a closer look at Apple and see if it's the right time to buy, sell, or hold its high-flying stock. Image source: Apple.\n\nThe key facts and figures\n\nIn its latest quarter, Apple generated 51% of its revenue from the iPhone and 26% from its services, which include the App Store, iCloud, and subscription-based services. The remaining 23% came from its Mac, iPad, and wearables, home, and accessories divisions. Here's how those core businesses fared over the past two and half fiscal years.\n\nMetric FY 2022 Growth (YOY) FY 2023 Growth (YOY) First Half of FY 2024 Growth (YOY) iPhone revenue 7% (2%) (1%) Services revenue 14% 9% 13% Mac revenue 14% (27%) 2% iPad revenue (8%) (3%) (22%) Wearables, home, and accessories revenue 7% (3%) (11%) Total revenue 8% (3%) (1%)\n\nData source: Apple. Fiscal year (FY) ends in September. YOY = year over year.\n\nApple's sales of iPhones declined as the 5G upgrade cycle ended and it faced stiff macro and competitive headwinds in China. Its Mac sales tumbled in a post-pandemic market, and its iPad sales withered due to longer upgrade cycles and a lack of compelling new features in its latest models. The strong dollar exacerbated that slowdown over the past two years.\n\nThe only consistent bright spot for Apple has been its services business, which served over a billion paid subscribers at the end of the second quarter of fiscal 2024. That's more than double the number of subscribers it had four years ago. It's been relying heavily on the expansion of that ecosystem to lock more customers into its hardware devices.\n\nApple's iPhone sales still slipped in the first half of fiscal 2024, but most of that decline can be attributed to currency headwinds. Its services growth is accelerating again and its Mac sales are finally stabilizing, but its iPad sales are still slipping. Analysts expect Apple's revenue and earnings to increase only 1% and 7%, respectively, for the full year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe reasons to buy or hold Apple\n\nThe bulls expect Apple's revenue growth to accelerate again in the second half of fiscal 2024 as its iPhone and Mac sales warm up again. They also believe its services revenue will continue rising and offset its other weaknesses.\n\nApple's near-term sales growth might seem anemic, but it ended its latest quarter with $162 billion in cash and equivalents, giving it plenty of room to make fresh investments, acquire smaller companies, and buy back more shares. It bought back 36% of its shares over the past 10 years as its stock price soared nearly 850%. That fortress balance sheet makes it a good safe-haven stock as long as interest rates stay elevated, even if it only pays a paltry forward dividend yield of 0.5%.\n\nApple also has other irons in the fire. Apple Intelligence could increase the stickiness of its ecosystem and make it easier to roll out new subscription-based services, while the Vision Pro might gain more traction as cheaper and lighter models hit the market. Therefore, it still seems like a good stock to buy and hold for the long term.\n\nThe reasons to sell Apple\n\nApple is still growing, but the bears will argue that its business is maturing, it faces unpredictable regulatory challenges, and its stock is overvalued. As the iPhone sees longer upgrade cycles, Apple will feel more pressed to expand its services segment to offset that pressure. However, antitrust regulators in the U.S. and Europe have been probing its services business and could gradually loosen its grip on its developers and users.\n\nIf antitrust challenges throttle the growth of Apple's services segment before its iPhone and Mac sales stabilize, it could face a prolonged slowdown. If Apple reacts to that deceleration by deworsifying its business with bad investments or focusing too much on big buybacks, it could be revalued as a slower-growth tech giant like IBM.\n\nThat's why the skeptics believe Apple is too pricey at 29 times forward earnings. IBM, which expects to generate low-single-digit earnings growth over the next few years as it expands its hybrid cloud and AI businesses, has a forward multiple of 17.\n\nWhat's the right move right now?\n\nApple faces some near-term challenges, but I don't think it's the right time to sell the stock. It might also be too early to chase the stock after its latest AI-driven surge, so I think the best move right now is to simply hold it if you already own it.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock lifted to Buy as AMD, Adobe get downgraded",
        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\n‘AI stands for Apple Intelligence:’ D.A. Davidson upgrades Apple to Buy\n\nAnalysts at wealth management firm D.A. Davidson upgraded Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock from Neutral to Buy this week after the iPhone maker introduced its much-anticipated AI strategy.\n\nAccording to the firm’s analysts, “AI now stands for Apple Intelligence,” which is the name of the company’s artificial intelligence platform unveiled at the WWDC event.\n\nD.A. Davidson also lifted their price target from $200 to $230.\n\n\"Another Napster to iTunes moment. We believe yesterday's presentation rhymes with one of Apple's previous milestone moments — the transition of digital music from a standalone app with questionable regulatory standing (i.e. Napster) to an experience integrated into existing consumer applications (i.e. iTunes),” analysts wrote.\n\n“We believe the integration of summarization, enhanced search, multi-modality, text generation, and enhanced photo editing into the exiting ecosystem will drive much broader adoption of AI than we have seen to date,” they added.\n\nAnalysts also highlighted that Apple is the first to introduce a meaningful agent capability, allowing Siri and other tools to execute tasks on behalf of the user. Moreover, they emphasize that Apple is uniquely positioned to offer these capabilities and “may be the only one capable of doing so any time soon.”\n\nAMD downgraded as Morgan Stanley favors Nvidia, Broadcom\n\nMeanwhile, AI chipmaker Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) got a downgrade at Morgan Stanley on Monday, from Overweight to Equal Weight.\n\nWhile the bank still supports the overall narrative, it believes investor expectations for AMD's AI business are too high. Morgan Stanley analysts think that the current AI expectations don't leave room for much upside, despite a recovery in the core business.\n\n“We see limited upward revision potential for AI from here,\" analysts wrote.\n\nMoreover, Morgan Stanley notes that AMD appears expensive compared to other large-cap AI plays, such as NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO), where the bank has more confidence in upward revisions to AI forecasts.\n\nDespite the downgrade, Morgan Stanley analysts continue to view AMD's product lineup as a strong competitor in the client and server CPU markets this year.\n\nMelius downgrades Adobe as enterprise software faces AI challenges\n\nEarlier in the week, Melius analysts lowered their rating on Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) stock from Buy to Hold, with a price target of $510.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe investment firm notes that the enterprise application software sector is facing challenges with AI, drawing parallels to how on-prem hardware companies were affected by the shift to the cloud in the 2010s. They suggest this trend could persist longer than anticipated.\n\nMelius highlights that AI, enabled by companies like Nvidia and major cloud platforms, will accelerate software creation, customization, and deployment. Moreover, coding tools are allowing smaller AI-first competitors to emerge more easily.\n\nThey also point out that most SaaS companies have been increasing prices for years, making it harder to charge extra for AI, and AI-driven productivity may disrupt the traditional \"seat model\" business approach, indicating a potential transition in business models.\n\n“Furthermore, we see AI as a disruptor to traditional databases as unstructured data rises in both importance and usability,” Melius analysts said. “In short, you could see AI's impact on Snowflake (NYSE:SNOW) and even parts of hold-rated Oracle (NYSE:ORCL), as well as ongoing impacts on Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Workday (NASDAQ:WDAY) for a while.\"\n\nBroadcom is “one of the strongest AI plays,” Morgan Stanley says\n\nAhead of its better-than-expected earnings report released Wednesday, Morgan Stanley reiterated its Overweight rating on Broadcom, describing the semiconductor company as \"one of the strongest AI plays.\"\n\nThe Wall Street giant pointed out several key catalysts for their positive outlook, including Broadcom’s growth prospects in AI, potential synergies from the VMware (NYSE:VMW) acquisition, and recovery in its core enterprise semiconductor businesses.\n\nThe bank’s analysts project Broadcom's AI revenues to rise from $4.2 billion in FY2023 to $14 billion in FY2025, which would account for approximately 39% of the company's projected semiconductor revenues.\n\n\"We expect Broadcom to easily meet, if not slightly exceed, AI targets,\" the analysts noted. They believe Broadcom is poised to benefit from the deployment of Ethernet in AI data centers, the continued ramp-up of Google’s TPU, and the addition of two new ASIC clients.\n\nMS: Tesla could make an AI-powered phone\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) may soon venture into the smartphone market, according to Morgan Stanley analysts.\n\n“The car is an extension of the phone. The phone is an extension of the car,” the Wall Street firm noted, based on its discussions with automotive executives and industry experts. “The lines between car and phone are truly blurring,” they added.\n\nMorgan Stanley analysts have long considered Tesla's potential to expand into edge computing domains beyond vehicles. In October, they emphasized the concept of a mobile AI assistant as a significant innovation.\n\nThis idea resurfaced when Tesla CEO Elon Musk mentioned that developing such a device is \"not out of the question\" following Apple’s WWDC.\n\n“As Mr. Musk continues to invest further into his own LLM/genAI efforts, such as ‘Grok’, the potential strategic and user experience overlap becomes more obvious,” the analysts wrote.\n\nSupercomputing at both the data center and edge levels is increasingly relevant from an automotive perspective. The latest Tesla vehicles, capable of over-the-air firmware updates, contain batteries with the energy equivalent of approximately 2,000 iPhones and come equipped with liquid-cooled inference supercomputers.\n\nMorgan Stanley asked, “What if your phone could tap into your vehicle’s compute power and battery supply to run AI applications?” They pointed out that edge computing and AI have highlighted challenges like battery life, thermal management, and latency in integrating powerful AI-driven applications with today's smartphones.\n\n“Any Tesla owner will tell you how they use their smartphone as their primary key to unlock their car as well as running other remote applications while they interact with their vehicles,” the analysts added.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: Apple stock lifted to Buy as AMD, Adobe get downgraded\n\nFrench election worries rekindle market memories of UK budget rout\n\nThe Dutchman who gets Nike and Lego into wartime Russiaâ€™s stores\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple Stock Following Its AI Announcements?",
        "content": "Tech sector analysts have Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) circled on their calendar every year. That's because the tech giant often takes advantage of that event to announce important news that will be relevant to its financial and stock performance. That was certainly the case this year. On Monday, the first day of WWDC, management finally made public its much-anticipated plans related to artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe stock jumped Tuesday due to this news. But is what the company revealed a good enough reason to buy Apple stock?\n\nA brief look at Apple's AI plans\n\nApple dubbed the AI overhaul of its devices \"Apple Intelligence.\" It will integrate AI capabilities into the next iteration of its mobile operating system, iOS 18, a change that will affect many functionalities of its already high-performing devices. It's worth pointing out that those AI features will only be available on the latest versions of the iPhone (15 Pro and 15 Pro Max), and some iPads and Macs with the required capabilities. But what exactly are these features? There are too many to talk about in detail here, so let's mention just a few.\n\nOne notable upgrade will allow users to access ChatGPT for free without creating an account through Apple's famous digital assistant, Siri. Elsewhere, its AI-powered writing assistant will help polish people's writing. Other AI tools will be involved in creating and editing images, searching for specific moments in videos, reading summaries of email messages without opening them, providing summaries of video calls, and much, much more.\n\nThese tools will completely transform the way people use Apple devices, hopefully for the better. But what do they mean for investors?\n\nFocus on the bigger picture\n\nAll these nifty AI tools will be integrated into Apple's operating systems, so they'll be free to their users. How exactly will that help Apple, especially since few of them -- arguably, none of them -- are tools original or unique to Apple?\n\nAs just one example, its new writing assistant sounds a lot like one made by Grammarly. But unlike Grammarly, Apple has 2 billion devices in active use worldwide. The tech giant's loyal base of customers -- at least those with the right devices -- will automatically have access to these tools. That will make competing platforms that perform similar tasks less attractive -- particularly those platforms that people need to pay to use.\n\nIn other words, Apple's AI overhaul helps strengthen its ecosystem, making it more appealing to those already in it and to those on the outside looking in. It may also incentivize existing Apple customers to upgrade, since only those with new enough devices will have access to these tools. Many people won't see a need to shell out for a new iPhone to get a crack at some AI features, but some almost certainly will. It will be interesting to see whether sales of Apple's latest iPhones experience an AI-related boom.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe bigger picture, though, is that Apple's massive customer base grants it a powerful competitive advantage, and anything that makes this ecosystem stronger and stickier is good for its long-term prospects. Apple knows that its future lies in its services segment, the success of which largely depends on its installed base of devices. The services unit has generally grown at a faster rate than the rest of the business for a while now, and its most recently reported quarter was no different.\n\nDuring its fiscal 2024 second quarter, which ended March 30, Apple's revenue dropped 4% year over year to $90.8 billion. But services revenue rose by about 14% to $23.9 billion -- an all-time record for the company.\n\nThis fast-growing high-margin segment will, eventually, have a massive impact on Apple's profits. The advent of Apple Intelligence helps the company move closer to that eventuality. That makes it an excellent reason to buy this tech stock.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "The Small-Cap Showdown: 3 Mighty Stocks Punching Above Their Weight",
        "content": "It’s time to look into small-cap stocks as the mega-cap tech titans have hogged the spotlight, especially in recent weeks, with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) joining the red-hot AI rally with its recent reveal of Apple Intelligence. This may be the generative AI tech of choice once it’s in the palms of iPhone users later this year. Indeed, Apple deserves an “A” grade for how it debuted its most ambitious AI offering to date. Apple’s entry into the AI race also seems to have given a lift to its mega-cap peers in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nWith so much concentration in the mega-caps, questions linger as to how things will ultimately settle. Markets could certainly become even more top-heavy as time goes on. But that doesn’t mean you should ignore the small- and mid-cap companies as they do their best to embrace new technologies and grow their way into investor’s radars.\n\nIn this piece, we’ll look at three small-cap stocks deserving of your attention.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSmall-Cap Stocks: Build-A-Bear Workshop (BBW) Several women walk past a Bath & Body Works (BBWI) retail store.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’ve been to the mall with your kids, you’re probably well aware of Build-A-Bear Workshop (NYSE:BBW), a retail store that allows you to customize and stuff your very own plush animal. Building your own stuffed toy is a great experience worth paying a premium for, even if you’re an adult.\n\nIn recent years, BBW stock has been on a choppy ride higher. At the time of writing, the stock’s up over 333% in the past five years and around 22% in the past year. The market cap sits at a mere $376.1 million.\n\nWith the reintroduction of the incredibly cute Mini Beans collection and collaborations with big brand names, including Pokémon and Disney (NYSE:DIS), I find BBW stock has what it takes to rebound after a rough 19% spill off its recent highs.\n\nWith an ongoing legal battle with Squishmallow, a subsidiary of Jazwares, which itself is a subsidiary of Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B), over allegations that Build-A-Bear “copied” its designs, things could certainly get messy from here. Either way, BBW stock looks super cheap at 7.5 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E). Definitely one of the small-cap stocks to buy, at least in my opinion.\n\nVita Coco (COCO) A line of Vita Coco (COCO) waters on a shelf.\n\nSource: Nicole Glass Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCoconut water maker Vita Coco (NASDAQ:COCO) has been on a hot run since bottoming out back in February 2024, now up more than 57% from those lows. The natural beverage maker has seen blistering growth in recent years. And though there have been dips along the way, COCO stock continues to look like a great small-cap growth stock as it expands its product further, perhaps in a way to disrupt the large-cap beverage firms in the process.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe firm boasts a $1.75 billion market cap, leaving Vita Coco a pretty long runway to take market share from a wide range of rivals. Despite dominating the coconut water market, with a 50% share in the U.S. market, Vita Coco still has the international market to tackle. Additionally, as consumers opt for healthier options in the drink fridge of their local grocery store, I view Vita Coco as having the edge over even the big-name soda makers.\n\nAt 33.89 times trailing P/E, I still view COCO stock as cheap relative to its growth potential. Perhaps new drink categories can help keep growth rates moving back into the high double-digits.\n\nBumble (BMBL) BUMBLE (BMBL) app on a smartphone\n\nSource: XanderSt / Shutterstock.com\n\nBumble (NASDAQ:BMBL) wants to harness the profound power of AI to help daters get better matches or, at the very least, save them a bit of time and heartache. Indeed, the market seems quite skeptical of Bumble’s AI ambitions.\n\nOn one hand, a Bumble-developed AI may help future daters find that perfect someone. However, companies like Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) could implement the same thing. Arguably, Meta’s Facebook looks like it could do a better job of matching since it already has a slew of user data and their relationship statuses.\n\nThough Facebook Dating has been met with limited success, I do think it can improve matching through the power of AI. Given competitive threats in the AI-focused dating world, I just can’t recommend BMBL stock. Not while it’s in a historic funk, with shares down over 85% from peak levels. However, it will be interesting to see how the $1.9 billion company aims to take on some giants in the scene with AI at its side.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held Apple, Disney, and Berkshire Hathaway.

        "content": "Electric vehicle sales are accelerating again, creating an opportunity for some of the top EV stocks to buy.\n\nIn California, for example, about 24% of all new cars sold were electric in the first quarter, according to the California Energy Commission. The state recently approved about $1.9 billion to build 40,000 new public EV chargers to help fuel adoption.\n\nAs for the rest of the country, “Six of the 10 biggest EV makers in the US saw sales grow at a scorching pace compared to a year ago,” says Bloomberg. Even better, “For the rest of 2024, GM appears to be on the brink of becoming the biggest driver of EV growth in the US. The Detroit automaker has committed to electrifying some of its biggest brands, which arefinally reaching production after years of delays.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe International Energy Agency also expects US deliveries to top 2.5 million by 2025 from about 1.1 million in 2024. In short, demand is on the run.\n\nWith that, here are some of the top EV stocks to buy that should accelerate with better sales.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center.

Granted, sales have slipped but it’s still dominating the market.”\n\nThat was on May 20, as Tesla traded at about $175. Today, it’s up to $191.08, which is still an attractive buy, especially with EV sales regaining momentum. From that last traded price, I’d like to see Tesla initially retest $205.\n\nHelping, Wedbush analysts say the $56 billion Elon Musk compensation removes a $20 to $25 overhang on the TSLA stock. That’s because the award now dispels fears Musk will focus on other projects outside of Tesla, including a generative artificial intelligence project. With this, Wedbush has a $275 price target on TSLA shares.\n\nPlus, Tesla’s market dominance is only expected to become stronger.\n\nAs noted by QZ.com, “While Tesla was out selling 50,000 new EVs, Ford was struggling to hit 10,000 EVs sold in second place. Behind it was Hyundai, which shifted 5,686 electric cars in March and BMW sold 4,246 electric models.”\n\nBYD Co. (BYDDF) Close-up of BYD (BYDDY) logo on red car, symbolizing BYDDY stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Trygve Finkelsen\n\nThe last time I mentioned BYD Co. (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), it traded at $24 on May 22.\n\nAt the time I noted, “From its last traded price of $28, I’d like to see it break above prior resistance at $32 a share. The company noted passenger vehicle sales were up 23.64% YTD to 936,446, with electric sales up about 18% to 434,579.”\n\nStory continues\n\nNow up to $29.05, it’s still a buy.\n\nAnalysts at Citi just opened a 30-day upside catalyst watch on the BYD stock with lower-than-feared European Union tariffs and stronger domestic demand.\n\n“The lower tariff bodes well for BYD’s market share gain in the EU, Citibank analysts said. They also forecast that BYD’s exports to the EU will account for one-fourth to one-third of its overall sales in 2024,” added Investint.com. “The brokerage also flagged strength in domestic sales, with BYD seeing strong order intake in recent weeks, which heralds stronger sales in the second and third quarter.”\n\nGlobal X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (DRIV) White electric car connected to power station charger on green background 3D Rendering. Electric vehicles, EVs, EV stocks.\n\nSource: Ilija Erceg / Shutterstock\n\nOr, if you want greater exposure to autonomous and other top EV stocks to buy at less cost, there’s the Global X Autonomous & Electric Vehicles ETF (NASDAQ:DRIV).\n\nThe last time I highlighted an opportunity in the DRIV ETF, it traded at $23.22 in April. Now at $24.08, it’s still a buy.\n\nFrom here, if EV sales momentum can improve, if we see more charging stations installed, and if the Federal Reserve does cut interest rates, electric vehicle stocks and ETFs, like DRIV, could accelerate to higher highs. In addition, with an expense ratio of 0.68%, the ETF currently invests in 45 stocks involved in the development of autonomous vehicle technology, electric vehicles and EV components and materials.\n\nSome of its top 75 fund holdings include Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Toyota(NYSE:TM), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Tesla, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL),Honeywell (NASDAQ:HON), Stellantis(NYSE:STLA) and Honda Motor (NYSE:HMC) to name a few.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Prediction: 3 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Nvidia 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "We can probably all agree that the world will look different in 2034. However, much will likely remain more or less the same as it is today.\n\nFor example, I expect Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) will still be one of the world's biggest and most influential companies. Despite my optimism about the AI chip leader, though, I don't think it will be the biggest company in the world. I predict these three stocks will be worth more than Nvidia 10 years from now.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) ranked as the world's largest company based on market cap throughout most of the last decade. It lost the top spot for a while and even fell into third place behind Nvidia for a brief period. However, Apple is again neck and neck in vying for the No. 1 position. I predict it will firmly hold this perch in 2034.\n\nYou might say Apple was a sleeping giant for a while with generative AI. The company didn't jump on the bandwagon like several other technology leaders did after OpenAI released its wildly popular ChatGPT. That's no longer the case.\n\nSome viewed Apple's new AI functionality that was revealed at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) earlier this week as underwhelming. On the other hand, many investors seemed to see Apple Intelligence (the name the company gave to its generative AI products and services) as a likely catalyst for a new iPhone upgrade super cycle.\n\nOne thing is certain: Apple is no longer asleep at the wheel with anything AI-related. I fully expect that the company will dominate edge AI (running AI on devices rather than in the cloud). I would also bet that its services business will continue to grow rapidly.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) has gone back and forth with Apple as the world's largest company. Although I don't think Microsoft will ultimately hang on to the top spot, I expect the company to remain larger than Nvidia 10 years from now.\n\nProbably the biggest reason for my prediction about Microsoft is its relationship with OpenAI. The huge tech company's impressive gains since early last year have been largely due to its integration of OpenAI's large language model (LLM) throughout its product lineup. I expect OpenAI to remain one of the leading innovators in AI. As a result, I think Microsoft will continue to profit from its relationship with the AI pioneer.\n\nI also look for Microsoft's cloud unit to have more sources for AI chips in the future, including its own custom silicon. If I'm right, this should boost the company's profitability as the laws of supply and demand work their magic on lowering chip prices. As Microsoft's earnings go, so go its stock price and market cap -- at least over the long term. In addition, increased competition could prevent Nvidia from dethroning Microsoft and Apple.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Alphabet\n\nAlphabet's (NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) market cap lags well behind Nvidia's right now. Since I've included the stock on this list, I obviously anticipate that will change. Why?\n\nFor one thing, Alphabet's Google DeepMind rivals OpenAI. I think the two leaders will remain neck and neck in advancing AI over the coming years. While some see AI as an existential threat to Google Search, I predict Alphabet will be successful in blending search with generative AI. Its Google Cloud business should also benefit from new sources of AI chips, just as Microsoft will.\n\nI like the prospects for Alphabet's Waymo self-driving car unit. By 2034, Waymo could be a significant growth driver for the company with the rising adoption of robotaxis.\n\nAlphabet could also achieve major breakthroughs in quantum computing over the next 10 years. Google Quantum Computing believes it could achieve its goal of developing a \"useful, error-corrected quantum computer\" within this decade.\n\nThis could make Alphabet an even more formidable player in AI because of the ability of quantum computers to process data much faster than traditional computers.\n\nDon't count Nvidia out, though\n\nAlthough I predict Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet will be bigger than Nvidia 10 years from now, I wouldn't count Nvidia out. My assumption is that other chipmakers will be in a better position to challenge it over the coming years. If the company continues to out-innovate all of its rivals, though, that might not happen.\n\nI think Apple, Microsoft, and Alphabet are great stocks for long-term investors. But Nvidia is, too.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Warren Buffett Is Selling Apple Stock and Buying This Brilliant Mega-Cap Stock Instead",
        "content": "Warren Buffett, CEO of Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B), bears responsibility for \"major investment decisions and all major capital allocation decisions\" made by the company, according to financial filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nWith that in mind, Berkshire sold 116 million shares of Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) in the March quarter, reducing its stake by 13%. Apple still accounts for 40% of its $336 billion portfolio, but the company has now trimmed the position in two consecutive quarters. Meanwhile, Buffett purchased another mega-cap stock he believes will outperform the S&P 500(SNPINDEX: ^GSPC) index.\n\nRead on to learn more.\n\nApple: The stock Warren Buffett was selling\n\nApple benefits from brand authority and pricing power. Its ecosystem of appealing hardware, proprietary software, and integrated services creates a user experience for which people will pay a premium. Indeed, 80% of iPhones are priced above $800, while just 22% of Samsung (Android) smartphones are in the same range, according to the International Data Corporation (IDC).\n\nApple has a particularly strong presence in the smartphone market. The iPhone accounted for 20% of smartphone shipments by volume last year, up from 14% in 2019, according to IDC. But Apple also has a strong presence in the tablet, personal computer, and smartwatch markets, among other consumer electronics verticals. In total, its installed base exceeds 2.2 billion active devices.\n\nApple monetizes its installed base with adjacent services. That includes fees for iCloud storage, App Store downloads, and subscription products like Apple TV+, as well as advertising and financial services like Apple Pay. Importantly, Apple's greatest growth prospects lie in services, because services revenue is growing more quickly than hardware revenue and services earn higher margins than hardware.\n\nApple reported disappointing financial results in the second quarter of fiscal 2024 (ended March 30). Revenue fell 4% to $90.8 billion due to a 10% decline in iPhone sales offset by a 14% increase in services sales. Meanwhile, GAAP net income dropped 2% to $23.6 billion, though the company managed to grow earnings per share with stock buybacks.\n\nThe problem with Apple is valuation. Wall Street expects earnings per share to grow at 10.6% annually over the next three to five years. If that number is divided into its current price-to-earnings ratio of 33.1, the result is a high price/earnings-to-growth (PEG) ratio of 3.1. That is a significant premium to the three-year average of 2.4, which may explain why Buffett trimmed Berkshire's stake.\n\nStory continues\n\nBerkshire Hathaway: The stock Warren Buffett was buying\n\nThe mega-cap stock Buffett bought during the first quarter was none other than Berkshire Hathaway. Specifically, he spent $2.6 billion on share buybacks during Q1 2024, building on $9.2 billion in share buybacks in 2023. Buffett has now repurchased Berkshire stock in every quarter since Q4 2018, which tallies up to 22 consecutive quarters.\n\nThat is consequential because the repurchase agreement stipulates that Buffett can only buy Berkshire stock when he \"believes that the repurchase price is below Berkshire's intrinsic value, conservatively determined.\" In other words, Buffett believes the stock has consistently traded at a discount to its true value for several years.\n\nBerkshire is a compelling investment for three reasons. First, its insurance subsidiaries generate cash in the form of premiums, and Buffett has historically earned good returns by investing that capital. Berkshire's book value per share increased at 11.1% annually over the last decade, while the S&P 500 returned 10.9% annually during the same period. Changes in book value per share are a good proxy for changes in intrinsic value, so the implication is that Berkshire gained value more quickly than the S&P 500 over the last decade.\n\nSecond, Berkshire owns dozens of subsidiaries that operate across a diverse range of industries, including insurance, freight rail transportation, energy, retail, and utilities. Many of those wholly owned businesses provide goods and services that are essential in any economic environment, such that Berkshire has historically outperformed the S&P 500 during bear markets, as shown in the chart below.\n\nBear Market Start Date S&P 500 Maximum Decline Berkshire Hathaway Maximum Decline March 2000 (49%) (24%) October 2007 (57%) (54%) February 2020 (34%) (30%) January 2022 (25%) (27%) Average (41%) (34%)\n\nData source: Yardeni Research, Ycharts.\n\nThird, Warren Buffett has great confidence in Berkshire. \"[W]ith our present mix of businesses, Berkshire should do a bit better than the average American corporation and, more important, should also operate with materially less risk of permanent loss of capital,\" he wrote in his latest shareholder letter. The S&P 500 is synonymous with the U.S. stock market and, therefore, a benchmark for the average American corporation. So Buffett is saying Berkshire should safely outpace the S&P 500 over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Billionaire Investor Warren Buffett Has 41% of Berkshire Hathaway's $332 Billion Portfolio in 2 Unstoppable Artificial Intelligence (AI) Growth Stocks",
        "content": "At one time, Berkshire Hathaway CEO Warren Buffett avoided technology stocks at all costs, reasoning that he had difficulty grasping complicated technology. The iconic investor was clear about his preferences for investing in \"simple businesses,\" saying, \"If there's lots of technology, we won't understand it.\"\n\nOver the years, however, that stance has changed. Today, more than 41% of Berkshire's equity portfolio is made up of two stocks poised to profit from the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\n1. Apple -- $135 billion\n\nInvestors who have followed Berkshire Hathaway for any period of time will know that the company's largest AI stock is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). While the initial stake in the iPhone maker was made by one of Buffett's money managers, the so-called \"Oracle of Omaha\" soon saw the attraction and began accumulating shares on his own. To close out the first quarter, Buffett's stake in Apple amounted to 789 million shares worth roughly $135 billion.\n\nWhile Apple has long been on the cutting edge of AI technology, the company kept its plans for generative AI close to the vest -- until recently. At Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week, the company ripped the lid off its plans, introducing \"Apple Intelligence,\" a comprehensive strategy to integrate generative AI functionality into a broad cross-section of its products and services. This includes features across messages, photos, notes, and even notifications.\n\nThe most notable development is that Siri will be getting a long-awaited makeover. Not only will the digital assistant get a generative AI boost, but it will also be able to interact with apps on the iPhone and other devices, making it much more useful along the way.\n\nThe company was quick to point out that all this new functionality will come with Apple's characteristic privacy built-in, performing many of the AI processes on-device, helping to protect user information. Access to ChatGPT will be coming later this year, giving users the option to engage the chatbot for specific purposes.\n\nWall Street is almost universal in its delight at Apple's plans. The general consensus is that these improvements will spark an upgrade \"supercycle.\" As many as 270 million of Apple's 1.5 billion active iPhones are at least four years old, and this could be the catalyst behind the next iPhone buying spree.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives predicts that Apple will sell between 225 million and 230 iPhones this year. At an average selling price of more than $900, the company could easily hit a new record for iPhone revenue.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat would be good news for Buffett and thousands of other Apple investors.\n\n2. Amazon -- $1.8 billion\n\nBuffett has admitted that he \"always admired Jeff [Bezos],\" Amazon's (NASDAQ: AMZN) former CEO. He also issued a mea culpa, saying he \"blew it,\" passing up two opportunities to invest in the e-commerce and cloud computing leader. He cited the \"miracle\" of the company's growth as putting him off because \"If I think something is going to be a miracle, I tend not to bet on it.\"\n\nAt the behest of one of Buffett's money managers, Berkshire Hathaway finally corrected that oversight and now holds a considerable stake in Amazon. The company holds 10 million shares in a stake currently valued at nearly $1.8 billion.\n\nAmazon has a long history of developing advanced algorithms to advance its business, creating tools to recommend products, map out delivery routes, and maintain accurate inventory levels to meet demand.\n\nCurrently, the company offers a suite of AI-powered products and services on its industry-leading cloud infrastructure platform, Amazon Web Services (AWS). This represents one of the company's largest opportunities, as infusing AWS with AI-powered features could be a catalyst for future cloud growth.\n\nIs it time to buy?\n\nInvestors were recently alarmed that Berkshire sold 13% of its Apple shares earlier this year. Some believed that Buffett had soured on Apple, but Buffett pushed back on the idea. He said the current corporate tax rate -- currently at 21% -- was historically low, compared to rates of 35% or 52% in recent memory.\n\n\"I would say that at the end of the year, I would think it extremely likely that Apple is the largest common stock holding we have,\" Buffett insisted. He went even further, saying that \"unless something really extraordinary happens,\" Berkshire will still hold a significant position in Apple \"when Greg takes over the place.\" Buffett was referring to his designated successor, Greg Abel. This suggests Apple will remain a foundational investor for Berkshire for the foreseeable future.\n\nApple's recent foray into generative AI, the pent-up demand, and the stickiness of its product portfolio suggest that the stock is still a buy.\n\nThe recent economic downturn and ongoing battle with inflation have weighed on Amazon, but the company is on the road to recovery. Its e-commerce business has returned to growth, and demand for its digital advertising and cloud services is on the upswing. Despite recent challenges, it remains the world's largest provider of e-commerce and cloud infrastructure services, which is why Amazon is also a buy.\n\nThe adoption of generative AI continues to accelerate, though no one knows for sure how high it will go. Estimates suggest that generative AI could have an economic impact of between $2.6 trillion and $4.4 trillion in the coming years, according to global management consulting firm McKinsey & Company.\n\nWith a windfall of that magnitude, Buffett's stake in these AI stocks could be about to get much more valuable.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "2 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks That Could Make You a Millionaire",
        "content": "Interest in artificial intelligence (AI) skyrocketed last year after the launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. The generative chatbot astounded the tech world with its ability to produce human-like dialogue based on prompts. OpenAI's platform highlighted just how far AI has advanced and its potential to boost countless industries.\n\nAs a result, dozens of tech companies ventured into AI and enjoyed major stock gains for their efforts. Companies like Nvidia and Amazon have seen their stocks climb 228% and 45% over the last 12 months, thanks to dominating positions in their respective areas of AI.\n\nHowever, the market is vast and appears to have plenty of room left to run, projected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% until at least 2030. Consequently, it could be worth investing in a company that is still in the early stages of its AI journey and could deliver significant growth in the coming years as the industry develops.\n\nHere are two AI stocks that could make you a millionaire if you're willing to wait.\n\n1. Intel\n\nShares in Intel(NASDAQ: INTC) have risen more than 115,000% since its initial public offering in 1971. The company was once the biggest name in chips and has undoubtedly created many millionaires in its time. However, the last decade has challenged the tech giant, with its stock down 3% alongside tumbles in revenue.\n\nYet, recent developments suggest a recovery is underway, with Intel an increasingly attractive way to invest in AI. The chipmaker's fall from grace and changes in the tech market forced Intel to rethink its business model. The company is reshaping its business around the semiconductor foundry market, an industry projected to more than double its 2022 valuation and hit $232 billion by 2032.\n\nIntel kicked off its foundry expansion by beginning construction on chip factories around the world, with its primary focus being the U.S. The company plans to build at least four American manufacturing facilities. On June 11, Intel temporarily delayed construction on a plant in Israel as it works to proceed with its multibillion-dollar investment at a slower pace and keep finances in check. The move comes after Intel announced it would sell a 49% stake in its Irish plant for $11 billion.\n\nChip manufacturing plants won't come cheap but could pay off over the long term, especially regarding Intel's position in AI. While rivals like Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices are prioritizing chip design and outsourcing much of their manufacturing, Intel could have a lucrative opportunity to become one of the biggest AI chip fabricators in the world.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, Intel's shares are trading at 28 times its forward earnings, significantly lower than Nvidia's 48 and AMD's 46. The figures indicate Intel's stock is potentially the biggest bargain in AI chips. In addition to a promising shift in its business model, Intel is a stock that could make you a millionaire over the long term.\n\n2. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) was slower than many of its rivals in joining the AI race. As AI-driven companies like Microsoft and Amazon have seen their stock pop 33% and 45% since last June, Apple's has risen a more moderate 16%. However, the company's more gradual venture into AI isn't out of the norm for the consumer tech giant.\n\nApple hasn't necessarily found success being first to a technology. The company instead tends to stand by the sidelines as it observes the competition, perfecting its own version and then launching a product that catapults it to the top of the industry. The tech giant has used this strategy to dominate smartphones, tablets, headphones, and smartwatches.\n\nOther companies led these industries before Apple landed on the scene, yet have mostly fallen by the wayside. Now, Apple appears to be employing a similar strategy to AI. The iPhone maker hosted its Worldwide Developer Conference on June 10, debuting its new AI platform, Apple Intelligence. The company's stock  spiked 12% since the announcement, allowing it to surpass Microsoft and retake its position as the world's most valuable company by market cap.\n\nApple Intelligence will launch in September and bring AI upgrades across the company's product lineup, including iPhone 15 Pro Models and Macs and iPads equipped with M1 through M4 chips. New features like language and image generation, a smarter Siri, and editing tools will elevate Apple's offerings with AI. Meanwhile, the new features could motivate many consumers to upgrade to the company's newer devices to gain access to the AI tools.\n\nApple's stock isn't a huge bargain, with its forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio at 33. However, compared to Microsoft's forward P/E of 37 and Amazon's 40, Apple is a far better value if you're looking to invest in AI. The company is only just getting started in the industry and could be worth investing in before it's too late.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Intel right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Intel, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Intel wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "By Foo Yun Chee\n\nBRUSSELS (Reuters) - Apple and Meta Platforms will likely face charges for failing to comply with landmark EU rules aimed at reining in their power before the summer, three people with direct knowledge of the matter said on Friday.\n\nThe European Commission, which launched investigations into the two companies and Alphabet's Google in March under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), sees Apple and Meta as priority cases, the people said.\n\nThe DMA requires Big Tech to open up space for smaller rivals to compete and make it easier for people to move between competing online services like social media platforms, internet browsers and app stores.\n\nEU regulators will issue preliminary findings which are similar to antitrust charges before the summer break in August, with Apple the first to be charged, followed by Meta, the sources said.\n\nThe Commission and Meta declined to comment. Apple referred to its March statement where it said that it was confident that its plan complies with the DMA and that it continues to constructively engage with the Commission.\n\nCompanies can offer remedies to address concerns laid out in the findings before a final decision expected before EU antitrust chief Margrethe Vestager leaves office in November, which could include fines up to 10% of a company's global annual turnover for breaches.\n\nThe EU investigation targets Apple's steering rules, which regulators say impose limitations that hinder app developers from informing users about offers outside its App Store free of charge, and also its new fees levied on apps developers.\n\nEU regulators are expected to charge Apple related to this issue, the people said, adding that a second investigation focusing on its choice screen for its Safari web browser will likely take more time.\n\nThe preliminary finding on Meta focuses on its recently introduced pay or consent model where users pay a subscription fee for an ad-free Facebook and Instagram, the people said.\n\nThe FT was the first to report that Apple would face EU charges.\n\n(Reporting by Foo Yun Chee; Editing by Jan Harvey)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "A soft reading from Wednesday’s consumer price index report for May sent U.S. equities on a tear. The overall inflation reading from the Bureau of Labor Statistics came in flat, marking the first time in nearly two years. The drop in prices was largely related to a sizable fall in gas prices. Moreover, the core consumer price index, which excludes volatility from food and energy prices, only ticked up 0.2% on a sequential basis, which was below most estimates from economists. From a year-over-year perspective, prices rose 3.3% while the core rose 3.4%, the lowest the figure has been since April 2021.\n\nOn the same day, U.S. Federal Reserve officials released a new dot plot with their rates forecast. It indicated only a single 0.25% rate cut versus the three we had seen in a previous forecast back in December. That is to say, the Fed is still remaining cautious, but the market is finding reason to celebrate. The S&P500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite have reached new highs: the former gaining 14.5% for the year, while the latter climbed 18.8%.\n\nA broad surge in stock prices creates a fertile ground for short-term lucrative bets. Below are three of the best stocks to buy in June for the short term.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir (PLTR) Palantir (PLTR) company logo on the screen of smartphone\n\nSource: Mamun sheikh K / Shutterstock.com\n\nPeter Thiel-cofounded data analytics giant Palantir (NYSE:PLTR) has, for the most part, had a decent trading session in 2024. As of the end of trading on Wednesday, PLTR rallied about 37.3% on a year-to-date basis. The stock appeared to be on a meteoric rally in the first quarter but has leveled off.\n\nInvestors are awaiting more news on the growth of the firm’s new AI Platform (AIP). Palantir released AIP in the second quarter of 2023, and the financials for its commercial business were extremely positive as a result. In essence, AIP embeds large language models (LLMs) into existing software products, Gotham and Foundry, in order to help enterprises gain critical insights from the data those products process.\n\nUnfortunately, a weak guidance reading from Palantir’s first-quarter earnings report for 2024 put shares of the data analytics firm into a sort of lull. The good reading from Wednesday’s CPI report could help to revitalize the momentum Palantir’s stock had at the beginning of the year. However, the long-term potential of AIP will determine how PLTR will perform in the following quarters.\n\nTesla (TSLA) An image of a Tesla EV charger\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) shares have had a terrible year. The U.S.-based electric vehicle (EV) behemoth, with polemic figure Elon Musk at the helm, has experienced a cataclysmic 27% plummet in its share price since the start of this year’s trading session. Even when Musk warned investors about a deceleration of the EV maker’s growth in 2024, nothing could have prepared investors for Tesla’s worst-performing Q1 in years. In particular, Tesla delivered 386,810 vehicles in the first quarter, representing an 8.5% year-over-year drop.\n\nStory continues\n\nAll the while, Chinese EV competitors, including BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDY), Li Auto (NASDAQ:LI) and even mobile handset manufacturer Xiaomi (OTCMKTS:XIACY), are giving the U.S. automaker a run for its money. In May, Tesla continued to lose ground in China, its second-largest market, due to the intensifying competition there.\n\nThere may be a silver lining for TSLA shareholders, though. Signs of moderating inflation could help shares recover. Not to mention, Tesla is still a well-known name in the stock market, and retail investors will probably clamor to buy up shares this summer, creating a viable opportunity to generate short-term returns.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo brand and text sign on entrance facade store American multinational boutique corporation dealership shop. Apple Layoffs\n\nSource: sylv1rob1 / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is another tech giant that did not start the year off great. The iPhone maker shares have fallen as much as 15% in 2024, though it has recovered since then. Ongoing woes in China, the tech firm’s second largest market that has seen competition intensify with the resurgence of Huawei, coupled with an over-saturated handset market have slowed down top-line growth. The company and its shareholders are betting that AI will somehow pull Apple out of its doldrum.\n\nThis week, besides the CPI report, Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) captured headlines. The iPhone maker unveiled a partnership with OpenAI, the startup behind ChatGPT and the advanced LLMs running it, and a new set of features under Apple Intelligence. This new technology suite will help users summarize text, create original images and retrieve relevant data. After the announcement, AAPL soared more than 7%, and subsequent near-term gains are possible, especially with an improving macro environment.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. investors finally have a roadmap for how it will use artificial intelligence — and they’ve responded by pushing the stock toward its best week in more than two years.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for ‘Simulation of Keyboard Activity’ Tesla Investors Get Behind Musk’s Fight for $56 Billion Pay Deal Apple to ‘Pay’ OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad’s Reaction Was Remarkable. Luxury Labels Slash Prices 50% to Lure Wary Chinese Shoppers\n\nWall Street is betting that new iPhone AI features — including Apple’s agreement with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT — will spur a massive upgrade cycle among users who have been holding on to older devices.\n\nInvestors have “more confidence that Apple is back in the game, that it has caught up competitively, and that it will see a re-acceleration of growth, given the installed base of phones that will need to upgrade to take advantage of this new tech,” said Jim Awad, senior managing director at Clearstead Advisors. “Apple will be a major beneficiary of AI, and the stock is catching up.”\n\nWall Street’s top stocks have quickly re-shuffled on AI optimism. Apple on Thursday overtook Microsoft Corp. as the biggest company by market capitalization. Apple was third-largest as recently as Monday, trailing behind $3.2 trillion Nvidia Corp, and Microsoft, which held pole position since January.\n\nThe iPhone maker is set for its biggest one-week percentage gain since 2021, climbing to a fresh record high. Since an April trough, the stock has added more than $700 billion in market value. Buy ratings on the stock are near the most since 2017.\n\nWhile seen as short on surprises, Apple’s event eased concerns that have weighed on the stock this year. Wall Street had fretted that the firm lacked an AI strategy, especially since its growth has been wanting compared with other megacaps, and its valuation is elevated. That has kept a lid on share-price gains; among the Magnificent Seven, only Tesla Inc. — down 27% — has seen a weaker performance.\n\nRevenue fell 4.3% in Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters. Despite that, it trades at about 30 times estimated earnings, above its long-term average and the roughly 27 times multiple of the Nasdaq 100 Index.\n\nThe iPhone is by far Apple’s biggest business, accounting for more than half its fiscal 2023 revenue, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. However, iPhone revenue fell 2% last year, a reflection of how millions are holding onto their phones for longer. AI, bulls argue, represents the kind of must-have features that will prompt them to trade up.\n\nStory continues\n\n“People who weren’t excited about the initial announcement are fast becoming believers that AI is the innovation that will spur the next cycle of iPhone sales,” said Robert Pavlik, senior portfolio manager at Dakota Wealth Management. “We have to be realistic, and it will take time to see confirmation in the numbers, but AI has the potential to create the kind of growth that will make the stock look cheap.”\n\nThe pool of users who might be in the market for an upgrade is potentially massive. According to Bloomberg Intelligence, over 40% of Apple’s 800 million-plus smartphone devices are iPhone 12 or older, with another 27% of users on an iPhone 13. Fewer than 10% of current users have phones that can be upgraded to the AI software.\n\n“Older stuff will be obsolete if you want AI,” wrote Melius Research analyst Ben Reitzes. Given the allure of AI, “we now have more conviction in our Super Cycle thesis that could even result in iPhone revenue growth of about 20% for up to 2 years.”\n\nThe prospect of an iPhone refresh cycle has also lifted Apple suppliers. Skyworks Solutions Inc. is up 17% this week, its biggest one-week percentage gain in four years, while Cirrus Logic Inc. has hit records. Qorvo Inc. is seeing its best week since 2020.\n\nThe integration of features such as enhanced search, enhanced photo editing and text generation “will drive much broader adoption of AI than we have seen to date,” wrote D.A. Davidson analyst Gil Luria, who raised his rating to buy. “Apple is uniquely positioned to offer these capabilities, and may be the only one capable of doing so any time soon.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nThe massive size of Apple, Microsoft, and Nvidia are a key reason why tech has become so dominant in equity indexes. The S&P 500’s tech sector represents a staggering 32.6% of the overall benchmark index. That’s the highest ratio since 2000, around the dot-com era, and up from a recent low of less than 29% from April. The trio of $3 trillion stocks together account for about 21% of the S&P 500.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nTesla Inc. investors voted for Chief Executive Officer Elon Musk’s compensation package and moving the company’s state of incorporation to Texas, signaling confidence in his leadership despite slumping sales and a precipitous drop in the stock price. Adobe Inc. shares are set for their biggest gain in about four years after projecting strong future sales for its creative products, suggesting customers are adopting the company’s new artificial intelligence-based tools. The French government has offered to buy some of Atos SE’s operations in its big data and security unit for an enterprise value of €700 million ($751 million) as part of discussions to restructure the embattled IT company. Crypto billionaires and their allies have amassed a $160 million war chest to protect their fortunes by bolstering US candidates who favor light-touch regulation of the embattled industry. Snowflake Inc. plans to close its own investigation this week into a hacking campaign that ensnared as many as 165 of its customers.\n\n--With assistance from Michael Msika.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Best AI Stock After WWDC AI Announcements?",
        "content": "We recently published a list of 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. Since Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nThe Federal Reserve now expects just one rate cut in this year, and the market’s reaction to this development has been calmer-than-expected, showing investors are now paying little to no attention to what the Fed does and instead have their eyes focused on AI, which continues to push the markets higher. Tech companies, small and large, are continuing to roll out AI-focused products and solutions, while funds are pouring billions into AI.  SoftBank has recently committed another $5 billion in AI investments for 5 companies ($1 billion each). A Wall Street Journal report cited SoftBank’s CFO, who said the bank’s chief Masayoshi Son was taking a “break from quarterly earnings meetings so he could focus on AI.”\n\nIn this backdrop it’s important to stay ahead of the curve and see what’s happening in the AI space.\n\nIn this article we will take a look at some of the biggest AI stock ratings updates and stories which can’t be missed. We focused on AI stocks that are popular among the smart money investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is the Biggest AI Story and Rating Update You Should Not Miss This Week\n\nCopyright: dennizn / 123RF Stock Photo\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares are trending as the company announced a slew of AI products and features at its much-awaited WWDC conference.\n\nWedbush’s Dan Ives also thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But if Apple can really execute its AI strategy well, the company can become the next favorite AI stock of the Street.\n\nTF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Consumers may find purchasing Microsoft’s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,” Kuo said.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th on Insider Monkey’s list titled 10 Biggest AI Stories and Ratings Updates You Should Not Miss This Week. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple, our conviction lies in the belief that under the radar AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "title": "ETFs in Focus as Apple Reclaims Most Valuable Title",
        "content": "Apple Inc. AAPL has regained its position as the world’s most valuable company, topping Microsoft Corp. MSFT. This achievement marks a significant milestone, driven by Apple's recent announcement related to its generative AI initiative called “Apple Intelligence” (read: Bet on \"Apple Intelligence\" With These ETFs).\n\nThese potential AI initiatives generated optimism about future iPhone generations and likely revenue increases. Apple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro, iPads, and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer models starting this fall. This could even result in a rebound in iPhone sales following recent declines in fiscal performance.\n\nMarket Capitalization and Recent Performance\n\nThanks to investor optimism surrounding its growth prospects, particularly in AI, Apple just logged its best three-day run since 2020, per Bloomberg. Following a robust rally, Apple closed with a market capitalization of $3.285 trillion on Jun 13, 2024, narrowly surpassing Microsoft at $3.282 trillion.\n\nThis is the first time since January that Apple has exceeded Microsoft in market value, reflecting recent reshufflings among Wall Street’s top stocks. In fact, earlier in the week, Apple briefly fell behind Nvidia Corp. NVDA in market capitalization. However, investors have shown confidence in Apple's potential as a likely AI winner, fueling its recent gains.\n\nAnalyst Insights\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan highlighted the potential of AI functionalities to drive a significant upgrade cycle for Apple, potentially raising average selling prices and boosting revenue in the coming years, as quoted on Bloomberg.\n\nPrice Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 30 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $206.96. The forecasts range from a low of $164.00 to a high of $275.00. And the current price of Apple is $214.24.\n\nWhat Lies Ahead?\n\nSo far, Apple’s AI initiatives have been well-received by investors. However, stiff competition awaits Apple in the AI space. Stocks with more direct exposure to AI, such as Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc., have shown stronger performance in 2024. Nvidia, in particular, has seen immense gains due to its prominent role in AI development.\n\nPlus, Apple’s association With ChatGPT has received a mixed response. Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight, and Tesla chief Elon Musk believe that ChatGPT integration may create deeper problems for the firm, as quoted on BBC.\n\nInvestors should note that Apple’s competitors have faced several AI hiccups during the initial phase of the rollout. Apple might also experience similar hiccups. Hence, it is better to track the company with the ETF approach. The basket approach minimizes the company-specific concentration risks.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple-heavy ETFs include the likes of Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, iShares Global Tech ETF IXN and iShares U.S. Technology ETF IYW. Incidentally, these ETFs have solid exposure to Microsoft—the second-most valuable company and an AI winner.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "The AI Architects: 3 Stocks Designing the Blueprint for the Future",
        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has existed for many years. However, it’s rapidly becoming something that existed on the fringes to an integral part of our daily lives. That’s why this is the time for investors to look for AI stocks that will shape the future.\n\nFor some investors, investing in AI stocks means looking at the big names like Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). And let’s be clear: those companies will be leaders in AI for years to come.\n\nBut those stocks are known quantities that buy-and-hold investors have followed for years. AI may enhance their value, but it doesn’t change what the company is. If you’re looking for companies that will deliver AI in ways that we might not fully appreciate yet, you have to expand the field of stocks and sectors you’re looking at. Here are three AI stocks that are helping to design the blueprint for the future.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) Palantir logo on the smartphone and the company share price on the day of opening the trade October 1, 2020. Palantir valued at $15.8bn in stock market debut. PLTR stock\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIt’s a bold statement to make that Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) may be the most important company in the world. But the company continues to show retail investors why Dan ives of Wedbush referred to Palantir as the Lionel Messi of AI.\n\nAs investors seek to understand why Palantir continues to win contracts in the public and private sectors, they are learning how Palantir’s unique semantic model (i.e., its ontology) sits on top of the digital assets in its platforms, which allows the company to set a standard that other companies can’t meet.\n\nDespite qualifying for inclusion in the S&P 500 index in late 2023, Palantir was rebuffed for the index for the second time in June. However, if the company continues to deliver on its promise, that will only be a matter of time. And while institutional investors own just 45% of the float, it’s a good time for retail investors to accumulate shares.\n\nZillow Group (ZG) The zillow app on a screen\n\nSource: OpturaDesign / Shutterstock.com\n\nZillow Group (NASDAQ:ZG) is a digitized real estate platform that took off during the great relocation but has come crashing down to earth as interest rates moved from near zero to just over 5%.\n\nAs the latest inflation readings come in, it should be clear to investors that higher inflation will be around for some time. That means that the Fed funds rate and mortgage rates will stay near their current levels for some time as well.\n\nHowever, the housing market is starting to show some resilience. It doesn’t have a choice. While phrases such as “the new normal” are becoming tiresome, there’s no denying that supply and demand issues represent a frustrating status quo that buyers must navigate.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a digitally native company, Zillow is well-positioned to use AI to aid the buying experience. The company says that AI is at the core of its platform, which turns data into insights and engaging user experiences.\n\nPlanet Labs (PL) Chatbot conversation Ai Artificial Intelligence technology online customer service. Digital chatbot, robot application, OpenAI generate. financial investment stock market. Virtual assistant on internet. AI stocks\n\nSource: khunkornStudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you’re looking for AI stocks that will define the future, you must look at the space sector. Planet Labs (NYSE:PL) is one of the companies in this sector already using AI to provide a competitive advantage. The company uses space, specifically satellite imagery, to help its customers better understand Earth. And AI is at the core of that.\n\nPlanet Labs provides its customers with geospatial tools that facilitate various services. AI is at the core of everything from satellite image analysis, pattern recognition and anomaly detection to predictive analysis and tracking objects of interest.\n\nThis is a tiny company with a market cap of just over $500 million. It qualifies as a penny stock, with shares trading for right around $2 as of June 12, 2024. But the company is growing revenue at a nice clip, and the 11 analysts that cover the stock give it a consensus price target of $4.49, which would give risk-tolerant investors a compelling 119% gain.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris Markoch had a LONG position in PLTR. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris Markoch is a freelance financial copywriter who has been covering the market for over five years. He has been writing for InvestorPlace since 2019.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "The 3 Best Metaverse Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "The metaverse is still alive and well, creating big opportunities for some of the best metaverse stocks to buy. IKEA, for example, is launching a virtual universe on Roblox (NYSE:RBLX). Its “The Co-Worker Game,” which will allow users “to live their home furnishing dreams and get paid for it.” Users inside the game will be able to virtually help customers and get promoted, just like in the real world.\n\nA McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD) metaverse just debuted in Singapore, which will allow users to build virtual burgers, envision future McDonald’s restaurant designs and participate in contests that will reward users with real food deals and prizes.\n\nHugo Boss (OTCMKTS:BOSSY) is heading to the metaverse with Roblox to market to Generation Z. Nike (NYSE:NKE) is working with Roblox with its virtual world. Adidas (OTCMKTS:ADDYY) is working with Roblox, too.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAccording to Market.us, the metaverse market could be worth about $2.3 trillion by 2032. That being said, investors should consider jumping into some of the best metaverse stocks to buy. Here are three you may want to invest in now.\n\nRoblox (RBLX) A smartphone displaying a web page for Roblox Corp (RBLX).\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nOne of the top metaverse stocks to buy is Roblox. Granted, recent earnings and full-year booking forecasts weren’t so hot. It posted an EPS loss of 43 cents, which beat by 10 cents. Bookings of $923.76 million, up 19.4% year over year, missed by $5.34 million.\n\nIt also offered a weaker-than-expected bookings forecast, expecting bookings of $870 million to $900 million. That was below expectations of $902.5 million. It also lowered its full-year bookings forecast to between $4 billion and $4.1 billion, which is down from its prior outlook of $4.14 billion to $4.28 billion.\n\nHowever, despite the weak bookings forecast, Roblox did raise its full-year sales outlook, now seeing full-year revenue of between $3.45 billion and $3.53 billion, up from a previous range of $3.3 billion to $3.4 billion. Also, despite recent negativity, traders are bidding the RBLX stock higher.\n\nIn fact, since earnings, RBLX rallied from about $30 to $36.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (AMD) logo in the building at CNE in Toronto. AMD is an American semiconductor company.\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nAfter dropping from about $230 to $169, Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is gaining momentum.\n\nFor one, the artificial intelligence story is still heating up. Two, demand for AMD chips is only expected to gain momentum. According to AMD’s CEO Lisa Su, the company expects to see about $4 billion in AI chip sales, an increase of $500 million from prior estimates.\n\nStory continues\n\nThree, analysts at Edward Jones just initiated a “buy” rating on AMD. Analysts at Jefferies also initiated coverage of AMD with a “buy” rating, with a price target of $190 a share. AMD even just replaced Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) on the Wolfe Research Alpha List.\n\nAMD plays a big role in the metaverse, too. After all, companies racing forward with data centers for artificial intelligence, and even the metaverse, will need plenty of chips from companies like AMD.\n\nRoundHill Ball Metaverse ETF (METV) The metaverse concept of future meta-technology engineers. 3d rendering illustration design character wireframe for networking, innovation, online communication. metaverse stocks\n\nSource: allme3d / shutterstock.com\n\nYou can always take the exchange-traded fund (ETF) route with the Roundhill Ball Metaverse ETF (NYSEARCA:METV).\n\nFor one, after bottoming out around $11.40, the METV ETF rallied back to $13.08, where it’s still a “strong buy.” From here, I’d like to see the ETF closer to $20 a share, especially with the metaverse story heading up again.\n\nFurther, with an expense ratio of 0.59%, the ETF is the world’s largest metaverse fund and should benefit from two key areas of growth. These include that the Metaverse’s economic reach is anticipated to hit an impressive $10.7 trillion by 2033. And, VR/AR headset shipments are forecasted to reach 31.1 million by 2026.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) to name a few of the top ones.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "title": "3 Chip Stocks to Buy After the Nvidia Stock Split",
        "content": "It turned out that Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) shareholders needn’t have worried. After the new regime of 10-to-1 stock split took place on Monday, NVDA shares ended up over 1% at the end of the day. A shareholder who previously held 10 shares now holds 100 NVDA shares hovering around $121 per share. This favorable outcome post-split raises an intriguing question: What are the other chip stocks to buy after Nvidia split that might similarly benefit from market perceptions and technological advancements?\n\nFor comparison, that made NVDA stock cheaper than its main competitor Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD), currently priced at $160 per share. With the new price tag perception of not being seen as “too expensive to get in”, Nvidia is likely to see further capital inflows despite already having the inkling of overbought-ness at 73.26 P/E.\n\nOn the broader AI semiconductor front, investors are still in the innings of the cycle. JPMorgan (NYSE:JPM) PB equity strategist Bruno de la Sota noted in April that this is a multi-year opportunity “just starting to show up in corporate bottom lines.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBut as Nvidia still dominates this focus, what are the chip stocks to buy after Nvidia split?\n\nArm Holdings PLC (ARM) ARM company logo on the paper document and large microchips placed around. Illustrative for electronic chip manufacturer.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAvailable as American Depositary Shares (ADS), Arm Holdings (NASDAQ:ARM) is an ambitious British chip designer. By forgoing direct chip manufacturing, the company furthers cutting-edge architecture to license CPUs and GPUs to other companies.\n\nThis resulted in Arm’s dominant market share among embedded computing and mobile app segments, at 65% and over 90%, respectively. The royalty-based revenue has served Arm well, having increased its market cap to $163 billion.\n\nRecently, Arm leadership hinted at greater ambitions. Within the Windows PC market, dominated by Nvidia, AMD and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Arm aims to capture over 50% of the market share over the next five years.\n\nArm CEO Rene Haas noted that is the most likely outcome from Microsoft’s (NASDAQ:MSFT) shift towards Arm-based chips as a strategy to tackle Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). The latest manifestation of this trend was at the Microsoft Surface Copilot+ presentation featuring Qualcomm’s (NASDAQ:QCOM) Snapdragon X Elite and Plus chips, which follow Arm’s design.\n\nIn other words, as Apple and Microsoft giants battle it out, this benefits ARM shareholders. More vendors, like Dell (NYSE:DELL) and Asus, will further sell Arm-based machines. By the end of 2025, Arm sees 100 billion devices ready to power AI apps. In the last month, ARM stock was up 36% to $155.59. That is 74% over the stock’s 52-week average of $89.37 per share.\n\nStory continues\n\nMicron Technology (MU) The logo for Micron Technology Inc (MU) is displayed on a large white and blue building.\n\nAt the end of May, Micro Technology (NASDAQ:MU) lost the Texas court battle over the memory module patent, potentially forcing Netlist (OTCMKTS:NLST) to pay up to $445 million in damages. When Netlist won a similar infringement case against Samsung in 2023, the company was forced to pay $303 million.\n\nWhile the payment determination process is still ahead, MU stock managed to outperform the wider market at 13.4%, continuing its valuation spree of nearly 100% gains over one year. That’s because Micron is a key player in the supply of memory modules, from microSD cards to DRAM, NAND flash and multichip packages for enterprise-grade solutions.\n\nIn the high-bandwidth memory (HBM) arena now trending for AI infrastructure, Micron expects to see up to 25% market share by 2025, presently dominated by Samsung and SK Hynix. In addition to advanced HBM3e tech, which began production in February, Micron is actively developing the next-gen HBM4 memory lineup.\n\nRegarding GPUs, customers will likely see Micron’s GDDR7 memory, facilitating over 50% energy efficiency improvement. That will go a long way in extending battery life for mobile devices but also power users’ AI and gaming needs.\n\nEven if Micron has to fully pay Netlist, which is unlikely, it will be a minor bump in the road, as the company reported a 57.7% year-over-year revenue increase ending February 2024. From the present price of $140.75, MU stock is 63% above its 52-week average of $86.13 per share. Analysts put the average MU price target at $135.98 with the upper ceiling at $224.18 per share.\n\nUnited Microelectronics Corporation (UMC) Semiconductors chips and blurred UMC United Microelectronics Corporation logo.\n\nSource: Ascannio via shutterstock\n\nLittle-known Taiwanese United Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) is a semiconductor company that manufactures integrated circuit (IC) solutions for telecom, IT and multimedia sectors across its multi-national foundries in Japan, Singapore, China and Taiwan.\n\nAdditionally, UMC invested in renewable energy solutions, having founded NexPower Technology in 2005, which manufactures the thin-film photovoltaic (PV) found in solar panels. After a slump in net sales during 2023, UMC turned around in February, followed by consecutive year-over-year growth each month up to May.\n\nIn its Q1 ‘24 earnings report, the company shipped 4.5% more wafers. UMC’s specialty business offset the minor drop in utilization rate by supplying silicon interposers for AI servers, RFSOI chips and power management ICs. Considering that UMC is a cyclical company, apparent from its net income figures over the years, the AI demand is pushing it to the start of a positive cycle.\n\nAhead of inventory replenishments in PCs and consumer electronics, UMC is finishing up its $5 billion expansion of Fab12i in Singapore for mass production in early 2026 as one of the most advanced foundries geared for 22 and 28-nm chip manufacturing.\n\nAt $8.74 per share, UMC stock is close to its 52-week high of $8.97, having remained relatively stable at an average price of $7.75 for the last 52 weeks. Investors looking into chip stocks to buy after the Nvidia split should take advantage of UMC’s relatively high dividend yield of 6.59% at a $0.58 annual payout per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "title": "What Apple's OpenAI deal means for Google: Morning Brief",
        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nNow that Cupertino has unveiled its AI plans, the relationship between frenemies Apple and Google just got more complicated.\n\nThat’s because the sometimes-gadget rivals work as partners when it comes to search and online advertising. But the tie-up, which has featured heavily in a landmark antitrust lawsuit against Google’s dominance in the search engine market, will come under new strain as AI changes how people seek out information online.\n\nFor more than two decades, Apple has fixed Google as the default search engine in its Safari browser. Apple steers the traffic of its huge user base into Google’s search business. And in exchange for the default privilege, Google pays the iPhone maker around $18 billion a year.\n\nBut Apple, to the delight of investors, has another deal going. Enter Sam Altman.\n\nApple is partnering with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the iPhone. It’s part of a bold effort to catch up to Big Tech rivals that have gone all-in on AI. Later this year, iPhone users will get free access to the chatbot, which will mesh with Siri and other apps, giving people access to a repository of knowledge and granting OpenAI a ticket to mainstreaming AI technology.\n\nApple's iPhones infused with increasingly capable versions of ChatGPT would lessen the need to use Google search. If users in significant numbers start interacting with the web primarily through Siri instead of a search bar, even the heavy influence of default status might mean very little for the future of search traffic.\n\nApple’s alliance with OpenAI comes at a pivotal moment for Google’s own AI ventures.\n\nThe search giant recently released its new feature, AI Overviews, which gives users pithy answers to their search queries without having to click around the web. But Overviews, along with a previous image generation tool, was met with near-instant criticism as users discovered the AI features were churning out absurd or incorrect information.\n\nThe troubled debuts shaped a pattern of bungled releases. They’ve fed a narrative that Google’s rush to plant its AI flag reflected mismanagement and strategic weakness. Deeper issues are also at play.\n\nIf chatbots and other software powered by large language models (LLMs) are as transformational as tech executives claim they are, the business of search is poised for major disruption.\n\nEvery new deal OpenAI inks with media and technology companies can be seen as an attempt to strengthen an alternative to search, siphoning attention away from Google’s empire.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple can still team up with Google, of course, perhaps eventually pulling in Gemini, Google’s set of generative AI models, even as it continues to develop in-house AI technology.\n\nApple’s OpenAI collaboration doesn’t eclipse its long union with Google. But it adds a wrinkle to the relationship. In this early stage of a new tech paradigm, a fresh set of defaults is up for grabs. morning brief image\n\nHamza Shaban is a reporter for Yahoo Finance covering markets and the economy.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Catapult Your $100K Into a Cool Million: June 2024",
        "content": "These so-called “millionaire-maker” stocks have the potential to turn a $100,000 investment into $1 million over the next decade. As legendary Fidelity fund manager Peter Lynch explained, a “tenbagger” stock appreciates 10 times its original purchase price, generating a 1,000% return for early investors.\n\nLynch made a fortune for mutual fund investors by spotting tenbaggers early. Today’s forward-thinking stock pickers aim to identify the next stocks poised for +1,000% upside over the next 10 years.\n\nThe key is finding reasonably valued stocks tapping into massive market opportunities. According to value investor Mohnish Pabrai, the “magic” compound growth rate is 26% annually. At that rate, money doubles every 3 years. So a stock growing earnings at 26% for a decade can easily become a tenbagger.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe 3 stocks in this article exhibit strong growth drivers that could potentially catapult a $100K investment to over $1 million by 2034. With vision and rigorous analysis, ordinary investors may uncover millionaire-maker stocks in everyday observations. The next tenbagger could be under the radar right now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a reputation that engenders great expectations, and this is a confidence that is not misplaced. This tech titan just keeps growing — both its top and bottom lines. Thanks to the incredible loyalty of its customers and its ecosystem of products and services, Apple’s earnings per share shot up 280% over the past decade.\n\nAnd this growth seems far from over. For example, Apple continues to expand into new areas like financial services, augmented reality, artificial intelligence, streaming entertainment and more. These initiatives have already started bearing fruit — Apple hit over $23 billion in fiscal Q2 2024 from services alone. As a result, service-generated revenues accounted for slightly over 20% of the $90.8 billion total revenue.\n\nShareholders are also benefiting from Apple’s massive buyback program. The company just approved another $110 billion of share repurchases, an impressive increase over the previous $90 billion. By reducing the total share count, buybacks boost earnings per share. So as Apple keeps raking in profits, a shrinking share base will help EPS climb even more steeply. With leadership in multiple massive markets, immense brand value, and a fast-growing services business, Apple is clearly among the top millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nASML Holding (ASML) Closeup of mobile phone screen with ASML logo on computer keyboard\n\nSource: Ralf Liebhold / Shutterstock\n\nStory continues\n\nASML Holding (NASDAQ:ASML) has already seen a significant surge, but it still has plenty of room to grow. As a result, it easily makes the list of the top millionaire-maker stocks, allowing investors to at least get close to 10Xing their investment.\n\nASML is the world’s leading supplier of chip-making equipment, holding over 90% market share in lithography systems for advanced nodes below 10nm. Its extreme ultraviolet (EUV) lithography tools are critical for cutting-edge semiconductor manufacturing, enabling smaller and more powerful chips.\n\nIn Q1 2024, ASML generated €5.3 billion in total net sales and €1.2 billion in net income. For the full year 2023, sales grew 30% to €27.6 billion with 51.3% gross margins. ASML also returned €3.3 billion to shareholders via dividends and buybacks, with an additional €12 billion slated for additional repurchases by the close of 2025. Importantly, ASML ended 2023 with a massive €39 billion order backlog.\n\nWhile 2024 will be a transition year amidst the semiconductor downcycle, secular growth drivers and expanding applications for chips bode well for multi-year growth. ASML expects the industry to double over the next decade. To capitalize, ASML is investing to expand capacity and prepare for the strong ramp expected in 2025-2026.\n\nWith advanced lithography technology driving the bleeding edge of Moore’s Law, no company is better positioned than ASML to be among the top millionaire-maker stocks.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG, GOOGL) Alphabet (GOOGL) - Quantum Computing Stocks to Buy\n\nDespite recent mishaps, such as AI overviews in Google search bombing, Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) is still among the top millionaire-maker stocks. The tech giant delivered strong first-quarter 2024 results, with revenues of $80.5 billion, up 15% year-over-year. Operating margins also expanded, highlighting Alphabet’s ability to reengineer costs amid growth.\n\nDriving gains is Alphabet’s leadership in AI research and infrastructure. As the company enters the “Gemini era” over the next decade, its global product footprint positions it to benefit tremendously from the next wave of AI innovation. Already, Alphabet is integrating its Gemini AI models into advertising and enterprise products, creating new revenue streams.\n\nEqually promising, Alphabet recently announced a $0.20 per share quarterly dividend, its first ever. The Board also authorized a sizable $70 billion increase to the company’s share repurchase program. These shareholder-friendly moves confirm Alphabet’s consistent cash generation and intent to return capital when possible.\n\nLastly, Alphabet onboarded a top-tier CFO in Anat Ashkenazi, poached from pharma giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY). With Eli Lilly shares up over 50% annually over the past three years amid blockbuster obesity drugs, Ashkenazi joins Alphabet at an ideal time to optimize investments into groundbreaking growth engines like generative AI. With strong growth and profits already in motion, shareholder returns improving, and top talent leading the financially disciplined charge into the AI era, Alphabet checks all the boxes as one of the attractive millionaire-maker stocks over the next decade.\n\nOn the date of publication, Andrea van Schalkwyk held long positions in AAPL and GOOGL.

        "content": "The most recent trading session ended with Apple (AAPL) standing at $214.24, reflecting a +0.55% shift from the previouse trading day's closing. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily gain of 0.23%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.17%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw an increase of 0.34%.\n\nThe maker of iPhones, iPads and other products's stock has climbed by 12.31% in the past month, exceeding the Computer and Technology sector's loss of 2.01% and the S&P 500's gain of 3.96%.\n\nMarket participants will be closely following the financial results of Apple in its upcoming release. The company is forecasted to report an EPS of $1.33, showcasing a 5.56% upward movement from the corresponding quarter of the prior year. Meanwhile, the Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenue is projecting net sales of $83.07 billion, up 1.55% from the year-ago period.\n\nFor the entire fiscal year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates are projecting earnings of $6.58 per share and a revenue of $384.68 billion, representing changes of +7.34% and +0.36%, respectively, from the prior year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends.

        "title": "Gabelli Funds Commentary: GAMCO All Cap Value Fund Commmentary for May 2024",
        "content": "U.S. stocks rebounded in May, with the S&P 500 (+4.9%) reaching another all-time high during the month. Big tech led the rally, with NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) continuing its rise after reporting another stellar quarter. The ongoing AI spending boom has driven NVIDIA's impressive growth, which now has the third largest market capitalization in the U.S. trailing only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with NVDA.\n\nStocks were higher as investors were encouraged by April's inflation report, which strengthened market expectations for the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates soon, fueling optimism for a soft landing. The personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index rose by 0.3% from March to April, in-line with expectations and indicating that inflation may be cooling.\n\nOn May 1, the Federal Reserve held interest rates steady for the sixth consecutive meeting. Elevated inflation, a resilient economy and a strong labor market suggests the Fed may not cut rates as soon as originally anticipated earlier this year, especially with inflation hovering around 3%. The Fed will remain patient, seeking greater confidence that inflation is trending towards its 2% inflation target. The next FOMC meeting is June 11-12.\n\nIn May, the Russell 2000 Value underperformed the S&P 500, and now lags in year-to-date performance by over 1,000 bps. We anticipate a favorable environment for smaller companies in 2024 as post-peak rates and necessary consolidation in certain industries such as media, energy and banking should lead to a more robust year. M&A activity began the year strong, setting the stage for catalysts to emerge within our portfolio of companies.\n\nWe remain optimistic in our outlook for small to mid-cap stocks, as valuations have proven to be a good indicator of the potential for long-term outperformance. The valuation of the Russell 2000 191 Mason Street Greenwich, CT 06830 Value remains compelling, which currently trades at ~13x estimated earnings for the next twelve months versus ~22x for the S&P 500.\n\nAs value oriented stock pickers, we find the current market conditions exceptionally favorable for our methodology. Our focus remains steadfast on identifying exceptional businesses trading at a discount to Private Market Value, with catalysts to surface value. We will continue to use the volatility provided by Mr. Market to increase our stakes in great companies at attractive prices.\n\nPortfolio Observations May:\n\nNextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) (+19.5%), DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) (+13.9%), and Grupo Televisa (NYSE:TV) (+17.3%) were the three primary contributors to performance. Shares of NextEra Energy, Inc. (NYSE:NEE) have continued to move higher, driven by increasing optimism around accelerated electric demand growth fueled by the expanding influence of AI, data centers, electric vehicles (EVs), electrification, and on-shoring efforts. We consider NEE to be one of the stronger electric utilities in the nation and the premier renewable player. The company will be a leading beneficiary of tighter power markets, renewable portfolio standards and growing demand specifically for clean power. Shares of DuPont de Nemours, Inc. (NYSE:DD) were higher after the company announced a plan to separate into three publicly traded companies within 18-24 months. Under the plan, DuPont will separate its Electronics and Water businesses in a tax-free manner to its shareholders with New DuPont continuing as a premier diversified industrial company following completion of the separations. The company anticipates that all three companies will have strong balance sheets and strong future growth trends. In addition, the company announced that Lori Koch, current CFO, will succeed Ed Breen as CEO. Ed will retain his role of Executive Chairman. We believe that completing the separations will give each business greater flexibility for M&A, while also attracting different investor bases, and providing potential upside to their respective trading multiples. Shares of Grupo Televisa (NYSE:TV) were higher as the company's integration plan at Sky Mexico and increased confidence in streaming margins at Televisa Univision has improved investors' sentiment in the near term. Televisa owns approximately 59% of Sky Mexico but announced on April 3 an agreement to acquire the remaining stake, pending regulatory approvals. Additionally, Francisco Valim was appointed CEO of Sky to aid in the integration with Cable and unlock additional synergies. TV's upcoming catalysts include the monetization of Univision (likely via a 2024 IPO) and the turnaround of Sky Mexico.\n\nStory continues\n\nGenuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) (-8.3%), O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) (-4.9%), and Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG) (-3.4%) were the three primary detractors from performance. Shares of Genuine Parts Company (NYSE:GPC) were lower after facing recent challenges related to weather and ongoing issues with supplier fill rates. Away from recent headwinds, GPC made the anticipated official announcement that their CEO, Paul Donahue, will be stepping down as CEO and replaced by the current president and COO, Will Stengel. Mr. Stengel has already driven strategic changes around supplier and inventory availability which drove sequential improvement in 1Q results. We expect to see further improvements going forward and continue to believe that GPC is undervalued at 10x EBITDA. Over the long term, we see scale benefits in the company's best-in-class automotive distribution business (~60% of revenue) that drive steady share gains and free cash flow of ~$1 billion. Further, we believe that GPC's Industrial segment is undervalued as the segment is uniquely positioned to benefit from reshoring, federal spending, such as The Inflation Reduction Act, and a rebound in rapidly growing end markets such as automation and conveyance. Shares of O'Reilly Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ:ORLY) were lower following concerns linked to the recent negative impact of weather and macro read-throughs relating to potential softening consumer demand. Despite concerns related to potential headwinds, management has continued to view the consumer to be reasonably healthy, which is supported by trade-downs and deferrals continuing to remain stable within ORLY's customer base. Going forward, we expect that ORLY will continue to take share in the fragmented DIFM market and volumes will remain solid as consumers feel some relief from moderating inflation levels. We continue to project that key drivers such as VIO, part complexity, and superior execution will support growth in 2024. ORLY is the best operator of its competitors and a high quality cash generating company that we anticipate will continue gaining market share. Shares of Republic Services, Inc. (NYSE:RSG) were lower after the company reported mixed Q1 results. While quarterly performance was solid, shares likely declined on account of elevated margin expectations stemming from underperformance relative to peers. Despite this relatively weak quarter, we expect RSG to continue to execute well on plans to improve margins with easing volume headwinds in addition to continued M&A, targeting $500m in expenditure for 2024. We view RSG's core solid waste business to remain strong and well-positioned to benefit from a persistently strong inflationary environment given its pricing indexed exposure to CPI.\n\nKevin V.

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) The Best Hardware Stock To Buy According To Goldman Sachs?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman Sachs using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other hardware stocks.\n\nThe soaring popularity of artificial intelligence for consumer and business applications has injected fresh life into the computing industry. If we're to rewind the hands of time and go back to 2022, the stock market environment was considerably different from what it is now. All major technology stocks, including those that are responsible for making chips that power AI workloads were down by double digit percentages in the wake of breakneck inflation and rising interest rates.\n\nFast forward to 2024 and the rise in valuations seems to have no end in sight. One bank that's quite optimistic about artificial intelligence is Goldman. Goldman's analyst teams are among the best in the world, and they spend countless hours analyzing stocks and industries for the right set of picks that could disrupt the industry.\n\nOn this front, Goldman came out with a note recently that outlined a new beginning for the computer hardware industry. According to the bank, the introduction of AI has necessitated a global shift to new hardware that can support the technology. In its note, the bank's analysts shared:\n\nDuring the pandemic, the tech hardware industry peaked as the majority of work-from-home employees purchased equipment. The space currently has fully unwind this cycle and we notice stocks like HPQ trading at 9x their 2025 earnings estimates.\n\nMost PCs purchased during the pandemic are expected to be replaced soon. We expect discernable new features of AI, enhanced security, and stronger computational power in upcoming PC and mobile device models, incentivizing the US consumer to spend more on newer equipment than historically, creating an unusually stronger cycle.\n\nGoldman also created a basket of stocks where the highest weighted stock has an 8% weight and there are 20 stocks in the basket. According to Goldman analyst Faris Mourad:\n\nThe basket is composed of technology hardware stocks that may benefit from PC and mobile device renovations that could include AI features. The basket can trade up to $250m in one day with no name exceeding 10% of ADV.\n\nConsidering this optimism, we decided to take a look at the top Goldman's top 15 hardware stock picks.\n\nOur Methodology\n\nTo make our list of the top Goldman Sachs hardware stocks, we used the top holdings of the bank's PC & Mobile Device AI Upgrades basket (GSXUPCAI).\n\nStory continues\n\nFor these hardware stocks, we also mentioned hedge fund investors. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\n2. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 150\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is all the buzz in the AI and technology industry this June. While its shares had remained lackluster before, the stock jumped by 10% after Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s WWDC conference. At the event, it introduced a slew of AI features called 'Apple Intelligence', which will bring on device AI capabilities to the iPhone, and also allow users to run more complex workloads on a secure cloud environment. After the event, Rosenblatt kept a $186 share price target and a Neutral rating on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares. At the heart of the note was a key observation, which outlined that while Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) might have introduced AI in its products, only the latest gadgets with the A17 processor can use the features. As a result, Rosenblatt remained cautious about pricing in AI euphoria in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has a forward price to earnings ratio of 29. This is higher than the S&P's 21, and it shows that investors expect the stock to grow slightly faster than the market. Aristotle Atlantic Partners mentioned the firm in its Q1 2024 investor letter and shared:\n\nApple contributed to portfolio performance in the first quarter due to the strategy’s underweight relative to the benchmark. Investors continue to be concerned about weak handset sales globally, as well as declining market share and competitive dynamics in the Chinese market, as Huawei has returned to the market with a more competitive premium-priced handset. Apple has yet to demonstrate a competitive AI product, which could present further competitive headwinds for the company.\n\nApple is a tad expensive for our taste, but hedge funds disagree with us. AAPL was one of the top 10stocks on our list of the 31 Most Popular Stocks Among Hedge Funds.\n\nOverall, AAPL ranks 2nd among the 15 best hardware stocks to buy according to famed investment bank. You can visit the 15 Best Hardware Stocks According To Goldman to see the other hardware stocks. While we acknowledge the potential of AAPL as an AI investment, our conviction lies in the belief that some AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None. The article was originally published at Insider Monkey.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. overtook Microsoft Corp. to regain its title as the world’s most valuable company, the latest sign of improving investor sentiment over its growth and position with artificial intelligence.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nWells Fargo Fires Over a Dozen for ‘Simulation of Keyboard Activity’ Apple to ‘Pay’ OpenAI for ChatGPT Through Distribution, Not Cash Hunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad’s Reaction Was Remarkable. US Producer Prices Surprise With Biggest Decline Since October Tech Powers Stocks With Adobe Up 15% in Late Hours: Markets Wrap\n\nThe milestone followed a blistering rally, including Apple’s biggest three-day advance since August 2020. It closed with a market capitalization of $3.285 trillion, compared with Microsoft at $3.282 trillion. This is the first time since January that Apple closed with a higher market value than Microsoft, and it represents the latest reshuffling of the ranks of Wall Street’s largest stocks. Earlier this week, Apple closed in third place behind Nvidia Corp.\n\n“People have a high degree of conviction that they will be an AI winner, and it seems like this is a market where if you’re an AI winner, you’re being bid up a lot,” said Rhys Williams, chief strategist at Wayve Capital Management. “I assume both Microsoft and Apple will be somewhat of a horse race for the foreseeable future with Nvidia also in contention.”\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company rose 0.6% on Thursday, its third straight positive session, which also included the largest one-day percentage gain since November 2022 on Tuesday. The three-day jump of about 11% added a staggering $323.9 billion to its market capitalization. That’s bigger than all but a handful of components in the S&P 500 Index.\n\nMicrosoft rose 0.1% on Thursday.\n\nThe catalyst for the gains was Apple’s AI-focused Worldwide Developers Conference presentation on Monday, which fueled hopes that customers will pay up for the next generation of iPhones, spurring a long-awaited rebound in growth. Revenue fell 4.3% in Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters.\n\n“AI functionality is likely to drive a multi-year upgrade cycle from faster replacement, more switching, and ASP increases,” wrote Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan, referring to average selling prices. “Apple Intelligence can drive a significant upgrade cycle and consensus estimates are too low.”\n\nThe AI event came in the wake of a positive quarterly report in early May, when Apple also announced a $110 billion buyback plan, the largest buyback program in US history.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven with the recent strength, concerns about growth have capped Apple’s gain relative to the rest of big tech.\n\nThursday’s rally pushed Apple’s gain in 2024 to 11%, below the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 16% advance. Stocks with more concrete AI exposure — including Microsoft, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. — have all outperformed Apple this year. Nvidia has soared more than 160%.\n\n--With assistance from Carmen Reinicke.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon Israeli Scientists Are Shunned by Universities Over the Gaza War Grieving Families Blame Panera’s Charged Lemonade for Leaving a Deadly Legacy The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple will let you send text messages via satellites in space later this year",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) Intelligence might have stolen the show at the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference this week, but another announcement during the show could literally help you stay in touch with friends and family while off the grid or camping when you don’t have cell service.\n\nMessages via satellite is a new feature for the iPhone 14 and iPhone 15 coming in iOS 18 that will allow you to send iMessages, you guessed it, via satellite. Apple already offers its Emergency SOS via satellite service, but that’s more geared to serious situations like when a user is lost in the wilderness or in some other kind of danger. Emergency SOS via satellite requires users to answer brief prompts about their particular situation, which Apple can then route to the appropriate authorities.\n\nUnlike Emergency SOS via satellite, Messages via satellite allows you to send standard iMessages to friends and family who use iPhones, as well as SMS messages to Android users. I joined Apple’s senior director of platform product marketing for iOS, iPadOS, and macOS, Kurt Knight, for a brief demo of the new feature and its capabilities.\n\nStanding outside in the sweltering California heat, Knight showed me how the process of sending texts via satellite works using an iPhone without either a cellular or Wi-Fi connection. From your phone’s lock screen, you’ll get a notification saying that you can send and check for messages via satellite when your iPhone detects you don’t have a cellular or Wi-Fi signal. Apple's Messages via satellite will let you send texts to friends and family even when you're off the grid. (Apple) (Apple)\n\nTap the notification and you’ll be brought to a screen showing your location on a map and indicating whether there is a satellite nearby overhead. Below that are options to send messages, call for roadside assistance, use the Find My app, or use Emergency SOS via satellite.\n\nYou can also launch Messages via satellite by opening up the Messages app on your phone when disconnected from cellular or Wi-Fi. While using the app, you’ll get a pop-up in your iPhone’s Dynamic Island showing your relative position to the closest satellite. Move too far to the left or right, and the pop-up will tell you to get back in the right position to communicate with the satellite.\n\nYou won’t be able to use the feature indoors or under heavy tree cover, since it requires a clear line of sight between the satellite and your iPhone, but it does work surprisingly quickly. During the demo, Knight was able to send both text and an emoji via iMessage, as well as one of Apple’s Tapback message replies.\n\nThe Messages app will alert you each time you send or receive a text via satellite by adding a small note above your message’s timestamp. The idea is to ensure you and the person you’re texting are both aware that you’re communicating via satellite and that responses might not be as fast as they would over cellular or Wi-Fi signals.\n\nStory continues\n\nDon’t expect to send videos or photos over satellite, though. Apple says it was able to make sending normal texts possible because it was able to compress them to a size that made them easier to send back and forth to satellites. Photos and videos are just too big at this point.\n\nAs for how to use Messages via satellite, you’ll need an iPhone 14 or newer and access to iOS 18 when it comes out later this fall. Apple hasn’t said when or what it will charge for the service yet. The company initially offered iPhone 14 users a year of service for free, but then extended that for another year in 2023. IPhone 15 owners received a free year of service when they purchased their phones as well. Apple has yet to announce what will happen when those terms are up.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Thursday after strength in technology shares saw Wall Street extend a recent run of record highs as data showed some cooling in inflation.\n\nGains in Wall Street were driven largely by optimism over artificial intelligence, and came even as the Federal Reserve warned that it saw fewer chances of interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nS&P 500 Futures fell 0.05% to 5,435.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures steadied at 19,606.75 points by 19:17 ET (23:17 GMT). Dow Jones Futures fell 0.1% to 38,646.0 points.\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq mark fourth straight day of record highs\n\nFutures steadied after Wall Street indexes marked a fourth consecutive day of record highs, amid persistent support from technology stocks.\n\nTech remained heady, extending a rally seen earlier this week that was largely triggered by market major Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announcing a major foray into AI. Apple’s announcement lent more fuel to the AI rally, and also saw the stock briefly become the most valuable company on Wall Street.\n\nGains in tech saw the S&P 500 rise 0.2% to a record high of 5,433.74 points, while the NASDAQ Composite rose 0.3% to a record high of 17,665.90 points. The economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to underperform, falling 0.2% to 38,647.10 points.\n\nPPI inflation cools, adds to disinflation narrative\n\nProducer price index data released on Thursday showed factory prices unexpectedly fell in May, adding to optimism that a disinflationary trend was in play.\n\nThe reading came a day after mildly softer consumer price index data, and ramped up hopes that inflation was cooling.\n\nStill, Wall Street’s pace of intraday gains now appeared to be slowing after a four-day run, especially after the Federal Reserve warned this week that it only saw one rate cut this year, compared to earlier expectations of three cuts. The central bank also hiked its inflation outlook for the year.\n\nTech rally continues on strong earnings, Tesla\n\nChipmaker Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) surged 12% on Thursday after clocking strong quarterly earnings on AI demand, while software maker Adobe Systems Incorporated (NASDAQ:ADBE) also logged strong earnings and hiked its 2024 guidance on higher demand for its AI-powered editing tools. The stock surged over 15% in aftermarket trade.\n\nElectric vehicle maker Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) surged nearly 3% on Thursday, adding another 0.5% in aftermarket trade after shareholders voted in favor of a controversial $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk, as well as the company’s reincorporation in Texas.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady as Wall St extends record run amid softer inflation\n\nVisa, Mastercard $30 billion fee settlement in peril\n\nGameStop postpones shareholder meet to June 17 after technical difficulties\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Tech Titans Rewriting the Rules of Growth Investing",
        "content": "Growth investing has been incredibly rewarding for investors who punched their ticket well ahead of the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AI hype is giving yet another shot in the arm to the tech sector. After an incredible Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) hosted by Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the sector found itself up close to 10% in the two trading days that followed.\n\nSurely, AAPL stock’s blistering rally crowned Apple as the world’s largest company, at least before Fed chair Jerome Powell gave his speech.\n\nAfter the Fed commentary, Apple began slipping off its peak, falling just a hair below Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in the market cap race. As these two titans, along with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), continue to soar, the rules of growth investing may be changing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAs momentum in some of the AI-savviest companies picks up again, investors should look beyond The Big Three. Let’s explore three that could also power higher as the “Magnificent Three” lead the way.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs powerful but compact AI models find themselves in our pockets, top public cloud firm and e-commerce disruptor Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) may have enough AI-induced wind at its back to help it join the company of the Magnificent Three in the $3 trillion market cap club.\n\nWith a market cap just shy of $2 trillion, AMZN stock has to gain around 57% to qualify. It may be just a matter of time before Amazon becomes a $3 trillion club member. And if Amazon has more AI in store for the next year, it will be unsurprising if it does so by next summer.\n\nAs a Magnificent Seven firm that only recently broke out to new all-time highs by only around 2%, AMZN stock stands out. It’s a great play for growth investors seeking a company that may still have untapped AI upside.\n\nMoreover, Amazon has its Titan foundation models, Bedrock service for firms to build generative AI models, and a very impressive Q Developer for AI-assisted coding. However, there’s still more in the Amazon AI pipeline that could excite. Specifically, the Olympus large language model (LLM), under development, could be a game-changer with parameters that are measured in the trillions.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is another AI beneficiary that seems unstoppable of late. Recently, the stock reported its Q2 earnings, adding more fuel to one of the hottest AI semi-stock stories outside of Nvidia. The company didn’t just post strong earnings. It also raised its annual AI chip sales forecast by 10% and announced a stock split.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe result? AVGO stock is up more than 14% in the after-hours session.\n\nIn many ways, Broadcom’s ascent seems to rhyme with that of Nvidia’s. Many investors and analysts underestimated AI’s potential to power growth. And those left sitting on the sidelines are probably wondering if it’s too late to jump in now that AVGO stock is up close to 50% year-to-date (YTD).\n\nAt this pace, perhaps Broadcom will crack a $1 trillion valuation sooner than most think. Either way, Broadcom still isn’t the priciest AI chip stock. It may even be a relative value play given the 1.4% dividend yield and price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple that still seems grounded in reality.\n\nOracle (ORCL) The Oracle (ORCL) sign hangs on an Oracle office in Deerfield, Illinois.\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nOracle (NASDAQ:ORCL) has been off to the races as well, despite reporting a lukewarm quarter that fell short on the bottom line. The cloud high-flyer has AI to thank. On Wednesday, ORCL stock shot up more than 13% as investors applauded deals made with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, GOOGL) Cloud in addition to Microsoft and OpenAI.\n\nIndeed, Oracle is joining forces with some heavy hitters on AI. No wonder investors are forgiving the sub-par earnings report.\n\nMoving ahead, ORCL stands out as an AI cloud winner poised to continue winning as it helps do its part to meet blistering demand for AI compute. In many ways, teaming up with OpenAI seems to be the magic formula for getting investors to hit that buy button.\n\nAs Oracle builds data centers that are cheaper than many of its big-name peers, it will be interesting to see how much gas ORCL stock has left in the tank after its latest melt-up. Perhaps a $500 billion market cap may not be far off as the growth bar is raised.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Amazon, Alphabet (Class C), Apple, and Microsoft.

        "title": "5 Stocks to Buy and Hold Forever",
        "content": "This article is an excerpt from the InvestorPlace Digest newsletter. To get news like this delivered straight to your inbox, click here.\n\nIn 2016, Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) bought almost 10 million Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares. The smartphone maker’s stock had declined 14%, pricing them at just 11 times expected earnings. Apple had become one of the worst-performing, cheapest companies in the Dow Jones Industrial Average.\n\nBut the Oracle of Omaha had his reasons. The smartphone maker had a “fortress” balance sheet – a quality Buffett has long appreciated. It was operating in a growing market; that same year marked the first time more people connected to the internet via mobile devices than by PCs. And the firm sported a “wide moat” business that kept rivals at bay.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nIn other words, Buffett saw Apple as an ideal stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nAnd he’s been right.\n\nSince 2016, shares of Apple have risen 640%… easily beating out the Dow Jones (120%), the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite (260%), and even Berkshire’s own gains (220%). The only reason he recently sold a portion this year was for taxes. As Buffett himself once quipped: “When we own portions of outstanding businesses with outstanding managements, our favorite holding period is forever.”\n\nOur analysts here at InvestorPlace.com also have been seeking out their own stocks to buy and hold forever. And we’ll take a look at five of these companies they’ve highlighted this week…\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNew York state-based Corning (NYSE:GLW) has been synonymous with best-of-breed glass products for the past 170 years. This week in Smart Money, Eric Fry writes how the company is riding some incredible tailwinds, and why he believes that makes Corning a stock to buy and hold forever.\n\nToday, the company operates six different business segments – each of which is beginning to benefit from powerful tailwinds. The worldwide 5G buildout tops the list of tailwinds that are benefiting Corning’s largest segment, Optical Communications. That’s the one that provides optical fiber and related connectivity solutions to telcos, data centers, and other enterprises.\n\nAs the global 5G build-out proceeds, so too will demand for Corning’s fiber-optic cable and components. This substantial source of new demand could become shockingly large.\n\nLooking further down the road, I expect the coming decade to reward Corning with a level of profitability that few investors anticipate today.\n\nStory continues\n\nCorning also has the same “wide moat” economics that define “forever” stocks. The company consistently reinvests $1 billion annually into research and development, which has kept profits high and competitors at bay. (Rivals like Nippon Electric Glass, by comparison, spend less than $50 million annually on R&D). It’s also interesting to note that Corning has the longest debt maturity of any S&P 500 company.\n\nThat tells us that Corning is positioned to last another 170 years… and probably more. The company remains an incredible generator of cash, and its latest tailwinds will help generate even more profits to reinvest into developing the next generation of glass products.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nMuslim Farooque adds Realty Income (NYSE:O) to his list of top blue-chip companies to buy this week at InvestorPlace.com. This real estate investment trust is known for paying monthly dividends, and its triple-net lease model gives it an unusual amount of long-term stability. Farooque believes Realty Income is a stock to snap up at current prices.\n\nAmidst the market’s ups and downs, O stock’s underlying business remains robust, maintaining a solid 98% occupancy rate. Importantly, 80% of its retail tenants operate in sectors proven resilient during economic downturns, such as grocery, convenience stores, and pharmacies.\n\nMoreover, its operation on a robust triple-net lease model is a key advantage. The model effectively allows for shifting all operational expenses and risks, including maintenance costs, onto its tenants. Moreover, with leases as long as 15 years or even more, the firm enjoys a robust and reliable rental income stream.\n\nValuations are particularly compelling thanks to a recent 12% selloff over “higher for longer” rates. (All else equal, high rates decrease the present value of REIT income streams). The stock trades for just 1.2 times book value (well below its 1.9x long-term average) and offers a generous 6% yield.\n\nMost importantly, Realty Income is managed with an eye on the long run. The company concentrates on defensive, service-based sectors that are resistant to e-commerce and leases them out over extended contracts. Its average remaining lease term is almost 10 years.\n\nThe company, of course, sacrifices some growth for this conservative strategy. Annual rent increases average at just 1%, so the company relies on acquisitions to fuel growth. Still, management has remained historically disciplined in how much they pay for new properties. If there were one REIT to buy and hold forever, Realty Income fits that bill perfectly.\n\nCostco (COST) Costco logo on a sign on a Costco store.\n\nSource: ARTYOORAN / Shutterstock.com\n\nRetailers are often troublemakers for long-term investors. Brick-and-mortar stores require constant reinvestment, and it’s often unclear at the time whether the money is well spent. The billions of dollars booksellers and electronics retailers spent in the 2000s, for instance, couldn’t save them from e-commerce.\n\nNevertheless, one company seems to have it figured out: Costco (NASDAQ:COST)\n\nThe 41-year-old company has found an incredible market in big-box retail. Many of the company’s products are immune from online competition, given the high costs of home delivery of refrigerated and other temperature-sensitive items. And for segments that do compete with e-commerce rivals, Costco has managed to cut costs enough to keep price competitive. The firm also generate profits from membership fees rather than markups.\n\nThis week at Market 360, Louis Navellier writes why he remains so bullish on this retailer.\n\nThe real difference maker here is Costco’s Quantitative Grade. It gets an A, which is an indicator of persistent and strong institutional buying pressure. That makes Costco the clear choice.\n\nI should also add that Costco is perhaps my favorite retailer. It’s just an incredibly well-run company, folks. If you want a company catering to rich people, this is the company that caters to rich people. They show up in their SUVs and load up on stuff. The average Costco buyer is very affluent and they’re very loyal to their gas stations…\n\nLook, I’ve been in the markets for about four decades, and one thing never changes…\n\nStocks with superior fundamentals almost always win out in the end. And those that don’t have strong fundamentals eventually end up in the garbage.\n\nWall Street agrees. Analysts are forecasting solid 10% growth rates through at least 2027, and for profits to steadily rise as overhead costs get divided across more stores.\n\nDeere (DE) a green John Deere tractor\n\nSource: mark stephens photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestorPlace.com’s Josh Enomoto writes about Deere & Co. (NYSE:DE) this week, calling the machinery maker an undervalued long-term stock to buy.\n\nAt first glance, DE might sound like a boring idea among undervalued long-term stocks. However, the sectors Deere serves are obviously critical for human health.\n\nFor fiscal 2024, covering experts believe EPS could come in at $25.40 on sales of $45.56 billion. Admittedly, that’s disappointing compared to last year’s results of EPS of $34.69 on sales of $55.56 billion. However, with DE’s modest performance in the market, it’s currently trading at 11.18X trailing-year earnings and 1.83X trailing-year sales.\n\nAbout one year ago, these metrics stood at 14.05X and 2.11X, respectively. Given the importance of agriculture, DE represents one of the undervalued long-term stocks to buy.\n\nJohn Deere has a particularly wide moat in its agriculture business, where it offers machines for field preparation, planting and seeding, chemicals application and harvesting. The company has the largest installed base in the industry, and uses that scale to offer cheap after-market parts and services.\n\nThe industrial juggernaut is also using technology to widen its moat. Not only can harvesters follow each other… they can “remember” where and when planting machines put the seeds. That creates a strong incentive for farmers to switch their entire fleet to Deere and allows the company to keep widening its moat over time.\n\nApple (AAPL) An Apple MacBook Air laptop sitting under bright purple lights.\n\nSource: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com\n\nFinally, at InvestorPlace.com this week, Chris MacDonald highlights Apple itself as a company for long-term wealth creation. The firm has proven its ability to innovate over the long term, and even its recent slowdown relative to Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is no cause for concern.\n\nApple is seeing a resurgence in China sales despite challenges from new European Union regulations. However, investors may remain cautious as Nvidia nips at its heels for the second spot in the global market capitalization rankings. The recent uptick in Chinese activity is a strong catalyst for the company, and if Apple’s new rumored AI-driven iPhone is as big a hit as many expect, this could be a company with a lot to offer in the months ahead.\n\nI think Apple’s valuation remains steep, and I’ve been cautious around this stock for some time. Buffett has felt the same way, recently trimming his Apple stake significantly.\n\nThat said, for long-term investors seeking defensive tech options, there are few better companies to consider than Apple right now.\n\nApple has long adjusted its risk-taking to reflect market needs. During the company’s 1997 turnaround, then-CEO Steve Jobs placed a daring bet by concentrating on relatively few core products. As the company grew (especially after the iPhone), it began taking less risks to ride its cash cow. As MacDonald rightly notes, the firm became a defensive behemoth.\n\nNow, Apple is reinventing itself again. New artificial intelligence plans, including a deal with OpenAI, give investors reason for excitement. Former insiders say Apple’s management is once again open to taking risks.\n\nTogether, that gives investors an unusual mix of defensive and growth-oriented strategies.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nThomas Yeung is a market analyst and portfolio manager of the Omnia Portfolio, the highest-tier subscription at InvestorPlace.

        "title": "Apple's Intelligence aims to get users to pony up for new iPhones",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) kicked off its big push into generative AI with the debut of its Apple Intelligence platform at its Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday.\n\nBut if you own an iPhone 15 or older, you’re out of luck.\n\nApple says you’ll need an iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max or future iPhone to take advantage of the software. That’s because the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max are the only iPhones with processors powerful enough to handle the AI platform.\n\nAnd despite coming out at the same time as the iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max, the iPhone 15 and iPhone 15 Plus are equipped with older, less capable chips.\n\nThat’s certainly a letdown for people who bought an iPhone 15 this year expecting it to stay updated with the latest software for at least more than a year.\n\nApple, however, wins by ensuring that anyone who wants to use Apple Intelligence and doesn’t have its top-of-the-line phones will need to pay up or go without.\n\nCashing in on AI hype\n\nApple is taking a more holistic approach to generative AI than its peers, spreading its Apple Intelligence software out across its existing apps like Photos and Messages and improving the functionality of apps like Siri, which will now be far more responsive and intelligent thanks to both Apple’s AI models and help from OpenAI’s ChatGPT.\n\nIt’s an enormous upgrade, and one the company hopes will make older iPhone users want to upgrade sooner than later. Apple CEO Tim Cook attends the annual developer conference event at the company's headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., June 10, 2024. (REUTERS/Carlos Barria) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nSee, one of Apple’s biggest problems is that its phones last a long time. IPhones get years' worth of security and operating system updates. And unless their batteries die or their screens crack, users hold on to them without feeling the need to upgrade every year.\n\nAccording to a 2023 survey by Consumer Intelligence Research Partners, 61% of iPhone users had their previous iPhones for two or more years. Another 29% held onto their previous phone for three years or more.\n\nUBS analyst David Vogt, meanwhile, says that a recent analysis of 7,500 smartphone users from the US, UK, China, Germany, and Japan found that the average age of consumers’ iPhones is 21 months, up from 19.9 months last year.\n\nBy only bringing its AI features to the iPhone 15 Pro and 15 Pro Max, Apple is incentivizing users to ditch their older phones for newer offerings more quickly, speeding up the usual replacement cycle.\n\n“With the advent of Apple Intelligence, we see replacement cycles shrinking, creating a stronger replacement dynamic,” BofA Global Research analyst Wamsi Mohan wrote in a recent investor note.\n\nStill, Apple Intelligence isn’t even available to users yet, and a big part of whether it will drive any sales comes down to how Apple delivers on the promises it made about the software during WWDC.\n\nStory continues\n\nWe’ve seen companies like Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) announce and debut their own AI offerings only to have to rework or pull them back following consumer pushback. Microsoft had to make changes to its Recall feature before it even hit the market over concerns that it presented a security risk.\n\nRecall is designed to take screenshots of what you’ve been doing on your PC so you can go quickly and easily access it. But security researchers said it could lead to hackers being able to view your data with ease.\n\nGoogle, meanwhile, had to address problems with its AI Overview for Search that told users it was alright to do things like add glue to pizza to keep the cheese from sliding off and eat rocks.\n\nApple will need to ensure that its own AI products don’t run into similar problems, which could keep some users from upgrading.\n\nNow the company just has to wait and see how well its Apple Intelligence works during its early beta periods. We’ll learn how many people actually want to buy their next smartphone based on the software when it lands later this fall. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "Redditors Are Buying These 8 Dividend Stocks For Early Retirement",
        "content": "Redditors Are Buying These 8 Dividend Stocks For Early Retirement\n\nBenzinga and Yahoo Finance LLC may earn commission or revenue on some items through the links below.\n\nYoung Americans have always been allured by the idea of leaving their 9-to-5 grind and enjoying the prime of their lives by the beach and doing what they love. But in recent years, this idea has seen a dramatic rise in popularity. In a recent survey conducted by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, 45.8% of the respondents said they would likely be working after age 62. This metric averaged 55% between March 2014 and March 2020, according to the bank.\n\nThe early retirement movement gained prominence during the COVID-19 pandemic as millions of Americans started working from home and saving money from stimulus checks. In October 2021, St. Louis Federal Reserve economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro estimated that a whopping three million Americans retired early due to the pandemic. However, this phenomenon, also known as ‘The Great Resignation,' reversed as inflation began to impact American households.\n\nEarly retirement communities such as Reddit’s /FinancialIndependence are still growing. Investing in dividend stocks is often pitched as one of the quicker and safest ways to retire early on Reddit. We scoured several discussion boards on Reddit to see the most popular dividend stocks recommended by investors on the platform for retirement based on their personal experience.\n\nPfizer\n\nPfizer Inc (NYSE:PFE) is a notable dividend stock popular among Redditors looking to live off dividends. Pfizer shares are down about 7% over the past year. The stock yields around 6%, which is high compared to the sector average of about 2.3%. Redditors think Pfizer is going through a post-COVID slump, but it’s poised to rebound on the back of strong growth catalysts in the pipeline. During the first quarter, Pfizer’s revenue from non-COVID products saw an 11% operational growth year-over-year. Pfizer has increased its dividend for 14 straight years.\n\nPhilip Morris\n\nWith 16 consecutive years of dividend growth and a 5% yield, the tobacco company Philip Morris International Inc (NYSE:PM) is a top choice for many Redditors who live entirely off dividends. Amid a decline in the popularity of traditional tobacco products, Philip Morris is aggressively expanding into tobacco-free products. The company plans to generate about two-thirds of its net revenues from nontraditional products by 2030. The company posted strong Q1 results in April and updated full-year 2024 guidance. Adjusted EPS in the quarter came in at $1.50, surpassing estimates by $0.09, while revenue jumped 9.7% YoY to $8.8 billion, beating the consensus estimate by $350 million. Philip Morris expects its organic revenue growth in 2024 to total somewhere between 7% and 8.5%, up from its previous forecast of 6.5% to 8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nMain Street Capital\n\nTexas-based business development company Main Street Capital Corp (NYSE:MAIN) is one of the most popular monthly dividend stocks among Redditors in retirement and dividend communities on the social media platform. Main Street has been paying dividends consistently since 2007 and has upped its dividend every year since 2014.\n\nMain Street’s management said during the Q1 earnings call that the company’s net investment income in the quarter was 54% higher than the monthly dividends the company paid to its shareholders and 9% more than the total dividends paid to shareholders. Total investment income in the March quarter came in at $131.6 million, easily beating the Street’s consensus of $127.9 million.\n\nAltria\n\nReddit’s retirement and dividend communities love Altria Group Inc (NYSE:MO) because of its dividend yield (over 8%) and impressive dividend growth history (54 consecutive years of increases). Retail investors on Reddit believe the stock is undervalued and poised to grow due to recreational marijuana and tobacco-free product growth.\n\nLast year, Altria completed its $2.75 billion acquisition of NJOY Holdings, an e-vapor products company. Analysts believe growth from the oral tobacco category and vaping products could offset declines from the smokable products segment.\n\nAltria’s valuation is indeed depressed. The stock trades at a forward P/E of 9.05, much lower than the industry average P/E of 17.24.\n\nIBM\n\nInternational Business Machines Corporation (NYSE:IMB) is one of the most talked-about stocks in Reddit retirement and dividend communities since many Redditors living off dividends have the tech stock in their portfolios. IBM is that sweet spot between dividend income and stock growth, as some Redditors think the company’s cloud and AI business has the potential to boost IBM’s share.\n\nIBM has 29 years of consecutive dividend growth and yields 3.95%. In April, IBM increased its quarterly dividend by 0.6% to $1.66 per share. During the same month, IBM said it would buy HashiCorp. for $6.4 billion. The company stated the acquisition would allow it to expand its hybrid cloud platform for AI. Bank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan said IBM has the ability to drive HashiCorp’s growth across its customer base.\n\nRealty Income\n\nCalifornia-based REIT Realty Income Corp (NYSE:O) is one of the top monthly dividend stocks, having raised its dividends for 29 straight years. Redditors are fond of this high-yield (5.9%) dividend growth stock. Realty Income hiked its monthly dividend by 0.2% on June 11 to $0.263 per share. The company has also increased the lower end of its 2024 earnings guidance. It now expects adjusted FFO per share in the year to come in between $4.15 and $4.21, up from its prior guidance of $4.13 to $4.21.\n\nApple\n\nDespite having a low yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is one of the favorite dividend stocks on Reddit, as retail investors on the platform believe the iPhone maker is a solid addition to a diversified dividend portfolio. With excess cash and rising competition, Apple prioritizes shareholder returns more than ever. It has raised dividends every year over the past decade. Earlier this year, Apple hiked its dividend by 4%. It’s still a growth stock, with many analysts betting that Apple’s AI plans will bear fruit. The stock jumped to new highs after Apple’s latest AI-related announcements during the annual Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nIn the latest note, TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo praised Apple’s AI move and said the company could have a competitive edge over peers as it has \"successfully defined on-device AI.\"\n\nCoca-Cola\n\nCoca-Cola Co (NYSE:KO) has over six decades of dividend growth, a solid business, and a 3% yield. Redditors believe this old-school, \"boring\" dividend stock is important for any balanced dividend portfolio. Coca-Cola’s organic revenue during the first quarter jumped 11% year-over-year.\n\nThe company’s defensive business makes it an all-weather dividend stock. In May, Goldman Sachs said in a note that Coca-Cola is one of the stocks \"insulated\" from headwinds from wavering consumer spending amid rising inflation.\n\nLooking For Higher-Yield Opportunities?\n\nThe current high-interest-rate environment has created an incredible opportunity for income-seeking investors to earn massive yields, but not through dividend stocks... Certain private market real estate investments are giving retail investors the opportunity to capitalize on these high-yield opportunities and Benzinga has identified some of the most attractive options for you to consider.\n\nFor example, the Jeff Bezos-backed investment platform just launched its Private Credit Fund, which provides access to a pool of short-term loans backed by residential real estate with a target 7% to 9% net annual yield paid to investors monthly. The best part? Unlike other private credit funds, this one has a minimum investment of only $100.\n\nDon't miss out on this opportunity to take advantage of high-yield investments while rates are high. Check out Benzinga's favorite high-yield offerings.\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com. Benzinga does not provide investment advice.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Buy in the Wake of Nvidia’s 10-for-1 Split",
        "content": "Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) recently completed its much-anticipated 10-for-1 stock split. That means traders who held one share of Nvida at around $1,200 per share now own ten Nvidia shares trading at around $120 per share. Investors have started considering other stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split. Given the reduced barrier for buying whole shares, it is typical for share prices to increase in the days and weeks following a split.\n\nA stock split also signals management confidence in the company’s long-term outlook. Nvidia’s shares rose modestly on the first day of trading after the split. However, several analysts adjusted their price targets upward.\r\n\r\nThe broader sentiment appears to be that confidence remains strong about the ongoing growth of artificial intelligence (AI). While some debate exists around whether this growth constitutes a bubble, most analysts do not believe it is near bursting.\n\nGiven Nvidia’s leadership position, its actions will likely impact other companies within the sector. Its success has even led to discussions about replacing Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) in the Dow Jones Industrial Average. Competitors like Intel may face challenges, but other firms could find opportunities.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) Close up photo of microchip (aka semiconductor chip, semiconductor device, Integrated Circuit) hold in tweezers with TSMC (TSM) logo on a background.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf Nvidia is attractive because it sells AI cards, then the semiconductor manufacturer producing the chips needed for those cards deserves attention. The less prominent TSM (NYSE:TSM) counts Nvidia as its second-largest customer. Even if rivals start designing and manufacturing their own AI servers, they will still likely require TSM for chip production.\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is working on its own AI chips and is TSM’s largest customer. Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are also said to work on custom chips and are TSM customers. Intel and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) chips are also manufactured by TSM. In other words, if an AI requires a chip to function, it likely has a TSM component, making this a logical consideration as one of the AI stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split.\r\n\r\nThe Taiwanese semiconductor foundry trades at a relatively affordable price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 32.3x for a technology company, just over half of Nvidia’s 71.6x. Analysts overwhelmingly have a positive outlook for TSC stock, with a history of exceeding estimates. Taiwan semi also offers shareholders a more generous dividend yield of 1.5% compared to Nvidia’s minimal 0.035%.\n\nMarvell Technology (MRVL) image of the marvell (MRVL) technologies office campus\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nAfter Nvidia’s recent stock split, looking for chip stocks in the 5G and data centers sectors is prudent. Marvell Technology (NASDAQ:MRVL) designs AI chips and infrastructure that major technology firms use. The company has seen solid gains, but analysts believe there is further upside potential thanks to expected growth in custom AI chips.\n\nMarvell provided strong guidance in its latest earnings report, expecting 8% revenue growth in a single quarter and an even stronger second half of the year. Despite lacking a P/E ratio following its reported losses, its forward P/E of 51.16x suggests investors are willing to pay the premium after Nvidia’s stock split.\r\n\r\nWhile the company remains unprofitable, analysts are optimistic about the MRPV stock and anticipate reporting its first profits in the second quarter. The average price target is $88.92 per share, representing a 26% upside from the current price. Its 52-week high hovers marginally lowered at $85.76 per share, still offering a 22% upside.\n\n​Arista Networks (ANET) Arista Networks, Inc. (ANET) logo displayed on top of a building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nThis cloud networking solutions provider is one of the ancillary beneficiaries of the surge in AI demand. Arista Networks (NYSE:ANET) high-performance networking solutions and data center switches are integral to building out AI systems, making them an essential element of the expansion of AI.\n\nAs one of the stocks to buy after Nvidia’s stock split, the company is targeting revenue from its AI solutions business to reach $750 million next year, becoming the largest component of its sales. That’s up from near nothing just two years ago. The company saw its EPS grow by 44% over the last year, with its gross margin up to 63.7% from 59.5% as it leverages into the higher-margin AI segment.\r\n\r\nEven considering this growth, the company still maintains a relatively appealing P/E ratio of 41.3x, just below the average for the tech sector at 45.2x. Analysts recommend buying the stock, with most setting an average price target of $319.29 per share.\r\n\r\nOn the date of publication, Stavros Tousios did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has seen its shares pick up since March, after significantly trailing behind the rest of the big tech sector. Despite a sharp recovery, the stock is currently 2% below its all-time high. Comparatively, shares are underperforming the market by about 6% in a year that has generally been very favorable for other major tech companies.\n\nFigure 1: Apple shares sharply recover following lackluster performance\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 3 Warning Sign with ACN. Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nAAPL Data by GuruFocus\n\nThis underperformance can be attributed to Apple's lackluster growth since 2021, with declining revenue in five of the last six quarters on a year-over-year basis and several quarters of declining net income. This revenue slump has been primarily driven by poor macroeconomic conditions. However, the overall industry environment for smartphones and PCs is improving, which should support the company's product sales in 2024 and 2025. Looking ahead to the second half of 2024, several catalysts could drive Apple's performance. These include the upcoming Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), the reveal of Apple's generative artificial intelligence initiatives, new product launches (such as the iPad and Mac) and the iPhone 16 product cycle.\n\nI will explore these factors in more detail as I explain why I believe Apple is an appealing option, contrary to current investor sentiment.\n\nA resilient tech titan poised for growth\n\nFigure 2: iPhone revenue stagnation since 2021, substantial update incoming Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nApple is no longer a legacy tech play that's falling behind, but rather a company with an incredible moat that should be relatively immune from disruption at the hands of new AI tools and applications. Plus, with continued services growth and a potentially improved upgrade cycle with the iPhone 16, I think the stock could be ready to move higher in the coming months. It is true that growth has slowed over the last few years, but the revenue stagnation since 2021 was largely due to incremental updates in iPhone models, which have not driven substantial upgrade cycles.\n\nAs such, many are expecting this coming year's update to be more substantial, between the potential for iPhone 16 to outperform and continued organic growth in services, I believe that Apple's revenue and net income should continue trending up and to the right over the medium term. Being more than three years away from the last strong release positions, the company is pretty well ahead of the iPhone 16, and that's even without the generative AI contribution. So a potential OpenAI partnership, improvements to Siri and other exciting AI features in photo editing, writing, music and more should be more than enough to create a strong iPhone 16 cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nStrategic advantage\n\nWhile it is still uncertain who the ultimate winners and losers of the generative AI opportunity will be, one thing is clear: even a decade from now, users will likely access these apps through Apple's hardware and devices. This is exemplified by Alphabet Inc. (NASDAQ:GOOGL) paying Apple $20 billion in 2022 for Google to be the default search engine in the Safari browser. This stability and competitive advantage present a highly attractive opportunity for Apple. Moreover, the company is well-positioned to benefit from new AI market entrants monetizing their apps through the App Store. As these entrants scale and seek a broad audience, the App Store remains one of the best platforms for it. With its monetization model, Apple is perfectly positioned to take a fee in return for providing this reach. As AI apps grow and monetize, this could significantly bolster services revenue growth. Apple is set to capitalize on the AI revolution, potentially unlocking a robust new revenue driver for its subscription ecosystem.\n\nAt the very least, we believe Apple will not experience material downside from being perceived as lagging in AI. All eyes are on the 2024 Worldwide Developers Conference, which started on June 10. Meeting expectations, the tech giant introduced its AI plans, which include a suite of tools it calls Apple Intelligence. In addition to the anticipated rollout of iOS 18, these generative AI capabilities could serve as a robust positive catalyst for the company going forward.\n\nFinancials\n\nIn the second quarter of 2024, Apple reported revenue of $90.80 billion, down 4% from the prior year but meeting the consensus expectations of $90.40 billion, which assured investors. Product revenue was $66.90 billion, a 10% decrease year over year primarily due to the one-time impact of iPhone channel inventory replenishment from the previous year. Last year, Apple managed to fulfill significant pent-up demand from the December quarter's Covid-19 supply disruptions for the iPhone 14 Pro and 14 Pro Max. Excluding this one-time impact, revenue would have been up 1% from the prior year, with iPhone revenue remaining flat. iPhone revenue was $46 billion, down 10% and aligning with consensus expectations.\n\nThe challenges faced by Apple's product segment are likely temporary, influenced by the harsh macroeconomic environment. Households across the developed world are contending with elevated inflation and high interest rates, which impact discretionary spending. However, demand for its products is expected to rebound as monetary policies across developed countries begin to ease. The April consumer price index showed a downtrend in the U.S. after a one-off spike in March.\n\nFigure 3: Second-quarter 2024 revenue and margin performance Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nAdditionally, Apple's gross margin improved, with the total gross margin percentage increasing to 46.60% from 44.30% in the prior-year quarter, driven primarily by a different services mix and cost savings. This improvement underscores the company's ability to manage costs effectively even in a challenging environment.\n\nRevenue and margin outlook\n\nI have bullish expectations for Apple's revenue outlook, driven by several key factors. The company's strategic push into AI, including the anticipated launch of iOS 18 with generative AI capabilities, is expected to significantly enhance its product offerings. This integration will likely boost demand for new devices and applications, driving overall revenue growth. Additionally, I expect the upcoming product launches to stimulate substantial consumer interest and drive higher sales. With improving macroeconomic conditions, including easing inflation and lower interest rates, I expect a recovery in consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth.\n\nFigure 4: Strong margins despite weak macro conditions Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Apple Investor Relations\n\nIn terms of margins, I expect strong growth, driven by Apple's expanding services segment. The services revenue increased by 14% year over year in the second quarter, contributing significantly to the company's overall margins. The high margins associated with services like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, compared to hardware sales, are expected to continue driving overall gross margin expansion as the Apple ecosystem expands through products like the Vision Pro. Further, as AI applications scale and monetize, services revenue will see exponential growth, contributing to higher margins. For the third quarter of 2024, I expect revenue to grow in low single digits year over year (in line with consensus and management expectations), with gross margins projected between 45.50% and 46.50%.\n\nFinancial strength and strategic opportunities\n\nApple boasts an unrivaled ecosystem and a balance sheet loaded with cash, giving it the ability to develop or acquire virtually any product. This combination of a strong ecosystem and a significant cash reserve presents substantial opportunities for the company. While Apple has not introduced a groundbreaking product recently, its potential to create another must-have item remains high.\n\nThere is ongoing speculation about potential deals, such as a partnership with Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) or an acquisition of Disney (NYSE:DIS). Although these transactions may or may not materialize, Apple's financial strength makes such moves plausible. Recently, Apple announced a $110 billion buyback, which aligns with its history of significant share repurchases, including previous authorizations of $90 billion and $100 billion. This marks the sixth consecutive year with buybacks exceeding $70 billion. Additionally, Apple has consistently increased its dividends annually for the past 12 years, recently raising the dividend by 4% to 25 cents per share for the current quarter. These actions underscore the company's commitment to returning value to shareholders while maintaining the flexibility to pursue strategic acquisitions and innovations.\n\nValuation perspective\n\nFigure 5: Discounted cash flow valuation Apple Is Positioned for Growth\n\nSource: Author's calculations\n\nIn evaluating Apple's future potential, we can consider several key drivers that contribute to its positive outlook. The anticipated product launches are expected to drive substantial consumer interest and sales. The growth in services revenue, fueled by the integration of AI capabilities into offerings like the App Store, Apple Music and iCloud, will further bolster the company's financial performance. As AI applications scale, they will significantly enhance user experiences and engagement, contributing to a robust and profitable services ecosystem. Moreover, the improving macroeconomic conditions, such as easing inflation and lower interest rates, are expected to revive consumer discretionary spending, further supporting revenue growth. The expanding Apple ecosystem, characterized by the seamless integration of hardware, software and services, will continue to attract and retain a large user base, driving sustained revenue growth.\n\nThe valuation model indicates a fair share price of $223.50, representing an upside potential of 15.80% from the current share price of $193. This projection is underpinned by a constant growth rate of 6.10%, which is supported by Apple's historical compound annual growth rate over the last three decades. The company's ability to leverage its strong operating history and financial flexibility to integrate AI capabilities positions it well to capitalize on the AI revolution. This revolution is expected to add trillions of dollars to the global economy through increased productivity, and Apple is poised to be a significant beneficiary. My confidence in the company's ability to improve its FCF margin, projected to rise to 24.30% by 2028, is based on its historically strong operating leverage and efficient cost management. Given these factors, I believe Apple presents an attractive opportunity with significant upside potential.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nApple is well-positioned for sustained growth and profitability, driven by its strategic integration of AI capabilities, robust product pipeline and expanding services ecosystem. The company's financial strength and operational efficiency provide a solid foundation for navigating economic fluctuations and capitalizing on emerging market opportunities. With a proven track record of innovation and shareholder value creation, Apple remains a compelling investment opportunity. Given the anticipated revenue and margin growth, alongside improving macroeconomic conditions, I am confident if will continue to deliver strong financial performance and drive long-term value for shareholders.\n\nThis article first appeared on GuruFocus.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "PayPal cofounder Max Levchin and a network of tiny banks could help Apple with its Goldman Sachs issue",
        "content": "Apple on Tuesday revealed a new way for customers to take out loans. Buried deep in a press release on new software products available this fall, the Cupertino-based firm shared that users in the U.S. will be able to “apply for loans directly through Affirm when they check out with Apple Pay.” Affirm Holdings, a San Francisco-based fintech that lets users spread out payments over months without incurring late fees or interest—a proccess called “buy now, pay later,” or BNPL—confirmed the deal in investor documents.\n\nAffirm’s stock jumped 11% on Tuesday to a high of $33.98, still well below its $52.48 high over the past year. Since then, the stock reached a high of $38.16 and was trading near $36 at time of publication.\n\nWhat’s interesting about the partnership is Apple already has a bank providing very similar services: Goldman Sachs. But multiplereports that cite people with knowledge of the matter have said the relationship is on the rocks—and could be on ice by this fall. Though Apple didn't respond to requests for comment on whether the deal with Goldman would continue, it did confirm the Affirm deal won't change those plans, whatever they are. Goldman didn't respond to request for comment. But multiple analysts who spoke to Fortune are operating under the assumption the deal is off—or soon will be.\n\nBy all outward appearances, the Affirm partnership looks like a great replacement for Goldman’s BNPL offering, according to Gil Luria, managing director of the wealth management firm D.A. Davidson. After all, U.S. regulators said last month they would treat BNPL the same as credit cards. While fintechs like Affirm may not replace banks in the eyes of users, they, and the network of smaller, mostly state banks that support them, could someday soon compete with the largest banks in the world.\n\n“From a regulatory perspective, and really from an intellectual perspective, there's not a lot of difference between a credit card product and a 'buy now, pay later' product,” says Luria. “In terms of the consumer perception, they are different products. And so it's hard to imagine that Apple will not have a credit card offering as part of its Apple wallet, even if it is providing a consumer credit through another type of product.”\n\nPayPal cofounder Max Levchin founded Affirm in March 2012 to build new kinds of payments products enabled by the internet. Almost right out of the gate, it competed against Apple. In October 2014, Apple launched Apple Pay to let customers use their iPhones to pay with credit cards issued by Bank of America, Capital One, Chase, Citi, and Wells Fargo.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn the fall of 2016, Affirm launched a service that let people choose how they wanted to pay for goods, which morphed into what is now known as BNPL. Apple countered three years later by joining forces with Goldman Sachs to offer an almost identical product. The offering was so similar that when Apple last year made it available in the U.S., Reuters described the event as threatening to fintechs like Affirm.\n\nWhile both Affirm's and Apple’s services sound an awful lot like a credit card minus the card, neither was regulated as such.\n\nThough Apple doesn't charge users fees, most BNPL companies make money through some combination of fees to users and merchants. Apple doesn’t break down its BNPL revenue, but Fortune Business Insights estimates the total market was $30 billion last year. Despite the promising revenue stream, just eight months after the Goldman partnership was publicized, Apple reportedly gave the investment bank a plan whereby the deal could be unwound by as early as November.\n\nEnter Affirm. The same day Affirm publicized the partnership, the company’s site elaborated: “Later this year, eligible U.S. customers checking out online or in-app with Apple Pay on iPhone and iPad will be able to apply to pay over time with Affirm for eligible transactions.”\n\nTo help fulfill customer loans, Affirm works with FDIC-insured, state-chartered private banks like Cross River Bank, from New Jersey, Celtic Bank from Utah, and Lead Bank from Missouri. In April, Memphis-based Evolve Bank and Trust, which issues the Affirm card, had customer funds associated with pig-butchering scams seized. It also provided banking services for fintech Synapse, which went bankrupt in May. Evolve didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nThat same month, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, an independent U.S. government agency regulating the financial sector, determined that BNPL lenders are credit card providers and “must provide consumers some key legal protections and rights that apply to conventional credit cards.” While the additional costs of complying with the regulation will likely eat into Affirm's bottom line, a written response from the company said the decision “aligned with responsibly extending access to credit.”\n\nThough regulators now view credit cards and BNPL as the same thing, Luria says the perception that they are different will likely lead Apple to seek a new, more traditional banking partner—should the Goldman deal officially dissolve: “It's very safe to assume that Apple will not have a hard time finding a replacement.”\n\nIf the Goldman deal does evaporate, there are dozens of potential candidates to replace it, including Providence-based Citizens Bank. Nationally chartered, Citizens is one of the few publicly traded banks working with Apple. Since 2014, it's been letting its users prove their identity using the iPhone’s fingerprint technology and provides financing for customers who want to upgrade phones. Citizens has $222 billion in assets. A bank representative says that contrary to other reports, the services are neither a credit card nor BNPL, and the Affirm deal won't impact the firm's work. “We don’t anticipate any changes,” the spokesperson said.\n\nState-chartered Green Dot Bank has $5.3 billion in assets and provides banking services for Apple Cash, which lets users send each other money. A Green Dot representative also confirms the relationship will continue unchanged.\n\nApple having so many banking partners only makes sense, according Dan Ives, a managing director and senior equity analyst at Wedbush Securities. Ives says the increasingly competitive series of financial products offered by Apple is likely intentional—it's designed to more efficiently capitalize on the iPhone’s estimated 1 billion users.\n\n“Apple has many partnerships, and they do not bet solely on one partner,” says Ives. “This a smart move by Cupertino in this space: Bet on the winners, and one will emerge.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple, Nvidia Secure Future with Taiwan Semi's Advanced Chips as AI Demand Soars\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Qualcomm Inc (NASDAQ:QCOM), Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA), and Advanced Micro Devices, Inc (NASDAQ:AMD) have almost fully booked Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company Ltd's (NYSE:TSM) 3nm chip production process until 2026, reflecting the artificial intelligence frenzy.\n\nThis demand spike reflects the rapid evolution of AI technology, pushing TSMC to innovate further in advanced manufacturing, TechNode reports.\n\nN3E, which started mass production last quarter, targets AI accelerators, high-end smartphones, and data centers. N3P, scheduled for mass production later this year, will cater to mobile devices and consumer electronics. It will likely be the standard by 2026.\n\nTo accommodate the growing demand, TSMC plans to convert some 5nm equipment to enhance 3nm production capacity, potentially increasing 3nm wafer production to between 120,000 and 180,000 units monthly. TSMC stock is trading higher on Thursday.\n\nThe contract chipmaker remains engaged in expanding its geographical presence beyond Taiwan. Recent reports indicated that TSMC is looking to recruit 2,000 employees in Europe, coinciding with its plans to construct a Dresden wafer fab.\n\nAlso, TSMC has significantly beaten leading Chinese chipmaker Semiconductor Manufacturing International Corp (SMIC), bagging a market share of 62% in the first quarter. It clocked a 30% sales growth in May, reaching $7.1 billion, as the intense demand for AI refuses to fizzle out anytime soon.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor stock gained 62% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock",
        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares closed higher during Wednesday's session on continued strength following the company’s WWDC event.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant has surpassed Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT) in market capitalization, reclaiming its title as the world's largest company.\n\nDays after it unveiled its consumer AI strategy, Apple has become the first brand to surpass $1 trillion in brand value, according to a global ranking by Kantar's BrandZ. This marks a 15% increase from the previous year. Earlier this week, Apple unveiled new AI features, expected to reignite demand for iPhones and reverse a sales decline.\n\nB of A Securities analyst Wamsi Mohan maintained Apple with a Buy rating and maintained a $230 price target.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.47%, which is a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,278,420 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $255,684 or around 1,200 shares.\n\nRead This: Jim Cramer Likes This Energy Stock With 4% Yield, Recommends Buying DraftKings\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.00 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple gained 2.9% to close at $213.07 on Wednesday.\n\nCheck This Out: How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\n\nStory continues\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "3 Blockchain Stocks That Can Turn $100 Into $10,000 by 2025: June Edition",
        "content": "Blockchain stocks and the industry are growing so quickly that investors can become multimillionaires if they time their bets right for events like the fourth Bitcoin (BTC-USD) split and the approval of Bitcoin ETF filings.\n\nWhat’s more, the ongoing interest in blockchain, illustrated by institutional money, is helping to legitimize the sector, which is making people more interested in blockchain stocks. For instance, the Depository Trust and Clearing Corporation has purchased the blockchain-based financial tech company Securrency. BlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is also in charge of the $47 million financing for Securitize.\n\nAlso, Yat Siu, co-founder of Animoca Brands, believes that blockchain technology will be widely used in the next 12 to 18 months, mainly in blockchain games. This will make blockchain stocks more appealing as their reliability and use cases grow.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nBuying stock in miners instead of tokens is the safest and most profitable way to invest in blockchain. This is because miners are looking to increase their capacity after the fourth halving and are expanding into AI to protect themselves against losses after the fourth halving on April 19. At the same time, they are not beholden to the price movements of Bitcoin (BTC-USD).\n\nAlso, stocks that make blockchain hardware are safe bets because they are not directly connected to any coin.\n\nLet’s look into it more!\n\nRiot Platforms (RIOT) In this photo illustration, the Riot Platforms (RIOT) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nRiot Platforms (NASDAQ:RIOT) recently signed a deal to buy 31,500 next-generation M60S miners from MicroBT, a smart move after the latest Bitcoin halving. These will increase the self-mining hash rate ability of its Rockdale Facility from 12.4 EH/s to 15.1 EH/s by the end of July. The goal of this $97.4 million investment is to make the system more efficient.\n\nAlso, the Corsicana Facility transformer was safely turned on, making it the biggest Bitcoin mining facility in the world, with a developed capacity of 1 GW. By the end of 2024, the first 400 MW of growth will possibly add 16 EH/s to Riot’s mining capacity.\n\nIn addition, if Riot decides to exercise rights under its deal with MicroBT, the Corsicana and Rockdale Facilities will both receive new machines, potentially raising Riot’s overall self-mining hash rate to 41 EH/s by the second half of 2025.\n\nAmid all of this expansion, RIOT continues to perform financially, reporting $79.3 million in revenue, up from $73.2 million last year and a net income of $211.8 million, or $0.82 per share, thanks to a 131% rise in Bitcoin prices.\n\nStory continues\n\nRiot’s stock price has fallen despite its strong finances, mainly because mining difficulty increased to $23,034, but the upside is phenomenal, at 78%, with all eight analysts covering RIOT rating it a buy.\n\nCleanSpark (CLSK) In this photo illustration, the CleanSpark (CLSK) logo seen displayed on a smartphone screen\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nCleanSpark (NASDAQ:CLSK), which boasts a potential upside of 40%, is also primarily focused on increasing capacity, upgrading its prior option to buy 100,000 Bitmain S21 Pro miners, having gone past 17 exahashes per second (EH/s) of operational hash rate.\n\nIf all goes according to plan, these additional miners will raise the overall hash rate bought by 17% to 23.4 EH/s. Operating at 15 joules per terahash, the new S21 Pro versions are 14% more efficient than the prior ones.\n\nEarlier this year, the company bought three Bitcoin mining data centers in Mississippi. CLSK also plans to buy 75 MW of Bitcoin mining sites in Wyoming for $18.75 million, with the option to add another 55 MW to these sites.\n\nAmid this expansionary effort, all eyes will be on CleanSpark’s mining capability. It generated 417 Bitcoins in May 2024, adding to the 6,154 Bitcoins it already had. It sold 2.43 Bitcoin for an average price of about $59,000 each and reported a hash rate of 17.97 EH/s.\n\nThe performance of its fleet has gone up to 23.05 joules per terahash. CLSK is also growing its campus in Dalton, Georgia, adding about 0.8 EH/s to its hash rate.​\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is the darling of today’s AI-powered stock market, recently becoming the second highest-valued company in the world after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, if analyst estimates materialize, there is more upside on offer, particularly after NVDA completed its recent 10-for-1 stock split and increased its quarterly cash distribution by 150% to $0.01 per share.\n\nNVDA makes GPUs for professional crypto mining, notably the Nvidia CMP HX range. Overall, Nvidia controls about 80% of the standalone graphics card market, making it the market leader in GPUs.\n\nOutside of blockchain, Nvidia has had considerable financial success as AI, notably generative AI and huge language models, drives its growth, accounting for 40% of its data center revenue. Success also stems from Nvidia’s Hopper GPU computing platform.\n\nAltogether, Nvidia made a record $26 billion in fiscal 2025’s first quarter, up 18% from the previous quarter and 262% year-over-year.\n\nBecause of such moves, Nvidia’s dominant position in the AI chip industry, its significant anticipated free cash flow of $100 billion over the next two years, and the smooth handling of the supply chain, Bank of America and Susquehanna analysts are business on the business in 2024.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "title": "Can Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Become The Best AI Stock of 2024?",
        "content": "We recently published a list entitled Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander is one of the most notable hedge fund managers in America. He founded Millennium Management back in 1989. Today, the fund’s portfolio is worth over $234 billion. Englander nabbed the top spot in Bloomberg’s list of highest-earning hedge fund managers in 2023, with a whopping $2.8 billion in net earnings including gains from personal investments and fees. Earlier this year, Bloomberg reported that Izzy Englander’s Millennium Management earned $600 million from commodities investments last year. However, in a separate report, the publication said despite installing a new chief of its commodities and making big changes, Millennium’s commodities business is lagging behind Citadel (of billionaire Ken Griffin) which made a whopping $8 billion from commodities in 2022. Bloomberg said, citing sources, that part of the reason why Millennium is struggling to post big gains is billionaire Englander’s imposition of “tight guardrails” to limit losses.  To make money in the commodities business, experts say, you have to take risks and give some freedom to traders. But Englander likes to be in control.  A Financial Times report earlier this year said Millennium Management manages a whopping $60 billion in assets, employs 5,400 people and has 17 offices. Yet Englander owns 100% of the firm.\n\nThe report said, citing a person who works at the fund, that this major concentration is “not a good idea.”\n\nThe FT report said Englander’s fund was up 8.3% in 2023 through October, while it returned 12.5% in 2022,  13.6% in 2021 and an impressive 25.9% in 2020.\n\nFor this article, we scanned Millennium Management’s Q1 portfolio and picked the fund’s top 10 holdings. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here). Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) Billionaire Israel Englander's Top Stock Pick for 2024?\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBillionaire Israel Englander’s Stake Value:$1,311,099,383\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) has finally entered the AI party with a bang, announcing new AI plans that many believe would create a strong ecosystem around the company’s software and hardware products. As a result, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares added over $215 billion in market cap and closed at a record high on June 11. TF International Securities analyst Ming-Chi Kuo said in a fresh note that Apple has a competitive edge over others with its on-device AI.\n\nStory continues\n\n“Consumers may find purchasing Microsoft’s AI PC confusing (calculating whether it reaches 40 TOPS before purchase), whereas Apple directly tells consumers which models can support Apple Intelligence. Regardless of whether on-device AI applications meet consumer needs, Apple has a clear selling advantage from the start,” Kuo said.\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given the company’s 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of that could change if Apple is able to actually implement and convert the AI features it recently announced at WWDC.\n\nDan Ives of Wedbush, one of the biggest Apple bulls, recently said that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and the company would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares.\n\nThe first signs of Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, the company revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is the company’s neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes “owning Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return because the market is in denial about Apple’s AI potential.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd on Insider Monkey’s list of Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024. You can visit Billionaire Israel Englander's Top 10 Stock Picks for 2024 to see other stocks in the list. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "It has been less than two years since ChatGPT 3.5’s release opened the capital floodgates for AI. Yet, in that short period, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) briefly surpassed Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap of $3 trillion, having increased its valuation by 643% since November 2022. While this trend amplifies the investing thesis, which AI stocks should you buy?\n\nIn particular, which companies have demonstrated clear-cut integration of AI to generate revenue and boost their bottom line?\n\nInvestors should consider these companies’ business models in the future to avoid relying on the “AI” buzzword alone.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdobe (ADBE) Adobe logo on the smartphone screen is placed on the Apple macbook keyboard on red desk background. ADBE stock.\n\nSource: Tattoboo / Shutterstock\n\nRecently, Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) tweaked its terms-of-use agreement. Although negatively received, it revealed trends that investors should account for. After transitioning to subscription model and cloud dependence, the company became a software as a service (SaaS) platform.\n\nDeparting from the traditional software licensing of one-time purchases allowed Adobe to boost its revenue stream and valuation drastically. The new licensing update enabled the company to access user-generated content hosted on Adobe Creative Cloud.\n\nConsidering Adobe’s existing rollout of AI algorithms, such as Content-Aware Fill and Sensei, this translates to Adobe utilizing those algorithms to further “improve services” by scanning vast amounts of user data, despite some caveats. This development is beneficial for existing and new Adobe shareholders.\n\nFirst, high-profile protestations of individuals do not have a strong history of impact. In the case of Adobe, this is even less pertinent because of the underlying mechanic. Namely, localized deployment of AI is not feasible for the vast majority of users. In turn, as they rely on cloud-powered AI tools, they become better owing to the network effect.\n\nBecause Adobe’s market share in the app development market is substantial, at around 60%, that network effect is also substantial. Conversely, in this cutthroat sector, Adobe’s services are likely to be superior to those of its competitors, making ADBE one of the top AI stocks to buy.\n\nAdobe has already proven its business model by consecutively beating EPS estimates since Q2 23 except Q1 (only -1.12% surprise), so the company will likely hold and expand its status as a content-generating hub. At its present price of $465.43, ADBE stock is close to its 52-week low of $433.97 per share. Nasdaq’s forecasting puts the average ADBE price target at $615.85 12 months ahead, while even the low estimate of $445 is near the present price level.\n\nStory continues\n\nBaidu (BIDU) Laptop computer displaying logo of Baidu (BIDU), a Chinese multinational technology company specializing in Internet-related services and products\n\nSource: monticello / Shutterstock.com\n\nAvailable as American Depositary Shares (ADS), Baidu (NASDAQ:BIDU) incorporated AI even more so than Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) or Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). As the Chinese equivalent to Google in the advertising and search engine arena, Baidu branched out to cloud services, smart homes, autonomous ride-hailing, augmented reality (AR) and healthcare.\n\nSimilar to Google’s creation of its vast app ecosystem, Baidu is cementing its position by releasing the framework for generating AI chatbots depending on users’ needs. In April, Baidu’s CEO Robin Li noted that Ernie (akin to ChatGPT) exceeded 200 million users.\n\nBreaking barriers to entry in creating custom bots, Baidu unleashed three pillars of the rapidly growing ecosystem – ModelBuilder, AgentBuilder and AppBuilder. More importantly, Baidu lacked ideological commitments, which resulted in Google’s Gemini launch debacle.\n\nIn Q1 earnings delivered mid-May, Baidu’s revenue increased 1% YoY, with quarterly net income growing 110% to $755 million. The company beat its EPS estimates for the last four consecutive quarters, with the latest surprise of +27.89%. From the present price of $95.89, BIDU stock is poised for significant growth to $155.06 per share, according to Nasdaq’s forecasting.\n\nAccenture (ACN) A photo of the Accenture (ACN) logo in silver and white on a silver, reflective wall outside a building.\n\nSource: Tada Images/ShutterStock.com\n\nExactly one year ago, in June 2023, Accenture (NYSE:ACN) decided to invest $3 billion into AI over the next three years. Building on its previous AI patents and expertise in client solutions, the global consulting company is scaling for the future.\n\nIn particular, through Accenture’s Center for Advanced AI, the company is heading its R&D division for generative AI. Considering that many chatbots have a confabulation problem, Accenture’s high credibility among Fortune Global 500 companies is likely to carve its own AI ecosystem, making it a strong candidate for investors looking for AI stocks to buy.\n\nFor fiscal Q2 2024 earnings delivered in March, Accenture broke its record on new bookings at $21.6 billion. The company’s net income increased by 10.3% to $1.71 billion. That was despite the decrease in revenue in Financial Services (-6%) and Communications, Media & Technology (-7%) and 10 bps decrease in operating margin.\n\nHowever, the 10% growth in Health and Public Service revenue made up for it, resulting in $1.99 billion in free cash flow vs. $2.33 billion in the year-ago quarter. At its present price of $288.40, ACN stock is close to its 52-week low of $278.69. Nasdaq’s average ACN price target falls to a significant upside of $372.28, with the low estimate near the current level of $275 per share.\n\nOn the date of publication, Shane Neagle did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "One of the best ways to spot winning stocks to buy is by spotting hot trends.\n\nJust look at artificial intelligence, machine learning, biotech, obesity treatment and solar energy booms that still offer solid opportunities.\n\nOr look at lithium stocks that could soon explode again on supply-demand issues. Or, flying cars that could soon take flight. There’s even the quantum computer story and new opportunities with AI an gene editing.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGranted, many of these hot trends have already created incredible wealth.\n\nJust look at Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). Or look at Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) and Viking Therapeutics (NASDAQ:VKTX), which exploded with the obesity story. Even better, with many hot trends still in their infancy, there’s still plenty of opportunity to be had in these hot stocks to buy.\n\nIn addition to those, here are three more stocks to buy today.\n\nDigital Realty Trust (DLR) A hallway with server racks on either side in a data center\n\nSource: dotshock / Shutterstock\n\nWith the artificial intelligence boom showing no signs of slowing, keep an eye on data center real estate investment trusts (REITs) like Digital Realty (NYSE:DLR).\n\nAccording to Goldman Sachs, data center demand is expected to rise at a 15% CAGR through 2030. Additionally, Jones Lang LaSalle CEO Christian Ulbrich said, “Data centers are emerging as the ‘hottest asset class’ as demand soars driven by US corporates embracing artificial intelligence.”\n\nDigital Realty’s President and CEO recently said:\n\n“AI has become a significant driver of demand as hyper scalers race to develop, deploy and implement the technology while enterprise begins to explore the potential of this wave of technological evolution.”\n\nThanks to that demand, the REIT’s total bookings of $252 million were “well ahead” of its prior quarterly record of $176 million. Again, with AI demand only set to grow, greater demand for data centers will drive Digital Realty to new heights.\n\nViking Therapeutics (VKTX) dollar sign written with pills spilled from a medicine bottle. millionaire maker drug stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nObesity treatment stock, Viking Therapeutics is another one of the must-own stocks to buy. While it already ran from about $5 to a high of $99.41, its recent pullback to $52.73 is a buying opportunity. All thanks to its experimental weight loss treatment, VK2735, a peptide GLP-1/GIP dual agonist in trials for injections and oral dosages.\n\nHelping, Goldman Sachs just raised its obesity drug market estimate to $130 billion from $100 billion. All on the belief that about 19 million Americans could be on anti-obesity drugs by 2030, up from a prior estimate of 15 million.\n\nStory continues\n\nEven better, Viking is turning heads with its potential treatment for non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, or NASH. In a recent Phase 2b VOYAGE study of its VK2809 treatment in patients with biopsy-confirmed non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, the company “achieved its primary endpoint, with patients receiving VK2809 experiencing statistically significant reductions in liver fat content from baseline to Week 12 as compared with placebo.”\n\nBoth treatments for NASH and obesity could send VKTX screaming to higher highs.\n\nNio (NIO) A mobile with NIO at horizontal composition.\n\nSource: Freer / Shutterstock.com\n\nWith electric vehicle sales starting to accelerate again, keep an eye on Nio (NYSE:NIO).\n\nAfter a rough few months, the Chinese EV stock is seeing a rebound in deliveries. In its first quarter, for example, the company’s EV sale topped lowered guidance with 30,053 deliveries. It also expects to rollout newer 2024 models, including the ES7, ET7 and ET5.\n\nAnalysts at DBS Holdings say NIO could see another 90% of upside, reiterating a “buy” rating. The firm added that vehicle margins could rebound to a range of 15% to 18% as the production of newer vehicles come online in upcoming quarters.\n\nRecent earnings were mixed. Its diluted EPS loss of 33 cents beat by six cents. Meanwhile, revenue of $1.37 billion, down about 7.2% year-over-year, missed by $70 million.\n\nMoving forward, Nio does expect to deliver between 54,000 and 56,000 EVs, which would represent growth of 129.6% to 138.1% year over year. The company also expects second quarter revenue of $2.3 billion to $2.37 billion, which is above estimates for $1.985 billion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nIan Cooper, a contributor to InvestorPlace.com, has been analyzing stocks and options for web-based advisories since 1999.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: 3 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy Instead",
        "content": "There's no denying that technology titan Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) has been many investors' favorite way of plugging into the artificial intelligence (AI) craze over the past 18 months. And rightfully so. Its processors form the backbone of most AI platforms.\n\nAs is so often the case though, time and reality are catching up with Nvidia. Competitors are diligently working to close the market-share gap, and (because it's already so big) accelerated Nvidia's growth pace is set to slow. Its shares are also very expensive as measured by some metrics ... a premium that has some investors questioning how much further it can go near-term.\n\nTranslation: It may be time to start shopping around for other ways to invest in the next stage of the AI revolution. Here are three other AI stocks to consider instead of (or at least in addition to) Nvidia.\n\n1. Palantir Technologies\n\nIf your experience with (and awareness of) AI is limited to user-friendly chat platforms like OpenAI's ChatGPT, Alphabet's Google Gemini, or Microsoft's Copilot, you probably agree they're clever applications. But generative AI doesn't exactly seem like technology that should be the basis for an entire industry.\n\nHowever, these AI-powered chatbots are far from the only way to commercialize artificial intelligence solutions. Far more marketable to industry and institutions are AI platforms built from the ground up to help them sift through mountains of digital data to make better-informed decisions.\n\nEnter Palantir Technologies(NYSE: PLTR), a stand-alone AI software name (meaning it's solely dedicated to AI-driven decision-making solutions) that's becoming a major player in this young industry. It did $2.2 billion worth of business last year and turned a little over $200 million of that into net income.\n\nThat's not a ton of money, particularly for a company sporting a market cap of more than $50 billion. The bullish key here, however, is the trajectory of these results. Analysts expect Palantir's top line to grow at an average of more than 20% per year for the next several years, creating the amount of scale that pushes up-and-coming companies well out of the red and deep into the black.\n\nDriving this prospective growth is the still-growing willingness to pay for everything decision-making AI can do. Technology market research outfit Precedence Research forecasts the AI software market is set to grow at an annualized pace of 23% through 2032.\n\nGiven that Palantir Technologies already serves a slew of high-profile customers including networking name Cisco Systems, the U.S. Army, and energy giant ExxonMobil, odds are good it's already positioned to capture at least its fair share of this growth.\n\nStory continues\n\n2. IonQ\n\nSilicon-based binary code computing has been around for decades now. And it's more than adequately evolved as the tasks thrown at it become more complex. We're reaching a point, however, where commonplace computing hardware can no longer handle the sort of software experts are able to conceptualize and then create. Quantum computers that utilize subatomic particles rather than silicon to interpret and calculate digital information are the new frontier of computers. To the extent this comparison will have any meaning, quantum computers can be on the order of thousands if not millions of times faster than traditional computers, depending on the task they're performing. This of course has enormous implications for AI.\n\nIonQ(NYSE: IONQ) is one of a handful of outfits developing such computing platforms. It's already developed and commercialized them, in fact; now it's just improving them. Its IonQ Tempo platform in development right now will utilize an integrated 64 superconducting qubit chip (a central element for the computing functions of quantum computers), versus the IonQ Harmony unveiled back in 2020 that only employed 11 such quantum particles in each chip.\n\nDon't misunderstand though. The world's not waiting on the next-generation tech. The company already boasts plenty of paying customers and developmental partners ranging from Lockheed Martin to Microsoft to Airbus to the Oak Ridge National Laboratory just to name a few. Last quarter's top-line revenue of only $7.6 million is still 77% better than the year-earlier quarterly comparison, with the company largely being held back by a lack of capacity to build more systems and offer more service. It's coming, however, in response to demand. Precedence Research predicts the quantum computing market will expand at a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030.\n\nThere's above-average risk here to be sure. That is, quantum computing is still a relatively young science. Its landscape could change quite a bit in the near and distant future.\n\nThe prospective reward measures up to this risk though. The current consensus price target for IonQ stands at $14.98. That's 85% above the stock's present price.\n\n3. Apple\n\nLast but not least, add Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) to your list of artificial intelligence stocks other than Nvidia to buy. It's a suggestion that might surprise some investors. While it's the United States' most profitable publicly traded company for good reason, it's not exactly been seen as a major AI player. (Saudi Arabia's state-owned oil company Saudi Aramco is the world's most profitable company.)\n\nThat's about to change though. At February's shareholder meeting CEO Tim Cook made a point of pointing out that \"every Mac that is powered by Apple silicon is an extraordinarily capable AI machine. In fact, there's no better computer for AI on the market today.\" Cook also highlighted Apple's work in generative AI. To this end, he also told the world to look for new AI functionalities from its tech later this year.\n\nWhat that meant wasn't entirely clear at the time, though details are slowly coming to light. In May, for instance, reports surfaced that the company was working on its own AI data center processors (rather than relying on third-party chips like those made by Nvidia). Then, at its annual developers conference this week, the company announced that OpenAI's ChatGPT would soon be able to be integrated with Apple's newer devices. Perhaps most notably, Cook explained that Apple wouldn't be collecting or storing any personal data from the usage of its new AI offerings.\n\nAt first glance, investors weren't exactly stoked. They were expecting a little more, or at least expecting a little more detail about these and future AI-powered features. But 24 hours later, the stock was trading up 6% on the news.\n\nDon't be like those initial stock traders and underestimate the potential of what Apple just unveiled. This may be exactly what a bunch of Apple's die-hard fans were waiting on before upgrading their iPhones. As such, don't be surprised to see sales of the breadwinning device finally perk up again. This may also only be a glimpse of Apple's bigger AI ambitions.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Rivian Stock Warning: Don’t Buy the Hype on RIVN",
        "content": "Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock is rising because of rumor and conjecture. Don’t buy it. The electric vehicle manufacturer still has poor financials amid an ailing industry. With EVs likely to report lower growth this year than last year, there is little reason to expect Rivian to buck the trend.\n\nAlthough the EV stock is generating support, buying RIVN stock without firm commitments is just gambling. If there is something there, investors will have plenty of time to buy in later. But because it appears to be more smoke than fire, you will be better off sitting on the sidelines.\n\nWall Street Take Notice\n\nWall Street is changing its tune about Rivian. Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas recently met with management and came away impressed. He said Rivian Automotive was “uniquely positioned within autos (other than Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA)) on scaling a fully integrated software stack critical to unlocking the AI opportunity.”\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nYet he offers caution, too. He notes the EV maker’s stock “is a balance of dilution risk vs. potential strategic partner rerate.” Basically, investors need to balance the risk of Rivian heavily diluting their ownership stake in a bid to stay afloat while awaiting good news to come to speed up growth.\n\nHardly a ringing endorsement, but he has an overweight rating on RIVN stock and a $13 per share price target. With Rivian Automotive currently trading at almost $12 per share, there is not too much upside left.\n\nIt should be noted, however, that Jonas’ price target is on the low side. Wall Street has a consensus price target of $19 a share, implying an additional 60% upside to come.\n\nPartnerships Part of the Buy Thesis\n\nPart of the analyst’s thesis for growth stems from partnerships Rivian can perhaps make with original equipment manufacturers to help them reduce their emissions through a vehicle’s electronic control unit.\n\nRivian overhauled its electrical architecture to enhance generative artificial intelligence for its forthcoming R2 vehicle lineup. It will consolidate the number of ECUs in the vehicle, which might not sound like much, but can save the automaker thousands of dollars on each vehicle.\n\nECUs are in every vehicle, electric or gas-powered. The more technology a vehicle has the more ECUs it needs. Rivian has developed its own ECUs and software and now has embedded gen AI capabilities into it. The EV maker plans to offer that technology to help other automakers reduce their costs.\n\nJonas writes, “Rivian can explore partnerships with legacy OEMs on their network architecture to reduce ECUs.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe problem is, while that could produce a nice revenue stream for Rivian, it is unrelated to its primary business of making cars itself. It doesn’t seem to be the sort of advance that will move the needle much in terms of revenue or profits, particularly if Rivian is losing money on the EVs it makes.\n\nThe Apple of Rivian’s Eye\n\nThe other speculative note that sparked interest in Rivian stock was the possibility of a partnership with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). However, there is no indication of what Apple might seek in a partnership or who the partner actually is. It is just rumor and fluff not built on any foundation whatsoever.\n\nIt is not likely to be anything AI-connected as Apple just said it was partnering with ChatGPT owner OpenAI to put the technology into its iPhone. At best Apple might put its CarPlay into a vehicle. Hardly a gamechanger for Rivian, so investors should completely discount the possibility.\n\nRivian Automotive’s business is hurting. It reported worse-than-expected earnings last quarter and it continues to burn through cash at a high rate. Until Rivian can report positive news about actually selling more EVs, investors would do best just standing on the sidelines.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

But it's always a good idea to have a list of stocks you wouldn't hesitate to buy if they were suddenly on sale.\n\nHistorically, a market sell-off of 10% or more from the previous high occurs about once every two years. The Nasdaq Composite experienced a mild correction almost a year ago, so investors should be prepared for the possibility of another dip in the next year or so.\n\nOne indicator that continues to weigh on the near-term outlook for the markets is the inverted yield curve -- the yield on shorter-duration Treasury bonds is higher than the yield on longer-term Treasury bonds. That condition has preceded almost every recession over the last 50 years -- and the yield curve has been inverted since July 2022.\n\nMarket declines make a lot of investors nervous, but the longer you invest, the more you come to see these dips as opportunities to buy your favorite companies at lower valuations, setting the stage for better returns when the market recovers.\n\nWith that in mind, here are two quality stocks that investors shouldn't hesitate to buy in the next market sell-off.\n\n1. Apple\n\nApple(NASDAQ: AAPL) is one of the most recognizable brands in the world. It has an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices. Combined with its cash-rich balance sheet and $101 billion in trailing free cash flow from sales of its products, it is an unstoppable business that would be worth buying on the dip.\n\nThe stock has surged to new highs this week as the company held its Worldwide Developers Conference, where it introduced Apple Intelligence -- a set of new artificial intelligence (AI) features coming to iOS 18 that could kick off a strong upgrade cycle for iPhones.\n\nSlowing iPhone sales growth over the last year had the stock largely trading flat to lower through the first half of the year. The share price is currently up just 11% year to date and lagging the Nasdaq's 17% increase, but Apple's growth historically has come in spurts around the release of new devices with improvements to hardware and other features. Apple Intelligence could be an incentive for users with older devices to upgrade, since it will bring several conveniences to iPhone users, including the ability to summarize documents and the integration of OpenAI's ChatGPT into Siri.\n\nWhile Apple Intelligence will be a free feature included in iOS 18, it will not run on older devices using previous-generation processors. It will require the A17 Pro chip found in the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max. It will also run on iPads and Macs with the M1 chip and later versions. These AI capabilities require higher processing power, but offering them is also a great strategy for Apple to boost sales of its premium devices and grow its profits, which will benefit shareholders.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple stock trades at a premium forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of around 31. If Apple sees strong demand for its newest devices when iOS 18 releases this fall, its revenue growth could accelerate, justifying that premium. Either way, Apple should be high on your shopping list in the next market sell-off.\n\n2. Microsoft\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) transformed itself over the last decade from a company dependent on a slow-growing PC market into a fast-growing cloud services provider. It's not easy for large companies to change strategies amid shifting competitive landscapes, but Microsoft has shown the ability to adapt quickly to emerging opportunities -- a tell-tale sign of an unstoppable company.\n\nThe stock has been performing well of late, supported by solid growth across the business. Microsoft is well positioned to profit from the latest revolution in tech as it rolls out new AI-powered features across its consumer and enterprise products.\n\nThe company's software and subscription-based services generate massive amounts of high-margin revenue, which is helping it fund its heavy expenditures in cloud computing infrastructure to meet the growing demand for AI services. Microsoft's revenue grew 17% year over year last quarter, driven by balanced growth across Office software and enterprise cloud services.\n\nMicrosoft is monetizing AI across a range of products and services. It now offers AI features in Office apps, Windows, and the GitHub coding platform. Its Copilot AI assistant is now used by nearly 60% of the Fortune 500. Revenue from the productivity and business processes segment, which includes Office and Microsoft 365 subscriptions, grew at a healthy rate of 12% year over year last quarter.\n\nMicrosoft is cementing its lead in software and becoming the face of AI for millions of users who rely on its software every day. The stock is expensive at its current forward P/E of 36, but it would be well worth buying at a lower valuation during a market dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "US stock futures mixed; hawkish Fed, soft inflation send differing messages",
        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures traded in a mixed fashion Thursday, as investors digested hawkish messages from the Federal Reserve as well as benign consumer prices, with more economic data due.\n\nAt 06:20 ET (10:20 GMT), Dow Jones Futures fell 155 points, or 0.4%, while S&P 500 Futures traded largely flat and Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 100 points, or 0.5%.\n\nWall Street is coming off a largely strong session, with the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite hitting all-time highs and closing at records. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average was the outlier, closing 0.1% lower.\n\nFed strikes hawkish chord, CPI inflation falls\n\nThe Fed kept interest rates steady as widely expected on Wednesday. But Chair Jerome Powell surprised markets by stating that the central bank was now set to cut rates only once this year, down from a prior estimate in March for three cuts.\n\nThe change in the Fed’s stance came as more members saw signs of higher inflation in the country, with some policymakers also calling for no cuts this year. The central bank also raised its inflation outlook for the year.\n\nBut the Fed’s hawkish messaging was somewhat offset by data showing consumer price index inflation eased slightly in May.\n\nThe May producer price index is due later in the session and is set to offer more cues on overall inflation, while the weekly jobless claims numbers will add details about the labor market.\n\nBroadcom shines\n\nThe rech sector has been in the spotlight this week, after Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a slew of new AI features for its flagship devices, and that it was also partnering with OpenAI to implement some of the features, and cloud giant Oracle (NYSE:ORCL) announced AI partnerships with Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nThis focus is set to continue Thursday, as Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) surged over 12% premarket after the chipmaker clocked bumper earnings on AI demand. The firm also announced a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nElsewhere, Dave&Buster’s Entertainment (NASDAQ:PLAY) stock fell 10% after the company’s first-quarter revenue missed estimates.\n\nTesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock gained 5% after CEO Elon Musk said in a social media post that shareholders are backing his $56 billion pay package and a move by the electric vehicle giant to reincorporate in Texas from Delaware.\n\nCrude slips on stockpile build\n\nCrude prices fell Thursday after a surprise build in U.S. crude inventories dented expectations of growing demand in the world's largest consumer.\n\nBy 06:20 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 1% lower at $77.75 per barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.9% to $81.89 per barrel.\n\nStory continues\n\nGovernment data, released on Wednesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories unexpectedly grew by 3.7 million barrels in the first week of June, against expectations for a draw of 1.2 million barrels.\n\nOutsized builds in distillates and gasoline stockpiles also drove up concerns that fuel demand was not picking up with the summer season as expected.\n\n(Ambar Warrick contributed to this article.)\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures mixed; hawkish Fed, soft inflation send differing messages\n\nVirgin Galactic shares tumble on reverse stock split announcement\n\nReaction to Musk's post on voting for his $56 billion Tesla pay package\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Asian suppliers of Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose sharply on Thursday, tracking sharp gains in the iPhone maker this week after it unveiled a slew of artificial intelligence features for its flagship devices.\n\nApple surged nearly 10% so far this week, briefly crossing Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) as the world’s most valuable company after investors reacted positively to its developer conference earlier this week.\n\nAnalysts bet that AI features will help spark a sales rebound for Apple, particularly its fast-moving iPhone, which has seen laggard sales in recent quarters.\n\nIncreased sales for the iPhone maker bode well for its Asian suppliers, which rallied this week.\n\nSouth Korean memory chip makers Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) and SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) rose 2.4% and 3.7%, respectively. Samsung SDI (KS:006400), which supplies batteries to Apple, added 0.5%.\n\nIn Taiwan, TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM)- the world’s biggest contract chipmaker and a major Apple supplier- rose 2%, while Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) (Foxconn), which assembles iPhones and other devices for Apple, added 0.4%. Both stocks were sitting on strong gains this week.\n\nIn China, AAC Technologies (OTC:AACAY) Holdings Inc (HK:2018), which makes acoustic components for Apple, rose 2%, while BYD Co (HK:1211), which also supplies battery technology to Apple, rallied nearly 8%.\n\nApple’s AI plans were welcomed by investors, who bet that introduction of new features, such as increased voice command functionality and photo editing capabilities will help shore up slowing iPhone sales. Given that a bulk of the new AI features are only compatible with newer iPhone models, their introduction could potentially spark a new upgrade cycle among customers.\n\nAI is also expected to further Apple’s software services, revenue from which has so far remained robust despite laggard device sales.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nApple’s AI spike sparks rally in Asian suppliers\n\nTesla shareholders voting yes for Musk's $56 billion pay package, CEO says on X\n\nWhite House to nominate Goldsmith Romero soon, aiming for July hearing - source\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com-- Most Asian stocks rose on Thursday as the technology sector tracked an overnight rally on Wall Street, although overall gains were limited after the Federal Reserve slashed its outlook for interest rate cuts.\n\nJapanese stocks lagged their peers as markets awaited a Bank of Japan meeting where the central bank is widely expected to tighten policy further.\n\nRegional markets took positive cues from Wall Street, where the S&P 500 and NASDAQ Composite clocked record highs on Wednesday as an artificial intelligence-fueled rally in technology stocks pushed on. A soft consumer price index inflation reading also aided sentiment.\n\nBut sectors beyond tech clocked middling moves, especially after the Fed warned that it only saw the possibility of one rate cut this year, down from previous forecasts of three. Some policymakers were also seen calling for no rate cuts in the face of sticky inflation.\n\nThis notion kept gains across most Asian markets limited.\n\nJapanese stocks lag as BOJ jitters grow\n\nJapan’s Nikkei 225 and TOPIX indexes moved in a flat-to-low range on Thursday, with sentiment towards Japanese markets turning sour before a BOJ meeting on Friday.\n\nThe BOJ is likely to keep interest rates unchanged, but is expected to further scale back its purchases of government bonds, tightening monetary policy.\n\nThe move comes after the BOJ hiked rates for the first time in 17 years in March, and marked an end to its yield curve control policies. It had also flagged an eventual reduction in its bond purchases, which it is expected to enact this week.\n\nBut the BOJ’s capacity to tighten policy appeared limited by persistent weakness in the Japanese economy, which contracted in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nTech buoyed by AI optimism, Apple suppliers gain\n\nTechnology-heavy indexes were the best performers on Thursday, with South Korea’s KOSPI up 1.5%, while Hong Kong’s Hang Seng rose 0.4%.\n\nTech stocks tracked overnight gains in their U.S. peers, with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) surging over 7% after it announced plans to incorporate AI into its flagship devices. The iPhone maker will also partner with OpenAI.\n\nGains in Apple spilled over into its Asian suppliers, with TSMC (TW:2330) (NYSE:TSM) and Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd (TW:2317) rising about 2% each.\n\nSouth Korea’s SK Hynix Inc (KS:000660) and Samsung Electronics Co Ltd (KS:005930) added 3.5% and 2.4%, respectively, while China’s AAC Technologies (OTC:AACAY) Holdings Inc (HK:2018) rose 2.6%.\n\nOther Asian markets were mixed. Australia’s ASX 200 rose 0.4%, having trimmed some intraday gains after employment data read stronger-than-expected for May. Strength in the labor market gives the Reserve Bank more headroom to keep rates higher for longer.\n\nStory continues\n\nChinese markets lagged as sentiment towards the country was battered by reports of more U.S. trade scrutiny against the country. The Shanghai Shenzhen CSI 300 and Shanghai Composite indexes fell 0.2% each.\n\nReports this week said the U.S. was considering wider chip sanctions against Russia, which could cover third-party Chinese sellers.\n\nFutures for India's Nifty 50 index pointed to a positive open, with the index remaining close to record highs.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nAsian stocks rise as tech tracks Wall St rally; Hawkish Fed limits gains\n\nWhite House to nominate Goldsmith Romero soon, aiming for July hearing - source\n\nDisney, Florida's DeSantis end spat with deal on 15-year expansion plan\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA): Underrated AI Stock Yielding Over 5%",
        "content": "AI stocks are hot, but many are richly valued, and few pay dividends. Enter Opera (NASDAQ:OPRA) — an underrated AI stock that’s profitable, trades at an alluring valuation, and features an enticing forward dividend yield of 5.1%.\n\nI’m bullish on Opera based on its user and average revenue per user (ARPU) growth, the advances it is making in using AI technology to enhance its products, its attractive valuation, and its big-time dividend yield of 5.1%, which makes it a rarity among tech stocks. Additionally, analysts believe that Opera has upside potential of over 50%, making this stock an interesting bargain in the AI space.\n\nWhat Is Opera?\n\nFounded in 1995 and based in Oslo, Norway, Opera is a provider of web browsers for Windows, iOS, and Linux computers, as well as mobile browsers. Opera describes itself as “a user-centric and innovative software company focused on enabling the best possible internet browsing experience across all devices.”\n\nHow does the company make money? Opera generates 58% of its revenue money through advertising and 42% through search. You can think of Opera as a much smaller competitor to Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google, but without the “Other Bets” segment the larger company comes with.\n\nGrowth Opportunities Abound\n\nOpera is much smaller than its competitors and only accounts for 2.5% of web browser market share worldwide as of May 2024. However, this can also be seen as an opportunity, as Opera has plenty of room to grow and try to take share from larger competitors.\n\nWhile it isn’t easy going up against massive, well-resourced competitors like Alphabet and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Opera can differentiate itself and compete with them by innovating and offering differentiated features that other browsers lack.\n\nFor example, Opera features free VPN, tracking protection, a built-in ad blocker, cryptomining protection, and integrated messengers, which Google’s Chrome lacks. Opera also touts the fact that it is more RAM/CPU friendly than Chrome. In a comparison between Opera and Apple’s Safari, Opera boasts features like free VPN, browser AI, a built-in ad blocker, built-in crypto wallets, integrated messengers, and other features that Safari lacks.\n\nOpera also differentiates itself by serving lucrative niche audiences, such as via its Opera GX browser, which specifically caters to gamers. Opera GX allows users to set limits for CPU, RAM, and network usage to optimize performance, integrate Discord and Twitch directly from its sidebar, and use GX Mods to fully customize the browser and create custom keyboard shortcuts.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Opera GX browser has 30 million users and is Opera’s most lucrative product in terms of ARPU. Opera believes it has a long runway ahead in this niche, estimating its total addressable market (TAM) to be 500 million users worldwide, an appropriately conservative estimate, given that it estimates there are 1.8 billion PC gamers globally.\n\nAdditionally, the company is growing its user base and revenues. Its user base in Western markets has grown by 64% over the past four years, from 31 million to 51 million, and its ARPU has grown by 248% over the past four years. Additionally, Opera GX has grown by 1,400% from two million users to 30 million over the same time frame.\n\nOpera may also have regulatory tailwinds at its back. The EU’s Digital Markets Act (DMA) now requires Apple and others to give users choices for default browsers on mobile devices, and Opera says this led to a spike in daily active users in the EU.\n\nCo-CEO Song Lin said, “We are starting from a modest base due to previous platform limitations, leading us to believe that the growth potential is substantial.” Lin added that Opera is “very excited about this development and will increase our iOS investments now that the playing field is more level with other key regions potentially also opening up.”\n\nAI Advances\n\nWhile Opera hasn’t received the same fanfare as many other AI stocks, it has released a spate of exciting AI-related updates in recent weeks. Aria, its new in-browser AI assistant, combines the ChatGPT model with up-to-date information.\n\nIn late May, the company announced plans to collaborate with Google to integrate Google’s Gemini AI feature into its Aria AI browser. It also unveiled plans to incorporate AI into “on-device browser capabilities to its flagship browser, Opera One, and its gaming browser, Opera GX.” While the companies compete in some areas, it appears to be a mutually beneficial arrangement for both.\n\nOPRA’s Alluring Valuation\n\nDespite these exciting AI growth prospects, Opera trades like a value stock at just 16.6 times 2024 consensus earnings estimates. Going out to next year, the stock looks downright cheap, trading at just 13.3 times forward earnings estimates.\n\nFor comparison, Alphabet trades at a reasonable but far higher 23.5 times earnings estimates, and the S&P 500 (SPX) sports an average P/E ratio of 23.4. Meanwhile, the tech-focused Nasdaq 100 trades at a considerably higher average P/E multiple of 30.9.\n\nOpera’s Dividend Makes It a Rarity Among Tech Stocks\n\nWhile many AI stocks are years away from profitability, let alone returning capital to shareholders, Opera pays a generous dividend and currently yields an enticing 5.1%. The company paid its first special dividend in January 2023 and subsequently declared a regular semiannual dividend of $0.80 per share.\n\nOpera’s yield is more than six times higher than that of the Nasdaq 100 (0.8%), illustrating just how remarkable OPRA’s dividend yield is compared to its tech-sector peers.\n\nOpera also engages in share buybacks and has bought back 35.5 million American depository shares since 2020, representing about 30% of shares outstanding at the start of 2020.\n\nIs OPRA Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nTurning to Wall Street, OPRA earns a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on two Buys, zero Holds, and zero Sell ratings assigned in the past three months. The average OPRA stock price target of $23.50 implies 53.3% upside potential from current levels.\n\nA Rare Bargain in the AI Space\n\nWhile many tech and AI-related stocks trade at sky-high valuations due to their immense growth opportunities, Opera looks like a downright bargain. I’m bullish on Opera based on its inexpensive valuation, considerable growth runway, exciting potential to further leverage AI into its products, and its 5.1% dividend yield, which is difficult to beat in the tech sector.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Broadcom Inc., a chip supplier for Apple Inc. and other big tech companies, rallied in late trading after its latest results and annual forecast topped estimates, lifted by robust demand for artificial intelligence products.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nHunter Biden Was Convicted. His Dad’s Reaction Was Remarkable. US Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials Fed Officials Dial Back Rate Forecasts, Signal Just One ‘24 Cut Stock Bull Run Breaks Record on Fed Decision Day: Markets Wrap Blinken Casts Doubt on Cease-Fire Hopes After Hamas Responds\n\nSecond-quarter profit was $10.96 a share, excluding some items, the company said in a statement Wednesday. That compared with an average estimate of $10.80. Revenue rose to $12.5 billion, compared with a projection of $12.1 billion.\n\nSales in the full fiscal year, which runs through October, will be about $51 billion, the company said. Analysts had projected about $50.6 billion, and Broadcom earlier said the figure would be closer to $50 billion.\n\nThe race to build artificial intelligence systems has benefited semiconductor companies like Broadcom, even though they don’t sell the highly prized AI chips made by Nvidia Corp. Broadcom offers a range of components that are used in computing and networking — including ones that are vital to data centers — giving it a boost from the trend. Broadcom’s acquisition of VMware also bolstered results, Chief Executive Officer Hock Tan said.\n\n“Broadcom’s second-quarter results were once again driven by AI demand and VMware,” he said in the statement. Revenue from AI products alone reached a record $3.1 billion in the period, Tan said.\n\nTotal AI sales for fiscal 2024 will be more than $11 billion, Tan predicted. And non-AI chip revenue, which had been sluggish recently, bottomed out in the second quarter. It is “likely to recover modestly for the second half of fiscal ’24,” he said during a conference call with analysts.\n\nBroadcom’s stock rose as much as 14% in late trading after the report were released. It had been up 34% to $1,495.51 this year through the close in New York. That compares with a 32% gain for the closely watched Philadelphia Stock Exchange Semiconductor Index.\n\nThe Palo Alto, California-based company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split, effective July 15. Broadcom follows Nvidia in taking such a step. That company’s split took effect on June 7.\n\nBroadcom’s semiconductor division had revenue of $7.2 billion in the three months ended May 5. That compares with an average estimate of $7.12 billion, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Infrastructure software sales were $5.29 billion, beating a prediction of $4.93 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nOne of the largest companies in the semiconductor industry, Broadcom has climbed the ranks via a series of acquisitions by Tan. That makes it a barometer for how the overall chip market is doing.\n\nData center providers rely on its custom chip design and networking semiconductors to build AI systems, but the company also sells components for cars, smartphones and internet access gear. And it’s increasingly pushing into software, including products for mainframe computers, cybersecurity and data center optimization.\n\nThe VMware acquisition, completed in November, has been a big part of the software push.\n\n“We’re making very strong progress in integrating VMware and accelerating its growth,” Tan said on the conference call.\n\nApple is a top customer: Broadcom provides key components for the iPhone. During earnings calls, Tan typically gives updates on Broadcom’s often-contentious relationship with that company, though he refers to it obliquely as his “North American customer” or another vague description.\n\nOn Wednesday’s call, Tan said Broadcom’s relationship with this customer remains “deep, strategic and multiyear.”\n\n(Updates with commentary from conference call starting in sixth paragraph.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nThe Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon China’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won’t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Elon Musk blasts Apple's OpenAI deal over alleged privacy issues. Does he have a point?",
        "content": "When Apple holds its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, its software announcements typically elicit cheers and excitement from tech enthusiasts.\n\nBut there was one notable exception this year — Elon Musk.\n\nThe Tesla and SpaceX chief executive threatened to ban all Apple devices from his companies, alleging a new partnership between Apple and Microsoft-backed startup OpenAI could pose security risks. As part of its new operating system update, Apple said users who ask Siri a question could opt in for Siri to pull additional information from ChatGPT.\n\n\"Apple has no clue what's actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI,\" Musk wrote on X. \"They're selling you down the river.\"\n\nThe partnership allows Siri to ask iPhone, Mac and iPad users if the digital assistant can surface answers from OpenAI's ChatGPT to help address a question. The new feature, which will be available on certain Apple devices, is part of the company's operating system update due later this year.\n\n\"If Apple integrates OpenAI at the OS level, then Apple devices will be banned at my companies,\" Musk wrote on X. \"That is an unacceptable security violation.\"\n\nRead more:Apple announces deal with OpenAI. Will it be a game-changer?\n\nRepresentatives for Musk and Apple did not respond to a request for comment.\n\nIn a keynote presentation at its developers conference on Monday, Apple said ChatGPT would be free for iPhone, Mac and iPad users. Under the partnership, Apple device users would not need to set up a ChatGPT account to use it with Siri.\n\n\"Privacy protections are built in for users who access ChatGPT — their IP addresses are obscured, and OpenAI won’t store requests,\" Apple said on its website. \"ChatGPT’s data-use policies apply for users who choose to connect their account.\"\n\nMany of Apple's AI models and features, which the company collectively calls \"Apple Intelligence,\" run on the device itself, but some inquiries will require information to be sent through the cloud. Apple said that data is not stored or made accessible to Apple and that independent experts can inspect the code that runs on the servers to verify this.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available for certain models of Apple devices, such as the iPhone 15 Pro and iPhone 15 Pro Max and iPad and Mac with M1 and later.\n\nSo does Musk have a point? Technology and security experts who spoke to The Times offered mixed opinions.\n\nSome pushed back on Musk's assertion that Apple's OpenAI deal poses security risks, citing a lack of evidence.\n\n\"Like a lot of things that Elon Musk says, it's not based upon any kind of technical reality now, it's really just based upon his political beliefs,\" said Alex Stamos, chief trust officer at Mountain View, Calif.-based cybersecurity company SentinelOne. \"There's no real factual basis for what he said.\"\n\nStamos, who is also a computer science lecturer at Stanford University and a former chief security officer at Facebook, said he was impressed with Apple's data protection efforts, adding, \"They're promising a level of transparency that nobody's really ever provided.\n\n\"It's hard to totally prove at this point, but what they've laid out is about the best you could do to provide this level of AI services running on people's private data while protecting their privacy,\" Stamos said.\n\n\"To do the things that people have become accustomed to from ChatGPT, you just can't do that on phones yet,\" Stamos added. \"We're years away from being able to run those kinds of models on something that fits in your pocket and doesn't burn a hole in your jeans from the amount of power it burns.\"\n\nRead more:AI companies are courting Hollywood. Do they come in peace?\n\nMusk has been critical of OpenAI. He sued the company in February for breach of contract and fiduciary duty, alleging it had shifted its focus from an agreement to develop artificial general intelligence \"for the benefit of humanity, not for a for-profit company seeking to maximize shareholder profits.\" On Tuesday, Musk, who was a co-founder of and investor in OpenAI, withdrew his lawsuit. Musk's San Francisco company, xAI, is a competitor to OpenAI in the fast-growing field of artificial intelligence.\n\nMusk has taken aim at Apple in the past, calling it a \"Tesla graveyard,\" because, according to him, Apple had hired people that Tesla had fired. “If you don’t make it at Tesla, you go work at Apple,\" Musk said in an interview with German newspaper Handelsblatt in 2015. \"I’m not kidding.”\n\nStill, Rayid Ghani, a machine learning and public policy professor at Carnegie Mellon University, said that, at a high level, he thinks the concerns Musk raised about the OpenAI-Apple partnership should be raised.\n\nWhile Apple said that OpenAI is not storing Siri requests, \"I don't think we should just take that at face value,\" Ghani said. \"I think we need to ask for evidence of that. How does Apple ensure that processes are there in place? What is the recourse if it doesn't happen? Who's liable, Apple or OpenAI, and how do we deal with issues?\"\n\nSome industry observers also have raised questions about the option for Apple users who have a ChatGPT account to link it with their iPhone, and what information is collected by OpenAI in that case.\n\n\"We have to be careful with that one — linking your account on your mobile phone is a big deal,\" said Pam Dixon, executive director of the World Privacy Forum. \"I personally would not link until there is a lot more clarity about what happens to the data.\"\n\nRead more:Scarlett Johansson also thinks OpenAI's new voice sounds like her. She's not happy about it\n\nOpenAI pointed to a statement on its website that says, \"Users can also choose to connect their ChatGPT account, which means their data preferences will apply under ChatGPT’s policies.\" The company declined further comment.\n\nUnder OpenAI's privacy policy, the company says it collects personal information that is included in the input, file uploads or feedback when account holders use its service. ChatGPT has a way for users to opt out of having their inquiries used to train AI models.\n\nAs the use of AI becomes more entwined with people's lives, industry observers say that it will be crucial to provide transparency for customers and test the trustworthiness of the AI tools.\n\n\"We’re going to have to understand something about AI. It’s going to be a lot like plumbing. It’s going to be built into our devices and our lives everywhere,\" Dixon said. \"The AI is going to have to be trustworthy and we’re going to need to be able to test that trustworthiness.\"\n\nNight Archiving Supervisor Valerie Hood contributed to this report.\n\nSign up for our Wide Shot newsletter to get the latest entertainment business news, analysis and insights.\n\nThis story originally appeared in Los Angeles Times.\n\nView comments",

Today's Research Daily features new research reports on 16 major stocks, including Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), Apple Inc. (AAPL) and Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), as well as a micro-cap stock CompX International Inc. (CIX). The Zacks microcap research is unique as our research content on these small and under-the-radar companies is the only research of its type in the country.\r\n\r\nThese research reports have been hand-picked from the roughly 70 reports published by our analyst team today.\r\n\r\nYou can see all of today’s research reports here >>>\r\n\r\nMicrosoft’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Software industry over the past year (+31.8% vs. +23.7%). The company is riding on strong growth from Intelligent Cloud and Productivity and Business Processes. Intelligent Cloud revenues are driven by growth in Azure and other cloud services.\r\n\r\nProductivity and Business Processes revenues continue to rise due to the strong adoption of Office 365 Commercial solutions. Microsoft 365 Consumer subscribers grew to 80.8 million in the third quarter. Continued momentum in the small and medium businesses and frontline worker offerings, as well as a rise in revenue per user, drove top-line growth.\r\n\r\nHowever, the office's declining commercial licensing has been a headwind due to the continued customer shift to cloud offerings. Higher operating expenses and spending on Azure enhancements amid stiff competition in the cloud space remain a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Microsoft here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of Apple have outperformed the Zacks Computer - Mini computers industry over the past year (+17.4% vs. +13.5%). The company is benefiting from increasing customer engagement in the services segment. The expanding content portfolio of Apple TV+ and Apple Arcade helped in driving subscriber growth. Apple’s top-line benefits from strong growth in emerging markets and growing adoption of its devices among enterprises.\r\n\r\nHowever, Apple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet, Microsoft and Amazon, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group. Following the launch of Apple Intelligence, its competitive position is expected to improve.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Apple here >>>)\r\n\r\nAlphabet’s shares have outperformed the Zacks Internet - Services industry over the year-to-date period (+28.4% vs. +22.2%). The company’s robust cloud division is aiding substantial revenue growth. Expanding data centers, cloud regions and availability zones will continue to bolster its presence in the cloud space.\r\n\r\nMajor search updates and removal of bad ads to enhance the search results continue to boost traffic on the company’s search engine. Growing momentum across Google’s mobile search is contributing further. Strengthening generative AI capabilities should aid business growth in the long term. Deepening focus on wearables category remains a tailwind. Expanding presence in the autonomous driving space is a plus.\r\n\r\nHowever, sluggish Network advertisement business is a negative. Increasing litigation issues and expenses remain concerns. Rising cloud competition from Microsoft and Amazon is a concern.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on Alphabet here >>>)\r\n\r\nShares of CompX International have outperformed the Zacks Office Supplies industry over the past six months (+18.2% vs. +10.8%). This microcap company with market capitalization of $292.45 million have a strong cash and marketable securities balance of $75.6 million as of Mar 31, 2024, ensures robust liquidity for operations and growth.\r\n\r\nCompX International also consistently pays dividends, with a recent 20% increase. The Security Products segment saw a 9% year-over-year sales increase in the first quarter of 2024, indicating strong demand. Efficient cost management in the Marine Components segment and aligning inventory with market conditions reflect operational efficiency.\r\n\r\nHowever, CompX faces a challenging 2024 outlook, particularly in the Marine Components segment, due to reduced demand and OEM customers cutting production. Security Products’ sales are expected to be lower, as a significant government project from 2023 is not anticipated to recur. Also, intense competition and dependency on key customers pose additional risks.\r\n\r\n(You can read the full research report on CompX International here >>>)\r\n\r\nOther noteworthy reports we are featuring today include NVIDIA Corp.

        "title": "4 Best Stocks to Buy and 3 Best Stocks to Sell: June 2024",
        "content": "It remains a tale of two markets. Some stocks have wind in their sails and are soaring to all-time highs. But others are paddling along and stuck at 52-week lows. In this market, a rising tide is not lifting all boats. Fundamentals and financial results continue to drive performance in the current market. Companies that beat targets with their earnings and have catalysts at work are seeing their share prices rise sharply.\n\nConversely, companies that miss earnings estimates and lack any catalysts are being punished and their share prices sent downward. This requires investors to be savvy with their stock picking among publicly traded companies.\n\nLet’s examine the four best stocks to buy and the three best stocks to sell this month.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nStocks to Buy: Apple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has been ignited by the company’s long-awaited artificial intelligence (AI) strategy. After initially dropping 2%, the stock rallied 7% higher the day after the AI strategy was unveiled. It hit close to its all-time high. The stock’s big move comes after Chief Executive Officer (CEO) Tim Cook announced a revamped Siri digital assistant and the addition of OpenAI’s ChatGPT technology to future iPhones.\n\nInvestors initially seemed concerned that Apple’s AI approach focused too much on consumers rather than on enterprise customers. However, sentiment quickly changed after several analysts who cover the company issued bullish reports. Those comments indicated that the AI strategy is likely to lead Apple’s billion users to upgrade to next generation iPhones. And this will create a huge sales boost for the technology giant.\n\nCurrently, Apple stock is up 12% on the year and looks to have its mojo back.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly (LLY) sign on corporate building with blue sky in background\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Michael Vi\n\nPharmaceutical giant Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) appears to have a new blockbuster drug coming to market. A panel of independent advisors to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommended Eli Lilly’s new Alzheimer’s drug called “Donanemab.” This clears the way for the medication to receive regulatory approval later this year. Donanemab will give Eli Lilly another potential blockbuster drug at a time when it is seeing brisk sales of its Zepbound weight loss medication.\n\nOnce approved, Donanemab will be only the second Alzheimer’s drug of its kind that’s available in the U.S. Their rival Biogen (NASDAQ:BIIB) has a treatment called “Leqembi. Donanemab is viewed by many in the medical profession as a milestone in the treatment of Alzheimer’s. Decades of efforts failed to develop medicines that can fight the disease. In a unanimous vote, 11 members on the FDA panel said data on the Alzheimer’s drug shows that it is effective at treating patients in early stages of the disease.\n\nStory continues\n\nThus, LLY stock has risen 94% in the past 12 months and is currently near an all-time high.\n\nCrowdStrike (CRWD) Person holding smartphone with logo of US software company CrowdStrike Holdings Inc. (CRWD) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings’ (NASDAQ:CRWD) stock is on a tear after the company issued strong Q1 financial results. Also, its stock is being added to the benchmark S&P 500 index. In a little more than a week, CRWD stock has risen 15%, bringing its year-to-date (YTD) gain to 56%. The stock has now risen an incredible 500% over the past five years! Clearly, it distinguishes itself as the leading cybersecurity concern.\n\nTherefore, news of the S&P inclusion lifted CRWD stock as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) and mutual funds that track the index are forced to buy shares of the company. The S&P 500 nod comes after CrowdStrike reported Q1 EPS of 93 cents. This is far above the 89 cents expected among analysts. Revenue totaled $921 million, ahead of estimates of $905 million. CrowdStrike’s free cash flow stood at $322.5 million, up 42% from a year ago.\n\nAll the good news makes CrowdStrike one of the best stocks to buy now.\n\nThe Gap (GPS) GPS stock: a close up of a Gap logo on a building\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother stock that has rallied hard based on its strong financial results is retailer The Gap (NYSE:GPS). Following a string of better-than-expected prints, GPS has increased an incredible 175% over the last 12 months. Yet, its shares still trade under $30. Also, the company’s valuation sits at 15 times forward earnings estimates. The stock pays a dividend of 15 cents a share per quarter, giving it a yield of 2.24%.\n\nIn late May, Gap stock jumped 23% higher after the clothing retailer reported stellar Q1 financial results and raised its full-year guidance. Gap CEO Richard Dickson has undertaken a turnaround strategy that is clearly working. Dickson has said that his management team is focused on brand storytelling, celebrity endorsements and positioning the Gap at the centre of culture.\n\nStocks to Sell: UiPath (PATH) In this photo illustration the UiPath (PATH) logo is displayed on a smartphone.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nA stock that investors should stay far away from is software company UiPath (NYSE:PATH). Recently, shares of the troubled tech company fell 30% in a day after it was announced that the CEO had departed. UiPath, which makes robotic process automation software, said that CEO Rob Enslin resigned on June 1 and has been replaced by company co-founder Daniel Dines. Before this year, Dines had served as co-CEO of UiPath.\n\nEnslin’s resignation comes as UiPath’s stock has declined 84% since the company went public in 2021, including a 50% YTD drop. Additionally, the company’s Q1 financial results were revealed. Despite beating Wall Street forecasts on the top and bottom lines, UiPath lowered its full-year guidance. The company says it expects revenue of $1.405 billion to $1.41 billion. That is significantly down from previous guidance that called for $1.55 billion to $1.56 billion in sales. Moreover, analysts have been downgrading PATH stock in recent weeks.\n\nTarget (TGT) an image of bullseye the target dog in a target store\n\nSource: Robert Gregory Griffeth / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmong retailers, Target (NYSE:TGT) continues to struggle. TGT stock is up only 2% this year. The discount department store’s share price fell 10% after it posted mixed Q1 financial results and said that consumers are buying fewer discretionary items. Target reported EPS of $2.03 versus $2.06 that was forecast on wall Street. The latest print marked the first time since November 2022 that Target missed profit expectations.\n\nRevenue in Q1 totaled $24.53 billion, slightly edging estimates of $24.52 billion. Target’s sales were down 3% from a year ago. Customer traffic, which includes online and in-store shopping, fell 1.9% in Q1. In addition, the average amount that customers spent per visit declined 2%. Same-store sales decreased 3.7% as shoppers bought fewer items such as apparel and products for the home.\n\nTo attract price sensitive consumers, Target has relaunched its loyalty rewards program. Also, it announced price cutbacks on thousands of items, including milk and diapers. It remains to be seen if the strategy will help Target moving forward.\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify (SHOP) on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nE-commerce company Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) is having a bad year.\n\nThe company’s stock plunged 18% after it reported a surprise loss for its fiscal first quarter. SHOP stock is down 14% on the year. The company shocked markets when it announced a loss of 21 cents per share. That was much worse than a profit of 9 cents that was the consensus expectation of analysts. Revenue in the quarter totaled $1.90 billion, which topped Wall Street estimates of $1.83 billion.\n\nThe surprise financial loss was blamed on the sale of Shopify’s logistics business and related fees that the company incurred on the sale. Looking ahead, Shopify said that for fiscal Q2, revenue will grow at a high-teens percentage rate year-over-year (YOY). Wall Street was looking for a fiscal Q2 sales increase of 19%. SHOP stock remains 63% lower than its all-time high reached in November 2021 when the market last peaked.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held a long position in LLY.

        "title": "3 Stocks to Cash In on the AI-Powered PC Craze",
        "content": "We may witness the next phase of the so-called artificial intelligence (or AI) boom as edge computing plays a bigger role in processing. Undoubtedly, AI accelerators in the cloud have been and will probably continue to be the way to run today’s most powerful AI models.\n\nHowever, running models on devices could be the new “first step” for simpler requests, especially once Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) launches AI-capable operating systems (iOS and macOS) and its latest slate of iPhones later this year. The data centers can always be connected for the complex prompts that “AI on the edge” can’t handle.\n\nApple had it right with its hybrid approach, betting on both the edge and the cloud. Also, the recently unveiled Apple Intelligence could kick off a boom in iPhone sales and a return of the Mac. As AI software advances rapidly, so too could the AI-powered PC craze later this year and into 2025. These are the stocks to buy for AI-powered PCs.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nApple received an incredible round of applause from investors on day two of its Worldwide Developer’s Conference (WWDC), with shares soaring more than 7%. Indeed, many analysts were big fans of what they saw during the event. I have a feeling the upgrades will keep flowing in as WWDC progresses and we learn even more about Apple’s longer-term AI plans.\n\nAfter a solid showing that catapulted AAPL stock to new all-time highs of over $207 per share, the big question is whether the firm has “caught up” in the AI race. The confidence of post-WWDC buyers certainly seems to suggest such. Further, I think the tailwind of Apple Intelligence could come into effect well before the slate of AI-ready operating systems launch.\n\nThe software may not have arrived quite yet, but the hardware has. The Macbook Air has the all-new M4 chip, which will likely be able to tackle coming AI features with ease. In my opinion, Mac is Apple’s horse in the AI PC race, and it’s one with great odds of winning.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Microsoft logo close up. Microsoft (MSFT) Flagship Store Fifth Avenue, Manhattan, NYC.\n\nSource: The Art of Pics / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) launches a fresh slate of AI-powered PCs called Copilot+ PCs. With such AI-savvy hardware and software, the enterprise cloud giant has a huge opportunity to bolster its standing with consumers. Indeed, we always hear about the benefits of AI for enterprise cloud customers, but what about everyday consumers like me and you?\n\nThough Copilot+ PCs weren’t given the same reception as Apple following its latest WWDC 2024 presentation, I think Microsoft has more than just a puncher’s chance to capture a bigger slice of the PC market with its offering. After all, Microsoft is an AI pioneer and owns the operating system (OS) that runs on most PCs.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs Microsoft announces more native first-party AI features (think Recall, which, thanks to AI, allows users to dig into past usage more easily), it will become that much more tempting to buy a Copilot+ PC. How Microsoft’s AI PC stacks up against the new Macbook Air with the new AI-capable M4 chip and macOS Sequoia (the coming AI-packed OS update) remains to be seen.\n\nBestBuy (BBY) Bed Bath and Beyond Inc. (BBBY) is an American chain of domestic merchandise retail stores founded in 1971. The chain is counted among the Fortune 500.\n\nSource: Mark Roger Bailey / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf AI PCs start selling over the next year, the high-tech retailers also stand to be a great bet. Best Buy (NYSE:BBY) comes to mind as a way to play not just a surge in AI PC sales but a rise in demand for AI smartphones or “IntelliPhones” and a slew of other artificial intelligence devices that aren’t on our radars. Along with all those AI-fuelled sales, extended warranties and other bells and whistles will be needed.\n\nThough BBY stock stands out as a great AI winner in this “second phase” of the boom, the stock’s latest post-earnings surge may limit the upside over the near term. Still, there’s value to be had for longer-term thinkers while shares are going for a modest 15.2 times trailing price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nCitigroup (NYSE:C) analyst Steven Zaccone recently upgraded BBY stock to Buy from Sell, citing “tech-replacement cycles underway” led by “new AI innovation.”\n\nIndeed, Zaccone is right to give Best Buy stock a double upgrade. Moreover, many people will want to try new AI features before they buy. At the local Best Buy, they can do just that before swiping their credit cards.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple and Microsoft.

        "content": "Bulls Push Wall Street To Record Highs On Declining Inflation; Tech, Real Estate, Small Caps Surge Ahead Of Fed Meeting: What's Driving Markets Wednesday?\n\nA lower-than-expected inflation report for May ignited a bullish frenzy on Wall Street, with investors increasing their bets on rate cuts, bolstered by growing confidence that the Federal Reserve will ease its policy stance later this year as price pressures trend towards the 2% target.\n\nThe Consumer Price Index (CPI) data revealed cooler-than-anticipated monthly and annual inflation rates for both headline and core items.\n\nThis report arrives just ahead of the highly anticipated Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, which will commence at 2:00 p.m. ET today.\n\nThe implied probability of a rate cut by September has surged to 72%, up from 54% before the inflation report. Fed futures now indicate a 55 basis points reduction (equivalent to two rate cuts) by year-end.\n\nIn response to rising expectations for rate cuts, traders quickly pivoted to riskier assets.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq 100 climbed 1.4% to over 19,400 points, setting new record highs. The S&P 500 Index increased by 1.1% to surpass 5,400 points, also achieving fresh all-time highs.\n\nBlue-chip stocks saw a modest rise of 0.2%, but the standout performance came from small caps. The iShares Russell 2000 ETF (NYSE:IWM) surged 2.7%, marking its best session since mid-December 2023.\n\nTreasury yields plummeted across the board, with the 2-year yield dropping 15 basis points to 4.68%. Long-dated yields also declined by approximately 10 basis points, propelling the iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (NASDAQ:TLT) up by 1.6%, its strongest one-day performance since early February 2024.\n\nIndustries sensitive to interest rates saw significant gains. The SPDR S&P Homebuilders ETF (NYSE:XHB) and the SPDR S&P Regional Banking ETF (NYSE:KRE) soared 4.6% and 3.5%, respectively.\n\nPrecious metals also rallied on the back of lower yields and a weakening dollar, with gold rising 0.8% and silver surging 2.8%.\n\nCryptocurrencies experienced sharp rallies driven by the risk-on sentiment. Bitcoin (CRYPTO: BTC) jumped 3.6% to $69,800, while the more speculative Dogecoin (CRYPTO: DOGE) surged over 8% on the day.\n\nWednesday’s Performance In Major US Indices, ETFs\n\nMajor Indices Price 1-day %chg Russell 2000 2,072.95 2.6% Nasdaq 100 19,471.20 1.4% S&P 500 5,435.07 1.1% Dow Jones 38,819.58 0.2%\n\nUpdated at 12:15 p.m. ET\n\nAccording to Benzinga Pro data:\n\nThe SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSE:SPY) was 1.1% higher to $542.76. The SPDR Dow Jones Industrial Average (NYSE:DIA) was 0.2% higher to $388.81. The tech-heavy Invesco QQQ Trust (ARCA: QQQ) was 1.4 higher to $474.65. Sector-wise, the TechnologySelect Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLK) outperformed, up by 2.6%, while the Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (NYSE:XLE) lagged, down 0.8%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWednesday’s Stock Movers\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) rose 4.7%, surpassing Microsoft Corp. (NYSE:MSFT) as the world’s biggest company. Tesla Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) rallied over 4%, following Cathie Wood’s bullish projection on the EV maker. The top performers among real estate stocks were Zillow Group Inc. (NASDAQ:Z), eXp World Holdings Inc. (NASDAQ:EXPI) and Redfin Corp. (NASDAQ:RDFN), with gains of 13.7%, 11% and 9.4%, respectively. Among the subset of stocks exposed to the office and commercial real estate sector, SL Green Realty Corp. (NYSE:SLG) and Vornado Realty Trust (NYSE:VNO) rose 8.3% and 8%, respectively. Within the regional bank industry, First Foundation Inc. (NYSE:FFWM) and Western Alliance Bancorp. (NYSE:WAL) rose the most, up 7.5% and 7%, respectively. Caseys General Stores Inc. (NASDAQ:CASY) skyrocketed over 17% in reaction to stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings and revenue. Other stocks reacting to company earnings are Oracle Corp. (NASDAQ:ORCL) up 12.7%, Autodesk Inc. (NASDAQ:ADSK) up 5.3%, Rubrik Inc. (NYSE:RBRK) down 4.9%. Companies set to report their earnings after Wednesday’s close are Broadcom Inc.

        "content": "There are currently six U.S. companies with a market capitalization of at least $1 trillion. Even with the impacts of inflation, one trillion dollars is still a huge sum. It’s quite a feat when any company joins the list of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nSurprisingly enough, the first ever trillion dollar market cap company was PetroChina, which briefly hit this point in 2007. In 2018, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) topped $1 trillion in market cap, and it was quickly followed by a number of other leading American technology companies.\n\nThere can still be explosive upside for a company even after hitting $1 trillion. Today, both Apple and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL, NASDAQ:GOOG) have already reached the $3 trillion market cap threshold and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is right around there as well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThat said, investors can earn larger gains buying into companies while they are still a bit smaller and have more potential upside. These are three more leading companies that have good odds of becoming part of the next batch of trillion-dollar stocks.\n\nBerkshire Hathaway (BRK-A) (BRK-B) The logo for Berkshire Hathaway displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: IgorGolovniov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt a nearly $900 billion market cap today, it should be just a matter of time until Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) reaches a trillion.\n\nWarren Buffett’s insurance firm and diversified holding company has many different ways to win. Berkshire operates many of its own businesses such as a railroad, electricity generation, paints, mobile homes, restaurants and more. In addition, Berkshire has a large investment portfolio including its roughly $135 billion stake in Apple.\n\nAs long as the economy keeps growing, Berkshire should be able to earn more money from its variety of operating businesses. And the value of its passive stakes in companies like Apple should rise over time.\n\nIn addition, Berkshire Hathaway is sitting on a large cash position. With high interest rates, this is delivering surprisingly strong interest income for the company, while giving it optionality to invest in any opportunistic deals that may happen to turn up. Buffett has already built Berkshire Hathaway into one of America’s leading firms, and soon his stock will graduate into having trillion-dollar status as well.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) Taiwan Semiconductor, TSMC (TSM) on phone screen stock image. trillion-dollar stocks\n\nSource: sdx15 / Shutterstock.com\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) has been one of the biggest winners from the artificial intelligence boom. That’s because TSM supplies a huge chunk of the global semiconductor foundry market, meaning that its products go into most of the leading AI-enabled semiconductor units available today.\n\nStory continues\n\nThis paves the way for Taiwan Semiconductor to potentially overtake Apple in market capitalization in the years to come. This comes amid a massive boom for TSM products; its revenues are up from $36 billion in 2019 to $70 billion in 2023. Analysts see this jumping above $100 billion in fiscal year 2025.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor isn’t just a top-line revenue growth story, either. The company is highly profitable. Even with the stock up more than 60% over the past year, TSM shares are still selling at 26 times forward earnings.\n\nThat’s hardly excessive given the rapid growth rate, strong industry tailwinds and favorable earnings outlook going forward.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nVisa (NYSE:V) is back on top of its game. V stock has been a huge long-term winner, with shares rising more than 1,500% since its 2008 IPO.\n\nHowever, Visa shares stalled out during the pandemic. The company earns its fattest profit margins on cross-border transactions which involve foreign exchange fees. The temporary shutdown of the global travel sector hit credit card profits hard.\n\nIn addition, investors feared that new fintech companies and cryptocurrency platforms could disrupt credit and debit cards. Certainly, in 2021, there was plenty of funding for alternative payments companies and Visa could have faced more competitive pressure.\n\nBut these concerns largely failed to materialize. Rival payments stocks have plunged in recent years as fintech companies struggled to maintain their prior momentum. Meanwhile, the global economy has recovered, with international travel being a particular bright spot. Specifically, CEO Ryan McInerney recently noted that cross-border travel spending is growing at a 17% year-over-year clip right now.\n\nVisa’s market cap is still under $600 billion today, so it will probably still be a couple of years until Visa enters the trillion-dollar stock club. But given the firm’s excellent business model and rapid growth rate, Visa will continue delivering the goods for its shareholders for many years to come.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Bezek held a long position in V stock.

        "title": "2 Traits of Shareholder Friendly Companies",
        "content": "There are many ways that companies can keep shareholders happy, whether that be through robust quarterly performance or rock-solid financials.\n\nIn addition, companies can also demonstrate a shareholder-friendly nature by offering consistent dividend payouts and implementing share repurchase programs.\n\nBut what are the benefits of each? Let’s take a closer look.\n\nBuybacks Can Put in a Floor for Shares\n\nStock buybacks, also known as share repurchase programs, are commonly executed by companies to boost shareholder value.\n\nA stock buyback occurs when a company purchases outstanding shares of its stock. In its simplest form, buybacks represent companies essentially re-investing in themselves. Reducing the number of outstanding shares can boost earnings per share (EPS), making a company's financial position more attractive to prospective investors.\n\nFurther, buybacks can help put in a floor for shares, reflective of consistent buying pressure.\n\nIn recent years, stock buybacks have become a popular strategy among large-cap companies, particularly in sectors with significant cash reserves, specifically technology. Apple AAPL, a mega-cap tech giant, recently unveiled the biggest buyback in corporate history totaling $110 billion.\n\nApple has been aggressively buying back its shares over the years, as illustrated below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nStill, it’s worth mentioning that buybacks can sometimes bring out the critics, as some believe the cash could be better deployed elsewhere, such as R&D. Nonetheless, buybacks are generally a net positive for shareholders, particularly those of mature companies with little growth left to squeeze.\n\nDividends Reflect Passive Income\n\nDividend payments are investors’ versions of paydays within the stock market.\n\nDividends provide a passive income stream, limit the impact of drawdowns in other positions, provide more than one way to profit from an investment, and provide the ability to reap maximum returns through dividend reinvestment.\n\nAnd with a little positioning, investors can actually build a portfolio that generates monthly income despite most companies paying on a quarterly basis.\n\nFor example –\n\nThe first stock pays its dividend in January, April, July, and October. The second stock pays out in February, May, August, and November. Finally, the third stock pays its dividend in March, June, September, and December.\n\nCompanies that have been paying dividends for decades reflect not only a shareholder-friendly but also a stable nature, flexing the ability to share a portion of profits through all economic cycles, good or bad.\n\nStory continues\n\nA great example of a company that’s consistently paid dividends is Genuine Parts Co. GPC, which currently sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy). Below is a chart illustrating GPC’s dividends paid on an annual basis dating all the way back to 1998. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nBuybacks and consistent dividends please shareholders, reflecting an investor-friendly nature. We’ve seen many companies announce sizable buybacks over recent years, with the most famous example undoubtedly being Apple AAPL with its $110 billion buyback announcement.\n\nCompanies that can consistently pay dividends are undoubtedly a favorite as well, with Genuine Parts Co. GPC, a current Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), holding the ranks of a Dividend King.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "3 Unshakeable Stocks to Buy for Slowing U.S. Growth",
        "content": "The U.S. economy is certainly showing some signs of slowing, raising questions about which stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth. According to the household survey of the May employment report, the number of people with jobs dropped by 408,000 last month. Further, the unemployment rate rose to 4% for the first time since January 2022 and the labor force participation rate dropped by 0.2 of a percentage point. Also in May, the Institute for Supply Management’s manufacturing purchasing managers index (PMI) came in at 48.7.\n\nPMI readings below 50 indicate that the sector being measured is contracting. And as I pointed out in a previous article, the housing sector, which is an important sector of the U.S. economy, appears to be poised to contract. Also importantly, consumers are reducing the amount that they spend on goods, while lower-end consumers are generally in bad shape, USA Todayreported on June 10. For investors who want to protect their portfolios from the impact of the decelerating economy, here are three stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth.\n\nEaton (ETN)\n\nBank of Americarecently named electrical-components maker Eaton (NYSE:ETN) as one of the top 19 beneficiaries of the electrification of the economy. Among the trends that will create large increases in the demand for electricity are the proliferation of AI and data centers, the bank noted. Given the huge cash reserves of many firms driving the latter trends, including Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) these developments are unlikely to falter from slowing economic growth. Moreover, very few people cut back a great deal on electricity usage during economic downturns, so the utilities that buy Eaton’s equipment will not curtail their spending plans if economic growth slows a great deal. The imperviousness of Eaton’s customers to economic slowdowns makes it one of the best stocks to buy for slowing U.S. growth.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAlso importantly, the firm is benefiting significantly from high government spending on infrastructure, along with various tax breaks and chip-manufacturing subsidies implemented by Washington in recent years.\n\nIn the first quarter, Eaton’s operating cash flow soared 42% versus the same period a year earlier to $475 million. Also impressively, the backlog of its electrical business jumped 27% year-over-year as of the end of Q1, while it raised its revenue growth guidance, excluding the impact of acquisitions, to 7%-9% from 6.5%-8.5%.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE)\n\nLike Eaton, NextEra (NYSE:NEE) seems very well-positioned to benefit from large increases in electricity demand going forward. NextEra owns the nation’s largest electric utility and sells large amounts of renewable energy.\n\nStory continues\n\nUtilities are widely expected to get a sizeable boost from the electrification of the economy. Moreover, many data center owners rely primarily on renewable energy.\n\nLikely because of these strong, positive catalysts, NextEra is one of eightutility stocks upon which Goldman Sachs has bestowed “buy” ratings. Like me, Goldman views utilities as having “Defensive” characteristics and believes that the utility sector is an effective play on the proliferation of AI.\n\nInvestor’s Business Daily gives NEE stock a very high Composite Rating of 92, along with an Accumulation/Distribution grade of A. The latter rating indicates that many large institutional investors have been buying significant amounts of NEE stock over the last 13 weeks.\n\nNEE stock has a relatively low forward price-earnings ratio of 22 times.\n\nNetflix (NFLX)\n\nI believe that Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) will be rather resilient to slowing economic growth. That’s because Netflix is a very cheap form of entertainment, and a recession would likely accelerate the cord-cutting trend. The latter development, in turn, would cause the growth of Netflix’s subscriber base and ad revenue to meaningfully accelerate.\n\nMeanwhile, after conducting a survey of Netflix users late last month, investment bank Evercore ISIwrote that the satisfaction levels of the company’s users have increased by five percentage points versus the previous quarter to 61%. And well-known Evercore analyst Mark Mahaney, who met with the company’s management, believes that “Netflix is in the strongest position financially, fundamentally and competitively that we have ever seen.” The bank reiterated an “outperform” rating on the shares.\n\nAdditionally, I believe that Netflix can benefit financially from its inclusion in multi-channel bundles. Recently, for example, Comcast (NYSE:CMCSA) included the company in a bundle with Peacock and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Apple TV.\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in AMZN.

        "content": "Wall Street closed mixed on Tuesday, pulled up by tech stocks. Investors traded cautiously ahead of this week’s inflation numbers and the Fed’s June FOMC meeting. Two of the three major stock indexes ended in the green, while one ended in the red.\n\nHow Did the Benchmarks Perform?\n\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJI) slid 120.62 points, or 0.3%, to close at 38,747.42. Eighteen components of the 30-stock index ended in negative territory, while 12 ended in positive.\n\nThe tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite gained 151.02 points, or 0.9%, to close at 17,343.55.\n\nThe S&P 500 advanced 14.53 points, or 0.3%, to close at 5,375.32. However, nine of the 11 broad sectors of the benchmark index closed in the red. The Financials Select Sector SPDR (XLF), the Utilities Select Sector SPDR (XLU) and the Industrials Select Sector SPDR (XLI) fell 1.2%, 0.6% and 0.6%, respectively, while the Technology Select Sector SPDR (XLK) gained 1.9%.\n\nThe fear-gauge CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) increased 0.9% to 12.85. A total of 10.7 billion shares were traded on Tuesday, lower than the last 20-session average of 12.8 billion. Decliners outnumbered advancers by a 1.52-to-1 ratio on the NYSE. On the Nasdaq, declining issues outnumbered advancing ones by a 1.17-to-1 ratio.\n\nApple (AAPL) Stock Drives the Market’s Gains\n\nApple Inc.’s AAPL stock jumped 7.3% on Tuesday, reaching a record high and giving a chase to Microsoft Corporation’s MSFT apex position in terms of valuation. This was caused by Apple unveiling new and exciting AI features at its annual developer event and the optimism around these announcements.\n\nApple announced that it will now integrate its new “Apple Intelligence” technology across its products and applications including Siri, the voice assistant, and will incorporate ChatGPT into its devices.\n\nThese announcements led to the company’s stock shooting up and the tech sector, in general, becoming the biggest earning sector on a day when stock trading was otherwise choppy. So great was its impact that tech, despite being one of only two of S&P 500’s 11 Select SPDR sectors to close in the green, dragged the index into the positive zone.\n\nConsequently, shares of Zscaler, Inc. ZS and Microsoft gained 2% and 1.1%, respectively. Both currently carry a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nInvestors Keenly Await Inflation Data and Takeaways From Fed Meet\n\nFollowing stronger-than-expected jobs numbers released on Friday, markets have revised their expectations of the September rate cut by the Fed.  CME’s FedWatch tool currently suggests a 48.3% chance that the central bank would cut rates in September. Also, inflation numbers from May will be released today. Investors would keep a keen watch on price trends and whether the recent softening sustains.\n\nStory continues\n\nInvestors traded cautiously all day Tuesday in a wait-and-watch mode. The central bank will be releasing its updated economic projections and dot plot, which would show where the Fed officials expect interest rates to be this year and going forward.\n\nNo economic data was released on Tuesday.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "title": "Apple Jumps on the AI Bandwagon: ETFs to Buy",
        "content": "Apple AAPL, which is way behind its competitors in adopting artificial intelligence (AI), is finally catching up following the launch of new AI features at its long-anticipated Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). The introduction of numerous AI-powered features is expected to kickstart the next upgrade cycle, enhancing the company's performance and restoring investor confidence in Apple.\r\n\r\nThe stock jumped 7% to a record high, marking the biggest one-day jump since November 2022 and the first all-time high of 2024. The gain added $215.1 billion to the company’s market capitalization, translating to one of the biggest single-day value additions by any company in history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg (read: Forget iPhone: 4 Reasons to Bet on Apple ETFs).\r\n\r\nInvestors seeking to tap the upcoming boom should buy ETFs having the largest allocation to the tech titan. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund XLK, Vanguard Information Technology ETF VGT, MSCI Information Technology Index ETF FTEC, iShares US Technology ETF IYW and Vanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF MGK have Apple as the top or second firm with a double-digit allocation and carry a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) or 2 (Buy).\n\nNew AI Features\n\nAt the annual WWDC on Monday, the iPhone maker unveiled a brand new AI feature called Apple Intelligence for iPhones, iPads and Macs. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it.\r\n\r\nApple Intelligence unlocks new ways for users to enhance their writing and communicate more effectively. With brand-new systemwide Writing Tools built into iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS Sequoia, users can rewrite, proofread and summarize text nearly everywhere they write, including Mail, Notes, Pages and third-party apps. The company will push this feature as integral to its various operating system offerings, including iOS, macOS and the latest, visionOS (read: Bet on \"Apple Intelligence\" With These ETFs).\r\n\r\nApple Intelligence also includes the biggest update to Siri since it was announced more than a decade ago. The feature will be “more deeply integrated” into its operating systems. In the case of iOS, this will mean trading the familiar Siri icon for a blue, glowing border that surrounds the desktop while in use. The new AI technology will also bring new features to emojis with personalized Genmoji by using a text field to build customized emojis.\r\n\r\nApple announced a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which provides customers access to ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. Apple Intelligence will be rolled out later this year, but some features, including the ability for Siri to precisely control features within apps, won’t come until next year. Support for languages beyond English will also arrive later.\n\nStory continues\n\nAnalysts Turn Bullish\n\nWall Street is once again bullish on Apple in the wake of the company's new AI features. At least 13 analysts raised their price targets on Apple after the event, with some saying the latest features could encourage a frenzy of new purchases as the company prepares to announce a new line of iPhones in autumn.\r\n\r\nAn analyst at Wedbush expects the addition of the new tools to iPhone to spark \"an AI-driven iPhone upgrade cycle starting with iPhone 16.\" The analyst expects AI to add $30 to $40 per share to Apple's growth story. Meanwhile, an analyst at Bank of America is also optimistic that the features will lead to “an upgrade cycle for AI-enabled IntelliPhones.”\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLK)\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund targets the broad technology sector and follows the Technology Select Sector Index. It holds about 65 securities in its basket, with Apple making up 21% share. Technology Select Sector SPDR Fund has key holdings in software, semiconductors and semiconductor equipment, and technology hardware, storage and peripherals.\r\n\r\nTechnology Select Sector SPDR Fund is the most popular and heavily traded ETF, with an AUM of $67.1 billion and an average daily volume of 5.5 million shares. The fund charges 9 bps in fees per year.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF (VGT)\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF manages $70 billion in its asset base and provides exposure to 313 technology stocks. It currently tracks the MSCI US Investable Market Information Technology 25/50 Index. Here, Apple accounts for a 15.3% share. Semiconductors, systems software, technology hardware storage & peripheral and application software are the top four sectors.\r\n\r\nVanguard Information Technology ETF has an expense ratio of 0.10%, whereas volume is solid at nearly 412,000 shares (read: Can Tech ETFs Keep Up Their Winning Momentum?).\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF (FTEC)\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF is home to 305 technology stocks with an AUM of $10.1 billion. It follows the MSCI USA IMI Information Technology Index. Apple accounts for a 15.8% share in the basket.\r\n\r\nMSCI Information Technology Index ETF has an expense ratio of 0.08%, while volume is solid at 207,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\niShares US Technology ETF (IYW)\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF tracks the Russell 1000 Technology RIC 22.5/45 Capped Index, giving investors exposure to 131 U.S. electronics, computer software and hardware, and informational technology companies. Apple makes up 15.5% of the assets.\r\n\r\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF has an AUM of $17.7 billion and charges 40 bps in fees and expenses. Volume is good as it exchanges 911,000 shares a day.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF (MGK)\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF offers diversified exposure to the largest growth stocks in the U.S. market. It tracks the CRSP US Mega Cap Growth Index and holds 79 securities in its basket, with Apple accounting for 12.4% of the total assets.\r\n\r\nVanguard Mega Cap Growth ETF charges 7 bps in annual fees and trades in a good volume of around 277,000 shares a day on average.

        "title": "Prediction: 2 Stocks That Will Be Worth More Than Apple 10 Years From Now",
        "content": "Well, it's official: Another company has surpassed Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) market cap. Last week, Nvidia became the second-largest U.S. company, trailing only Microsoft.\n\nIt was another blow to Apple, whose revenue remains stuck in neutral. And it's facing a federal antitrust lawsuit.\n\nIndeed, given Apple's struggles and the impressive growth of some of its fellow tech megacaps, several more companies will likely surpass Apple's market value over the next decade. I expect Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOG)(NASDAQ: GOOGL) and Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) will be among them.  Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThe case for Alphabet\n\nAs of this writing, Alphabet has a market cap of $2.2 trillion, trailing Apple by \"only\" $900 billion.\n\nAt first blush, that gap might seem insurmountable, but for a megacap, it's entirely feasible. Nvidia, for instance, closed a recent gap of $1.8 trillion with Apple in less than six months.\n\nAnd Alphabet is up by about 26% year to date, while Apple is up just 6%. That means the former has shrunk the lead of the latter by about $275 billion so far this year. If that trend continues, Alphabet will surpass Apple in size within a couple of years.\n\nThat might turn out to be too much to expect, but over the long term, I do think Alphabet will catch up. First and foremost, Apple is a hardware company. It designs and sells computers, tablets, watches, and smartphones. Alphabet, on the other hand, is a software company. Its signature business is internet search through Google. It makes most of its money by selling digital ads. Crucially, digital advertising is cheap and easy to scale; mass production of physical electronics is not.\n\nWhat's more, Apple has put its signature product, the iPhone, into the hands of almost every human being who might want one. With an estimated 1.4 billion iPhones in use today, there's little room for it to grow its share of that key market.\n\nConversely, Alphabet's revenue grew 15% in the first quarter. The company relies on digital ad revenue (from its Google search business and YouTube), subscription revenue (YouTube, Google Fiber), and data center revenue from its Google Cloud segment. Those diversified revenue streams will help keep its growth humming along well into the future.\n\nAmazon\n\nE-commerce and cloud services leader Amazon has a market cap of $1.9 trillion, which trails Apple by about $1.2 trillion.\n\nBut like Alphabet, Amazon has narrowed the gap this year. Amazon shares have rallied by 22% year to date, with the company's market cap increasing by about $300 billion, while Apple has gained around $150 billion. If Amazon keeps closing the gap at that rate, it could catch Apple in around four years.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat isn't out of the question. Amazon's annual revenue is almost $600 billion -- roughly the same size as Sweden's entire economy in 2022. Moreover, the company is growing sales by 13% year over year, with its expansive e-commerce business and its industry-leading cloud services division, Amazon Web Services (AWS).\n\nMoreover, the pace and size of advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could further accelerate that growth. AWS is a key driver for Amazon's profits, and that segment is in position to capitalize on this revolution. AI-powered apps require enormous computing power, the sort that can only be provided by high-performance data centers, many of which are run by AWS.\n\nAmazon is a tech juggernaut that is likely to continue growing -- and growing faster than Apple.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Adobe Results to Reveal Scale of Threat From GenAI Competition",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Investors in Adobe Inc. are increasingly on edge about competition from generative AI. The Photoshop maker’s results will illustrate how it’s coping with the threat.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nUS Inflation Broadly Cools in Encouraging Sign for Fed Officials Blinken Casts Doubt on Cease-Fire Prospects After Hamas Responds EU to Slap Tariffs of Up to 48% on EV Imports From China Hunter Biden Convicted of Gun Charges by Jury in Delaware Britain’s ‘Quiet Quitters’ Are Costing the Economy £257 Billion\n\nEarlier this week, Melius Research downgraded Adobe to hold from buy, citing risks from image and video generators from OpenAI and Alphabet Inc.’s Google. Adobe shares are down more than 20% this year as Wall Street considers its prospects in a world where AI products create text and images out of user prompts.\n\n“Companies will pay for software that offers a clear return on investment, but it’s become less clear which services do if AI platforms can just offer a version of the product as a feature,” said Sean Sun, portfolio manager at Thornburg Investment Management. “Adobe is integrating AI into its own products, but AI images and video are becoming really good, really fast — and it could become a loser to the extent people stop spending on it and use AI instead.”\n\nShares rose 1.3% on Wednesday.\n\nOn one hand, software companies focused on AI have performed well this year, including Microsoft Corp., Palantir Technologies Inc., and C3.ai Inc. However, there have also been selloffs from the likes of Salesforce Inc., Workday Inc., MongoDB Inc., and UiPath Inc., which warned about weaker enterprise IT spending, a headwind that could also impact Adobe, according to Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nAdobe’s last report featured a weak outlook, underlining concerns about competition. Consensus estimates for the company’s net full-year earnings are down 13% over the past three months, though the view for revenue has held steady.\n\nSince its mid-March report, the firm has worked to reassure investors. AI-related product announcements at its annual Summit conference were viewed positively, as was pricing information for its Acrobat AI Assistant services.\n\nWhile that has failed to reverse the stock’s drop, bulls have other positives they can point to. Thursday’s report is expected to show 20% growth in net earnings, along with nearly 10% revenue growth, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. Full-year revenue is seen growing at a double-digit pace for the next few fiscal years, while free cash flow is expected to grow 13% this year before accelerating to nearly 25% next year.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe stock trades at 24 times estimated earnings, a discount to its long-term average, and its recent weakness could mean a low bar to clear in the results. More than 75% of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, while the average price target points to upside of 30%.\n\n“There are a lot of software companies that will struggle against AI, but there are also ones that are starting to look interesting from a valuation standpoint, and where the market may come around to appreciate that they’re not as much at risk as previously thought,” said Brent Fredberg, a portfolio manager at Brandes Investment Partners.\n\n“We’re focusing on the ones with a lot of data about their customers, since AI is dramatically data-intensive, and which have the balance-sheet strength and financial wherewithal to invest in their own AI offerings.”\n\nAI has evolved so quickly that perceived winners and losers can change rapidly. Alphabet was thought to be an also-ran for a while, but now it is generally seen as a leader.\n\n“We’re still at the start of AI, so we don’t know what it will mean for software demand or efficiency, especially if some companies can offer almost every service,” said Michael Mullaney, director of global market research at Boston Partners. “Some are going to be very vulnerable, but others are going to really benefit. This feels like the calm before the storm.”\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nApple Inc. soared to a record on Tuesday, jumping 7.3% in its biggest one-day percentage gain since November 2022 as investors bet that the company’s newly unveiled AI features would spur an iPhone upgrade cycle. The rally added more than $210 billion to the company’s market capitalization, making for one of the biggest single-session increases in market value in history, according to data compiled by Bloomberg.\n\nTop Tech News\n\nOracle Corp. reported better-than-expected bookings and announced partnership deals with tech rivals, giving a boost to Chairman Larry Ellison’s effort to redefine the software maker as a major competitor in the business of cloud computing. SK Telecom Co.’s artificial-intelligence chip startup unit Sapeon Korea Inc. and rival Rebellions Inc. have agreed to combine their businesses, joining forces in a bid to compete globally and capitalize on booming demand for AI services. Spotify Technology SA will introduce a new, higher-priced premium plan for its most ardent users later this year, according to a person familiar with the plan. Users will be charged at least $5 more per month for access to better audio and new tools for creating playlists and managing their song libraries, said the person. ByteDance Ltd. is slashing about 450 jobs at its Indonesian e-commerce arm in the first round of cuts since combining its TikTok Shop with local rival Tokopedia in January. GlobalFoundries Inc. will produce a sample of startup Diraq Pty’s chip equipped with both quantum and classical processors this month, the latest attempt to make quantum computers practical in the real world.\n\nEarnings Due Wednesday\n\nPostmarket\n\nBroadcom\n\n(Updates to market open.)\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nChina’s Economic Powerhouse Is Feeling the Brunt of Its Slowdown The Rise and Fall of a $600 Million Strip-Mall Tycoon As Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Food Companies Hope You Won’t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices The World’s Most Online Male Gymnast Prepares for the Paris Olympics\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "3 Growth Stocks Primed for a June Boom",
        "content": "Most of the narrative among equity investors right now centers on growth stocks. Questions about whether interest rates will decline, how robust spending will be, and the AI boom apply to a wide range of higher-growth companies in specific industries. This dynamic hasn’t really changed over the past decade or so, but it’s also a trend that appears to be accelerating.\n\nIn June, we received plenty of data to suggest that job growth (at least in the U.S.) remains strong, and macro data is pointing to a “good news is bad news” type of setup for interest rate cuts. While the market is pricing in one to two cuts this year, it’s clear that higher for longer is indeed here to stay.\n\nIf that’s the case, investors may want to focus on companies with the most robust growth prospects that can be sustained in any environment. These are three growth stocks that fit the bill.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nShopify (SHOP) Shopify on the phone display.\n\nSource: Burdun Iliya / Shutterstock.com\n\nShopify’s (NYSW:SHOP) stock price has certainly fluctuated greatly over the past year, with the stock taking a recent hit after the company announced earnings. Despite robust growth and stable financials, many seem to view Shopify as more cyclical (which makes sense). With interest rate cuts pushed out, this is an e-commerce play many aren’t viewing as favorable right now.\n\nRevenue continues to grow, as does the company’s user count. With notable technological improvements, including the introduction of new AI features, Shopify’s growth trajectory could improve in the coming quarters. The company’s consistent growth in recent years can be tied to strong trends in the global e-commerce space, which is forecasted to grow at an 11.2% pace annually from 2023 to 2027.\n\nFor those who believe in the long-term secular growth catalysts underpinning this sector, Shopify remains a top pick to consider because of its double-digit growth rate and ability to see valuation multiple expansion if macro conditions improve.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia corporation logo displayed on smartphone with stock market chart background. Nvidia is a global leader in artificial intelligence hardware. NVDA stock\n\nSource: Evolf / Shutterstock.com\n\nSome of the most notable news around semiconductor giant Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is that it just surpassedApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in market capitalization, surging above the $3 trillion mark. Its share price surged to more than $1,200 per share (pre-split) driven by expectations of continued growth driven by AI investments from the company’s growing list of clients. Nvidia now trails only Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) in terms of valuation and could theoretically eclipse the software giant’s valuation if this kind of stock price appreciation continues.\n\nStory continues\n\nOf course, trees don’t grow to the sky, but Nvidia’s recent revenue and earnings growth has been off the charts. The company has provided investors with triple-digit growth on both the top- and bottom-lines, and the demand underpinning this growth appears very robust.\n\nThe company’s H100 AI processor, introduced in 2022, costs between $25,000 and $40,000 and remains in high demand. The successor, Blackwell B200, cost $10 billion to develop and is expected to be four times as powerful, priced at $30,000 to $40,000. Despite high share prices and skepticism around its valuation, Nvidia consistently outperforms expectations. The AI catalysts we’re seeing are very real for companies like Nvidia, and this is a stock investors looking to play a growth-driven rally during this cycle should be in.\n\nMeta Platforms (META) Threads app logo seen on screen. Instagram Threads app is a micro blogging platform, developed by Facebook Meta.\n\nSource: Ascannio / Shutterstock.com\n\nMeta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) is a prominent trillion-dollar mega-cap company with quite the turnaround over the past couple of years. Last year’s focus on efficiency has translated into strong fundamentals, and investors continue to see this growth continue into Q1 of 2024. Meta posted a net income that doubled year-over-year and revenue growth of 27%. Those numbers alone speak to the efficiency story the company is chasing.\n\nThe company is now increasingly focusing on monetizing messaging apps by introducing free AI chatbots on WhatsApp. Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg continues to evolve his strategy around monetization with its suite of apps, integrating AI into the company’s portfolio in a way that makes sense. Over time, I expect these moves to generate strong revenue growth and improved monetization, which could mean we’re still in the early innings of this fundamentals-led rally in META stock.\n\nThe launch of AI-driven ad targeting on WhatsApp has signaled a significant shift. This approach leverages user behavior from Facebook and Instagram for optimized message delivery. This approach is crucial for businesses paying for messages to reach receptive users. For those bullish on the long-term prospects of the social media space and Meta’s ability to continue to integrate AI and improve its monetization efforts, this is a company that looks reasonably valued relative to its growth outlook.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nChris MacDonald’s love for investing led him to pursue an MBA in Finance and take on a number of management roles in corporate finance and venture capital over the past 15 years. His experience as a financial analyst in the past, coupled with his fervor for finding undervalued growth opportunities, contribute to his conservative, long-term investing perspective.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "There is no end in sight to the stock market’s latest bull run. These S&P 500 stocks keep rising, hitting new all-time highs.\n\nAlthough we intuitively know that eventually we will see a correction, or the stocks might crash into a bear market, they are relatively short-lived events. The average bear market lasts about 16 months while bull markets are measured in years. Even better, they also tend to go on and wipe out all remnants of the losses.\n\nIt is why investors should have a long-term mindset. Understand these setbacks are a part of the investing cycle and don’t get scared into selling your S&P 500 stocks. Because no one can perfectly time entry and exit points consistently, buy-and-hold is the best investing strategy you can adopt.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nEven with the stock market’s rise there are still excellent companies to buy. Below are three of the top S&P 500 stocks for your portfolio today.\n\nBooking Holdings (BKNG) The home page of the Internet booking of hotels booking.com on the screen the Chinese Xiaomi smartphone in male hand on a computer monitor. BKNG stock.\n\nSource: Andrey Solovev / Shutterstock\n\nBooking Holdings (NASDAQ:BKNG) is the leading global online travel agent via its platforms including Booking.com, Agoda, Priceline.com and Kayak. It also offers car rentals through Rentalcars.com and restaurant reservations through OpenTable.\n\nBy having an extensive network of properties in almost every country around the world, Booking Holdings is able to attract more travelers seeking accommodations, rentals and more. Although the global pandemic crimped travel for many countries, especially those in Asia and Europe who imposed extreme travel restrictions, that is now largely a thing of the past.\n\nGlobal room nights increased 17% in 2023 from the year before and are now 24% above 2019 pre-pandemic levels. Relaxation of travel regulations has also allowed the booking window to expand, which benefited year-over-year room night growth.\n\nAlthough it was feared demand would falter as pent up pandemic”revenge travel” subsided, that has not been the case. People still want to travel and they are turning to Booking Holdings properties to find their destination.\n\nBKNG stock is up 45% over the past year and as travel demand grows, its business will expand. Booking Holdings is an S&P 500 stock to buy for the long-term.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia (NVDA) company logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) needs no introduction. As the premiere artificial intelligence (AI) stock on the market, Nvidia has led the technology boom surrounding it. There is no let up in its rapid growth pace on the horizon.\n\nThat’s because Nvidia is constantly innovating. While its H100 chip had been the gateway to AI for many businesses, demand from data scalers for more power led to Nvidia introducing the H200. That recently just gave way to the Grace Blackwell superchip that is twice as powerful as the H200.\n\nStory continues\n\nAlthough lesser companies might have been comfortable with that, Nvidia was not. Just ahead of the Computex tech conference in Taipei, CEO Jensen Huang revealed yet another new AI chip architecture, Rubin. Mind you, the Grace Blackwell chip hasn’t even shipped yet — is still in production.\n\nNvidia is accelerating its rate of innovation as competition heats up. There can be no let up in advancing the technology, because, like a shark, if it stops moving it dies. NVDA continues to move too and its shares, which just split 10-to-1, are in a seesaw battle with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most-valuable company.\n\nNVDA stock isn’t cheap, but because AI technology is still in its infancy, this is an S&P 500 stock to lock up for the long run.\n\nMcKesson (MCK) A photo of The McKesson Canada lawn sign\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock.com\n\nThere is an investment saying that goes, “What the king sells, I buy.” It refers to times when the government privatizes business making for good investment opportunities. Well, Warren Buffet is the king of investing and when he completely sold down his stake in pharmaceutical and surgical supplies distributor McKesson (NYSE:MCK) last year, I said it was time to buy.\n\nFollowing that advice would have been a good call. MCK is up almost 50% in the last 12 months compared to a 25% gain by the S&P 500. I didn’t quite understand Buffett’s decision at the time because the medical supplies distributor offered an excellent value. MCK went for just 13 times earnings estimates, a tiny fraction of its sales, and a bargain 12 times the free cash flow it produces. While it has improved substantially since then, McKesson still represents a good deal.\n\nIt is one of the country’s largest distributors and is seeing tremendous demand, especially for pharmaceuticals. That is primarily because of demand for GLP-1 drugs like Ozempic and Wegovy that are providing a significant tailwind. Revenue from the drug class surged 24% year over year.\n\nAs there is no let up for these treatments, and with numerous similar drugs coming to market, look for McKesson stock to have substantial near-term growth potential. But the medical products business has long tail potential as well, making McKesson an S&P 500 stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TW:2330) will be a \"beneficiary\" of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s plans to enhance to its artificial intelligence capabilities, according to analysts at Bank of America Securities.\n\nIn a note to clients on Tuesday, the analysts said that the world's leading contract chipmaker will see increased demand from Apple for its semiconductors, many of which are used in AI applications. Apple is TSMC's biggest client, accounting for roughly a fourth of its revenue.\n\n\"We believe the semi[conductor] demand upside from Apple can get bigger with its widening AI service, from a relatively low base. TSMC is Apple’s supplier for the A- and M-series semiconductors and is well poised to benefit from multi-year growth,\" the BofA analysts said.\n\nThey reiterated their \"Buy\" rating of TSMC's stock and lifted their estimates for the firm's 2024 to 2026 earnings by 1% to 3%.\n\nEarlier this week, Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI that will see the iPhone-maker fold ChatGPT into its products. The agreement, which was revealed at Apple's annual developers conference on Monday, comes as the tech giant looks to enhance its AI offerings following an intensifying surge in enthusiasm around the nascent technology.\n\nPrior to the event investors were speculating if Apple would roll out new generative AI features, particularly as it looks to address a growing feeling that it was lagging behind its Big Tech rivals like e-commerce group Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Google-owner Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL). Chief Executive Tim Cook lauded the new \"Apple Intelligence\" system, which aims to use AI to improve its Siri voice assistant and deliver more personalized offerings, as the company's \"next big step.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nTSMC poised to \"benefit\" from Apple's AI push - Bank of America\n\nJefferies dissects Apple's 7% surge higher\n\nPetMed Express shares slump premarket after Q4 loss widens\n\nView comments",

Thus, the sell-off may have opened a window of opportunity, and I am bullish on the stock.\n\nDoes Salesforce Have a Revenue Growth Problem?\n\nSalesforce’s recent revenue growth performance was the main reason behind the post-earnings sell-off. To understand this, we need to look at the current market environment, which is buzzing with excitement in the tech industry. The AI era has arrived, leading to substantial spending and impressive revenue beats across the board.\n\nFor instance, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) managed to beat revenue estimates by 6% in its latest quarter despite high expectations. Other tech giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NYSE:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) have also outperformed analysts’ forecasts.\n\nGiven this high-expectation environment in the tech sector, it shouldn’t come as a surprise that Salesforce missing estimates (even marginally) and providing soft guidance caused a very negative market reaction. Regarding the Q1 revenue miss, note that it marked just the second time in 20 years that Salesforce has not met the Street’s expectations, with the only previous miss happening in Q4 of 2006. This is only two revenue misses in 80 quarters.\n\nFinally, regarding the guidance, the company’s Q2 estimates point toward revenue growth between 7% and 8%. Even if Salesforce exceeds these estimates, the second quarter will still be the weakest quarter in its history in terms of revenue growth. Thus, the post-earnings sell-off wasn’t entirely unjustified.\n\nSalesforce Keeps Delivering Bottom-Line Growth\n\nDespite Salesforce’s ongoing revenue growth unwinding, investors shouldn’t overlook the progress the company has been making regarding its bottom-line growth. In recent quarters, Salesforce has managed to improve its margins considerably, resulting in strong operating and free cash flow growth, which should strengthen its investment case.\n\nSpecifically, Salesforce ended Q1 with an adjusted operating margin of 32.1%, marking a huge expansion of 450 basis points compared to last year. Therefore, despite the slowdown in revenue growth, Salesforce still managed to grow its operating cash flow by a significant 39% to $6.25 billion.\n\nStory continues\n\nNow, consider the fact that Salesforce runs on a capital-light business model. In fact, capital expenditures (CapEx) came in at a light $163 million, further declining from an already measly $243 million last year. Thus, the strong operating cash flow growth and decline in CapEx led to free cash flow surging 43% to $6.1 billion. These numbers tell a different story than the rather soft top-line growth and management’s second-quarter outlook.\n\nIs Salesforce’s Valuation Attractive?\n\nMy initial argument was that Salesforce’s post-earnings sell-off has created a window of opportunity for bullish investors. As I just mentioned, Salesforce has made noteworthy progress in terms of improving its profitability. This progress and the recent decline in its share price have likely created fertile ground for investors to take advantage of, valuation-wise.\n\nIndeed, Salesforce’s valuation appears to hover at rather reasonable levels. While most tech stocks have seen their multiples expand lately, Salesforce’s valuation seems quite more grounded. In fact, the stock is trading at some of the most attractive multiples it has seen in its history.\n\nIts forward P/E of 24.2x has never been more attractive. Even during the Great Financial Crisis of 2007-08, this multiple would still hover closer to 30x. Further, Salesforce is expected to achieve free cash flow of $11.75 billion this year, which implies a price/FCF multiple of 20x. I find this valuation multiple quite attractive as well, especially considering that Salesforce is likely to achieve further margin improvements, which aligns with the current trend.\n\nIs CRM Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nLooking at Wall Street’s view on the stock, Salesforce stock has a Moderate Buy consensus rating based on 29 Buys, 10 Holds, and one Sell assigned in the past three months. At $297.11, the average CRM stock price prediction suggests 23.3% upside potential.\n\nIf you’re unsure which analyst you should follow if you want to buy and sell CRM stock, the most profitable analyst covering the stock (on a one-year timeframe) is Keith Bachman from BMO (NYSE:BMO) Capital, with an average return of 20.32% per rating and an 82% success rate. Click on the image below to learn more.\n\nThe Takeaway\n\nWhile Salesforce’s Q1 revenue growth and Q2 outlook may have disappointed investors, the company’s substantial progress in bottom-line growth is noteworthy. If anything, the post-earnings sell-off has resulted in shares now trading at an attractive valuation. With the potential for Salesforce’s ongoing margin expansion to persist and its valuation hovering near all-time lows, the tech behemoth looks like a compelling opportunity.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Fed decision ahead, U.S. inflation data looms large - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. stock futures hovered only slightly above the flatline on Wednesday, with traders taking caution ahead of a day filled with potential market-moving events. The Federal Reserve is preparing to unveil its latest forecast for interest rates over the remainder of 2024 and beyond. However, these predictions could be influenced by the outcome of a key May inflation reading prior to the end of the central bank's latest two-day policy gathering.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures were broadly muted on Wednesday, as investors geared up for a much-anticipated Federal Reserve interest rate decision and the release of fresh inflation data out of the world's largest economy.\n\nBy 03:38 ET (07:38 GMT), the Dow futures contract had gained 30 points or 0.1%, while S&P 500 futures and Nasdaq 100 futures were mostly unchanged.\n\nThe benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both clocked record high closing levels for a second consecutive session on Tuesday, boosted in part by a jump in Apple shares (NASDAQ:AAPL). The tech giant released new artificial-intelligence enhanced features at its annual developers conference earlier this week in a bid to bolster demand for its devices.\n\nMarkets are now turning their attention to the conclusion of a two-day Fed policy meeting, which will be preceded by the publication of May's consumer price index -- a crucial gauge of price growth in the U.S. -- prior to the opening bell on Wall Street.\n\n2. Fed decision ahead\n\nFed officials are widely tipped to leave interest rates at a more than two-decade high of 5.25% to 5.5% on Wednesday, meaning the central bank's outlook for future borrowing costs will be in the spotlight.\n\nPolicymakers at the Federal Open Market Committee are due to unveil their latest \"dot plot\", a collection of predictions about the Fed's rate path during the rest of 2024 and longer-term. Fed Chair Jerome Powell is also set to make a statement.\n\nIn March, the dot plot showed that most officials were seeing two or three cuts this year. But, in recent weeks, several Fed members have indicated that they are in no rush to ratchet down rates, saying instead they would like to see more proof that inflation is sustainably easing to their stated 2% target.\n\nAccording to CME Group's (NASDAQ:CME) closely-monitored FedWatch Tool, the probability of a cut in September has slipped since one week ago, as traders reacted to a stronger-than-anticipated jobs report last Friday that raised the prospect of sticky prices.\n\n3. CPI looms large\n\nThe Labor Department's latest consumer price index, which is scheduled to be released around thirty minutes before the Fed gathering wraps up, could present a last-minute wrinkle in the central bank's policy projections.\n\nStory continues\n\nEconomists forecast that annualized headline price growth in May matched the previous month's pace, but slowed on a monthly basis. The so-called \"core\" reading, which strips out more volatile items like food and fuel, is seen decelerating slightly year-on-year and remaining in line with April's rate month-on-month.\n\nA hotter-than-expected report could lead Fed officials to moderate their predictions for rate reductions in 2024, while a soft reading may convince more of them to estimate as many as two cuts.\n\nAnalysts cited by the Wall Street Journal have suggested that a median average of at least two cuts would be needed to support hopes for a reduction by September, while a median of only one would signal that a cut would not come until even later this year.\n\n4. Chinese consumer price inflation weaker than anticipated in May\n\nChinese consumer prices grew less than expected in May as consumption remained largely languid in the face of an uncertain economic recovery.\n\nMeanwhile, producer prices shrank at a slower-than-expected pace, marking its smallest contraction since February 2023 amid signs of a possible rebound in the industrial sector.\n\nThe country's consumer price index (CPI) rose 0.3% year-on-year in May, data from the National Bureau of Statistics showed on Wednesday. The reading was weaker than expectations for a rise of 0.4% and unchanged from the prior month. Month-on-month CPI inflation shrank 0.1%.\n\nThe producer price index shrank 1.4% year-on-year in May versus projections for a drop of 1.5% and a 2.5% decline in April.\n\n5. Crude prices rise\n\nCrude prices rose Wednesday, boosted by a series of upbeat views of global demand.\n\nBy 03:33 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $78.52 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $82.41 a barrel.\n\nData from the American Petroleum Institute, released on Tuesday, showed that U.S. oil inventories shrank by more than expected last week, ramping up hopes that U.S. fuel consumption was picking up with the onset of the travel-heavy summer season.\n\nAdding to the optimism was the news that the U.S. Energy Information Administration has raised its 2024 world oil demand growth forecast to 1.10 million barrels per day from a previous estimate of 900,000 bpd.\n\nElsewhere, the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries maintained its 2024 forecast for relatively strong growth in global oil demand in its monthly report, citing expectations for travel and tourism in the second half.\n\nA monthly report from the International Energy Agency is also due later this week, while the EIA will also release its official weekly U.S. inventories report.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFed decision ahead, U.S. inflation data looms large - what's moving markets\n\nExclusive-Capital Group shakes up strategy to hit $4 trillion by 2031\n\nGermany's May inflation rises 2.8% on higher services prices\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Nvidia Stock (NASDAQ:NVDA): Cheaper after the Stock Split, Yet Priceless",
        "content": "AI prodigy Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock has risen colossally from $15 (split-adjusted) when I first wrote about it to almost $121 currently. It surpassed Apple to become the world’s second-highest-valued company. I also predicted that NVDA could go for a stock split, and it just did. The stock continues to surprise with newer highs (+144% YTD) after its spectacular earnings beat. Nonetheless, my thesis remains intact: NVDA is attractive for the long term based on its undeniable AI leadership and exponential AI growth potential.\n\nNVDA Reports Blowout Earnings Over and Over Again\n\nOn May 22, Nvidia posted yet another blowout Q1 result on May 22, driven by robust continued computing and accelerated generative AI demand momentum. Adjusted earnings of $6.12 per share handily beat the consensus estimate of $5.60 per share. Also, the figure came in much higher (+461%) than the Fiscal Q1-2024 (ended April 2023) figure of $1.09 per share.\n\nImpressively, Q1 revenue jumped 262% year-over-year to $26.04 billion, surpassing the consensus estimate of $24.59 billion. On top of that, its adjusted gross margin expanded 13.8 percentage points to an unbelievably new high at 78.4% from 64.6% a year ago.\n\nConcurrent with the earnings report, the company also announced a 10-for-1 stock split. While the stock split does not change the valuation or the performance of the company, it does mean that NVDA will now be more available to retail investors, creating short-term momentum in the share price.\n\nOn top of that, the company hiked its quarterly cash dividend by 150% to $0.01 per share on a post-split basis. NVDA shares started trading on a split-adjusted basis today. Markedly, this is Nvidia’s sixth stock split.\n\nImportantly, NVDA’s crown-jewel segment, Data Center revenues, soared 427% year-over-year to $22.6 billion. The segment makes up 86% of the firm’s total revenue. As expected, revenues declined in China due to the U.S. export control restrictions. During the earnings call, management affirmed that “business in China is substantially lower than the levels of the past.”\n\nLooking ahead, the Q2 guidance appears promising, with its revenues expected to hover around $28 billion, ahead of expectations. However, adjusted gross margins are forecast to be around 75.5% versus 77% projected for Q1 three months ago. Nonetheless, it still remains far ahead of chipmakers like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), with gross profit margins of 50.6% and 41.5%, respectively, in the past year.\n\nNVDA Continues to Innovate and Retains Its Top-Notch AI Leadership Status\n\nNvidia continues to innovate in the AI space, keeping its leadership status quo intact by innovating newer, cutting-edge AI products. NVDA’s latest GPUs & CPUs, backed by both its hardware and software capabilities, remain top-of-the-line in the AI industry. As the preferred choice in high-computing data centers worldwide, NVDA commands superior pricing power.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe scope and expansion of AI continue to grow manifold, and the demand clearly continues to outpace supply. During the earnings call, Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated, “Beyond cloud service providers, generative AI has expanded to consumer Internet companies and enterprise, Sovereign AI, automotive, and health care customers, creating multiple multibillion-dollar vertical markets.”\n\nAt the Computex conference held in Taiwan on June 2, Huang unveiled Nvidia’s latest AI architecture, Rubin, which is expected to begin shipping in 2026. This follows the launch of the Blackwell platform less than three months ago in March. Blackwell, designed for high-performance AI and scientific computing, succeeded the Hopper platform, which was optimized for AI inference and training and launched less than a year ago.\n\nBlackwell is now in full production and expected to ramp up in Q3. Meanwhile, Hopper continues to see strong demand.\n\nFurther, Huang said that NVDA will launch a new family of chips every year, compared to its initial plan of releasing new models every two years. This accelerated pace of innovation and rapid transition to newer models and chip enhancements has allowed Nvidia to retain a 70% to 95% market share (according to estimates from Mizuho Securities) in the AI chip market.\n\nHowever, competition in the AI space is heating up. Competitors like AMD (with its Ryzen AI 300) and Intel are launching newer AI chips at lower prices. Despite this, Nvidia’s first-mover advantage in AI technology keeps AMD and Intel several quarters behind NVDA.\n\nNVDA Valuation Still Isn’t Expensive, Given Its Earnings Prowess\n\nHaving overtaken Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) by market cap, many investors are hesitant to purchase NVDA stock amid its remarkable rally and concerns about overvaluation.\n\nOn the contrary, however, NVDA stock is not expensive. Currently, it’s trading at a forward P/E ratio of 44.7x (based on FY2025 earnings expectations). This is relatively cheaper than the multiples of its peer group. For instance, NVDA’s closest competitor and U.S.-based semiconductor company, AMD, is trading at a forward P/E of 47.8x, while Netherlands-based semiconductor stock ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) is trading at a forward P/E of 51x.\n\nInterestingly, its current valuation is still hovering around its five-year average of 46.6x despite the earnings, margins, and stock price having grown multifold. These are attractive price levels and likely present a reasonable buying opportunity, in my view, given the supernormal growth potential for the AI market titan Nvidia.\n\nIs NVDA Stock a Buy or Sell, According to Analysts?\n\nNVDA stands as an invincible force, a stock that garners widespread attention. With 37 Buys and three Hold ratings from analysts in the last three months, the consensus rating is unmistakably a Strong Buy. Nonetheless, the average Nvidia stock target price of $123.62 suggests that the shares will return 2.2% over the next year.\n\nConclusion: Consider NVDA Stock for Its Long-Term AI Potential\n\nNvidia has climbed to become the second most valuable stock in the world, with a market cap of $2.98 trillion, a significant leap from just under $100 billion less than five years ago. NVDA has earned its stature by leading the AI industry to unprecedented heights.\n\nDespite increasing competition, NVDA continues to enjoy a sizeable market share in the AI industry, which will continue to grow by leaps and bounds in the coming years. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels. While some critics warn of waning demand after the initial wave of AI installations, I believe this is at least several quarters away. Therefore, I will continue to buy NVDA at current levels.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL stock spiked +7% today to fresh 52-week highs after the renowned iPhone maker announced a partnership with OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into its iconic product line and services.\n\nWith that being said, investors may certainly be wondering if it's time to buy Apple’s stock with its operating system getting an innovative makeover.\n\nApple Intelligence Overview\n\nJoining the lineup of big tech companies that are accelerating and utilizing the capabilities of artificial intelligence through generative AI chatbots, Apple joins Alphabet GOOGL, Meta Platforms META, and Microsoft MSFT in this regard.\n\nSiri, Apple’s iconic voice-embedded virtual assistant will be upgraded with AI chatbot features as part of Apple Intelligence, the company’s AI platform that will be integrated into the iOS 18 which is the next-generation operating system that will power its iconic devices including the iPhone, iPad, MacBook, and smartwatch.\n\nRecent Performance & Valuation\n\nSoaring to over $200 a share on Tuesday, Apple’s stock is now in positive territory for the year and sitting on +7% gains. Although this has slightly edged the benchmark S&P 500, Apple has underperformed Alphabet, Meta Platforms, and Microsoft’s stock with the tech-centric Nasdaq up +15% for the year. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAt current levels, Apple’s 29.3X forward earnings multiple is a slight premium to the P/E valuation of Meta Platforms and Alphabet along with the benchmark’s 21.7X but is beneath Microsoft’s 36.3X. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nGrowth Trajectory\n\nBased on Zacks estimates, Apple’s total sales are now expected to be virtually flat in fiscal 2024 but are projected to rise 5% in FY25 to $405.81 billion. Notably, Apple’s top line is more robust than any of its aforementioned big tech peers with the closest being Alphabet whose total sales are expected to cross $300 billion next year.\n\nOn the bottom line, Apple’s annual earnings are projected to be up 7% this year and are forecasted to rise another 9% in FY25 to $7.21 per share. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nTakeaway\n\nWhile it’s far too soon to say Apple may be at another inflection point due to its artificial intelligence offerings, AAPL does land a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold). However, there could be better buying opportunities after the smoke clears from the recent rally atttribued to the announcement of Apple Intelligence and the collaboration with OpenAI.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Tuesday, June 11th, 2024\r\n\r\nThe markets started slow out of the gate, but largely made up for it. In fact, both the Nasdaq and the S&P 500 notched yet another all-time closing high this Tuesday — ahead of tomorrow’s all-important Inflation Rate number and the latest Fed meeting. Apparently, market participants are not quite as reliant on good news from the Fed as some may have thought. The Dow fell -120 points today, -0.31%, but the S&P gained +0.27% to 5375, the Nasdaq was up +151 points, +0.88%, to 17,343. The small-cap Russell 2000 dropped another -0.37%.\r\n\r\nApple AAPL played a role in both historic high indices. Following its presentation yesterday at the Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), in which the iPhone maker announced several upgrades incorporating A.I. services via assistance from companies like OpenAI and ChatGPT, and building out offerings from Apple like Vision Pro. Shares shot through the $200 per share threshold with ease today, closing up +7.2% on the session to roughly $207 per share.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Dow and Russell find themselves hampered. Financial companies appear to be on the wane in today’s market — likely at least partially due to a stagnant Fed, as we’ll see tomorrow afternoon when interest rates stay put at 5.25-5.50% — and companies like JPMorgan JPM and Goldman Sachs GS on the Dow and a plethora of regional banks on the small-cap Russell find themselves affected. Financials as a sector today slipped -1%.\r\n\r\nOracle ORCL saw an end to its six-quarter positive earnings surprise streak. Reporting fiscal Q4 results after today’s close saw earnings of $1.63 per share missing the Zacks consensus by a penny or revenues of $14.29 billion, which missed the $14.55 billion anticipated. Yet, much like Apple, Oracle rolled out two major partnerships in A.I.: Alphabet’s GOOGL Google multi-cloud partnership for app migration and another OpenAI deal, utilizing Oracle cloud infrastructure. Shares traded up +5% on the news, despite to the top and bottom-line misses.\r\n\r\nTomorrow’s Consumer Price Index (CPI) report for May will play a part in Wednesday’s market trajectories. Month-over-month headline CPI is expected to come down to +0.1% from +0.3% a month ago. Year over year headline CPI, aka the Inflation Rate, is expected to remain steady at +3.4%. Core CPI on a month-over-month basis, stripping out volatile food and energy prices, is currently projected in-line with April at +0.3%, year over year to come down 10 bps to +3.5%.\r\n\r\nQuestions or comments about this article and/or author?

        "content": "By Max A. Cherney\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - On stage on Monday CEO Tim Cook's Apple announced a splashy deal with OpenAI to include its powerful artificial intelligence model as a part of its voice assistant, Siri.\n\nBut in the fine print of a technical document Apple published after the event, the company makes clear that Alphabet's Google has emerged as another winner in the Cupertino, California, company's quest to catch up in AI.\n\nTo build Apple's foundation AI models, the company's engineers used its own framework software with a range of hardware, specifically its own on-premise graphics processing units (GPUs) and chips available only on Google's cloud called tensor processing units (TPUs).\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nGoogle has been building TPUs for roughly 10 years, and has publicly discussed two flavors of its fifth-generation chips that can be used for AI training; the performance version of the fifth generation offers performance competitive with Nvidia H100 AI chips, Google said.\n\nGoogle announced at its annual developer conference that a sixth generation will launch this year.\n\nThe processors are designed specifically to run AI applications and train models, and Google has built cloud computing hardware and software platform around them.\n\nApple and Google did not immediately return requests for comment.\n\nApple did not discuss the extent to which it relied on Google's chips and software compared with hardware from Nvidia or other AI vendors.\n\nBut using Google's chips typically requires a client to purchase access to them through its cloud division, much in the same way customers buy computing time from Amazon.com's AWS or Microsoft's Azure.\n\n(Reporting by Max A.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures steadied in evening deals on Tuesday after an artificial intelligence-fueled rally put Wall Street at new highs, with focus turning to the Federal Reserve and upcoming inflation data.\n\nHype over AI remained a key point of support for markets after Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) announced a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI to roll out AI features. This optimism also spilled over into aftermarket trade after Oracle Corporation (NYSE:ORCL) announced partnerships with Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT), OpenAI and Alphabet Inc's Class A (NASDAQ:GOOGL) Google for more cloud capacity to power AI.\n\nStill, broader gains were held back by anticipation of more cues on U.S. interest rates later on Wednesday.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,386.50 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 19,265.75 points. Dow Jones Futures steadied at 38,788.0 points by 19:14 ET (23:14 GMT).\n\nFed meeting, CPI data due on Wednesday\n\nMarket focus was squarely on the conclusion of a two-day Fed meeting on Wednesday, where the central bank is widely expected to keep interest rates steady.\n\nBut markets were somewhat optimistic about the Fed flagging potential rate cuts, especially after its peers, particularly the European Central Bank, began trimming rates earlier in June.\n\nStill, general consensus is that the Fed will only begin cutting rates by September, as the U.S. labor market remains strong and inflation expectations buoyant.\n\nBefore the rate decision, consumer price index data for May is expected to offer more cues on inflation.\n\nThe reading is also due on Wednesday, and is expected to show inflation remained sticky in May, and well above the Fed’s 2% annual target range.\n\nSticky inflation diminishes the chances of rate cuts by the Fed, while the prospect of high for longer U.S. rates presents a constrained outlook for stock markets.\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq at record highs on AI hype\n\nThe S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite finished at record highs on Tuesday, driven chiefly by technology stocks amid persistent hype over AI. Apple Inc rallied over 7% to a record high after announcing its new AI features, while Microsoft and Alphabet added about 1% each.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 0.3% to end at 5,375.32 points on Tuesday, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.9% to 17,343.84 points. But the more economically sensitive Dow Jones Industrial Average continued to lag its peers, falling 0.3% to 38,747.42 points.\n\nGains in most tech stocks did not extend into aftermarket trade.\n\nBut Oracle surged nearly 9% after the bell on its new AI partnerships, which largely overshadowed disappointing quarterly earnings from the company.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS stock futures steady after AI rally; Fed rate decision, CPI on tap\n\nTesla shareholder sues Musk to return billions in alleged unlawful profits\n\nMediaTek designs Arm-based chip for Microsoft's AI laptops, say sources\n\nView comments",

        "content": "We recently published a list of Top Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. Since Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in the list, it deserves a deeper look.\n\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones recently made headlines  after he participated in the Robin Hood foundation’s fundraising event dressed as Neo from the movie “The Matrix.” The event raised $68.5 million. The billionaire, who founded Tudor Investment Corporation in 1980, couldn’t help himself but talk about investing during the event, and highlighted the importance of “Warren Buffett-style compounding.”\n\n“Somewhere, somehow the multiplicative power of compound put you in this seat,” Tudor Jones said.\n\nPaul Tudor Jones’ Recession Prediction\n\nDuring an interview last year, the billionaire had predicted that a recession was expected to start in the first quarter of 2024. He said at the time that the US was in its “weakest position” since World War II. However, the market rally fueled by AI proved the prediction wrong. Earlier this year,  Jones said in another interview that the financial markets represent people’s ideas and what they make of the economic situation. Paul Tudor Jones said that there’s a chance the stock market would be “here or lower” in the next five to ten years. However, the billionaire also said it’s possible that the markets would go higher from here if the next President of the US devises a better “policy response” next year.\n\nREAD NEXT: Billionaire Cooperman’s Top Dividend Picks and Analysts Are Upgrading These AI Stocks\n\nHe’s been vocal about AI lately and sharing his thoughts about the impact of technology on our society. He thinks AI could be the “knight on the horse that rides and saves us.”\n\nBut AI-related threats worry Paul Tudor Jones.  In an interview in January he referred to a survey where close to 3,000 AI experts were asked whether they believe AI would end humanity. According to Jones, a whopping 58% of the experts said yes. The billionaire said US policymakers will have to decide how to tackle this problem. Jones believes AI is growing at an “unbridled pace” since there’s so much money to be made in the domain but the biggest problem for policymakers would be to balance the benefits and threats of AI to make it sustainable.\n\nFor this article we scanned billionaire Paul Tudor Jones’ Q1 portfolio and chose his top dividend stock picks. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nStory continues Is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) the Top Dividend Stock to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones?\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nBillionaire Paul Tudor Jones Q1’2024 Stake: $57,187,894\n\nDespite having a low dividend yield, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a notable dividend stock thanks to almost a decade of dividend growth and strong share upside potential amid AI-related catalysts. Bank of America recently said in a note Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) plans to overhaul its Siri assistant with new AI-powered features could infuse a new iPhone upgrade cycle. BofA’s Wamsi Mohan expects conversational AI to become more popular and give a boost to AI-powered phones. He has a Buy rating and $230 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes “owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return” because the market is in denial about Apple Inc.’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI potential. Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of this could change if Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is able to pull AI-related catalysts out of its bag. The WWDC event and the new few weeks and months would be critical for Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth trajectory.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 3rd in Insider Monkey’s list of Top Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones.You can visit Top Dividend Stocks to Buy in 2024 According to Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones to see other stock picks of Billionaire Paul Tudor Jones. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

Nvidia, the largest benefactor of a boom in AI applications and number three in terms of market value, is at $2.93 trillion.\n\nAt its annual developer event that kicked off on Monday, Apple unveiled an improved Siri virtual assistant that can answer a wider range of queries and accomplish more complicated tasks than earlier, and several AI features across its apps that will be shipped with the latest operating systems for iPhones, iPads and Mac computers.\n\nAt least 13 analysts raised their price targets on Apple's shares after the developer event, and said the latest features could encourage a cascade of new purchases as the company prepares to announce a new line of iPhones in autumn.\n\n\"Apple is demonstrating that it is invested in evolving its platform and devices to enable the next era of computing, interfaces and experiences,\" Gartner analyst Tuong Nguyen said.\n\nApple's shares closed 1.9% lower on Monday but were up 6% year-to-date, while the S&P 500 rose 12% in the same period.\n\n(Reporting by Yuvraj Malik and Shubham Batra in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)\n\nView comments",

        "content": "NEW YORK (AP) — Apple Inc. plans to add several new features to Apple Pay and Apple Wallet later this year that will more deeply integrate financing, rewards, and buy now, pay later options into the iPhone.\n\nThe new features are part of Apple's annual iOS update that will arrive in the fall, the company said. Apple revealed some of the features at its annual developer conference this week and released more details Tuesday.\n\nThe biggest change for consumers will be ability for banks to offer multiple forms of financing to customers within Apple Pay, as well as the ability pay with rewards points or programs through an iPhone or other Apple device. iPhone users currently can use credit or debit cards to fund Apple Pay purchases.\n\nApple will now give banks the ability to offer other forms of financing through the same credit cards, like buy now, pay later, monthly installment plans, or the use of reward points.\n\nBuy now, pay later company Affirm will be integrated into Apple Pay, allowing customers to apply for an account with Affirm inside of Apple Pay. Shares of Affirm rose nearly 5% Tuesday on the news. Apple said that its own buy now, pay later service, known as Apple Pay Later, is not going anywhere and the other major buy now, pay later companies like Klarna will also be able to integrate into Apple Wallet.\n\nApple Pay has become a significant force in mobile and digital payments since it was rolled out nearly a decade ago, along with Apple Wallet. Nearly all banks and credit card companies have integrated their credit and debit cards with Apple Pay, mobile concert tickets are standard issue, and a handful of states are experimenting with issuing digital drivers' licenses.\n\nA limiting factor for Apple Pay has been that it was only on iOS devices, whichonly represents roughly a third of the smartphone market. But Apple said it will allow the use of Apple Pay on Windows computers and Google's Chrome browser later this year. Those customers will be able to scan a code and approve an Apple Pay transaction on their phone.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) stock on Tuesday surged more than 5% to reach an intraday record as investors digested the announcement of its AI platform, Apple Intelligence.\n\nAfter the stock fell on Monday during and after the company's WWDC conference, the stock moved higher as some Wall Street analysts cheered the company's announcements.\n\n\"If you look at the signal away from the noise, you realize that this is unprecedented capability that Apple is going to introduce and it's going to integrate AI into everyday life,\" D.A. Davidson managing director Gil Luria told Yahoo Finance (video above).\n\nFollowing Monday's event, Luria upgraded Apple to buy from Neutral and raised his price target to $230 from $200.\n\nOn Monday, Apple announced \"Apple Intelligence,\" its long-awaited foray into the generative AI space. The company said the platform would be integrated across the company's hardware and software products ranging from the iPhone and Mac to mail, messages, and photos. Apple Intelligence will be available for the iPhone 15 Pro and iPads and Macs running Apple's M1 series chips and newer later this fall.\n\nKey features of the launch include updates to Siri, which will now be able to, for instance, parse phones for addresses sent in messages or find photos in a phone's photo library based on voice prompts. Apple also launched new software updates for its iPhone, watches, and computer products.\n\nThe announcements capped off a month of excitement around the stock as rumors around some of the news, including a partnership with ChatGPT operator OpenAI, had already been percolating.\n\nAfter briefly being passed by Nvidia (NVDA), the stock of the iPhone maker is now back as the second most valuable company (behind Microsoft (MSFT) in the world with a market capitalization of more than $3.1 trillion.

(Photo by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images) (Justin Sullivan via Getty Images)\n\nFollowing a slow start to the year amid concerns of slowing iPhone demand, Apple stock is now up more than 15% in the past two months.\n\nImportantly, Luria noted he believes these AI integrations could start the next upgrade cycle for iPhone as the new features will only be available for iPhone 15 Pro or newer.\n\n\"As people buy new phones this holiday season, they're going to see this great functionality,\" Luria said. \"They're going to show their friends and family and the product upgrade cycle will happen over the next few months and quarters.\"\n\nThis, Luria argued, should be a key catalyst for the stock moving forward.\n\n\"The stock's been flat because there hasn't been revenue growth at Apple,\" Luria said. \"Now, we think that this will allow Apple's overall growth to accelerate from the low single digits into the mid-, maybe even high-single digits over the next year or two. That's what can drive Apple's stock.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Apple announced a slew of new features for iOS 18 at Monday's developers conference event, many of which are designed to enhance the Siri assistant and bring artificial intelligence tools to iPhone users.\n\nThe AI-packed updates coming in the fall are meant to enable the billions of people who use the company’s devices to get more done in less time, while also giving them access to creative tools that could liven things up. For instance, Apple will deploy AI to allow people to create emojis, dubbed “Genmojis” on the fly to fit the vibe they are trying to convey.\n\nThe full suite of upcoming AI features will only work on the recent iPhone 15 line because the functions require advanced processors. But there are still plenty of upgrades for all iPhone owners.\n\nHere are some of the best new features coming to iOS 18 and Apple Intelligence.\n\nScheduled texts, tap backs and RCS\n\nApple confirmed that it will be rolling out a technology called Rich Communications Service, or RCS, to its iMessage app. The technology should improve the quality and security of texting between iPhones and devices powered by Android software, such as the Samsung Galaxy and Google Pixel.\n\nIn another upcoming change to the iPhone’s messaging app, users will be able to write a text (or have an AI tool compose it) in advance and schedule a specific time to automatically send it.\n\nAnd Apple is introducing a series of animated tap backs to allow users to instantly reply with any emoji or sticker, giving its app abilities similar to other messaging platforms like Google Chat or WhatsApp.\n\nAI tools and data privacy\n\nApple's new AI platform, dubbed \"Apple Intelligence,\" will use Siri to help carry out actions between apps and boost the assistant's range of capabilities. AI can also help manage and prioritize notifications, and summarize text in searches, email and other apps. There will be functions that can help you write text and change the tone of it as well, similar to other popular gen AI platforms.\n\nBut the tech firm is trying hard to convince consumers that the iPhone won’t be used to spy on them. Apple is harnessing its chip technology so most of its AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of at remote data centers, often called “the cloud,” thus keeping users data local.\n\nWhen Apple users make AI demands that requiring computing power beyond what’s available on the device, the tasks will be handled by what the company is calling a “private cloud” that is supposed to shield their personal data.\n\nMore screen customization and control center options\n\nStory continues\n\niPhone users will have more options to arrange apps, resize icons and widgets on the home screen when iOS 18 arrives. A new dark mode look and tinting effect will also be available for further customization.\n\nThe control center has also been redesigned to give users access to more one tap functions, and the ability to add some third-party app options — such as remote starting your car — to it.\n\nCollecting your passwords\n\nAll of Apple's platforms — iPhone, iPad, Mac and Vision Pro — are getting a new dedicated Passwords app.\n\nThe new app lets you access all of your passwords in one place, including Wi-Fi passwords, and allow you to access some authentication tools. Apple also claims the app will alert you when certain passwords are compromised.\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple looks to make AI more personal",
        "content": "Apple (AAPL) took the leap into generative AI, debuting its Apple Intelligence platform at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference on Monday. It’s a massive shift for the company, bringing a host of new features to its various operating systems and products.\n\nApple certainly isn’t the first company to debut generative AI capabilities for its software or devices. Microsoft (MSFT) and Google (GOOG, GOOGL) both debuted their own AI chatbots and services in 2023 and updated them with new capabilities during their respective developer conferences earlier this year. But Apple is unique in how it’s positioning its AI service. Samsung also has its own Galaxy AI services, which use the company's own AI models as well as Google Gemini models.\n\nRather than introducing a digital know-it-all, however, Apple, is presenting Apple Intelligence as a personalized AI platform designed to understand your data and provide it to you when you need it most. It’s a subtle distinction but one that acts as a key differentiator for Apple as it seeks to prove that its approach is the one consumers will find most useful. Apple is bringing generative AI capabilities to Siri, elevating the voice assistant to a more prominent role across its operating systems. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\n“When we think about what it means for intelligence to be really useful, it has to be centered on you,” said Apple’s senior vice president of software engineering, Craig Federighi. “We think AI's role is not to replace our users but to empower them. … It needs to be integrated into the experience you're using all the time. It needs to be intuitive, but it also needs to be informed by your personal context, really, knowledge of you.”\n\nApple is creating a personal kind of AI experience in a number of ways, including a new and improved version of Siri that is contextually aware of your data. For instance, imagine you have to pick your mother up from the airport but don't know what time she gets in.\n\nYou'll be able to ask Siri when your mom’s flight is landing, and the assistant will find the appropriate messages your mother sent you about her flight via email or text, then check real-time flight data to give you the exact time her flight lands.\n\nSiri will also be able to understand the content on your screen. Say your friend sends you an address followed by a series of unrelated texts. You can tell Siri, “Save this address to their Contact Card,” and Siri will recognize that you want to save that particular address to your friend’s Contact Card without having to say your friend’s name over again.\n\nSiri isn’t the only place you’ll find Apple Intelligence. Apple says it’s using the technology to help prioritize notifications, putting priority messages and app alerts at the top of your notifications stack and even summarizing long threads to help you catch up without having to scroll through endless messages.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Google and Samsung, Apple has also added generative AI-powered photo editing features and the ability to summarize and rewrite text in Mail and other apps.\n\nBut generative AI raises privacy concerns since data is regularly shared back and forth with the web. And it could be especially problematic for Apple to intertwine so much of your personal data with generative AI apps. To that end, Apple says it is using a number of on-device AI models that don’t share your data with cloud-based services. Apple Intelligence will stack the most important notifications above less time-sensitive messages. (Image: Apple) (Apple)\n\nFor requests that are too complex for on-device models, Apple says it will connect to its own specialized cloud services it calls Private Cloud Compute that run on Apple’s own servers powered by its own chips, which the company says ensures requests remain secure. What’s more, the company says that when users make requests, only a small amount of necessary data goes up to the cloud.\n\nApple further points out that its servers have no storage options for user data, so it won’t save any of the information it uses in your requests. The software powering Private Cloud Compute is also publicized so that it can be audited by security researchers.\n\nBasically, the company wants users to know that while some AI prompts will use cloud-based AI models, your user data won’t end up being used to train future Apple models or live on Apple’s servers in perpetuity.\n\nApple isn’t only using its own AI models. It has also partnered with OpenAI to bring ChatGPT to the company’s devices. But Apple says you’ll be asked whether you want to use the service every time you try to access it before anything is sent to the OpenAI’s servers. The company says it’s also working to integrate other AI models including Google’s Gemini.\n\nApple Intelligence will be available on the iPhone 15 Pro and Macs and iPads running its M1 chip and newer later this fall. And if the company is successful in its effort to make generative AI truly useful for the average user, it could set Apple up as one of the industry leaders in the still-nascent space.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. shares hit their first intraday record since December on Tuesday, as investor sentiment around the iPhone maker continues to improve.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nMusk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Apple’s ‘AI for the Rest of Us’ Plan Gets Lukewarm Reaction NYC Landlord to Sell Office Building at Roughly 67% Discount Russia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine\n\nShares rose as much as 3.5% to $199.87. The stock has risen more than 20% off an April low, a rally that has added more than $500 billion to its market capitalization and returned it above a $3 trillion market cap.\n\nThe record came in the wake of the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, where it showcased a number of features related to artificial intelligence and announced a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI. The event crystallized a strategy many investors felt had been missing from Apple amid AI-fueled rallies elsewhere within Big Tech.\n\nApple’s AI event fueled hopes that customers will pay up for the next generation of iPhones, and D.A. Davidson upgraded the stock to buy from neutral on this thesis.\n\nThe AI functions “could lead to a much-needed iPhone upgrade cycle,” wrote analyst Gil Luria. “Apple has not only the consumer’s information, but also their trust, it can deliver the above deeply integrated functionality in a way that standalone chat applications, PCs, and Android devices may not be able to fully replicate.”\n\nSuch a cycle would represent the kind of growth catalyst investors have been longing for.\n\nConcerns about the company’s growth were eased by a positive quarterly report in early May, when Apple also announced the largest stock buyback program in US history at $110 billion.\n\nThat report has also supported the stock in recent weeks — May was the best month for Apple shares since July 2022 — but despite the record share price, Apple is only up 3.7% this year. It lags behind the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 13% gain, while stocks with more concrete AI exposure — including Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. — have all posted double-digit gains. AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia Corp. has soared 146%, briefly overtaking Apple in size.\n\nAmong the so-called Magnificent Seven, only Tesla Inc. has done worse than Apple this year. The electric-vehicle maker has dropped more than 30% this year.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Food Companies Hope You Won’t Notice Shortages Are Raising Prices Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?\n\n©2024 Bloomberg L.P.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "In the current dynamic economic environment, investors are looking for opportunities that will not only stick but also have the potential to make great leaps and bounds. Only with an understanding of the financial health, strategic resource management, and innovative position created in the marketplace can careful identification of such opportunities be made.\n\nWe spotlight seven stocks to buy that have epitomized such traits over the years. These firms must have good financials, use capital efficiently, and strategically move ahead with technology. They reflect how calculated moves, effective resource management, and innovative solutions spur business success.\n\nAll these stocks became unique market leaders, with record-breaking net income growth and strategic investments in technology and innovation. This shows what can be done by balancing profitability with sales growth and the power of entering new markets with groundbreaking solutions.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese successes are a story of adaptability and resilience, making these seven stocks the perfect choice for investors to make money with future market leaders. That’s why there are seven stealthy stocks to buy and set up to take over the market.\n\nBTCS (BTCS) An image of the blockchain, distributing digital crypto from a phone through the web to another tablet\n\nSource: elenabsl/Shutterstock\n\nBTCS (NASDAQ:BTCS) is a blockchain tech company focusing on cryptocurrency and blockchain ecosystems. In the first quarter of 2024, the company delivered a record net income, exhibiting remarkable profitability and financial success. There was a massive 148% year-over-year (YOY) growth and a 13% quarterly gain, demonstrating the company’s fundamental capacity to improve its bottom line continuously.\n\nMoreover, this substantial increase in net income results from BTCS’s effective capital allocation, revenue optimization tactics, and generally favorable market circumstances. Thus, with such remarkable profit growth, BTCS attracts potential partners and investors as a profitable investment option.\n\nFurther, the solid rise in BTCS’s cash and cryptocurrency worth indicates the company’s sound financial standing and liquidity. The 91% YOY increase shows significant asset accumulation that may be used for research projects, strategic investments, and possible acquisitions.\n\nOverall, BTCS’s strong cash and cryptocurrency reserves allow it to adapt to market swings, take advantage of expansion possibilities, and weather unanticipated difficulties. Hence, these fundamentals make the company an ideal addition to the stocks to buy list.\n\nStory continues\n\nCelestica (CLS)\n\nSource: sdecoret / Shutterstock.com\n\nCelestica (NYSE:CLS) provides design, manufacturing, hardware platform, and supply chain solutions. In Q1 2024, it was $0.86, a solid boost from $0.47 in Q1 2023. Compared to 17.9% in Q1 2023, the adjusted ROIC for Q1 2024 was 24.8%, a significant improvement. Celestica can produce increased profits per share and efficiently use its capital to create returns, reflected in the solid growth in adjusted EPS and ROIC. Indeed, this financial stability supports the company’s growth trajectory.\n\nAdditionally, adjusted free cash flow for Celestica increased significantly from $9.2 million in Q1 2023 to $65.2 million in Q1 2024. With $900 million in cash and borrowing capacity, the company was able to retain a solid lead (in terms of liquidity). Celestica can make strategic investments, initiate acquisitions, and operational expansions. Indeed, this is because of its strong cash flow generation and liquidity position.\n\nOverall, generating substantial free cash flow indicates efficient operations and skillful working capital management, cementing its place on the stocks to buy list.\n\nBeamr (BMR) an image of a cloud imprinted on a circuit board lit up by blue circuit lights. AVCT stock. cloud computing stocks\n\nSource: Blackboard / Shutterstock\n\nBeamr (NASDAQ:BMR) is competitive in the video optimization business because of its sharp focus on technological innovation and distinction. In February 2024, the debut of the Beamr Cloud SaaS service marked an important turning point. This service will make large-scale, high-quality video processing affordable.\n\nAdditionally, the system provides advanced features, including faster adoption of new standards and upgrading video standards (from AVC to HEVC). The firm may have an edge after it includes visual AI processes into Beamr Cloud in Q2 2024. This indicates that it is adaptable to market demands and can use cutting-edge technology to improve its products.\n\nMoreover, Beamr’s 2023 performance marks enhanced financial stability and liquidity. Even though the company lost$0.7 million on the net, this was still a major improvement over its $1.2 million loss in 2022. Overall, Beamr’s efforts to improve cost efficiency and streamline operations have decreased net loss, making it a compelling addition to the stocks to buy list.\n\nZenvia (ZENV) A man examines a digital screen with different icons for software.\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nThe success that Zenvia (NASDAQ:ZENV) has had in its software-as-a-service (SaaS) and communications platform-as-a-service (CPaaS) divisions marks the increasing acceptance of the company’s product and market penetration. Strong recovery and growth were seen in the CPaaS market, fueled by increased SMS volumes among major organizations. SaaS and CPaaS’s many income sources offer a balanced growth engine that lessens reliance on a particular market niche and demonstrates resilience and adaptability to changing market needs.\n\nFurther, SaaS Active users climbed from 6,231 to 7,127, a 14.4% increase. CPaaS active clients dropped from 7,505 to 6,263 (16.5%). The increase in annual recurring revenue (ARR) and SaaS active customers suggests this market is expanding strongly, especially among small and medium businesses. A strategy change towards higher-value interactions with larger organizations is reflected in the drop in CPaaS active clients. This might lead to fewer but more substantial customer partnerships.\n\nOverall, expansion in ARR, market penetration, and customer base more than offsets any potential churn or downselling in bigger customers, as indicated by the decline in the Net Revenue Expansion rate. Therefore, these fundamental developments place the company under stocks to buy class.\n\nRingCentral (RNG) The RingCentral (RNG) mobile app is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: OpturaDesign/Shutterstock.com\n\nRingCentral (NYSE:RNG) provides businesses with cloud-based communications and collaboration solutions. In Q1 the company’s stock-based compensation fell 15.6% of total sales, a 340 basis point YOY decline.\n\nAdditionally, RingCentral maintained its strict policy on stock issues, anticipating that fresh grants in 2024 would be around half of those in 2023. The reduction in share-based compensation (SBC) exemplifies RingCentral’s attempts to match executive remuneration with business success and shareholder interests. Further, the firm hopes to increase profitability and support expansion efforts more effectively by reducing SBC expenditures.\n\nMoreover, RingCentral maintained its alliances with over 15,000 channel partners, important original equipment manufacturer partners like Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) AWS, and international service providers. The firm announced a new agreement with Optus, the second-largest telecommunications operator in Australia, expanding its partnership network.\n\nHence, by leveraging partnerships, the business can expand its audience, increase brand awareness, and capitalize on synergies to drive sales growth, securing its place on the stocks to buy list.\n\nJamf (JAMF) An Apple MacBook Air laptop sitting under bright purple lights.\n\nSource: WeDesing / Shutterstock.com\n\nJamf (NASDAQ:JAMF) specializes in device management of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) devices. It provides device deployment, security, and management solutions for enterprises, schools, and other organizations.\n\nSecurity is a priority for the company, as seen by the 31% YOY rise in security ARR to $138 million, or 23% of total ARR. This expansion highlights the rising need for reliable security solutions. Jamf focuses on meeting changing client demands and regulatory standards, which is reflected in the launch of new compliance-focused capabilities, such as tools for compliance editors and configurable compliance dashboards.\n\nFurthermore, Jamf’s sharp focus on creativity and flexibility reflects its support for cutting-edge technologies like watchOS management and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro. Expanding its product offerings beyond standard device management to include identity management, security, and compliance solutions increases Jamf’s competitiveness and market relevance. Thus, gaining contracts with Middle Eastern and Indian government organizations demonstrates Jamf’s success in expanding internationally and its capacity to meet various customer demands.\n\nLightspeed (LSPD) The Lightspeed Commerce logo on a smartphone representing LSPD stock.\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nLightspeed (NYSE:LSPD)offers cloud-based point of sale (POS) and e-commerce software solutions for retail, restaurant, and hospitality businesses. Examples of the company’s focus on enabling current clients to expand include Tribal Sportswear, Analogue October Records, and Mildreds. The net retention rate shows strong client retention and growth within the current customer base, around 110%. Lightspeed is still investing in new product development, using AI to automate processes and give merchants useful information.\n\nAdditionally, subscription revenue gross margins increased to 77% due to initiatives to streamline cloud suppliers and boost general productivity. The business undertook cost-cutting measures. These include a 10% decrease in personnel and carefully examining vendor contracts and worldwide facilities. Analysts predict adjusted operating expenses will increase in the low-to-mid single-digit range in fiscal 2025. With that, there is a focus on cost containment and investments in research, product innovation, and sales.\n\nOverall, adjusted EBITDA margins are anticipated to increase significantly in fiscal 2025 and 2026, demonstrating a sharp focus on profitability and solidifying its position on the stocks to buy list.\n\nOn the date of publication, Yiannis Zourmpanos did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Following Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s WWDC event, analysts at RBC Capital, Morgan Stanley, and Evercore ISI provided their thoughts on what the iPhone maker's announcements could mean for Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL)'s AI position.\n\nRBC sees Apple's AI product announcements as mixed or slightly negative for GOOGL. The bank did note one positive, with Apple saying it intends to add support for other AI models (besides ChatGPT) in the future and specifically mentioned Google's Gemini as a likely example.\n\nHowever, on the negative side, RBC highlighted the confirmation from Apple that OpenAI's ChatGPT will be Apple's first GenAI partner with ChatGPT integrated into Siri as well as a few of Apple's other productivity apps around content creation.\n\n\"Bears will argue that Apple is diversifying away from GOOGL with tight integration of competing tools signaling fewer hand-offs to Google in the future,\" they add.\n\nMeanwhile, Morgan Stanley said the current iOS GenAI use cases don't appear to be Google Search disintermediation threats.\n\n\"In our view, the use cases presented by AAPL do not appear to present a disintermediation threat to broad-based internet Search (i.e.GOOGL Search) or commercial query search,\" said Morgan Stanley. \"For now, we see the new Siri and Apple Intelligence products as a native AAPL assistant with still limited capabilities.\"\n\nFurthermore, the bank continues to believe AAPL is more likely than not going to leverage GOOGL and Gemini, given the aforementioned dynamics, noting that AAPL said it intends to add support for other AI models (other than OpenAI) in the future. \"In our view, a confirmation of an AAPL/Gemini partnership is likely to be positive for GOOGL shareholders as it would confirm GOOGL's position in AAPL's stack of GenAI tools,\" they added.\n\nOppenheimer surveyed consumers' adoption and usage of Gen AI Search with a 1,000-respondent U.S. survey, leading up to Apple's WWDC event.\n\nThey came away from the survey more constructive on Google's competitive position in both Core Search and Gen AI Search, as it suggests \"Google's market share remains very strong even among Gen Zers.\"\n\n\"Despite the rise of Social Media searches, we see very consistent leadership for Google Search across all demographics,\" said Evercore. \"Further, our survey suggests Gen AI is driving higher overall search volume, and Google's AI products are leading to more effective searches and higher user satisfaction – which would likely translate into better ROAS for Advertisers and more Search Revenue for Google.\"\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nGoogle stock: Analysts weigh in on Alphabet's AI position after Apple WWDC event\n\nLufthansa unlikely to offer more concessions in ITA bid, sources say\n\nAnalysis-Apple's AI push could reinvigorate iPhone sales as customers look to upgrade\n\nView comments",

Both ETFs share a similar focus on high-quality dividend growth stocks and have performed well over the years.\n\nI am bullish on both ETFs, but in this article, we will compare DGRO and DGRW to determine which could be the better choice for investors.\n\nWhat Is the DGRO ETF’s Strategy?\n\nAccording to iShares, DGRO invests in “an index composed of U.S. equities with a history of consistently growing dividends.”\n\niShares also touts the fact that DRGO “offers low-cost exposure to U.S. stocks focused on dividend growth” and says that DGRO enables investors to “access companies that have a history of sustained dividend growth and that are broadly diversified across industries.”\n\nThe fund launched in 2014 and has $27 billion in assets under management (AUM).\n\nThe Allure of Dividend Growth Investing\n\nDividend growth stocks may not feature the highest yields, but they grow their dividend payouts and are projected to do so in the future, which is a strong indicator of financial health.\n\nDividend growth stocks often offer a potentially attractive combination of returns from capital appreciation and dividend payouts. While their payouts may be lower than those of some high-yield dividend stocks, they often offer more growth potential than these high-yielding stocks, which may feature little in the way of growth or potential price appreciation.\n\nTo get a better understanding of why this strategy can be appealing, let’s take a look at a stock like Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), which both funds hold, as we’ll discuss below.\n\nWhile Broadcom only yields 1.4%, the company has increased its payout for 13 years in a row. The stock has returned an incredible 2,441% over the past 10 years on a total return basis, including capital appreciation and the reinvestment of the dividends it paid. While the yield may not be high, few investors would turn down that type of return.\n\nWhat Is the DGRW ETF’s Strategy?\n\nDGRW has a similar focus. WisdomTree says that it invests in an index of “dividend-paying large-cap companies with growth characteristics in the U.S. equity market.”\n\nDGRW predates DGRO, having debuted in 2013, and is smaller, with $12.8 billion in AUM, but it is still a major dividend ETF.\n\nIt gives investors “access to the current investment landscape of U.S. large-cap dividend growing companies by applying quality and growth screens.”\n\nStory continues\n\nHead-to-Head Performance\n\nThese are both good ETFs that have posted solid returns for investors over time. As of the end of May, DGRO has produced a three-year annualized return of 8.9% and an annualized return of 12.3% over five years.\n\nFor comparison, DGRW has produced an annualized return of 10.65% over the past three years and an annualized return of 15.47% over the past five.\n\nComparing the Portfolios\n\nDGRO offers investors great diversification, with positions in 419 different stocks. Furthermore, its top 10 holdings make up just 26.7% of assets, so it isn’t exposing investors to much concentration risk.\n\nBelow, you’ll find an overview of DGRO’s top 10 holdings using TipRanks’ holdings tool.\n\nDGRO owns a mix of large-cap growth stocks like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) that pay dividends, coupled with more traditional dividend stocks like energy giants ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM) and Chevron (NYSE:CVX).\n\nDGRW is also well-diversified, although a bit less so than DGRO, and a bit more concentrated. DGRW owns 299 stocks, and its top 10 holdings account for 37.3% of the fund.\n\nYou can check out an overview of DGRW’s top 10 holdings below.\n\nLike DGRO, DGRW owns a mix of large-cap growth stocks like Microsoft, Apple, Broadcom, and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) that pay dividends. These are mixed with more traditional longtime dividend stalwarts like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Procter & Gamble (NYSE:PG), and Pepsi (NASDAQ:PEP).\n\nThe top holdings of both funds have a similar style in this regard, and there is plenty of overlap. In fact, Apple, Microsoft, Broadcom, Johnson & Johnson (NYSE:JNJ), Procter & Gamble, and AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) all feature in the top 10 holdings for both funds.\n\nTipRanks’ Smart Score system also takes a favorable view of each fund’s top holdings. The Smart Score is a proprietary quantitative stock scoring system created by TipRanks. It gives stocks a score from 1 to 10 based on eight market key factors. A score of 8 or above is equivalent to an Outperform rating. Eight out of DGRO’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores of 8 or above, and eight out of DGRW’s top 10 holdings feature Outperform-equivalent Smart Scores.\n\nDGRO enjoys an Outperform-Equivalent ETF Smart Score of 8 out of 10, and DGRW has the same rating. All in all, these two funds are on pretty even footing when it comes to their holdings.\n\nDividend Yields\n\nWith both funds boasting solid performance track records in recent years and highly-rated portfolios, there isn’t too much separating them. However, dividend yield is one area where one has a discernible advantage over the other. While DGRW yields just 1.6%, DGRO’s yield comes in higher at 2.3%, making it the clear choice in this category.\n\nNow, you may be thinking that neither of these yields sounds that great. And while they aren’t particularly high, it’s important to remember that these aren’t necessarily high-yield dividend funds. They are focused on dividend growth and a combination of returns from both dividends and capital appreciation, and they have been effective in this regard, as we saw in the total return section.\n\nPlus, the dividends of the stocks these funds focus on are expected to grow over time, so while the yields aren’t particularly high, investors can reasonably expect the levels of the dividend payouts to increase over time.\n\nFee Comparison\n\nThe other area where DGRO pulls away from DGRW is when it comes to their fees. To be clear, both ETFs are very reasonable in this department, but DGRO’s 0.08% expense ratio is much lower than DGRW’s 0.28%. These expense ratios mean that an investor putting $10,000 into DGRO will pay $8 in fees annually, while an investor in DGRW will pay $28.\n\nAgain, these are both reasonable numbers, but DGRO has the clear advantage. The discrepancy between the two also becomes more pronounced over time. Assuming that each fund maintains its current expense ratio and gains 5% per year going forward, the investor in DGRO will pay just $103 in fees over 10 years, while the investor in DGRW will pay $356.\n\nWe Have a Winner\n\nThese are both similarly focused funds with strong portfolios of highly-rated dividend growth stocks and solid track records of performance. While both are likely good choices for investors, I’m more bullish on DGRO and choose it as the winner in this comparison between these two high-powered ETFs because of its higher yield and lower expense ratio.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Analysis-Apple's AI push could reinvigorate iPhone sales as customers look to upgrade",
        "content": "By Jeffrey Dastin and Aditya Soni\n\nSAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Apple's developer conference on Monday was about more than infusing its software with the latest artificial intelligence technology, including from ChatGPT.\n\nIt was also about selling more iPhones.\n\nFacing choppy consumer spending and resurgent tech rivals, Apple has looked to AI as a way to invigorate its loyal fan base of more than 1 billion customers and to reverse a sales decline for its biggest-selling product.\n\nThe software, which requires at least an iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max to operate, may encourage a cascade of new purchases, several analysts said. Some predicted the biggest upgrade cycle come autumn since Apple's release of the iPhone 12 in 2020, which drew consumers in part through 5G connectivity.\n\n\"What we saw today was more compelling than anything we've seen since,\" analyst Gil Luria of D.A. Davidson said.\n\nThe company showcased what it called Apple Intelligence, its take on generative AI that can conjure text, images and other content on command.\n\nApple demonstrated how its AI could generate custom emojis, a cartoon to text friends or edits making an email sound more professional. Its digital aide Siri could prompt users if they wanted ChatGPT's help too.\n\nSome analysts voiced skepticism, predicting consumers would not race to Apple stores to get more AI on their phones.\n\n\"Perhaps there may be enough in the new and improved Siri-powered, intelligently Apple devices to stanch some of the device revenue that's been hemorrhaging lately, but there isn't enough to create a new band of followers,\" said Forrester analyst Dipanjan Chatterjee.\n\nTejas Dessai of Global X added, \"Investors clearly want a more comprehensive and ambitious strategy from Apple when it comes to AI.\" The company's stock fell 2% on the news.\n\nUPGRADE TO AI\n\nLike them or not, Apple's AI features won't come to every iPhone.\n\nThe company said smartphone customers have to upgrade to the iPhone 15 Pro or Pro Max that Apple began selling in September 2023. The AI, built so it can process data privately on a user's device, depends on chips in Apple's newer smartphones.\n\nIn Wedbush Securities analyst Dan Ives' view, that represents a big opportunity. He estimated some 270 million iPhones had not been upgraded in four years.\n\n\"We estimate 15%+ of the Apple installed base will upgrade to iPhone 16 as Apple Intelligence is the killer app many have been waiting for,\" Ives said.\n\nThe iPhone 16 release is expected sometime this autumn.\n\nStory continues\n\nGene Munster, a managing partner at Deepwater Asset Management, said another feather in Apple's cap was its easy-to-use integration with ChatGPT. \"They're really taking the friction out of using AI,\" he said.\n\nApple's iPhone revenue for its fiscal year that ended in September 2023 was $200.6 billion, down from $205.5 billion the prior year, the company's latest annual report showed.\n\nStill, AI is just a part of Apple's draw to consumers. They may primarily want a bigger iPhone display or better camera, but the AI updates would appeal to early adopters and stand apart for their ability to take actions in and across apps, said Martin Yang of Oppenheimer & Co.\n\n\"That action part will make Apple an immediate leader in consumer AI,\" Yang said.\n\n(Reporting by Jeffrey Dastin in San Francisco; Additional reporting by Aditya Soni in Bangalore and Max Cherney in Cupertino; Editing by Jamie Freed)\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple’s big AI announcements were all about AI ‘for the rest of us’ — Google, Meta, Amazon and, yes, OpenAI should take note",
        "content": "In the end, Apple’s highly-anticipated AI announcements were very, well, Apple-y. You could practically feel that bite in the tech giant’s fruit logo as the company finally announced Apple Intelligence (how deliciously on-brand to take advantage of the technology’s initials), which Apple’s Tim Cook touted will be “personal, powerful, and private” and integrated across Apple’s app and hardware ecosystem.\n\nApple, of course, has always been all about being a protective “walled garden” that provides comprehensive security measures but also plenty of restrictions for users, and Apple Intelligence will be no different. But it is that very personal context of the user within the Apple landscape, combined with the power of generative AI, that makes Apple Intelligence something perhaps only Apple could really do.\n\nApple has not been first, or anywhere near the cutting edge of generative AI, but it is betting on something else: An AI ‘for the rest of us’ — for the billions of users who don’t care about models or APIs or datasets or GPUs or devices or the potential for artificial general intelligence (AGI). That is, the ‘normies’ — as those in the tech industry like to call them — who simply want AI that is easy, useful, protective of privacy and just works.\n\nThe laundry list of features Apple executives promised to roll out across iPhone, iPad and Mac OS devices was long. Siri is getting an upgrade that makes the assistant “natural, more contextually relevant, and more personal.” If Siri can’t answer a question itself, it will ask the user if it’s OK to tap into ChatGPT (thanks to a new deal between Apple and OpenAI) and it will have “on-screen awareness” that will eventually allow Siri to take more agent-like action on user content across apps.\n\nThere will be new systemwide writing tools in iOS 18, iPadOS 18, and macOS Sequoia, as well as new ways for AI to help prioritize everything from messages to notifications. The fun factor is well-represented as well, with on-device AI image creation and the fittingly-named Genmojis, which let users create custom emojis on-the-fly (think: smiley face with cucumbers on the eyes to indicate you're at the spa).\n\nBut unlike Google and Meta’s throw-everything-at-the-wall approach to integrating generative AI to their products, Apple is taking a different tack, putting a carefully designed layer of gen AI on top of its operating system. None of it, at least in Monday’s demo, seems bolted on as an afterthought (like Meta’s AI-is-everywhere search bar in Instagram, Facebook and WhatsApp, for example). And none of it, in fact, really uses the word AI as in “artificial intelligence.”\n\nStory continues\n\nThe re-branding of AI as Apple Intelligence takes a technology consumers have heard and read about for more than a year (and which has often sounded frightening, futuristic and kind of freaky), and serves it up as something that's soothingly safe and secure. It’s the tech equivalent of a mild soap for sensitive skin, offering consumers a freshly-scrubbed face with no hard-to-pronounce and potentially irritating ingredients.\n\nOf course, Big Tech demos are notorious for big announcements that don’t always deliver. And there were few details about important issues like the provenance of the data powering Apple Intelligence features, the terms of Apple's deal with OpenAI for access to ChatGPT, and how Apple plans to deal with the inevitable hallucinations that will result from its AI output. After all, safe and secure does not mean “accurate.” When Apple Intelligence is released “in the wild,” things are sure to get interesting, and messier.\n\nThe tech world is in a fierce battle to see which company will be able to take AI and turn it into the industry’s next game-changer. Whether that is Apple or not remains to be seen, but the elegant simplicity of the Apple Intelligence announcements certainly puts Google, Meta, Amazon and yes, OpenAI on notice: AI may be complicated, but as Steve Jobs said, “simple can be harder than complex: You have to work hard to get your thinking clean to make it simple.” Perhaps, AI companies will finally figure out how to keep it simple—and as Jobs said, “move mountains.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Apple is looking to integrate more AI chatbots, including Google’s Gemini, into its devices in the future, the company’s software chief has said.\n\nOn Monday, the tech giant confirmed it was working with OpenAI to build ChatGPT into the software of the newest iPhone, iPad and Mac devices as part of a major update to bring more generative AI tools to its devices.\n\nSpeaking to reporters after the announcements were made, Craig Federighi said Apple believed that AI models trained to be experts in specific fields were likely to become more common in the future, and the tech giant was keen to give users options to combine these with their own Apple Intelligence tools.\n\nApple’s own tools are designed to take advantage of the personal knowledge a user’s iPhone, iPad or Mac has of their schedule, habits and activities, rather than grab knowledge from the internet to help answer queries.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“We focused on a set of experiences that we felt were extremely core to the user experience of our platform, but we know that there are other models out there and some of them have really fantastic world knowledge and they may have domain knowledge – ultimately you can imagine a world where there’s a medical model that’s going to have an incredible depth of expertise, or a legal model,” Mr Federighi said.\n\n“So people are going to want to draw on that kind of expertise that might not be part of our core, but something that they want to take advantage of, and so we see the capabilities of those models is really complementary to what we’re doing as an optional thing that users can draw on.”\n\nOn the decision to work first with OpenAI, the Apple executive said he believed ChatGPT was the current market leader.\n\n“We wanted to start with the best, and we think ChatGPT from OpenAI and their new 4o model represents the best choice for our users today,” he said.\n\n“We think ultimately, people are going to have a preference perhaps for certain models that they want to use – maybe one that great’s for creative writing, or one they prefer for coding, and so we want to enable users ultimately to bring the model of their choice and we’re going to look forward to doing integrations with models, like Google Gemini for instance, in the future.\n\n“Nothing to announce right now, but that’s our direction.”",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. took the wraps off long-awaited new artificial intelligence features, including a partnership with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, betting that a personalized and understated approach to the technology will win over customers.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Investment Bank Moelis Probes Incident After Video of Employee Appearing to Punch Woman NYC Landlord to Sell Office Building at Roughly 67% Discount Musk to Ban Apple Devices If OpenAI Is Integrated Into OS Macron Gambles on Snap French Election in Bid to Stop Le Pen\n\nA new AI platform called Apple Intelligence was the highlight of the company’s Worldwide Developers Conference presentation on Monday, which also included updates to the iPhone maker’s operating systems. The technology will help summarize text, create original images and retrieve the most relevant data when users need it. The push also includes a revamped version of Siri, the company’s once-pioneering digital assistant.\n\nApple is making a high-stakes bid to catch up with rivals in the booming AI market. After falling behind tech peers like Alphabet Inc.’s Google and Microsoft Corp., the company is counting on a streamlined interface — and loyal customer base — to regain ground.\n\n“This is a moment we’ve been working toward for a long time,” Senior Vice President Craig Federighi, who oversees software engineering, said at the event. He described Apple Intelligence as “AI for the rest of us,” alluding to an old slogan about the Mac computer.\n\nThe partnership with OpenAI, which Bloomberg reported on before the event, will let customers access ChatGPT via Siri at no extra cost. Apple Intelligence will begin rolling out later this year, but some features — including the ability for Siri to precisely control features within apps — won’t come until next year. Support for languages beyond English also won’t arrive until later.\n\nOpenAI Chief Executive Officer Sam Altman was at Monday’s event and wrote on the social media site X that he was “very happy” to be teaming up with Apple. While the ChatGPT integration will be free, paid subscribers to OpenAI will get additional features over time. Apple, which has also held talks with Google about using that company’s Gemini feature, said it plans to support other services later.\n\nEnsuring that customer data is secure was a major theme of the presentation. A system called Private Cloud Compute will help keep users’ information safe when it’s being sent to data centers, Federighi said. Apple Intelligence will also support AI-created emoji called Genmoji and automated photo editing.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple’s iOS 18 and iPadOS — its iPhone and iPad software — will get features that improve customization, productivity and communication. Some additions will include:\n\nAn upgraded home screen will let users place icons anywhere. App icon colors can also be changed, and they can be tinted when the device is placed in dark mode. A new Control Center includes support for third-party controls, multiple pages of settings and an updated look. The iPhone 14 and more recent models will get support for text messaging via satellites. That was previously available in emergency situations. The Messages app will have the ability to schedule a text to be sent later. The Tapbacks feature, which lets users quickly respond to texts with things like a heart or question mark, will now work with an emoji or digital sticker. Customers can set up effects — such as a shaking word — for individual words and phrases, rather than entire texts. And there’s rich text support, which will make it easier for Apple customers to communicate with Android users. A Passwords app will manage secure logins, passkeys and Wi-Fi account details. A redesigned Photos app will use artificial intelligence to improve editing. There’s the ability to lock any app behind Face ID. The iPad gets the Calculator app for the first time, and it will let people solve handwritten math equations using an Apple Pencil. That app’s absence from the iPad was a longstanding issue among customers, and the new feature was announced to applause at Monday’s event.\n\nInvestors gave a tepid reaction to the event — a not-uncommon reaction when Apple debuts long-anticipated new features. The shares fell almost 2% to $193.12 in New York, leaving the stock little changed for the year.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company also rolled out macOS Sequoia, which includes the same Apple Intelligence features as the iPad and iPhone.\n\nSome of its other enhancements:\n\nThe ability to receive and interact with iPhone notifications. The ability to drag and drop files between devices. Mirroring an iPhone’s display so it can be used on a Mac’s screen. The ability to organize Mac application windows as tiles that stick to different portions of the display.\n\nAnd the company unveiled visionOS 2, the latest version of its software for the Vision Pro headset. That has new features for photos and handling office work, including:\n\nThe ability to turn regular photos into 3D spatial pictures. New hand gestures for opening the Home View and Control Center. A new version of the Mac Virtual Display feature that can create a virtual wraparound screen. The ability to AirPlay content from an iPhone, iPad or Mac into the Vision Pro.\n\nApple also announced plans to launch the Vision Pro internationally, with preorders beginning in China, Hong Kong, Japan and Singapore on June 13. The device will go on sale in those areas June 28. That will be followed by Australia, Canada, France, Germany and the UK. Preorders will begin in those countries June 28, and sales will start July 12.\n\nNew AirPods software, meanwhile, will make it easier to hear users’ voices during a phone call by removing background noise. The Apple Watch will get additional health capabilities, such as enhanced pregnancy tracking and an app that shows at-a-glance vital statistics.\n\nBut the AI features were the biggest focus of the event. Those tools will also include the ability to transcribe phone calls and voice memos, solve advanced math equations, sort through email, and prioritize notifications.\n\nThough Apple had an early lead in AI after it launched Siri in 2011, its technology was quickly overtaken by the Google Assistant and Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa. Then AI took another giant leap forward when OpenAI’s ChatGPT arrived at the end of 2022.\n\nThat led to a flurry of other services, including ones from Google, Microsoft and Meta Platforms Inc. Samsung Electronics Co. — Apple’s biggest smartphone rival — also integrated Google AI features into its devices earlier this year.\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook is now under pressure to show that the iPhone maker can lead again. The company also is contending with a broader sales slump. Revenue declined in five of the past six quarters in the face of sluggish smartphone demand and a slowdown in China.\n\nOn Monday, Cook said AI would be “the next big step for Apple.” Though the company won’t make money directly on the new features, the hope is to make users more loyal and prod them to upgrade more frequently.\n\n“We think Apple Intelligence is going to be indispensable to the products that already play such an integral role in our lives,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nAs Banking Moves Online, Branch Design Takes Cues From Starbucks Legacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

That is an unacceptable security violation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\n“And visitors will have to check their Apple devices at the door, where they will be stored in a Faraday cage.”\n\nIn a further post, he added: “It’s patently absurd that Apple isn’t smart enough to make their own AI, yet is somehow capable of ensuring that OpenAI will protect your security & privacy!\n\n“Apple has no clue what’s actually going on once they hand your data over to OpenAI. They’re selling you down the river.”\n\nApple has been approached for comment in response to Mr Musk’s claims, but in its announcement of the partnership, it said users needed to give their permission before any request was shared with OpenAI and that requests were not stored during the process.\n\nMr Musk has a fractious relationship with OpenAI – he was a founder of the company, but has since turned against it and accused it of failing to follow its founding principles.\n\nHe has even sued the company, claiming it has abandoned its original mission to instead focus on profit, something OpenAI has denied.\n\nThe SpaceX boss is also now a direct rival to OpenAI, with Mr Musk having created his own AI firm – xAI – which has created Grok, a chatbot designed to take on ChatGPT.",

        "content": "Admittedly, bailing on over-hyped stocks to sell can seem like a regretful move in the near-term. Flying in the face of the Wall Street adage “let your winners run,” it’s common to feel regretful when you sell said hot stocks, only to see them get even hotter and head higher.\n\nYet, while it may at first seem like you are leaving money on the table selling, exiting from stocks benefiting heavily from hope and hype right now could prove to be a shrewd move in hindsight. The latest meme wave, driven by famed meme stock investor Keith (Roaring Kitty) Gill is clearly fading.\n\nThe popularity of AI stocks has benefited from a resurgence lately. But it’s unclear whether fear, uncertainty and doubt (FUD) about the future growth for this space will soon emerge once again. Atop this, momentum plays are at risk of running out of runway, as concerns about higher for longer interest rates and other macro factors continue to climb.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nWith this in mind, it may be high time to take profit, with the following seven over-hyped stocks to sell.\n\nApple (AAPL) Newly released iPhone 15 pro max mockup set with back and front angles. AAPL stock\n\nSource: Yalcin Sonat / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) may not be the first “Magnificent 7” stock that comes to mind when you think over-hyped. But, consider how much the tech giant still has to prove, when it comes to capitalizing on the generative artificial intelligence (AI) growth trend.\n\nYes, AAPL stock could keep surging, if the company makes a splash with its AI unveiling at this week’s Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC). However, pretty soon, concerns about Apple iPhone sales could once again start to overshadow the AI hype. As I recently argued, weak iPhone demand, especially in China, threatens to continue affecting the company’s overall fiscal performance and growth.\n\nWith shares currently changing hands a pricey 30 times forward earnings, a shift in sentiment back to bearish may mean a massive de-rating ahead for AAPL. Trading in the $190s today, shares could easily retest their 52-week low of $164.08 per share, or worse, head back to even lower prices. If this was merely a story of Apple doing okay overall, but possibly getting an extra boost from AI mania, it would be a different story. Yet as iPhone headwinds remain, selling existing positions into strength is the better move.\n\nC3.ai (AI) C3.ai (AI) logo on a smartphone with computer screen showing graph in background, symbolizing AI stock\n\nSource: shutterstock.com/Below the Sky\n\nC3.ai (NYSE:AI) has once again become one one of the most over-hyped stocks to sell. Yes, AI has not only benefited from the latest resurgences in AI and meme stock popularity. Alongside this, the enterprise AI software company recently released an earnings report that was well-received by the market.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, longstanding concerns have not gone away completely for AI stock. Although growth last quarter re-accelerated year-over-year (YOY) and quarter-over-quarter (QOQ), it’s unclear how much C3.ai’s rate of growth will increase, as it completes its transition to a subscription-based revenue model. Another question that remains unanswered is when the company will become consistently profitable. Sell-side forecasts still call for net losses to persist through 2026.\n\nTherefore, it makes sense that the short side of the trade with AI remains very crowded, at around 31.9% of outstanding float. Any sort of stumble in the coming quarters, with growth and/or with its path to profitability, could lead to a severe correction for shares. Given the many other fundamentally-strong AI plays, why mess around with C3.ai?\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC)\n\nSource: MNAphotography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Entertainment (NYSE:AMC) briefly gained from the aforementioned Roaring Kitty rally. Yet, as meme mania heads into the sunset once again, a further sell-off likely awaits for this former “meme king.”\n\nWhy? As Louis Navellier and the InvestorPlace Research Staff recently argued, AMC stock is caught in a lose-lose situation. First, consider movie theater attendance, amid the industry continuing to make a sluggish post-Covid19 recovery. This is a factor outside of management’s control but key for AMC’s financial health. Second, with this underwhelming industry recovery, AMC is struggling to experience the rebound in necessary profitability to pay down debt through cash flow.\n\nAs a result, the company faces a tough choice. AMC can either continue to dilute shareholders to raise equity, or simply contend with continued net losses, which will further call into question the stock’s valuation. To add to Navellier’s bearish points, consider the fact that there’s a much better movie theater play out there: Cinemark Holdings (NYSE:CNK). CNK is profitable and trades at a reasonable 14.2 times forward earnings.\n\nGE Aerospace (GE) a private plane inside a hangar is prepared for a flight. represent aerospace stocks\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nGE Aerospace (NYSE:GE) is another that may be controversial to consider as one of the over-hyped stocks to sell. After all, it’s not as if GE has surged because of “meme mania” or “AI mania.” Rather, investors have bid up the former conglomerate, now aerospace pure play, for other reasons.\n\nAt least, that’s the bullish narrative being disseminated regarding GE stock. Per the bulls, as safety concerns with Boeing (NYSE:BA) affect delivery of enough new aircraft to meet demand, existing aircraft are likely to stay in the skies longer than previously anticipated. This means more demand for parts and maintenance – good news for aerospace suppliers like GE.\n\nHowever, it’s possible that the market is overestimating how much this will affect GE’s growth and profitability going forward. How so? Take a look at GE’s forward valuation. Shares today trade at 40 times forward earnings, a high multiple for an “old economy” industrial stock. If the above-mentioned tailwinds aren’t as strong as expected, GE could go from a high flier to a stock facing heavy turbulence.\n\nEli Lilly (LLY) Eli Lilly and Company World Headquarters. Lilly makes Medicines and Pharmaceuticals XI\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nSimilar to the situation with GE Aerospace, Eli Lilly (NYSE:LLY) is another potential case of the market putting the cart before the horse regarding a growth catalyst. Actually, two growth catalysts exist. That is, this pharma firm is sitting pretty, with the success of its diabetes and weight-loss treatment Mounjaro.\n\nAlongside Mounjaro is another promising candidate in the pipeline that’s driving heavy hype for LLY stock right now. That would be donanemab, Lilly’s candidate for the treatment of Alzheimer’s disease. Per analysts at Bloomberg Intelligence, donanemab is a mega-blockbuster drug in the making. By 2030, it may have 50% of a $13 billion per year Alzheimer’s drug market.\n\nEven so, consider that LLY trades for around 61.8 times forward earnings. There’s validity in questioning whether or not both these growth catalysts are already baked into the stock’s valuation. After more than doubling in price since early 2023, at best, further gains for Eli Lilly shares could be far less stellar. At worst, disappointment could lead to a massive reversal. If you bought in before hope and hype for Mounjaro and donanemab took shape, consider it high time to take profit.\n\nReddit (RDDT) Silhouette man using smartphone with Reddit (RDDT) logo on blurred background is an American social news aggregation, content rating, and discussion website.\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nReddit (NYSE:RDDT) has been rallying lately, and not for reasons you may think. This rally has coincided with the recent resurgence in popularity of meme stocks. However, it’s not as if investors have bought RDDT just because its eponymous social media platform is heavily associated with the trend.\n\nRather, investors have bid up RDDT stock, in large part due to AI-related news. On May 16, the company announced a collaboration with ChatGPT developer OpenAI. As a result of this partnership, Reddit content will be made available to ChatGPT. In addition, new AI features will be integrated into Reddit’s platform. Even so, it’s not as if this is a surprise development.\n\nAs I discussed in an article on RDDT shortly after its IPO earlier this year, AI licensing was one of several potential catalysts hyped up at its public market debut. So before this recent rally, RDDT’s valuation may have already factored-in this catalyst. Hence, it’s very possible that once the market digests this news, RDDT, one of the over-hyped stocks to sell, falls back from nearly $60 per share, back on down to the low-$40s per share.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA stock) Motors store in Piazza Gae Aulenti square in Milan, Italy. TSLA stock. stocks that could be the next Tesla\n\nSource: Zigres / Shutterstock.com\n\nTwo months back, it seemed as if Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) was en route back on down to multi-year lows. However, since then, shares in the electric vehicle (EV) maker have bounced back. Namely, this is due to renewed hope and hype regarding one of the company’s sexier growth catalysts, the Robotaxi.\n\nOther developments have contributed to this warming back up in enthusiasm about TSLA stock. However, don’t assume that the renewed bullish sentiment will continue. Pretty soon, concerns could be back on the radar of investors, such as Tesla’s sales and margin issues. Recent vehicle shipment data and fiscal results suggest that the company is struggling in China. Also, Tesla may be facing trouble in the European EV market as well.\n\nTesla may consider itself a “tech company that happens to build cars,” but if its bread-and-butter automotive division keeps on struggling, look out below. It’s only a matter of time before investors realize that paying 70 times earnings for a cyclical automaker makes little sense, especially as more promising EV stocks, like BYD (OTCMKTS:BYDDF), trade at far less steep valuations.\n\nOn the date of publication, Thomas Niel did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) remains the stock market’s most valuable company, worth $3.15 trillion. That’s a mind-boggling number. But how long will it hold onto the top spot of trillion-dollar stocks?\n\nBoth Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) fight for the second sport with both worth about $3 trillion. Apple is No. 2 as of this writing, but that was flip-flopping last week as the chipmaker surged to surpass the consumer tech giant briefly.\n\nOnly six companies out of the thousands that trade on the market are worth $1 trillion or more. Several are within shouting distance of the threshold. Below are three stocks that could be the next trillion-dollar stocks to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt a market valuation of $418 million, Mastercard (NYSE:MA) is less than halfway to the goal. Yet, it is well within the realm of possibility for the credit card processor to reach a $1 trillion valuation.\n\nOver the past decade, Mastercard stock has appreciated at a 17.5% compounded annual rate. That suggests that if it continues at that pace, Mastercard could cross the finish line within five years. And we’re not talking about some tech stocks (all six existing trillion-dollar stocks are technology stocks). This is a mature, rather mundane business of processing payment transactions, which underscores the health and strength of Mastercard.\n\nA bet on Mastercard becoming a trillion-dollar stock by 2035 is a bet on the long-term growth in U.S. consumer spending and an ever-expanding U.S. economy. Both seem like even-money bets.\n\nNot that it will be a straight shot. A recession could slow its growth. Total household non-housing debt stands at a record $4.87 trillion. Overall, Mastercard stock seems an easy pick for hitting a trillion-dollar valuation.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nHealth insurer UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH) is an even likelier candidate for achieving a $1 trillion valuation than Mastercard. The 10-year stock return for UNH stock is higher than that of the payments processor, at over 500%. That means it could cross the threshold sooner than Mastercard. Its growth could accelerate.\n\nThe healthcare industry has been under enormous pressure due to the pandemic, inflation and labor shortages. Industry analysts at McKinsey say the tide is turning, especially in the managed care population. Patients who qualify for both Medicaid and Medicare represents “one of the most substantial opportunities for payers.”\n\nStory continues\n\nUnitedHealth is seeing robust growth in Medicare Advantage revenue, which grew almost 3% in the first quarter to $7.7 billion from the year-ago period. It was up sequentially from the fourth quarter as well. Medicaid revenue, however, was down sharply year-over-year. The insurer also saw a slight improvement in Medicare supplemental revenue compared to last year.\n\nUnitedHealth Group’s revenue rose $8 billion in the quarter to almost $100 billion. Although it reported a net loss of $1.53 per share, that was wholly due to selling its Brazilian sale and the impact of a cyberattack it suffered. Look for UnitedHealth’s performance to improve as these one-time costs move into the rearview mirror and it expands into new lines of business.\n\nJPMorgan Chase (JPM) Chase Bank logo and storefront\n\nSource: Daryl L / Shutterstock.com\n\nAt over $574 billion, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) is already more than halfway there. The stock of the financial industry giant is up over 17% in 2024 and 42% higher over the last 12 months. At these growth rates, it could achieve trillion-dollar status in no time.\n\nHowever, its 10-year growth rate is substantially lower than that of either Mastercard or UnitedHealth, so investors should not expect that pace to continue. Still, there seems little doubt the country’s biggest bank will reach that valuation.\n\nIt is already benefiting from the Federal Reserve’s higher-for-longer interest rate policies. Higher rates boost JPMorgan’s net interest income (NII), which surged 19% last year to $24.2 billion as the Fed raised rates an unprecedented 11 times between 2022 and 2023. NII was up another 11% in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nFed bank presidents, however, recently expressed doubts about any rate cuts coming soon. They want sustained progress on inflation, not just a one-quarter improvement. The May jobs report showed that 272,000 new jobs were created, well ahead of expectations of 180,000 new jobs. That puts the prospects for a rate cut even more in doubt.\n\nLast year, Morgan Stanley analyst Betsy Graseck called JPMorgan an “underappreciated rate play” and said she saw the bank becoming a trillion-dollar stock. Her timeline, though, was 12 years down the road, maybe eight if it cut costs or increased the rate of revenue growth. JPM might not cross the threshold faster than some other companies, but it seems clear the bank will eventually be worth $1 trillion.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Customers in Australia, Canada, France, Germany, and the United Kingdom can pre-order Vision Pro beginning Friday, June 28, at 5 a.m. PT, with availability beginning Friday, July 12. Vision Pro seamlessly blends digital content with the physical world to deliver powerful spatial experiences that transform the way people work, collaborate, connect, relive memories, enjoy entertainment, and much more.\n\n\"The enthusiasm for Apple Vision Pro has been extraordinary, and we are thrilled to introduce the magic of spatial computing to more customers around the world,\" said Tim Cook, Apple’s CEO. \"We can’t wait for more people to see the impossible become possible, whether working and collaborating with an infinite canvas for apps, reliving treasured memories in three dimensions, watching TV shows and movies in a one-of-a-kind personal cinema, or enjoying brand-new spatial experiences that defy imagination.\"\n\nA Revolutionary Spatial Computer\n\nApple Vision Pro is powered by visionOS™, a revolutionary operating system, intuitive spatial user interface, and magical input system that users navigate with their eyes, hands, and voice. visionOS is built upon decades of engineering and design innovation in iOS, iPadOS®, and macOS®, and works seamlessly with Apple’s ecosystem of hardware, software, and services to deliver a delightful experience across users’ favorite Apple devices.\n\nUsers interact with apps by simply looking at them and tapping their fingers together. They can also speak to dictate text, use the virtual keyboard to type, and ask Siri® to open and close apps, play media, answer questions, and more. The infinite canvas frees apps from the boundaries of a physical display, so they can appear side by side at any scale, providing users with the ultimate workspace for productivity, collaboration, and entertainment. Environments — stunning, dynamic landscapes like Haleakalā, Joshua Tree, Yosemite, and even the moon — are designed to help users focus, reduce visual clutter, and enjoy immersive experiences.\n\nWith visionOS 2, available as a free software update this fall, all Apple Vision Pro users will gain access to even more features that enhance how they engage with spatial computing, including a powerful way to transform photos into 3D memories; intuitive hand gestures to easily access the Home View and important information at a glance; new capabilities for Mac® Virtual Display, Travel Mode, and Guest User; enhancements to Mindfulness, Safari®, and the Apple TV® app; and much more.\n\nStory continues\n\nA Robust Catalog of Apps, Games, and Experiences\n\nThe App Store® now features more than 2,000 apps designed for Apple Vision Pro; more than 1.5 million compatible iOS and iPadOS apps; and even more apps on Mac using Mac Virtual Display that work seamlessly alongside one another.1 The unique capabilities of Vision Pro, paired with apps built by Apple’s worldwide developer community, make it a remarkably versatile device for users.\n\nAn Enormous, Private, and Portable Workspace\n\nLeading business and productivity apps — including Box, Craft, Fantastical, MindNode, Slack, Things 3, Webex, Zoom, and apps from Microsoft 365 — help users collaborate with colleagues and accomplish everyday tasks.

Apps that support SharePlay™ and spatial Persona allow multiple users to watch together, as if they’re in the same physical space.4\n\nA Front-Row Seat and Personal Scoreboard for Sports\n\nWith apps from major sports leagues and brands — including the NBA, MLS, MLB, NHL, PGA TOUR, The Masters, UFC, World Surf League, and Red Bull TV — Apple Vision Pro users have the opportunity to watch games and follow athletes like never before. Features like multiview, real-time player and game stats, live object mapping, and more bring the benefits of a physical scoreboard or second screen right into view. Fans can also follow live local, national, and international sports with apps from top cable services and sports broadcasters.\n\nAn Incredible Gaming Device\n\nUsers can explore thousands of fun games, including more than 250 titles with Apple Arcade®. New spatial games and content updates launch on Apple Arcade regularly, with recent releases such as Alto’s Odyssey — The Lost City, Crossy Road Castle, and Where Cards Fall, alongside spatial games on the App Store, such as the 2024 Apple Design Award-winning Blackbox, Loóna, and DapTap. Popular immersive games, like Job Simulator, shine on Apple Vision Pro, allowing players to simply use their eyes and hands to simulate various professions, like a gourmet chef or store clerk. Players can also access iPad® and iPhone® games, PC and console games using apps like Steam Link, and even more games on Mac — which are all compatible with PlayStation DualSense and Xbox Wireless controllers.\n\nAn Infinite Canvas for Creativity\n\nNew design apps like AirDraw and Da Vinci Eye have been built to leverage the unique capabilities of spatial computing, like the ability for users to sketch, draw, and paint with just their eyes and hands. The 2024 Apple Design Award-winning app djay empowers artists to make music out of thin air, while Lowe’s Style Studio allows users to design their dream kitchen.\n\nGroundbreaking Storytelling Experiences\n\nApple Vision Pro introduces Apple Immersive Video™, a storytelling format that leverages 3D 8K video with a 180-degree field of view and Spatial Audio to transport viewers to the center of the action. The Apple TV app is home to a growing slate of Apple Immersive films and series, while the App Store features unique immersive and interactive experiences, including Encounter Dinosaurs, GUCCI’s film Who Is Sabato De Sarno?

        "title": "The Dividend Dynasty: 3 Stocks That Will Keep Your Pockets Lined for Years",
        "content": "Dividend stocks are not on everyone’s radar right now, with Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) moving past Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to become the second-most-valuable company in the world. And, a host of other artificial intelligence stocks, such as Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) lead the pack for mega-cap stocks. But with a potential recession this year and no rate cuts thus far, dividend stocks are the safe haven investment you need in your portfolio.\n\nBlackRock (NYSE:BLK) is concerned about the 2024 economy, citing macroeconomic volatility and fundamental inflation pressures even if inflation falls to 2%. Moreover, Morgan Stanley (NYSE:MS) and Morningstar analysts wrote that the U.S. equities market is overpriced after a significant gain by the end of 2023, and this was before Nvidia’s surge this year.\n\nIn these times, it’s better to pick up dividend aristocrat stocks analysts love, whose payouts have increased for 25 years and counting. Overall, the S&P 500 dividend aristocrat stocks have done better than the S&P 500 Index. Especially during a decade when average yearly stock returns were less than 10%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nCardinal Health (CAH) Cardinal Health (CAH) sign with bushes in front of it\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCardinal Health (NYSE:CAH) recently decided to increase its dividend to $0.5056 per share, helping maintain its 35-year dividend aristocrat streak. With this raise, the forward yearly dividend will be $2.02, giving CAH a forward yield of 2.05%, which is higher than the average yield in the healthcare sector of 1.58%. A payout ratio of 26% means the dividend is more than secure.\n\nIn addition, CAH’s second-quarter $250 million accelerated share buyback program brought fiscal 2024 share repurchases to $750 million.\n\nApart from the shareholder returns, the healthcare services company deserves credit for navigating some tricky waters. It recently reaffirmed its fiscal 2024 non-GAAP EPS forecasts despite its decision not to renew its contracts with OptumRx when they expire at the end of June 2024. Instead, CAH believes new customer wins and niche growth will make up for any revenue loss.\n\nRecent numbers support this. Cardinal Health’s fiscal year 2024 third-quarter sales grew 9% to $54.9 billion, and CAH boosted its full-year non-GAAP EPS estimate. At-Home Solutions, Nuclear and Precision Health Solutions, and OptiFreight Logistics drove its Other business segment, which rose 14%.\n\nThe business is also expanding its network and delivery hubs to fulfill the demand for $2.6 billion in at-home solutions and is looking to create a larger Texas distribution facility with robots and modern technologies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) Image of a yellow construction vehicle with the Caterpillar (CAT) logo on it\n\nSource: astudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nSince its founding, Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT) has paid a cash payout every year, and since 1933, it has increased its dividends for 30 years; with a payout ratio of around 23%, CAT has a sustainable dividend model\n\nCaterpillar earned $5.75 per share in Q1 2024, or $5.60 after adjustments. Company revenues and earnings stayed at $15.8 billion from Q1 2023. The operational profit ratio improved from 17.2% to 22.3%, and operating cash flow was $2.1 billion, with $5.1 billion for buybacks and incentives.\n\nCaterpillar’s Cat Financial revenues grew 11% to $853 million owing to higher average lending rates and earning assets. Profit rose 12% to $229 million pre-tax. New retail business surged, and past-due accounts fell, showing a strong Cat Financial portfolio.\n\nCaterpillar’s success is due to its agile operating strategy and a strong housing market. Starting in April 2024, 1.36 million privately held homes were seasonally adjusted, 5.7% higher than in March 2024. April 2024 had 1.62 million housing completions, 8.6% higher than March and 14.6% more than April 2023. Active listings show increasing home prices owing to low housing availability.\n\nWith potentially three rate cuts this year, all of these statistics are great news for CAT investors.\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSince going public in 1994, Realty Income (NYSE:O) has increased dividends 125 times, with a 2.1% increase to $0.2625 per share, the latest of its hikes.\n\nDue to its increasing dividend, paid monthly, O boasts a 5.8% yield, which is substantial even considering its REIT status and beats the real estate industry average of 4.5%.\n\nAfter raising its AFFO outlook to $4.15–$4.21 per diluted share from $4.13–$4.21, O offered investors another reason to be hopeful.\n\nO needs market trust following a lackluster earnings report. A market already suffering from rising interest rates was further soured by EPS falling over 40% short of expert estimates. However, a $129.7 million net income and $862.9 million AFFO for the first quarter of 2024 were still encouraging. Rent hikes and occupancy rates were maintained as the corporation invested $598 million at a 7.8% cash return.\n\nRealty Income made initial cash yield investments in various property sectors totaling $598 million during the quarter. At an average cap rate of 7%, O has completed $1.67 billion in acquisitions.\n\nThe results arrive shortly after Realty Income closed on its purchase of Spirit Realty Capital for $9.3 billion, adding 61.6 million square feet to the portfolio, becoming the fourth-largest REIT in the process.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faizan Farooque did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nFaizan Farooque is a contributing author for InvestorPlace.com and numerous other financial sites.

        "content": "According to PricewaterhouseCoopers, artificial intelligence could contribute $15.7 trillion to the global economy in 2030. The technology promises to impact everything from video games to medical procedures, and just about everything in between. The cars we drive, the food we eat and the entertainment we watch are all expected to be impacted, in some way, by AI.\n\nOf course, this presents a huge opportunity to the companies leading the development of AI applications and models and whose engineers and scientists understand the technology’s likely impact on society. For investors, there’s an opportunity to make a fortune off the stocks of the companies leading us into the future. Here are three stocks representing companies that are doing the best job navigating the seas of technological change.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nChipmaker Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) isn’t just navigating the seas of technological change, it is leading the change. The company controls about three-quarters (75%) of the global market for AI microchips and semiconductors enabling the current technological boom. Owing to the huge demand for its chips and semiconductors, Nvidia reported year-over-year first-quarter sales growth of more than 200% and profit growth exceeding 600%.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nNVDA stock has soared, helping the company briefly achieve a $3 trillion market capitalization and challenge Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) in becoming the world’s second-most valuable public company behind Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). Nvidia’s shares have risen nearly 25% since the company reported its Q1 financial results in May, and have increased 217% over the last 12 months. Along with its recent earnings, Nvidia raised its quarterly dividend 150% and implemented a 10-for-1 stock split.\n\nSalesforce (CRM) lose up of Salesforce (CRM) logo displayed on one of their towers in downtown San Francisco. Salesforce layoffs\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nCloud computing giant Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) is all in on AI. The company announced plans to open a new AI center in London, part of a larger $4 billion investment in the U.K. Salesforce said it will open a 40,000-square-foot facility in downtown London capable of hosting 300 people. The center will be used to encourage industry collaboration among technology companies and engage in AI training and upskilling programs for workers.\n\nSalesforce expects the center will help create 500,000 AI-related jobs in the U.K. The new facility officially opens on June 18 with a free event that will train more than 100 AI developers. Salesforce said the London AI center is the first of many that the company plans to launch worldwide and that it will support its British and Irish businesses. The AI center is part of a broader $4 billion investment that Salesforce is making in the U.K. The company said it has also invested more than $200 million into British start-up companies.\n\nStory continues\n\nCRM stock declined 5% this year, mostly after the company issued lackluster Q1 financial results.\n\nIntel (INTC) Intel (INTC) logo is seen outside of the Robert Noyce Building at Intel Corporation's headquarters in Santa Clara, California.\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading chipmaker Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) is doing its best to catch rival Nvidia in the global race to supply the chips and semiconductors needed to develop AI models and applications. Intel unveiled new AI microchips for data centers days after Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) announced their latest chips. Intel claims its new “Xeon 6” processor will deliver better performance and energy efficiency for high-intensity data center workloads.\n\nSix months ago, Intel launched its Xeon line of processors for data centers, as well as its Gaudi 3 processor for training AI models and chatbots. Intel also announced that prices for its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerator chips will be lower than the chips of its main rivals. Intel also revealed details for its Lunar Lake processors that are expected to ship this year and compete against Nvidia’s and AMD’s chips for AI personal computers. While Intel is playing catch-up to Nvidia and AMD, it looks to be closing the gap.\n\nINTC stock is down 36% this year.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joel Baglole held long positions in NVDA and MSFT.

        "title": "The Rivian Stock Resurgence: Don’t Let FOMO Burn Your Portfolio",
        "content": "After bottoming out two months back, Rivian Automotive (NASDAQ:RIVN) shares have been creeping back to higher prices. That’s not surprising. A new bull case for Rivian stock appears to be taking shape.\n\nAt least, that’s the take-away, from both recent promising developments, and the proliferation of bullish arguments once again for the fledgling EV maker’s shares. Instead of dwelling on current problems, investors are again looking to Rivian’s potentially bright future.\n\nThat’s a future that entails Rivian, after an extended slump, finally making progress in areas like delivery volume and profitability.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAfter years of poor performance due to poor operating performance, we agree that starting to put these problems into the rearview mirror could bring RIVN back toward a full charge.\n\nHowever, Rivian is still well-within the early stages of this resurgence. With this, it may be too early and too risky, to dive into a position today.\n\nWhy Investors are Warming Back Up to Rivian Stock\n\nInterestingly enough, it wasn’t a monthly deliveries report or a quarterly earnings release that drove the “bottoming out” moment for RIVN. Rather, it was news of competitor and former backer Ford (NYSE:F) cutting prices on its electric trucks that sank shares to all-time lows.\n\nStoking fears about losing competitive ground, not to mention the impact of an EV truck price war on margins, it made sense that confidence in RIVN stock bottomed out at this point. However, since briefly tumbling to single-digit prices, Rivian has surged higher, as the market warms back up to this EV contender.\n\nThe company has continued to report disheartening news throughout this time frame. For instance, for the March quarter, Rivian reported worse-than-expected losses. The strongly suggested high cash burn remains an issue, with little sign of improvement thus far. More recently, though, as we mentioned above, the focus has shifted back to Rivian’s future potential.\n\nChalk this up to various developments. For one, Rivian just unveiled next-generation versions of its existing R1S SUV and R1T truck models. Rumors about the company partnering with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continue to swirl. Investors are also looking ahead to when Rivian’s lower-priced R2 models make their debut.\n\nThe Risk of Buying Too Early\n\nAgain, recent upward moves with Rivian stock have been slow and steady. It’s not as if shares have aggressively rebounded, and will go parabolic in the near-future. Investors may be interested in locking down a position ahead of a further recovery for this former hot stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nStill, much suggests that RIVN will retreat once again, irrespective of whether a recovery ultimately continues or not. The next gen unveiling and Apple rumors may pique investor interest, but it’s the last catalyst mentioned that stands to most materially improve Rivian’s fiscal performance.\n\nThe launch of lower-priced R2 SUV and truck models could lead to significantly higher sales, and a path to consistent profitability. However, these models aren’t set to launch until the first half of 2026.\n\nIn the meantime, high cash burn will continue. Prior third-party forecasts have called for cash burn totaling $4.6 billion this year.\n\nEven if Rivian’s has the cash to absorb these losses, and billions more to boot, what remains in the war chest at year’s end may not be enough to cover billions in additional cash burn during 2025.\n\nDespite management’s touting of cost-saving measures, expect another dilutive capital raise.\n\nThe Verdict: ‘Watch and Wait’ for Now\n\nMake no mistake. Rivian isn’t at risk of ending up in a downward spiral like some other high-profile EV upstarts. Unlike, say, Lucid Group (NASDAQ:LCID), there’s still the potential for this contender to go the distance.\n\nBut given the long time line to Rivian’s liftoff moment, as well as the strong chances of further shareholder dilution, we remain cautious. Investor sentiment could shift back to bearish, before moving once again to bullish.\n\nThe opportunity to enter a long-term position at single-digit prices could reemerge at some point down the road. Now, that’s not to say RIVN is a no-brainer buy if it retests its lows. Assessing the situation at that time will be key.\n\nHowever, with regards to whether you should buy Rivian stock now, our verdict is that “watch and wait” is instead your best move.\n\nRivian stock earns a D rating in Portfolio Grader.\n\nOn the date of publication, neither Louis Navellier nor the InvestorPlace Research Staff member primarily responsible for this article held (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.\n\nMore From InvestorPlace\n\nThe #1 AI Investment Might Be This Company You’ve Never Heard Of Musk’s “Project Omega” May Be Set to Mint New Millionaires.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- It’s the moment of truth for Apple Inc.’s artificial intelligence plans — and for the $471 billion rally that has rescued the stock from the doldrums.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Macron and Scholz Get Trounced by Far Right in EU Elections Putin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine Scholz’s SPD Suffers Record Rout in Germany’s EU Vote Gantz Quits Israel Government After PM Fails to Meet Demands\n\nAI is expected to be a central focus of the company’s annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which begins Monday, and optimism has been steadily growing. Investors are hoping new AI features will be enticing enough for consumers to pay up for the next generation of iPhones, countering the perception Apple has few catalysts for growth.\n\nThe conference is “the most important event for Apple in over a decade,” according to Wedbush. Such high expectations could invite disappointment if the event doesn’t deliver, especially as the stock trades at an elevated multiple.\n\n“If Apple doesn’t come out with compelling reasons to upgrade, that’s a real problem,” said Greg Martin, co-founder of Rainmaker Securities. “If the event is uninspiring, I think the stock will be stagnant for a while.” At the same time, he added, a positive event would be a catalyst.\n\nThe stock has soared almost 20% off an April low, returning above a $3 trillion market valuation and pulling within 1% of a record close hit last year. While some of the rally reflects a positive earnings report from early May, where Apple announced the largest buyback in US history, improving sentiment about AI has also been central to the bull case.\n\nDespite the recent gains, Apple’s year-to-date rise of 2.3% is paltry compared with the Nasdaq 100 Index’s 13% advance. Stocks with more concrete AI exposure — including Microsoft Corp, Amazon.com Inc., Alphabet Inc., and Meta Platforms Inc. — have all posted double-digit gains. AI-focused chipmaker Nvidia Corp has soared 144%, briefly overtaking Apple in size.\n\nThe underperformance reflects how growth at Apple has lagged well behind megacap peers. Revenue fell 4.3% in Apple’s fiscal second quarter, the fifth contraction in the past six quarters. Despite that, Apple trades at 28 times estimated earnings, a sizable premium to its 10-year average of 19.\n\nThe multiple and lack of growth is why fewer than two-thirds of the analysts tracked by Bloomberg recommend buying the stock, a low ratio among megacaps.\n\nGiven that backdrop, the conference comes at a pivotal time. Investors are hoping new AI features will catalyze an iPhone upgrade cycle, reinvigorating growth in Apple’s most important product line while also supporting its high-margin services business.\n\nStory continues\n\nBloomberg News has reported that Apple will announce an agreement with OpenAI at the conference, wherein it will integrate the company’s AI model into the iPhone’s operating system. This is likely to mean AI-supported features for the company’s native apps, including Siri, photos, music, and iMessage.\n\nHow much that moves the needle remains to be seen. Bernstein’s Stacy Rasgon writes that AI functionality on the iPhone “is likely to be useful and pervasive, but not necessarily revolutionary relative to what Google (and Samsung) have offered in their AI phones.”\n\nAnalysts are expecting limited short-term impact. The consensus for Apple’s full-year net earnings have barely budged over the past quarter, while the view for revenue is down 0.5% over that period. Estimates for 2025 revenue have also come down over the past three months.\n\n“The event looks at least somewhat built into the stock, and Apple therefore needs to really come up with something new for the momentum to continue,” said Rick Bensignor, chief executive officer of Bensignor Investment Strategies and a former Morgan Stanley strategist.\n\nTech Chart of the Day\n\nJust over 60% of Nasdaq 100 Index components are above their 200-day moving average, the fewest since November and down from a peak of nearly 90% in January. The trend reflects how even though the tech-heavy index has performed well this year, most of the advance has come from its biggest components. While the Nasdaq 100 is up 13% this year, an equal-weighted version of the index is up just 3.4%.\n\nTop Tech Stories\n\nNvidia Corp.’s Jensen Huang has steadily climbed the ranks of the world’s wealthiest as the market value of his computer-chip maker touches $3 trillion. Meta Platforms Inc. and other social media companies won the dismissal of novel claims in hundreds of lawsuits brought by school districts seeking to recover costs for addressing the negative impacts of students’ social media use. Oracle Corp.’s most high-profile medical records customer, the US Department of Veterans Affairs, says the company’s software is failing at its main job of helping improve patient care, according to previously unpublished internal survey data. Elon Musk and his companies are embroiled in dozens of lawsuits, ranging from fatal crashes blamed on Tesla Inc.’s Autopilot system to civil rights complaints over the treatment of employees. Microsoft Corp. says a key new feature in an upcoming line of artificial intelligence-branded PCs will be shipped in the “off” position after cybersecurity experts said the tool created an alluring target for hackers.\n\nEarnings Due Monday\n\nPostmarket\n\nYext Inc.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "title": "Meet Apple's New $186 Billion Market Opportunity",
        "content": "Some might think Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) best days are behind it. Revenue growth has ground to a halt. The company's biggest new product in years, its Vision Pro mixed reality headset, might be a commercial flop. Apple's reign as the largest company in the world based on market cap has ended. It's now in third place behind Microsoft and Nvidia.\n\nDon't give up on Apple just yet, though. Anytime people have done so in the past, the company has reinvented itself and gone on to achieve tremendous success. Apple just might do it again. And the company could have a clear path to making it happen. Meet Apple's new $186 billion market opportunity.\n\nLiving on the edge\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) could be bigger than the internet. That's not just my opinion. Alphabet CEO Sundar Pichai and Altimeter Capital CEO Brad Gerstner think so. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang believes that one specific type of AI -- generative AI -- will be bigger than the internet all by itself.\n\nSo far, AI development has been primarily done in the cloud. That's why Nvidia's data center revenue soared 427% year over year in the first quarter of 2024 and now makes up nearly 87% of the company's total revenue.\n\nBut this story could soon change as edge AI gains momentum. Edge AI is the deployment of AI on devices near where data is created (on the \"edge\"). There are several advantages of edge AI compared to AI on the cloud, including lower latency (delays in data transfer) and bandwidth requirements along with increased privacy.\n\nHow big could the edge AI market be? Estimates vary, but there's a consensus that the market will grow rapidly. Market researcher Market.us predicts the edge AI market will expand by a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 25.9% to $143.6 billion by 2032. Fortune Business Insights projects a CAGR of 27.5% with the edge AI market topping $186 billion by 2032.\n\nWhy Apple could be the leader in edge AI\n\nMorgan Stanley wrote in a 2023 report that it believes \"Apple will emerge as one of the key winners\" in the edge AI market. I wholeheartedly agree with that assessment.\n\nEdge AI must run on devices. Apple has over 2.2 billion devices in active use throughout the world. This number largely consists of iPhones, but the company also has other devices, including computers and wearables.\n\nImportantly, Apple already has chips powerful enough to run AI apps on its devices. The company's next-generation iPhone chip on the way will almost certainly provide even better AI performance.\n\nApple has the ecosystem to foster edge AI software development by other companies. It also has deep pockets to fund internal R&D and acquisitions to advance edge AI technology going forward.\n\nStory continues\n\nSome might be excited by Apple's AI announcements at its Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) this week. Others could be disappointed. Either way, any WWDC revelations are only the beginning. Look for Apple to continue to launch edge AI functionality over the coming years.\n\nDoes this opportunity make Apple stock a no-brainer buy?\n\nEven for a company that generates as much revenue as Apple does, the edge AI market opportunity is big enough to move the needle significantly. But does this opportunity make Apple stock a no-brainer buy? Not necessarily.\n\nApple could squander its opportunity. It's possible that edge AI won't be as impactful as many expect. I don't expect either to happen, though. However, Apple won't be a no-brainer buy until there's sufficient reason to believe the company will return to strong growth. We're not at that point yet, but we could be relatively soon.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Apple expected to enter AI race with ambitions to overtake the early leaders",
        "content": "Apple's annual World Wide Developers Conference on Monday is expected to herald the company's move into generative artificial intelligence, marking its late arrival to a technological frontier that's expected to be as revolutionary as the invention of the iPhone.\n\nThe widely anticipated display of AI to be embedded in the iPhone and other Apple products will be the marquee moment at an event that traditionally previews the next version of software that powers the company's hardware lineup.\n\nAnd Apple's next generation of software is expected to be packed with an array of AI features likely to make its often-bumbling virtual assistant Siri smarter, and make photos, music, texting — and possibly even creating emojis on the fly — a more productive and entertaining experience.\n\nTrue to its secretive nature, Apple hasn't provided any advance details about Monday's event being held at the company's Cupertino, California, headquarters.\n\nBut CEO Tim Cook has dropped strong hints during the first few months of this that Apple is poised to reveal its grand plans to enter a space that has been fueling an industry boom during the past 18 months.\n\nAI mania is the main reason that Nvidia, the dominant maker of the chips underlying the technology, has seen its market value rocket from about $300 billion at the end of 2022 to about $3 trillion. The meteoric ride allowed Nvidia to briefly surpass Apple last week as the second most valuable company in the U.S. Microsoft earlier this year also eclipsed the iPhone maker on the strength of its so-far successful push into AI.\n\nBut analysts have been have been getting increasingly worried that Apple may be falling too far behind in the rapidly changing AI space, a concern that has been compounded by an uncharacteristically extended slump in the company's sales. Both Google and Samsung already have released smartphone models touting AI features as their main attractions.\n\nThat's why analysts such as Dan Ives of Wedbush Securities view Monday's conference as a potential springboard that catapults Apple into another robust phase of growth. Ives believes infusing more AI into the iPhone, iPad and Mac computer will translate into an additional $450 billon to $600 billion in market value for Apple.\n\nMonday's conference “represents the most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center,” Ives wrote in a research note.\n\nApple definitely could use the boost that AI may be able to provide, particularly for its 13-year-old assistant Siri, which Forrester Research Dipanjan Chatterjee now calls an “oddly unhelpful helper.”\n\nStory continues\n\nMeanwhile, OpenAI's ChatGPT is getting increasingly conversational — so much so that it recently sparked accusations of intentionally copying a piece of AI software voiced by Scarlett Johansson — and Google last month previewed an AI “agent” dubbed Astra that can seemingly see and remember things.\n\nBesides using AI to spruce up Siri, Apple may also team up with OpenAI to bring some elements of ChatGPT to the iPhone, according to a wide range of unconfirmed reports leading up to Monday's conference.\n\nThis will be the second straight year that Apple has created a stir at its developers conference by using it to usher in its entrance into a trendy form of technology that other companies already had been making inroads.\n\nLast year, Apple provided an early look at its mixed-reality headset, the Vision Pro, which wasn't released until early this year carrying a $3,500 price tag that has been a major impediment to gaining much traction. Nevertheless, Apple's push into mixed reality, tweaked with a twist that it bills as “spatial computing,” has raised hopes that what is currently a niche technology will turn into a huge market.\n\nPart of the optimism stems from Apple's history of releasing technology later than others and then using sleek designs and services combined with slick marketing campaigns to overcome its tardy start to unleash new trends.\n\n“Apple’s early reticence toward AI was entirely on brand,” Forrester's Chatterjee wrote in a preview of the developers conference. “The company has always been famously obsessed with what its offerings did for its customers rather than how it did it.”\n\nBringing more AI into the iPhone, in particular, will likely raise privacy issues — a topic where Apple has gone to great lengths to assure its loyal customer base that it can be trusted not to peer too deeply into their personal lives.\n\nOne way Apple could reassure consumers that the iPhone won't be used to spy on them is to leverage its own chip technology so most AI-powered features are handled on the device itself instead of remote data centers, often called “the cloud.” Going that route also would help protect Apple's profit margins because AI technology through the cloud is far more expensive than when it is run solely on a device.\n\nView comments",

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc.’s developers conference on Monday will show whether the iPhone maker can become a major player in the burgeoning field of artificial intelligence, marking a critical moment for a company forced to adapt to a new era.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nRussia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Macron and Scholz Get Trounced by Far Right in EU Elections Putin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine Scholz’s SPD Suffers Record Rout in Germany’s EU Vote There’s Still a Way to Snag a 3% Mortgage Rate\n\nThough Apple was an early pioneer in AI, which it has used in photo processing, health features and the Siri digital assistant, it’s now seen as a laggard — especially since ChatGPT and other cutting-edge technology hit the scene in the past two years.\n\nAgainst that backdrop, Apple promises to demonstrate its AI prowess during a keynote address at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference, which starts at 10 a.m. California time. The company will lay out a suite of features that it calls Apple Intelligence, people familiar with the matter have said.\n\nWhile Apple launched Siri in 2011, its voice technology was quickly overtaken by Alexa from Amazon.com Inc and Alphabet Inc.’s Google Assistant. AI took another leap with OpenAI’s ChatGPT at the end of 2022 and rival services from Google, Microsoft Corp., Meta Platforms Inc. and others during 2023.\n\nAdding to the pressure: Samsung Electronics Co. — Apple’s biggest smartphone rival — integrated Google AI features into its devices earlier this year.\n\nThe shift to artificial intelligence promises to be a big opportunity for Apple if it can hone its technology and catch up with rivals. AI-based operating systems will change how people gather information, create and edit content, and navigate their devices.\n\nAt the event, Apple will show how it’s weaving AI features into its next software updates: iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15. The company is also planning a more powerful version of Siri.\n\nApple Intelligence will focus on providing more information to users when they need it. That involves summarizing notifications, text messages and emails; synthesizing meeting notes; transcribing voice memos; and even creating custom emojis. The software also will be able to sort through emails and classify them into categories.\n\nApple also has been working on its own large language models — the technology behind ChatGPT-style services — but it’s not far enough along in that area, people familiar with the matter have said. So it’s planning to announce a partnership with OpenAI that will supply Apple with a chatbot.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple has one major advantage as it pushes deeper into AI: a massive number of loyal consumers. That could help make the company a success in AI even without breaking ground in large language models, said Bernstein analyst Toni Sacconaghi.\n\n“It has a very powerful consumer installed base for which it can act as a channel — just like it has for search and the App Store, the two most lucrative parts of Apple’s business today, outside of iPhone,” he said.\n\nOne concern is whether the OpenAI deal means that fewer users will be using Google search on the iPhone. Apple generates billions of dollars per year through a revenue sharing agreement with Google. The terms of Apple’s deal with OpenAI, meanwhile, aren’t clear. And Apple is still negotiating a separate agreement with Google to eventually also add its Gemini technology as a chatbot option on the iPhone, Bloomberg has reported.\n\nIt’s likely that Apple will eventually want to offer its own chatbots and other generative AI, but having partners helps it navigate the artificial intelligence industry without taking on as many risks. OpenAI and Google have suffered some backlash from chatbots providing incorrect information.\n\nApple wants to avoid that, said Ruslan Salakhutdinov, a former director of AI research at the iPhone maker and a professor of computer science at Carnegie Mellon University.\n\n“They’ve always watched what the space is like and have long decided they don’t have to be first, but they have to get it right,” he said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI Is There Room for Common Ground on Congestion Pricing?

        "title": "Generative AI expected to dominate at ‘momentous’ Apple conference",
        "content": "Apple is expected to unveil a wide range of new generative artificial intelligence tools on Monday night, as it looks to rival Google, Microsoft and Samsung in embracing the emerging technology.\n\nAfter hinting at it for several months, and while many of their biggest rivals have rolled out a range of new generative AI tools, WWDC (Worldwide Developers’ Conference) is finally expected to be the moment Apple lays out its plans for using the technology.\n\nExperts say this will be a big moment for the tech sector as a whole, given the widespread use of Apple devices. How generative AI is embedded into the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch, Mac computers and other devices will have a substantial impact on the future of the emerging technology.\n\nApple’s investors will also be keen to see what the company has planned for what many believe will be the key innovation of this generation.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nExperts are predicting Apple’s AI plans to come in several layers.\n\nFirstly, that broad AI-powered updates will be made across core apps to help with basic, everyday tasks, for example new AI editing tools to help with photos and videos, better predictive text for messages and emails or quick, AI-generated summaries of webpages or longer emails.\n\nIn addition to this, there are reports that Apple will use the event to announce a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI, which will see the chatbot and virtual assistant integrated directly into Apple’s software across iPhone, iPad and Mac, to help with more detailed, complex tasks.\n\nDespite many of these features already being available on rival platforms, industry expert Ben Wood, the chief analyst at CCS Insight, said Apple is likely to use its “strength in storytelling” to make these updates appear “new”, rather than “just catching up with Samsung and others”.\n\n“We expect that most features showcased at WWDC will be things we’ve seen before with examples including a host of improvements to photo editing and optimisation, transcription and translation tools, deeper integration of AI into automatic responses to messages and chat tools, and improvements to a suite of apps including Apple Music, Fitness and Health to make them feel more personalised,” he said.\n\nStory continues\n\n“I think there will be a very slick demo showing how easy it is to edit a photo using generative AI to remove people from backgrounds or add missing elements.\n\n“Numerous Android smartphones already offer this, but if Apple does it, suddenly everyone will get excited.”\n\nMr Wood added that the rumoured deal with OpenAI over ChatGPT being built into Apple products could give the tech giant’s current voice assistant, Siri, a major boost – software the industry expert said currently “feels like talking to a “pre-schooler” in comparison with the latest generative AI chatbots.\n\n“I’ve been using the ChatGPT voice interface, and its understanding of questions and requests is the best I’ve experienced so far,” he said. There are reports that Apple will use the event to announce a deal with ChatGPT maker OpenAI (John Walton/PA)\n\n“If Apple has signed a deal to integrate GPT-4o with Siri, it could deliver a remarkable transformation in Siri’s performance — and emerge as arguably the biggest story from the event.”\n\nAlthough the integration of generative AI tools is expected to dominate the event, the US tech giant will also provide its traditional annual software updates to its suite of products, with the technology that powers the iPhone, iPad, Apple Watch and others all due to receive updated operating systems.\n\n“This feels like a momentous WWDC,” Mr Wood said.\n\n“At a time when AI is transcending the tech industry, Apple is arguably on the back foot for the first time in a while.\n\n“However, the company is no laggard and we expect it to come out fighting as it seeks to demonstrate how it can use AI to deliver meaningful improvements to its apps and services.”",

        "title": "Nvidia stock split: What's next for the stock and other AI plays",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) is joining its mega-cap tech peers, becoming the fourth Magnificent 7 stock to split since 2022.\n\nThe chip giant’s 10-for-1 stock split, which will start trading on Monday, follows significant price growth, with shares up 212% in the past year. That massive rally pushed Nvidia into the $3 trillion club, becoming just the third U.S. company ever to reach that milestone.\n\n“A stock split is a vote of confidence from management that the stock will hold its value, as the stock [price] typically increases,” S&P Dow Jones Indices senior analyst Howard Silverblatt said.\n\nWinthrop Capital chief investment officer Adam Coons expects the split to boost retail investor interest, but cautions that an influx of retail traders could trigger volatility for the stock.\n\n“They can be a little bit more quick and emotional with their buying and selling decisions, so that can lead to heightened volatility as you start to dilute the institutional buyers,” Coons told Yahoo Finance.\n\nEvercore ISI's Julian Emanuel sees increased volatility as an opportunity to buy Nvidia — a stock he views as a “generational opportunity” and this era's \"marquee\" technology stock.\n\n“While high profile splits have often fueled stock volatility — speculative buying and profit taking around the event — Thinning the trees within the forest post-split catalyzes the Buying Opportunity for the patient investor,” Emanuel wrote.\n\nHistorically, stock splits are typically bullish for the companies that enact them, with average returns one year later of 25% versus about 12% for the broad market, according to analysis from Bank of America.\n\nNvidia’s skyrocketing gains have driven the broader market to record highs. Its rally accounted for about a third of the S&P 500’s return since the start of the year, and more than a quarter of the S&P 500’s return in the month of May, according to Silverblatt.\n\nWall Street has gotten even more bullish on the stock since its earnings report on May 22. Last week, Bank of America’s Vivek Arya raised his price target to a Street high of $1,500.\n\n“We are at the start of what I think would be a decade-long conversion to accelerated computing … We think that the spending could be anywhere between $250 to $500 billion a year, and Nvidia is leading the charge,” Arya told Yahoo Finance.\n\nNvidia’s stock split not only signals management’s confidence in the chip giant, but enthusiasm and optimism about the broader AI industry's growth potential.\n\nAs Lam Research (LRCX) CFO Doug Bettinger explained to me at Bank of America’s Global Technology conference last week, we’re still “very, very early” in the AI investment cycle.\n\nStory continues\n\nThat next round of growth — or the second wave of AI — is expected to take hold as companies begin to integrate AI into their planning and enterprise spending.\n\n“More and more companies are adopting hybrid-cloud architectures, and with a focus on building modern applications, and starting their journey into enterprise AI,” Nutanix (NTNX) CEO Rajiv Ramaswami told me.\n\nFor investors looking to add to their portfolios, Arya likes Broadcom (AVGO), Marvell Technology (MRVL), Micron (MU), and Arm (ARM) as winners of AI’s continued wave. In a note to clients last month, Arya wrote that he sees increased requirements in computing, networking and memory as a “multi-year growth driver” for the group.\n\nSeana Smith is an anchor at Yahoo Finance.

        "title": "Wall Street praises Spotify price hikes — and notes other audio streamers should follow suit",
        "content": "Spotify (SPOT) shares have surged as Wall Street bulls continue to praise the company's outlook on the heels of fresh price hikes for its premium US subscription plans. The stock is up about 70% since the start of the year.\n\nThe upcoming price hikes, which begin in July and are between $1 and $3, depending on the plan, follow previous hikes of certain plans implemented last summer. Analysts say the move could mean more increases for other music streamers — much to the chagrin of consumers.\n\n\"Given the size of these Spotify increases (9% to 18%) and the frequency (second time in less than a year), we believe other [streamers] should follow suit,\" Morgan Stanley analyst Benjamin Swinburne wrote in a note published earlier this week. Still, competitors \"may not have the same pricing power as Spotify and may be more reluctant broadly.\"\n\nSpotify's family plan will rise to $19.99 per month from $16.99. Duo plans, which allow two users to share an account, will increase by $2 to $16.99. Spotify Premium subscriptions will now cost $11.99 a month, an increase of $1.\n\nSwinburne, who boasts a $370 price target and Overweight rating on shares, said the upcoming hikes \"are larger and earlier than forecasted.\" This suggests potential upside to average revenue per user and revenue growth in the second half of the year.\n\n\"We believe Spotify's strong engagement levels and industry low churn should allow it to execute these increases and still deliver on net adds expectations,\" he said.\n\nTo compare, Apple Music's (AAPL) individual plan costs $10.99 a month, while its family plan sits at $16.99. It's only raised prices once, in October 2022. Meanwhile, YouTube Music (GOOGL, GOOG) boasts the same costs for its respective plans, although it's also an included option for customers who subscribe to YouTube Premium, which carries a monthly cost of $13.99.\n\nSimilarly, Amazon Music (AMZN) is free with a $14.99 Prime membership but Prime members who want access to the Amazon Music Unlimited plan will have to pay an additional $9.99 a month. The individual plan costs $10.99 for non-Prime members, while the monthly family plan clocks in at $14.99.\n\nSpotify 'has pricing power'\n\nSpotify turned a profit in the first quarter and beat on most of its key metrics. It also guided to higher revenue and operating income for the current quarter.\n\nOver the past year, Spotify has committed to price increases in addition to multiple rounds of layoffs and other initiatives to improve profitability. The company said it would be more intentional about future investments after spending billions on its push into the crowded podcast market.\n\nStory continues\n\nDuring the company's first quarter earnings call in April, Spotify CEO Daniel Ek hinted at plans to raise prices again after last year's hikes \"had minimal impacts on growth.\" He also confirmed the platform will offer various subscription tiers to attract as many users as possible, including a music-only tier and an audiobook-only tier.\n\n\"The more value we create, the more ability we will have to then capture some of that value by price increases,\" Ek said at the time. The Spotify logo hangs on the facade of the New York Stock Exchange with American and Swiss flags as the company lists its stock with a direct listing in New York, April 3, 2018. (REUTERS/Lucas Jackson) (REUTERS / Reuters)\n\nJPMorgan analyst Doug Anmuth, who reiterated his Overweight rating on shares and boosted his price target to $375 from $365, said he believes the price increases will result in \"favorable unit economics for Spotify.\"\n\n\"Spotify cited churn in-line with expectations & better than expected gross adds following 2023 price increases, suggesting the company has pricing power,\" Anmuth wrote on Monday. \"Spotify’s deep data & strong content curation, personalization, discovery, & ubiquity are best-in-class & hard to replicate, making it unappealing for consumers to switch platforms.\"\n\nAccording to market research firm Antenna, fewer than 1.5% of Spotify subscribers canceled their subscription plans in April. Its average churn rate has hovered around 2% since the start of the year.\n\n\"Looking ahead, we expect a more normalized cadence of price increases across the music streaming industry,\" Anmuth said. \"We believe that Spotify maintains longterm pricing power given the company’s reach (615M monthly active users, 239M Premium Subscribers), leading market share, & ability to improve & expand its product offering.\"\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

The new policy starts with a payout of $0.20 per share, issued on June 17 to holders of Class A (GOOGL voting shares), Class B (insiders only, 10 votes each), and Class C (GOOG shares without voting powers) shares.\n\nThe policy will continue on a quarterly schedule, and Alphabet seems likely to raise the payouts over time.\n\n\"We view the introduction of the dividend as further strengthening our overall capital return program,\" CFO Ruth Porat said on the earnings call.\n\nAlphabet's dividend by the numbers\n\nThe annual dividend yield works out to roughly 0.4% for now. With a total of 12.4 billion shares outstanding, the cash payouts work out to a substantial $9.9 billion in the first year. Moreover, Alphabet added $70 billion to its stock buybacks program. That's up from $62.2 billion of buybacks in 2023, culled from $69.5 billion of free cash flow.\n\nThe balance between dividend payouts and share buybacks will probably shift over time. Stock repurchasing tends to consume most of Alphabet's free cash flow, and the Google parent will need to make room for the dividend budget: GOOGL Stock Buybacks (TTM) Chart\n\nSo the company has added another financial mechanism to its tool belt, stuffing cash profits directly into shareholder wallets in a new way. It's a sign of experience and maturity. It was stunning when Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) took this step in 2003, followed by Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) return to quarterly payouts in 2012. Now, the two tech giants are commonly seen as robust income investments.\n\nAnd now it's Alphabet's turn to join this club of megacap tech titans with active dividend programs.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Alphabet right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Alphabet, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Alphabet wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Big Tech Is Driving the S&amp;P Rally. The Rest Have to Step Up Soon",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- The unceasing growth of Big Tech has been an article of faith for investors since the latest stock market rally began in October 2022.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPutin Is Running Out of Time to Achieve Breakthrough in Ukraine There’s Still a Way to Snag a 3% Mortgage Rate Russia Is Sending Young Africans to Die in Its War Against Ukraine Philippines Rejects ‘Absurd’ Beijing Demand Over South China Sea Saudis Said to Hand About 60% of Aramco Offer to Foreigners\n\nBut with an uninspiring earnings outlook for the rest of 2024, other corners of the market will likely be needed if share prices are to keep soaring.\n\n“To have a similar return for the market in the second half, you’d need to see broader participation,” said Keith Lerner, co-chief investment officer and chief market strategist at Truist Advisory Services.\n\nThat looks like it may happen. While Big Tech’s profit growth is expected to slow dramatically from here, industries like materials and health care are expected to see roughly 25% profit growth by the fourth quarter after posting contractions of 20% or more in the first quarter.\n\n“I think those sectors are starting to look pretty interesting, and I’m talking about energy, materials, consumer discretionary, industrials, financials,” said Ohsung Kwon, equity and quantitative strategist at Bank of America. “I think all those cyclical sectors are going to do better in the second half of the year.”\n\nThat rotation already appears to be underway. At BofA, clients pulled almost $2.2 billion from tech stocks during the week ended May 31, the second-most in the bank’s data going back to 2008. The biggest client inflows went to the consumer discretionary sector, which is up 1.9% this year, making it the second worst performer in the S&P 500.\n\n“Discretionary is traditionally a huge driver of S&P 500 earnings and a place that typically picks up the slack,” said Michael Casper, equity strategist at Bloomberg Intelligence.\n\nCan’t Quit Tech\n\nNone of this is to say investors will, or should, give up on Big Tech. The S&P 500 is up 12% this year, and its five biggest stocks — Microsoft Corp., Apple Inc., Nvidia Corp., Alphabet Inc. and Amazon.com Inc. — are responsible for more than half of that gain with markets captivated by the artificial intelligence boom.\n\nIn the process, those five companies have added a combined $2.9 trillion in market value in 2024. That’s helped make information technology by far the biggest sector in the S&P 500, with a 31% weighting. The next closest groups are financials and health care at around 12%.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhat’s more, it’s not like technology companies are done growing. It’s just that the pace of their profit expansion is slowing. After three consecutive quarters of more than 44% earnings growth, the S&P’s five biggest companies are expected to see that figure fall to 29% in the second quarter before settling into the teens in the second half of the year, according to data compiled by BI.\n\n“We still think Big Tech will likely outperform, but at a more moderate level,” Lerner said. “Investors will continue to stick with these companies, which are high quality, have strong cash flow, a lot of cash on the balance sheet.”\n\nIn many ways, the companies are suffering from their past success, as their strong 2023 results make for challenging comparisons to 2024. But the businesses are still increasing profits and generating healthy margins after aggressive cost-cutting efforts.\n\n‘Lofty Expectations’\n\n“The onus is on Big Tech to live up to lofty expectations,” said Adam Sarhan, founder of 50 Park Investments. “Or else the stock market will be forced to recalibrate and sell off, particularly if profit growth from other sectors doesn’t improve from here.”\n\nPart of the challenge for tech investors is the stocks are already quite expensive. Nvidia is priced at 40 times profits projected over the next 12 months, compared with 21 times for the S&P 500. Microsoft is at 33 times, and Apple is at 29 times. Even Alphabet, which is relatively cheaper at 21 times, is trading above its average over the past 10 years.\n\n“As those non-tech sectors start to grow earnings, the premium that investors were paying for tech should come down on a relative basis compared to other sectors,” BofA’s Kwon said.\n\nThere’s also an emerging asymmetry in the directions of Big Tech stocks as the companies’ earnings outlooks diverge.\n\nWith investors focused on AI, Nvidia has soared ahead of the pack, climbing 144% this year and continuing as the best performer in the S&P 500. Facebook-parent Meta Platforms has added 39%, while Google-parent Alphabet has climbed 25% and Amazon has gained 21%. Microsoft, on the other hand, hasn’t really kept up, posting a relatively meager 13% rise. And then there’s struggling Apple, which spent most of the year in the red and is up just 2.3% in 2024.\n\n“The fundamental business lines of each of these companies aren’t moving in the same direction anymore like during the recovery from the pandemic, so that’s also causing a profit cool down,” BI’s Casper said. “The Magnificent Seven stocks no longer move as one ubiquitous block, and that hurts its earnings potential as a cohort because the trade has now broken up.”\n\nPicking Sectors\n\nCounting on a lift from the rest of the market carries its own risks, however. For example, health care margins are shaky despite the enthusiasm for anti-obesity drugs because the group is still grappling with charges from big drug companies. Meanwhile, the consumer discretionary sector’s earnings growth is being driven by just a handful of companies, like Amazon and home-improvement retailer Home Depot Inc.\n\nThat means more sectors beyond those will need to post profit growth, particularly consumer discretionary and those closely tied to the health of the economy: industrials and financials, Casper said. However there are risks embedded in each of these groups.\n\n“Consensus earnings forecasts are pretty poor for most retailers not named Amazon,” he said. “Financials and industrials may pick up their pace, though regional banks still face a hangover from (the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank).”\n\nIn the end, the stock market’s success in 2024 still may come down to Big Tech, directly or indirectly. With AI expected to have a transformational impact on so many industries, technological development will likely spill over into other parts of the economy, lifting those shares along the way.\n\n“As long as Big Tech companies continue to deliver on their profit outlooks, that bodes well for the economy,” 50 Park’s Sarhan said. “Which will help power the stock rally further because there are other industries outside of technology that will benefit from AI.”\n\n--With assistance from Alexandra Semenova.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nLegacy Airlines Are Thriving With Ultracheap Fares, Crushing Budget Carriers Sam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "title": "Inflation reading and a Fed meeting: What to know this week",
        "content": "Stocks closed another week near record highs as the latest jobs report showed a US labor market that's cooling, but not at a pace that economists find concerning.\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) was up about 2.3%, and the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose roughly 1.3%. The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was up about 0.3%.\n\nNext week's highlights include the June Federal Reserve meeting and a key inflation reading on Wednesday. The first reading of consumer sentiment for June is also expected on Friday.\n\nIn corporate news, Big Tech will kick off the week with Nvidia's (NVDA) 10-for-1 stock split and Apple's (AAPL) Worldwide Developer's Conference both set for Monday. A vote on Tesla (TSLA) CEO Elon Musk's $56 billion pay package is expected on Thursday.\n\nMeanwhile, chaotic moves in GameStop stock (GME) have continued to garner investor attention as the return of Keith Gill, a popular leader of the 2021 meme stock frenzy, has reignited interest.\n\nThe Fed, inflation, and the path for interest rates\n\nFriday's May jobs report showed more job additions than expected, adding fuel to a common narrative from Federal Reserve officials that the labor market remains on solid enough footing to keep interest rates at their current restrictive levels. And to economists, the latest data just emphasizes that the Fed needs to see inflation decline further before cutting rates.\n\n\"Policymakers will need to see a few slower inflation reports over the summer in order to start cutting rates by the fall,\" Wells Fargo senior economist Sarah House wrote in a research note on Friday.\n\nThe next update on inflation is expected on Wednesday morning with the release of the May Consumer Price Index (CPI). Wall Street expects an annual gain of 3.4% for headline CPI, which includes the price of food and energy, unchanged from April. Prices are set to rise 0.1% on a month-over-month basis, down from 0.3% in April.\n\nOn a \"core\" basis, which strips out the volatile food and energy prices, inflation is expected to have risen 3.5% year over year, a slowdown from the 3.6% increase seen in April. Monthly core price increases are expected to clock in at 0.3%, unchanged from the prior month.\n\nThe release will come just hours before the Fed's latest policy decision, where markets largely expect the central bank to keep rates unchanged. This pushes the main focus to the Fed's latest Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) — including its \"dot plot,\" which maps out policymakers' expectations for where interest rates could be headed in the future — as well as commentary from Fed Chair Jerome Powell.\n\nStory continues\n\nJPMorgan chief US economist Michael Feroli expects the Fed to project a median of two interest rate cuts this year in its dot plot, down from three in March. As far as Powell's commentary is concerned, Feroli believes Powell's presser will be perceived \"dovish.\"\n\n\"At the press conference, we expect Chair Powell will express confidence that the economy is still on the right path and that the FOMC can be patient in gaining confidence that inflation is heading toward two percent,\" Feroli wrote in a note to clients on Friday.\n\nFewer cuts, no problem\n\nPrior to Friday's jobs report, the market was pricing in two rate cuts this year. After the release, that number teetered between one and two, per Bloomberg data.\n\nNotably, though, that shift and a 15-basis-point jump in the 10-year Treasury yield (^TNX) to 4.43% did little to deter investor optimism as the S&P 500 closed near a record high on Friday.\n\nNew York Life Investments economist and chief market strategist Lauren Goodwin told Yahoo Finance this could be because the stronger-than-expected jobs report is good news for the economy, and \"markets have been very focused on growth.\"\n\nShe added that, given the solid earnings backdrop expected for the rest of this year and a solid growth trajectory for the economy, markets can take the Fed repricing \"in stride.\" Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell listens at a meeting of the Financial Stability Oversight Council at the Treasury Department on May 10, 2024, in Washington, D.C. (Kent Nishimura/Getty Images) (Kent Nishimura via Getty Images)\n\nApple's WWDC\n\nApple's Worldwide Developers Conference is set to kick off on Monday, with investors expecting more details to be released on the tech giant's push into generative AI.\n\nAfter a rocky start to the year, the stock has rallied more than 7% over the past month leading into the event and recently turned positive for the year.\n\nYahoo Finance's Dan Howley has a full preview of the event.\n\nMore Nvidia stock\n\nNvidia shares are set to begin trading on Monday on a new 10-for-1 split basis, revising the stock price from its Friday close of $1,208.88 to $120.88. The split means that owners of Nvidia common stock as of the close of market on Thursday received 10 shares for each share they held. For example, if a shareholder owned four shares of Nvidia as of Thursday, they'll now own 40 shares post-split.\n\nTypically, stock splits are viewed by investors as a sign of strength, and consequently, companies that split their stock typically outperform the S&P 500 in the year following their announcement.\n\nOn average, stocks rise 25% in the 12 months following the announcement of their split compared to an average return of 12% from the S&P 500 in the same time frame, per analysis from Bank of America. This has been true \"across market regimes,\" BofA investment and ETF strategist Jared Woodard wrote in a note to clients.\n\nNotably, the trend includes the time period from 2000 to 2009, amid the unwinding of the tech bubble. Since Nvidia announced its split on May 22, shares are up about 27%.\n\nMusk's money\n\nTesla's annual shareholder meeting is slated for after the market close on Thursday, and the most pressing issue will be the shareholder vote on a potential $56 billion pay package for CEO Elon Musk.\n\nMorgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas said he's advised investors to pay close attention to the vote, as it will have \"significance to the long-term strategic direction of the company.\"\n\nHe added, \"While impossible to predict the outcome, we expect the event could potentially drive material volatility in TSLA shares.\"\n\nIn a survey of 109 investors, Morgan Stanley found most investors feel that approving Musk's pay package would send Tesla shares higher, while a vote not to approve would weigh on the stock. Entering the meeting, Tesla shares are down nearly 30% this year.\n\nWeekly calendar\n\nMonday\n\nEconomic data: New York Fed one-year inflation expectations, May (3.26% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nTuesday\n\nEconomic data: NFIB Small Business Optimism, May (89.5 expected, 89.7 previously)\n\nEarnings: Academy Sports and Outdoors (ASO), Casey's (CASY), Oracle (ORCL)\n\nWednesday\n\nEconomic data: Consumer Price Index, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.3% previously); Core CPI, month-over-month, May (+0.3% expected, +0.3% previously); CPI, year-over-year, May (+3.4% expected, +3.4% previously); Core CPI, year-over-year, May (+3.5% expected, +3.6% previously); Real average hourly earnings, year-over-year, May (+0.5% previously); MBA Mortgage Applications, week ending June 7 (-5.2% previously); FOMC rate decision (no change to range of 5.25% to 5.5% expected)\n\nEarnings: Broadcom (AVGO), Dave & Buster's (PLAY), Vera Bradley (VRA)\n\nThursday\n\nEconomic data: Initial jobless claims, week ending June 8 (223,000 expected, 229,000 previously); Producer Price Index, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.5% previously); PPI, year-over-year, May (+2.5% expected, 2.2% previously);\n\nEarnings: Adobe (ADBE), Lovesac (LOVE), RH (RH), Signet Jewelers (SIG)\n\nFriday\n\nEconomic data: University of Michigan consumer sentiment, June preliminary (72.8 expected, 69.1 prior) Import prices, month-over-month, May (+0.1% expected, +0.9% previously); Export prices, month-over-month, May (+0.2% expected, +0.5% previously)\n\nEarnings: No notable earnings.\n\nJosh Schafer is a reporter for Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "Investing.com -- Here are the biggest analyst moves in the area of artificial intelligence (AI) for this week.\n\nInvestingPro subscribers always get first dibs on market-moving AI analyst comments. Upgrade today!\n\nEvercore: Nvidia stock split could be a catalyst for volatility\n\nNvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock will begin trading on Monday on a split-adjusted basis, and according to Evercore analysts, the 10-for-1 split could act as a potential catalyst for increased market volatility.\n\nFollowing Nvidia’s earnings report on May 22, which included the announcement of the stock split effective June 10, Nvidia shares surged by 20.9% over four sessions while the S&P 500 index dropped by 0.75%. Evercore’s team said this divergence in performance between the pair had \"no precedent whatsoever.\"\n\nThe investment firm pointed out that similar past events also resulted in notable momentum shifts and higher volatility. One such “extreme” episode happened on August 31, 2020, amid Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Tesla’s stock splits, when a similarly strong Nasdaq 100-led market rally. Analysts said the momentum shifts around the split-effective dates were substantial.\n\n“The result in late 2020 was increased downside, market volatility, and a rotation of leadership from NDX/Growth to Small Cap stocks,” they wrote.\n\nNow, with the potential for Nvidia’s June 10 split to “shift the narrative” along with other catalysts such as new jobs report, CPI and FOMC data, and the Trump sentencing, Evercore advised investors to brace for higher volatility.\n\nBank of America hikes ASML stock price target to a Street high\n\nBank of America analysts on Thursday raised their price target on ASML (NASDAQ:ASML) to a new Wall Street high of €1,302, saying they are growing more confident that the European semiconductor giant can achieve €40 billion in revenue by 2025.\n\nASML, which is also a Top Pick at BofA, was described as a \"critical enabler\" of the AI infrastructure buildout.\n\nBofA increased its calendar year 2025 and 2026 revenue and EPS estimates for ASML by around 6% to 9%, reflecting \"higher confidence in higher demand for EUV tools as well as higher GM.\"\n\n\"Our new CY25/26E revenue estimates are 10-7% above css while our EPS ests are 15-9% above css,\" BofA analysts wrote.\n\n\"ASML remains our top pick in EU Semicaps,” they added.\n\nBofA acknowledged concerns about foundry orders through year-end but believes that investment from leading hyperscalers and enterprise customers in AI infrastructure signals a clear need for significant capacity additions at the leading edge.\n\nStory continues\n\nArgus upgrades HPE to Buy on growing opportunity in AI space\n\nAnalysts at Argus Research upped their rating on HP (NYSE:HPQ) Enterprise stock from Hold to Buy, setting a price target of $26.\n\nThe investment firm cited the company's strong positioning and growing opportunity in the AI space as key factors for the upgrade.\n\nHewlett Packard Enterprise (NYSE:HPE), an edge-to-cloud solutions provider, exceeded consensus revenue and non-GAAP earnings per share (EPS) estimates for fiscal Q1 2024 and offered positive forward guidance.\n\nArgus analysts said HPE continues to generate strong revenue from AI servers, and its overall compute business is now showing signs of recovery. Cumulative AI systems and services orders totaled $4.6 billion as of mid-year fiscal 2024.\n\n“Although HPE continues to anticipate a low double-digit year over year decline in FY24 earnings, the company expects to grow revenue and, in our view, is positioned for sales and profit growth ahead,” they wrote.\n\nDeutsche Bank lifts Adobe price target despite underwhelming GenAI monetization\n\nAlso this week, design software maker Adobe (NASDAQ:ADBE) received a vote of confidence among Deustche Bank analysts, who reiterated their Buy rating on the stock and hiked the price target to $650.\n\nThey note that Adobe is heading into its Q2 earnings on June 13th, with the stock currently under pressure due to competitive concerns and underwhelming near-term generative AI (genAI) monetization.\n\n“We expect some DM NNARR [Developed Markets Net New Annual Recurring Revenue] outperformance, with F2Q estimates currently subseasonal, though have less conviction around the magnitude of upside given pricing noise and lack of Generative Credit monetization,” the bank’s analysts said.\n\n“We expect investors will key in on commentary around ex-pricing NNARR growth to get a sense of underlying momentum given y/y net pricing headwinds remain in F2Q,” they added.\n\nDeutsche also pointed out early positive momentum in Express for Enterprise and the strong early growth in monthly active users (MAUs) for the recently released Express mobile app with Firefly, which supports the expansion of Adobe's top-of-funnel efforts.\n\nDespite this, the bank does not expect significant contributions from generative credit packs until more consumption-heavy generative models, such as 3-D, Video, and Animation, become widely available.\n\nBofA: Semiconductor industry set for multi-year growth as AI boom marches on\n\nBank of America is predicting a multi-year boom for the semiconductor industry, fueled by surging demand for AI. Observations from Computex, a tech trade event, pointed to a global push towards AI across various sectors, BofA analysts noted.\n\n\"We see the semiconductor industry is set for multi-year growth, with the tech titans being all in for AI at Computex,\" they said.\n\nThe bank noted AI's increasing presence in data centers, edge computing, PCs, and smartphones, necessitating larger semiconductor dies to handle the growing data and processing power. The rapid pace of innovation supports this demand, as evidenced by AMD's (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA's annual product development cycles.\n\nMoreover, BofA also highlighted ARM's projection of a substantial surge in AI-ready devices, anticipating over 100 billion ARM units capable of running AI by the end of 2025.\n\nRelated Articles\n\n5 big analyst AI moves: ASML receives new Street-high price target, HPE upgraded\n\nVolvo shifting EV production to Belgium to avoid China tariffs, The Times reports\n\nJefferies Report: Margin Expansion of IT Cos. in FY25 Faces Significant Hurdles\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Apple needs to make Siri fit into a ChatGPT world—Is it Mission Impossible?",
        "content": "Apple’s Siri was the first virtual assistant to grace our smartphones, but it only took about five years before newer competitors like Google’s Assistant—which could more freely search the web for answers—made it seem a little clunky. Now, nearly 13 years after that 2011 launch, Siri is looking positively antiquated.\n\nThe advent of generative AI is to blame. Siri was always an AI assistant of sorts—machine learning, which is a subset of AI, is what gives it the ability to understand spoken commands and requests—but the world has come to expect so much more of AI, particularly since OpenAI's seminal release of the ChatGPT chatbot in late 2022.\n\nApple arch-rival Google, which has one of the leading large language models in the form of Gemini, is baking a host of AI capabilities into its Android operating system—most notably the Gemini chatbot itself, which is taking over from Assistant. And even on Apple's iOS, many people are now turning to apps for third-party chatbot like ChatGPT. Siri is increasingly out in the cold.\n\nThat may change on Monday, when Apple holds what’s likely to be its most consequential Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) in many years. Investors are clamoring for the company to more full-throatedly declare its enthusiasm for AI and, when it unveils iOS 18 next week, Apple will have to demonstrate that it has what it takes to at least keep up in the chatbot stakes. The obvious way to do so will be to unveil a smarter Siri—one that still acts as the familiar voice interface that iPhone owners have long used to access the device's functionality, but that could also understand and do much, much more.\n\nBut there’s a problem: Apple’s most advanced under-development large language model (LLM), reportedly known internally as Ajax, isn’t yet ready for primetime.\n\nSo, to stay in the game, Tim Cook’s company has reportedly struck a deal with Sam Altman’s OpenAI to integrate ChatGPT into iOS. Bloomberg reports that Apple is still talking to Google about using Gemini too—it may be that iPhone users end up with a panoply of chatbots powering the answers to their queries—but for now, it seems Cook will on Monday tout a mix of ChatGPT and Apple’s in-house AI efforts.\n\n“Apple is playing catch-up with LLM technology, and it’s probable that their AI’s conversational abilities and, more importantly, cost, don’t yet meet what they can get from OpenAI,” said Forrester senior analyst Andrew Cornwall. CUPERTINO, CA - OCTOBER 04: Apple's Senior Vice President of Worldwide product marketing Phil Schiller standing in front of an image showing thought bubbles discusses the new personal assistant called Siri for the new iPhone 4s at the company's headquarters October 4, 2011 in Cupertino, California. The announcement marks the first time new CEO Tim Cook introduced a new product since Apple co-founder Steve Jobs resigned in August. (Photo by Kevork Djansezian/Getty Images)\n\nThe limits of keeping AI 'on-device'\n\nWith the OpenAI deal now apparently a certainty, the biggest mystery about Apple’s near-term AI strategy is where it will draw the line between the capabilities offered by the cloud-based ChatGPT and those that it can offer locally on the iPhone or iPad itself. Reports suggest that an algorithm will determine which type of AI would be most appropriate, depending on the sophistication of the request.\n\nStory continues\n\nSiri’s on-device nature is part of Apple’s big privacy pitch—that, unlike Google in particular, Apple is not interested in exploiting its users’ data. Indeed, this reluctance to learn too much about the user’s interests, and to keep what is learned away from third parties, is widely seen as a key reason why Siri’s capabilities remain so limited.\n\nIt is certainly possible to find some kind of middle ground. Apple’s mobile devices have since 2017 included a neural processing unit (NPU)—a specialized component for handling AI tasks—that the company calls the Neural Engine. This has allowed Apple to offer things like improved image and sound recognition, language translation and various health features. The newest iterations of the Neural Engine, reportedly the version in last year’s iPhone 15 Pro as well as whatever is inside this year’s iPhones, will be what enables Apple’s on-device generative AI.\n\nBut a tiny NPU will not be able to match the wild horsepower contained in the data centers powering OpenAI, which allows ChatGPT to provide such an uncanny simulacrum of human intelligence. So Apple will have to walk a tightrope between the privacy that its users have come to expect and the futuristic capabilities promised by a cloud-happy AI sector.\n\n“Apple is likely to announce that much of the new Siri processing is done on-device,” said Cornwall, who suggested that the reported Apple-OpenAI deal “would be a stopgap measure to give Apple developers time to build an LLM that can run mostly on-device and inside Apple’s ecosystem.” As for requests that require OpenAI’s superior technology, Apple will probably route those through its own servers so any personal data can be anonymized, he added—a tactic that wouldn’t just conform to Apple’s privacy-first brand, but that would also “permit Apple to switch providers without disrupting its users.”\n\nAccording to Bloomberg, the revamped Siri that Apple will unveil on Monday will be able to control the functions within apps on the user’s behalf, open documents, email web links, and summarize online articles. But even if some functions are using OpenAI’s technology, Apple will likely present them as improved “Apple capabilities” rather than “a front end to OpenAI,” Cornwall said.\n\nCompany pride aside, there are good reasons why Apple may want to avoid putting its OpenAI association front-and-center. Altman has become a highly controversial figure who allegedly kept OpenAI’s old board in the dark about that company’s plans, so they wouldn’t delay moves like the release of ChatGPT in the name of safety—his lack of openness with his overseers led to his brief ouster late last year. Although he won that tussle, former OpenAI employees continue to warn about an insufficient focus on safety.\n\nEven if Apple does keep OpenAI at arm’s length, it also faces risks around ChatGPT’s propensity to confidently make up nonsense when answering questions—a problem called “hallucinating” that is shared to some extent by all LLMs, as demonstrated by the dangerously wrong answers that Google’s recently AI-imbued Search has been giving. Users may not welcome Siri’s newfound willingness to provide answers if those answers are wrong.\n\nAs for whether Monday’s reveal will be enough to convince Apple’s users and Wall Street that the iPhone remains both a cutting-edge and reliable device, the proof will be in the hands-on experiences that follow when iOS 18 becomes available for public testing in July, ahead of its full release around September.\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

        "content": "When times get tough, invest in resilient growth stocks. These are the companies with strong revenue and earnings growth. They’re the ones that are reinvesting their earnings for growth instead of distributing it as a dividend. In fact, when it comes to investing in growth stocks, investors aren’t typically after dividends. They just want exposure to exponential growth.\n\nMotley Fool contributor Stefon Walters noted, “Growth stocks are companies expected to outperform the U.S. stock market (generally using the S&P 500 as a proxy) because of their potential for high earnings growth. This growth potential is largely why growth stocks have been the darlings of the market for quite a while now. After all, why wouldn’t investors take a liking to companies that can produce market-beating returns?”\n\nHere are just a few of the most resilient growth stocks you may want to buy.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) is one of the top growth stocks to buy and hold.\n\nSince bottoming out around $60 in late 2022, AMD hit a high of $227.30. Now consolidating at $166.77, I’d like to see AMD initially retest its prior high, especially with the artificial intelligence boom just starting to get hot.\n\nHelping, AMDjust unveiled its latest AI chips, intensifying its competition against Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA).\n\nThat includes the Instinct MI325X accelerators, which are planned for availability in the fourth quarter. All as the “race to develop generative artificial intelligence programs has led to towering demand for the advanced chips used in AI data centers able to support these complex applications,” says Reuters.\n\nIn addition, the company introduced an upcoming series of chips titled MI350, which is expected to be available in 2025. AMD said the MI350 will likely perform 35 times better in inference, the process of computing generative AI responses.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) Service Center. Tesla designs and manufactures the Model S electric sedan IV. Tesla layoffs\n\nSource: Jonathan Weiss / Shutterstock.com\n\nInvestors may also want to pay close attention to Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA), even with its countless issues. Down but not out, it could benefit from reaccelerating electric vehicle (EV) sales this year.\n\nFor 2024, EV industry sales are expected to increase anywhere from 20% to 30%. Plus, according to Michelle Krebs, executive auto analyst for Cox, “EV sales are increasing faster than any other segment in the industry.”\n\nBetter, TSLA sales could accelerate with the potential for newer, cheaper electric vehicles.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs noted in a first-quarter earnings report, “We have updated our future vehicle line-up to accelerate the launch of new models ahead of our previously communicated start of production in the second half of 2025.”\n\n“These new vehicles, including more affordable models, will utilize aspects of the next generation platform as well as aspects of our current platforms, and will be able to be produced on the same manufacturing lines as our current vehicle line-up,” the company added.\n\nMicrosoft (MSFT) Wide angle view of a Microsoft sign at the headquarters for personal computer and cloud computing company, with office building in the background.. MSFT stock\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nMicrosoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a no-brainer when it comes to resilient growth stocks to buy. Since bottoming out in early 2023 at around $220, MSFT is now up to $424.52 and could see higher highs. For one, the software company has evolved into a tech giant with its operating systems, cloud services, game consoles and artificial intelligence.\n\nTwo, the company is launching its first artificial intelligence personal computer product, the Surface model laptop with built-in AI capabilities.\n\nThree, as noted by Investorplace’s Louis Navallier:\n\n“The company may be just starting to monetize its AI technology within its customer-facing segment, but AI integration has already had a major impact on Azure’s fiscal performance. Last quarter, Azure revenue was up 31% because of this factor.”\n\nAll are serving as significant catalysts for future growth at Microsoft. Even better, analysts believe Microsoft could grow its EPS by about 13.8% a year over the next three to five years.\n\nSchwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (SCHG) charles schwab sign outside of a building. SCHD stock\n\nSource: Isabelle OHara / Shutterstock.com\n\nWe can also find resiliency with exchange-traded funds (ETF) like the Schwab U.S. Large Cap Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHG). With an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF offers exposure to 249 holdings and tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Large-Cap Growth Total Stock Market Index.\n\nSome of its top holdings include Microsoft, Nvidia, Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nEven better, if I wanted to buy 100 shares of the SCHG ETF, it would cost me $9,726, which is far less than buying just one of its 249 holdings. Not only does the ETF offer me solid diversification, it does so at a low price.\n\nEven better, since its inception, the ETF has historically outperformed the S&P 500.\n\nVanguard Growth ETF (VUG) image of vanguard website to represent index funds to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAnother hot growth stock ETF to buy and hold is the Vanguard Growth ETF (NYSEARCA:VUG).\n\nWith an expense ratio of 0.04%, the ETF tracks the performance of the CRSP U.S. Large Cap Growth Index in an attempt to match the performance of the nation’s top 200 growth stocks. Some of its top holdings include Microsoft, Apple, Nvidia, Amazon and Alphabet.\n\nSince bottoming out in early 2023 at around $210, the VUG ETF is now up to $361.50. From here, given the growing demand for growth stocks, I’d like to see the ETF closer to $400 this year. Even better, the VUG ETF is seeing massive inflows. According to BNK Invest, the VUG ETF recently saw an inflow of about $1.3 billion, a 1.1% increase from the prior week.\n\nIn addition, according to TipRanks, “The VUG ETF has a Strong Buy consensus rating. Of the 200 stocks held, 173 have Buys and 27 have a Hold rating.”\n\nMastercard (MA) Close up of a pile of mastercard credit load debit bank cards.\n\nSource: David Cardinez / Shutterstock.com\n\nMastercard (NYSE:MA) is another strong growth stock to buy on a recent dip.\n\nAfter running from about $410 to a high of $490, Mastercard slipped to $440. All of that happened after cutting guidance and better-than-expected earnings. However, MA did find strong double-bottom support at $440 and is starting to bounce, last trading at $448.68.\n\nFrom that price, I’d like to see Mastercard initially retest its prior high of $490.\n\nHelping, analysts at Piper Sandler (NYSE:PIPR) just initiated an Overweight rating on MA. The firm cited MA’s “scale, hard-to-replicate networks, and fintech ecosystem partnerships, all tied to sustainable secular growth within digital payments.”\n\nThe firm added that “Mastercard should be able to boost revenue by 11% this year and by 12.7% in FY204, driven by 9.5%/13.5% payment network revenue growth and value-added services and solutions growth of 13.7%/11.5% in FY24/FY25.”\n\nWe also have to remember that more Americans are heavily dependent on credit cards these days. As noted by Fox Business, “35% of Americans said they have maxed out their credit cards in recent years. Of those who had maxed out their credit cards, 85% said they were pushed to use their cards to the limit because of price increases from inflation.”\n\nZscaler (ZS) Zscaler (ZS) logo on a corporate building\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother one of the top resilient growth stocks to buy and hold is Zscaler (NASDAQ:ZS).\n\nFor one, it’s a leader in zero trust and cloud cybersecurity trading at less than growth. Second, it just unveiled multiple innovations to its “AI Data Protection Platform that leverage the world’s largest security cloud and the power of AI,” as noted by the company.\n\nThat includes its Gen AI App Security, offering “context-rich user and risk correlation, providing insights into risky prompts, AI app usage and granular policy controls,” reported TechnologyMagazine. The feature is reportedly critical, as the “adoption of AI technologies continues to accelerate, presenting new security challenges.”\n\nTwo, recent earnings were solid. In its third quarter, earnings per share of 88 cents beat estimates by 23 cents. Revenue of $553.2 million, up 32.1% year over year, beat by $17.6 million. Moving forward, Zscaler forecasts revenue of $565 million to $567 million, a possible growth of $12.8 million at the mid-point.\n\nOn the date of publication, Ian Cooper did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nFor a brief and marvelous time, the latest and greatest consumer services the tech economy had to offer came on the cheap, with generous subsidies from the companies themselves.\n\nJeff Bezos picked up your shipping costs. Various VC benefactors chipped in to pay for your rides, short-term rentals, and food deliveries.\n\nOthers helped pick up the tab for your TV, movies, and music. All of which now streamed directly to your device(s).\n\nYou made a contribution, of course, but in the low-interest-rate environment of easy money in the 2010s, Big Tech helped you pay.\n\nBut as our Chart of the Week shows, this era could not be more over.\n\nThis week, consumers were hit with more price hikes from Max and Spotify, which took their turn in what seems like a never-ending cycle of price hikes. Recently, Comcast announced price hikes for Peacock that coincide with the Paris Olympics.\n\nWarner Bros. Discovery and Comcast, of course, are not quite the Big Tech names synonymous with losing money to gain market share. But while you were getting a deal on all your new digitally enabled habits, these companies were scrambling to copy the same playbook.\n\nThe biggest takeaway they copied was losing money. And the rush to raise prices today shows them running in the other direction.\n\nThis next development in the industry also comes with another catch: ads. The second prong in the fork of potential profitability.\n\nAs our Alexandra Canal notes, streamers are getting more interested in ad-tier platforms and are thus incentivizing participation away from their premium (read: ad-free, another “innovation” from a bygone era) offerings despite their higher prices.\n\nNow, cord-cutters who haven’t seen an ad in years will finally learn about Buffalo Wild Wings' BOGO Thursday boneless wings and McDonald’s $5 value meal.\n\nAnd just as excitement over a paradigm shift helped usher in cheap subscriptions for all over a decade ago, the ad-supported streaming model has the potential to generate a similar level of sentiment. Sentiment that analysts note could cause ad-tier subscription prices to decline if user eyeballs become more valuable than the literal dollars they bring to the table.\n\nAs Bank of America wrote in a note to clients Thursday, despite the sector’s headwinds and years of weakness, there’s “cautious optimism” in the near term and “disruption” in the long term as the potential of in-platform shopping and ad format innovation excites executives and investors alike.\n\nStory continues\n\nIf this works, maybe these companies can finally go back to making good content.\n\nUntil then, $16.99 will give you the entire Sopranos catalog.\n\nEthan Wolff-Mann is a Senior Editor at Yahoo Finance, running newsletters.

        "content": "Apple (AAPL) closed at $196.89 in the latest trading session, marking a +1.24% move from the prior day. The stock outperformed the S&P 500, which registered a daily loss of 0.11%. Meanwhile, the Dow experienced a drop of 0.22%, and the technology-dominated Nasdaq saw a decrease of 0.23%.\n\nThe the stock of maker of iPhones, iPads and other products has risen by 5.37% in the past month, lagging the Computer and Technology sector's gain of 6.52% and overreaching the S&P 500's gain of 3.51%.\n\nThe upcoming earnings release of Apple will be of great interest to investors. On that day, Apple is projected to report earnings of $1.33 per share, which would represent year-over-year growth of 5.56%. Simultaneously, our latest consensus estimate expects the revenue to be $83.07 billion, showing a 1.55% escalation compared to the year-ago quarter.\n\nLooking at the full year, the Zacks Consensus Estimates suggest analysts are expecting earnings of $6.57 per share and revenue of $384.68 billion. These totals would mark changes of +7.18% and +0.36%, respectively, from last year.\n\nIt is also important to note the recent changes to analyst estimates for Apple. These recent revisions tend to reflect the evolving nature of short-term business trends. Therefore, positive revisions in estimates convey analysts' confidence in the company's business performance and profit potential.\n\nOur research shows that these estimate changes are directly correlated with near-term stock prices. We developed the Zacks Rank to capitalize on this phenomenon. Our system takes these estimate changes into account and delivers a clear, actionable rating model.\n\nThe Zacks Rank system, which varies between #1 (Strong Buy) and #5 (Strong Sell), carries an impressive track record of exceeding expectations, confirmed by external audits, with stocks at #1 delivering an average annual return of +25% since 1988.

        "title": "Famous Analyst Thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a Better AI Investment Than Nvidia(NVDA) — Here’s Why",
        "content": "We recently published a list of top 10 AI stocks Wall Street analysts are upgrading. Apple ranks 5th in the list. That's why the stock deserves a deeper look.\n\nThere has been much uproar about AI stock valuations and how investors are overpaying for mega-cap tech stocks that are promising something that still lies far into the future — productivity gains, real-life AI products and AGI. But the market doesn’t seem to care what the AI skeptics and naysayers believe. There seems to be no end in sight to the AI-led gains in stocks. And analysts are expecting more. Goldman Sachs's Scott Rubner recently said that he sees a \"wall of money\" heading towards the market. Rubner pointed towards the whopping $7.3 trillion sitting in money market funds and said he believes the floodgates are about to open and investors would funnel that money into stocks. According to Rubner's model, the third quarter of 2024 is when we should expect billions ($29 billion, to be precise) to be flushed into the market.\n\nOne doesn’t need to have a crystal ball to know where all of those billions would be headed. AI is the promising theme everyone is betting on and that everyone includes experts, billionaires, money managers and long-term value investors. Tom Lee, Fundstrat Global Advisors co-founder, recently said in a program on CNBC that investors have been \"hesitant\" for much of the year, but they should just \"stick\" with \"what's working.\" AI, weight loss drugs and related themes is what's working these days, according to Lee.\n\nMethodology\n\nFor this article we picked the top AI stocks Wall Street analysts recently upgraded or gave bullish comments about. With each stock we have mentioned the number of hedge fund investors. Why are we interested in the stocks that hedge funds pile into? The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nPhoto by Alexandr Bormotin on Unsplash\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Investors: 150\n\nNotable Wall Street analyst and Deepwater Asset Management Managing Partner Gene Munster recently made waves when he said in a post on Twitter that Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a better investment than Nvidia for the long term. Munster believes \"owning Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) over the next year will have a higher return\" because the market is in denial about Apple Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI potential.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Wall Street is running out of patience with Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) amid Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI strategy that's been so far nonexistent and lagging behind competitors. But Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bulls believe Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will shine through in the AI race. The market is now awaiting the WWDC event where Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to reveal its AI plans. Dan Ives of Wedbush, one of the biggest Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) bulls, recently said that WWDC  is the \"most important event for Apple in over a decade as the pressure to bring a generative AI stack of technology for developers and consumers is front and center.\"\n\nIves thinks Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) will be able to create an ecosystem around its AI offerings and Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) would see a $30 to $40 per share surge because of its AI products. Ives has a $275 price target on Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) shares.\n\nApple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is trading at 27x its 2025 EPS estimate, which is still a high multiple given Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) 9.60% growth estimate for 2025 and 10.50% per-annum growth expected over the next five years. But all of this could change if Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) is able to pull AI-related catalysts out of its bag. The WWDC event and the new few weeks and months would be critical for Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) growth trajectory.\n\nThe first signs of Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) AI capabilities are here. Last month, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) revealed new M4-powered iPad Pro and claimed that its devices, powered by Neural Engine,  will be “more powerful than any neural processing unit in any AI PC today.” Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Neural Engine is Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) neural processing unit (NPU) that accelerates AI workloads.\n\nRiverPark Large Growth Fund stated the following regarding Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) in its first quarter 2024 investor letter:\n\n“Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL): Apple shares were a top detractor in the quarter. The company’s stock was pressured by negative news items including a government antitrust case, an Apple Watch patent dispute, and slowing China iPhone sales. Ultimately the company’s fiscal 1Q24 earnings report delivered a slightly better than expected quarter, but with guidance that disappointed investors. 1Q24 revenue and gross margin were better than feared, buoyed by stronger than expected worldwide iPhone sales which grew 6% despite a slight decline in China iPhone sales. Services revenue in the quarter was as expected and signaled the third quarter in a row of accelerating growth. Gross margins were also stronger than expected at 45.9%, the highest level in more than a decade. Guidance of $90 billion of revenue for 2Q24 was light however, due to weaker than expected iPhone sales in the current period and year-over-year declines in other hardware products facing difficult year-over year comps.\n\nAlthough near-term trends are a bit muted, Apple is carrying lean inventory into an iPhone refresh cycle later this year. With an installed base of 2.2 billion active devices and significant growth of the company’s recurring revenue Services segment, we believe that Apple remains one of the most innovative, best positioned and most profitable companies in the mobile technology industry.”\n\nOverall, Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) ranks 5th in Insider Monkey’s list of Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks.You can visit Analysts are Upgrading These 10 AI Stocks to see the other AI stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple, our conviction lies in the belief that smaller AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe.

        "title": "Navigating the Tech Stock Jungle: 3 Picks for Massive Returns",
        "content": "If you’re trying to hone in on which tech stocks to buy this month, you’ve come to the right place. The technology sector continues to carry the stock market higher. In just six months, Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) tripled its market valuation to $3 trillion and replaced Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable stock (it recently slipped back to third place).\n\nYet other tech stocks are performing just as good or better than the chipmaker. Software company Dave (NASDAQ:DAVE) has quadrupled in value this year, rising almost 400%. Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) is up 170%, though that has more to do with Bitcoin (BTC-USD) bubbling up again.\n\nWhat it shows, though, is significant profit-making opportunities remain in the sector and the following three tech stocks to buy could be the next to explode higher.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTech Stocks to Buy: Super Micro Computer (SMCI) Person holding cellphone with logo of US company Super Micro Computer Inc. (SMCI) (Supermicro) in front of business webpage. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nLast year’s tech darling Super Micro Computer (NASDAQ:SMCI) is growing slower this year – but not by much. After tacking on 250% gains in 2023, it is “only” 172% higher this time around. But that’s because SMCI stock slipped 37% below the all-time high it hit in March. Now is the time for the next leg up.\n\nSuper Micro reported fiscal first-quarter results that beat Wall Street’s top and bottom line estimates but didn’t offer blow-the-doors-off guidance for the rest of the year. The stock market sold off its shares because SMCI’s outlook for the fourth quarter said revenue would only triple from last year to as much as $5.8 billion.\n\nSuper Micro Computer is the leading provider of artificial intelligence (AI)-optimized computers, servers, networks, storage solutions and workstations for data centers and other industries. The need for more capacity has hyperscalers like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) building new data centers all over the country. There will be no lack of demand for Super Micro’s equipment.\n\nSMCI stock earnings are expected to grow a whopping 62% every year for the next five years yet it trades at a fraction of that growth rate. That makes Super Micro Computer a tech stock to buy now.\n\nPalo Alto Networks (PANW) Palo Alto Networks (PANW) building with blue logo on side with blue sky backdrop\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nCybersecurity expert Palo Alto Networks (NASDAQ:PANW) is another discounted tech stock to buy because it also has no end in sight to its growth potential. Like death and taxes, hackers and cybercrime will always be with us in the connected computer age. LexisNexis Risk Solutions says “human-initiated digital attacks” are up 19% globally from last year.\n\nStory continues\n\nYet Palo Alto’s stock is only up 1% in 2024. The market is worried that billings growth is slowing. It rose just 3% in the fiscal third quarter to $2.3 billion. But that resulted from the cybersecurity outfit offering program bundling discounts to existing customers.\n\nIt is also benefiting from customers consolidating where they spend their money on security. Rather than numerous different vendors, they are buying more Palo Alto modules under its new, single-platform offering. Particularly with the growth of AI, the cybersecurity leader has new program packages that offer superior protection.\n\nPalo Alto Network’s lower price gives investors the chance to buy into this tech stock at a discount.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) Business man using computer hand close up futuristic cyber space decentralized finance coding background, business data analytics programming online VPN network metaverse digital world technology. tech stocks\n\nSource: thinkhubstudio / Shutterstock.com\n\nAdvanced wafer cleaning technologies and equipment (WFE) supplier ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR) is another tech stock the market wrongly sold off. Shares are down 38% from its 52-week high though it remains 16% above where it started the year.\n\nPart of the reason for the pullback is ACM’s market is declining, but only through this year. Analysts at Gartner predict the WFE industry will fall 4% this year after a 10% decline in 2023. However, starting in 2025, it will reverse and see 10% growth with significant gains continuing through 2027. It is easy to see why.\n\nDemand for computer chips is growing, especially due to the needs of AI. ACM Research’s equipment is essential because it eliminates contaminants from wafer surfaces at the front end of the chip processing cycle. Chip manufacturers need pristine surfaces before they begin making the wafers.\n\nThe specialized nature of its equipment will be necessary as chip companies face secular growth trends. That should push ACMR stock to new heights in the future.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference event kicks off Monday, June 10, from the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif., with a keynote by CEO Tim Cook. One of the most anticipated Apple events in years, WWDC 2024 is expected to serve as the launch point for the company’s big push into generative AI.\n\nWall Street is eager to find out what Apple’s been cooking up over the past few months as its rivals have begun rolling out, or in some cases rolling back, their own generative AI offerings. Apple has been largely on the sidelines of the AI conversation, save for a few fleeting mentions during earnings calls and the like.\n\nDuring the company’s Q2 call in May, Cook seemed to tee up potential AI news from WWDC while touting Apple’s capabilities in both hardware and software.\n\n\"We believe in the transformative power and promise of AI, and we believe we have advantages that will differentiate us in this new era, including Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software, and services integration; groundbreaking Apple silicon with our industry-leading neural engine; and our unwavering focus on privacy,\" he said.\n\nIf that wasn’t enough, Apple’s marketing chief Greg Joswiak posted on X, formerly Twitter, that WWDC will be “Absolutely Incredible!” and made sure to capitalize both words. Get it? A.I. Apple CEO Tim Cook speaks during Apple's Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) at the Apple Park campus in Cupertino, Calif., on June 5, 2023. (JOSH EDELSON/AFP via Getty Images) (JOSH EDELSON via Getty Images)\n\nIn addition to unveiling its broader AI strategy, Apple will also debut the latest versions of its various operating systems, including iOS, iPadOS, watchOS, macOS, tvOS, and the first major updates to the company’s visionOS, which powers the Vision Pro mixed reality headset.\n\nStill, everything else is virtually guaranteed to take a back seat to Apple’s AI news.\n\nSiri gets smarter, and more\n\nAccording to Apple soothsayer Mark Gurman of Bloomberg, the highlight of WWDC 2024 will be a new generative AI-powered version of Apple’s Siri smart assistant. The feature will allow Siri to control individual features within apps, making it far more versatile than the Siri on your current iPhone.\n\nSiri has been languishing for years, proving more useful for setting timers and playing songs on Spotify than acting as a true digital helper. But a generative AI version of Siri offers the promise of an actual smart assistant that could provide you with everything from proactive tips to improved responses to those random questions that pop in your head throughout the day.\n\nBloomberg’s Gurman also says Apple’s AI features, called Apple Intelligence, will touch a host of other apps including Messages, Notes, and Safari, as well.\n\nStory continues\n\nExactly how Apple will power a smarter Siri is still an open question. According to reports from Bloomberg, the Wall Street Journal, and the New York Times, Apple has held talks with OpenAI to license its GPT software and separate talks with Google (GOOG, GOOGL) to license its Gemini software.\n\nA tie-up with either company could get complicated. OpenAI already works closely with Microsoft (MSFT), which is working to set its PC business apart from Apple by boasting about how some Windows 11 features are powered by GPT-4o. Google, meanwhile, uses its Gemini AI model on its Android smartphones, which compete directly with Apple’s iPhone. Google is also working with Samsung to provide AI software for that company’s Galaxy line of phones.\n\nIt will also be interesting to see if consumers or Wall Street end up more excited about Apple’s AI rollout. Investors and analysts have been waiting for Apple to debut some kind of answer to the generative AI explosion, but so far consumer use cases have been relatively limited.\n\nIf Apple does roll out some well-developed features, they’re unlikely to get consumers to drop everything and buy a new iPhone come September when the company debuts its newest phones. Instead, most consumers will probably wait until they see some kind of hardware upgrade they’ve been waiting for, or until their current phone becomes unbearably slow, before ponying up for a new device.\n\nAs for iPadOS and macOS, expect Apple to roll out the same AI features it adds to iOS across those operating systems as well. In general, I expect Apple to be rather judicious with its AI moves. The company is keenly attuned to how consumers perceive its products, and after the blowback competitors like Google and Microsoft have seen with their own AI stumbles, it’s hard to imagine Apple will announce anything it isn’t completely confident in.\n\nOutside of AI, Apple is also expected to unveil Rich Communication Services, or RCS, for the iPhone. This means that users will finally be able to text high-quality images and videos to their Android friends. RCS is also more secure than the SMS standard Apple currently uses for iPhone-to-Android texting.\n\nGurman also says that Apple will finally allow people to arrange app icons on their iPhone home screen in any way they want, rather than being stuck with the traditional grid layout.\n\nThere are bound to be plenty more announcements from the big show, and Yahoo Finance will be there live, bringing you all of the latest news as it breaks.

        "title": "Apple’s WWDC is crucial to the company showing it can still compete in the one area that matters",
        "content": "No pressure, Apple.\n\nThe iPhone maker’s WWDC conference starting on Monday will be pivotal to the company’s future. CEO Tim Cook must reassure customers, developers, and investors that Apple can narrow the gap with its rivals in the only thing that seems to matter in the tech industry these days: artificial intelligence.\n\nHe has his work cut out for him.\n\nOver the past year, the parent companies of Google and Facebook, along with Microsoft its upstart ally OpenAI, have unleashed a torrent of large language models and AI-infused products. Sure, some of those products have been buggy and occasionally spouted nonsense, but they showed that the companies behind them are at least striving, and, in some cases, sprinting ahead.\n\nMeanwhile, Apple has been mired in the AI mud. The company has made relatively few AI-related upgrades to its products, leaving its executives to repeatedly—and not so convincingly—promise big things to come.\n\nAbsent something soon, Apple’s lineup of devices and services risks becoming obsolete. Customers, after all, could easily switch to buying lower-priced electronics from rivals that can do significantly more.\n\nIf the news leaks are to be believed, Apple will use WWDC—described by Wedbush tech analyst Dan Ives in a recent research note as “the most important event for Apple in over a decade”—to sprinkle AI magic across its portfolio. If you’re allergic to hearing the term AI, well, avoid the event’s livestream.\n\nVoice assistant Siri, once an AI trailblazer, but now only marginally useful because it can handle a limited number of tasks, is expected to get a high-profile update. For the first time, users will be able to tell Siri to access any feature within other apps, such as opening documents or sending an email, vastly increasing Siri’s utility.\n\nYou can count on Apple to also brag about more minor AI upgrades. Voice memo transcriptions, automated replies to messages, and AI-generated emojis are just some of what’s on tap, according to Bloomberg.\n\nApple will likely power some of the updates through a new partnership with OpenAI. The deal would let Apple integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT chatbot into various Apple products, thereby supercharging Apple devices with additional AI capabilities. Using such outsourced technology could help Apple catch up to the competition. But it would also hammer home that Apple, embarrassingly, lacks an in-house equivalent, while also adding to OpenAI’s already considerable momentum.\n\nApple investors are already lapping up the idea of a would-be AI renaissance, to be marketed under the brand name “AI Intelligence,” according to Bloomberg. Apple’s shares have risen 15% since May 1, and are near an all-time high.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut before everyone gets overly giddy, here’s a few words of caution. Apple’s revenue has declined in five of the six most recent quarters, partly because of falling iPhone sales in China. Apple can add all the AI it wants, but it won’t necessarily solve the China problem, which is mostly about politics and Chinese customers switching to lower-priced Chinese-made smartphones—and not about AI.\n\nFurthermore, despite all the whiz-bang on stage on Monday, many of Apple’s major AI upgrades aren’t expected to be available until much later this year, when iOS 18 is released—and only as beta-stage products. Any boost in sales from shoppers rushing to buy Apple devices that are powerful enough to handle all the AI will therefore be delayed.\n\nAnd even after cramming AI into everything it produces, Apple will still face serious competitive challenges. Rivals have added or will soon add many similar AI features to their own devices, which means Apple’s efforts will merely help it keep pace rather than gain an advantage.\n\nSo, as I said earlier, facetiously, no pressure, Apple.\n\nVerne Kopytoff\n\nWant to send thoughts or suggestions to Data Sheet?

        "title": "Cash Flow Kings: 7 Stocks Set to Deliver Massive Value to Shareholders",
        "content": "A commonly used method to value stocks is discounted cash flow analysis. The basic idea is to estimate the present value of future cash flow from the business. While revenue growth is important, the bottom line is the cash flow potential that the business holds. Investors should look for cash-flow stocks that represent companies with robust free cash flow and the ability to increase cash flow on a sustained basis.\n\nAn important point to note is that blue-chip companies generally have robust cash flow. On the other hand, growth companies are focused on aggressive investments and cash flow is relatively low. However, if an investor can correctly identify a future cash-flow machine, returns from the stock can be multi-fold.\n\nI have discussed a mix of blue-chip and emerging ideas from the perspective of cash flow potential from the business. I must add that healthy cash flow would also imply robust dividends and sustained value creation through share repurchase.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThese are seven cash-flow stocks worth your attention now.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple logo on a pink and purple background. AAPL stock.\n\nSource: Moab Republic / Shutterstock\n\nThat Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) trades at a valuation of almost $3 trillion is not a euphoria or a bubble. The valuation is a function of innovation and the cash flow potential. AAPL stock has a low dividend yield of 0.5%. However, I expect robust dividend growth in the next five years.\n\nApple reported operating cash flow of $62.5 billion for the first half of 2024, implying an annualized operating cash flow potential of $125 billion. Further, the technology company has a cash buffer of $160 billion.\n\nTherefore, there is ample flexibility for dividends, share repurchases, and investment in innovation-driven growth. For the first half of 2024, the products business witnessed some contraction. However, the services segment, which includes the App Store, offset that weakness.\n\nEven in the product segment, the wearable, home, and accessories businesses are likely to gain growth traction in global markets. Recently, the company unveiled a new AI-focused chip in its iPad Pro. With AI-powered enhancement in devices, I expect the products segment to deliver healthy growth in the coming quarters. Therefore, as the business grows, cash flows will continue to swell.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG) Closeup logo of Google.com website on an iPhone on wooden table. GOOG stock and Google layoffs\n\nSource: Koshiro K / Shutterstock.com\n\nAlphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) is another technology stock that looks attractively valued, and the business is a cash flow machine. GOOG stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 23.5x, which is attractive considering the impending growth backed by AI.\n\nStory continues\n\nFor Q1 2024, Alphabet reported revenue growth of 15% on a year-on-year basis to $80.5 billion. It’s worth noting that the Google Cloud business growth was 28% to $9.6 billion. Further, the technology giant reported operating cash flow of $23.5 billion for the quarter. The annualized operating cash flow potential is almost $100 billion.\n\nThis provides Alphabet with the flexibility to invest in AI-driven growth. At the same time, I expect a robust upside in dividends in the coming years. Coming back to AI, Alphabet is just getting started on that front. Last month, the company launched a beefed-up AI search and chatbot. Alphabet believes that it’s well-positioned for the “next wave of AI innovation.” I, therefore, expect healthy growth to be sustained coupled with a cash flow upside.\n\nLockheed Martin (LMT) Lockheed Martin (LMT) M142 High Mobility Artillery Rocket System (HIMARS).3D illustration.\n\nSource: Mike Mareen / Shutterstock.com\n\nGlobal defense expenditures surged to $2.44 trillion in 2023 and there is no doubt that spending will continue to swell. Defense stocks are likely to benefit on the back of a robust order intake. Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) is among the undervalued defense stocks to buy at a forward P/E of 17.9x. The defense stock also offers a healthy dividend yield of 2.7%.\n\nAs of the first quarter, Lockheed Martin reported an order backlog of $159 billion. This provides clear revenue and cash flow visibility. For 2024, the company guided for free cash flow of $6.2 billion (mid-range). This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth and continued share repurchases.\n\nIt’s also likely that sales growth will accelerate in the coming years and will have a positive impact on cash flows. There are two reasons to expect healthy sales growth. First, Lockheed increasingly pursued deals outside the U.S. with its allies. The geographic expansion will benefit the defense major.\n\nFurther, Lockheed is focused on next-generation defense technology, including hypersonic and next-generation interceptors. Its aggressive investment in research and development is likely to be a growth catalyst.\n\nChevron (CVX)\n\nSource: JL IMAGES / Shutterstock.com\n\nChevron (NYSE:CVX) is an undervalued blue-chip stock from the oil and gas industry. In the last 12 months, CVX stock remained sideways with oil struggling to trend higher on the back of macroeconomic headwinds. I see the sideways move as a good opportunity to accumulate.\n\nWith multiple interest rate cuts likely in the next 12 to 18 months, I am bullish on oil. Chevron has an investment-grade balance sheet and high-quality assets with an attractive break-even point.\n\nChevron reported operating cash flow of $35.6 billion for 2023 and $6.8 billion in the first quarter of 2024. If oil trends higher, it’s likely that cash flow will be in the range of $35 billion to $40 billion for the year.\n\nCash flows will swell further with the likely completion of the acquisition of Hess (NYSE:HES). Therefore, even with aggressive capital investment plans, there will be ample flexibility for dividend growth and share repurchase.\n\nCostco Wholesale (COST) A Costco Wholesale (COST) warehouse in Auburn Hills, Michigan.\n\nSource: ilzesgimene / Shutterstock.com\n\nCostco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST) is possibly the best pick among retail stocks considering the company’s growth trajectory. While a forward P/E of 51x looks slightly stretched, COST stock has always commanded a valuation premium as compared to peers. I would look at corrections to accumulate this retail behemoth.\n\nFor the third quarter of fiscal year 2024, Costco reported sales growth of 9.1% on a year-on-year basis to $57.39 billion. Comparable store sales growth was also healthy at 6.6%. With rate cuts impending, I expect consumption expenditures to accelerate, and Costco will benefit.\n\nFor the first nine months of fiscal 2024, the company reported operating cash flow of $8.3 billion. Cash flows have continued to swell, and I remain bullish, considering the top-line growth and continued upside in membership revenue.\n\nAs of Q1 2023, Costco had two warehouses in China. In the last quarter, the number of warehouses increased to seven. International expansion is likely to be another catalyst for growth and cash flow upside.\n\nCrowdStrike Holdings (CRWD) A sign with the Crowdstrike (CRWD) company logo\n\nSource: VDB Photos / Shutterstock.com\n\nCybersecurity stocks have been in the limelight considering the big addressable market. CrowdStrike Holdings (NASDAQ:CRWD) is an emerging cash-flow business that deserves a place in the portfolio. CRWD stock surged by 122% in the last 12 months. There was an intermediate correction, but the reversal was swift on the back of strong Q1 results.\n\nFor the first quarter, CrowdStrike reported stellar revenue growth of 33% on a year-on-year basis to $921 million. For the same period, CrowdStrike generated operating cash flow of $383 million and ended the quarter with a cash buffer of $3.7 billion. With annual operating cash flow visibility of almost $1.6 billion, CrowdStrike is an emerging cash-flow star.\n\nThe cybersecurity company reported annual recurring revenue of $3.65 billion as of April. Over the next five to seven years, CrowdStrike is targeting an annual recurring revenue of $10 billion. This provides an indication of the headroom for upside in revenue and cash flows. It’s, therefore, not surprising that CRWD stock has remained in a sharp uptrend.\n\nNewmont Corporation (NEM) Newmont logo on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat/Shutterstock\n\nMultiple factors globally are likely to ensure that gold remains in an uptrend. Some important reasons include geopolitical tensions, inflation, and the prospects of expansionary policies. Newmont Corporation (NYSE:NEM) is a blue-chip gold mining company worth holding for healthy dividends and capital gains.\n\nAs of 2023, Newmont reported 128 million ounces of gold reserves and 155 million ounces in resources. The gold miner has a leading portfolio of 10 Tier 1 assets. A strong asset base ensures a steady production upside beyond the current decade.\n\nIt’s also worth noting that Newmont has an investment-grade balance sheet. As of Q1 2024, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $7 billion. Last year, Newmont reported operating cash flow of $2.7 billion. With gold trending higher, it’s likely that operating cash flow will be more than $3.5 billion. This provides ample flexibility for dividend growth. At the same time, capital investments will remain aggressive backed by a strong balance sheet.\n\nOn the date of publication, Faisal Humayun did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of WWDC 2024\n\nApple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is set to unveil significant advancements at its annual Worldwide Developers Conference(WWDC) from June 10-14, 2024.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based tech giant is expected to spotlight new AI-powered features across its core applications, along with updates to its operating systems, according to a recent note by Goldman Sachs analyst Michael Ng.\n\nIn a bid to simplify the login process for its users, the company reportedly plans to launch a new app called \"Passwords\" at its Worldwide Developers Conference or WWDC.\n\nWith the recent buzz around Apple, some investors may be eyeing potential gains from the company's dividends, too. As of now, Apple offers an annual dividend yield of 0.51%. That’s a quarterly dividend amount of 25 cents per share ($1.00 a year).\n\nSee Also: Wedbush’s Dan Ives Says WWDC 2024 Is ‘Most Important Event For Apple In Over A Decade’ – What To Expect\n\nSo, how can investors exploit its dividend yield to pocket a regular $500 monthly?\n\nTo earn $500 per month or $6,000 annually from dividends alone, you would need an investment of approximately $1,166,880 or around 6,000 shares. For a more modest $100 per month or $1,200 per year, you would need $233,376 or around 1,200 shares.\n\nTo calculate: Divide the desired annual income ($6,000 or $1,200) by the dividend ($1.0 in this case). So, $6,000 / $1.00 = 6,000 ($500 per month), and $1,200 / $1.00 = 1,200 shares ($100 per month).\n\nNote that dividend yield can change on a rolling basis, as the dividend payment and the stock price both fluctuate over time.\n\nHow that works: The dividend yield is computed by dividing the annual dividend payment by the stock’s current price.\n\nFor example, if a stock pays an annual dividend of $2 and is currently priced at $50, the dividend yield would be 4% ($2/$50). However, if the stock price increases to $60, the dividend yield drops to 3.33% ($2/$60). Conversely, if the stock price falls to $40, the dividend yield rises to 5% ($2/$40).\n\nSimilarly, changes in the dividend payment can impact the yield. If a company increases its dividend, the yield will also increase, provided the stock price stays the same. Conversely, if the dividend payment decreases, so will the yield.\n\nAAPL Price Action: Shares of Apple fell 0.7% to close at $194.48 on Thursday.\n\nCheck This Out: How to Find Dividend Stocks: Scan, Analyze, and Capture with Benzinga Pro\n\nImage: Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nStory continues\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nThis article How To Earn $500 A Month From Apple Stock Ahead Of WWDC 2024 originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Here’s Everything Apple Plans to Show at Its AI-Focused WWDC Event",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. isn’t typically the first to embrace new product categories — as it famously showed with its iPhone, smartwatch and Vision Pro. All those areas were established before the company showed up, but Apple found a way to make its mark.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nReal Estate Investors Are Wiped Out in Bets Fueled by Wall Street Loans Behind ‘Suicide Squad,’ the Year’s Biggest Video-Game Flop Vietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media Billionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day\n\nNow it looks to do something similar with artificial intelligence. Nearly two years after the generative AI frenzy started, the company is preparing to lay out its vision for the technology. At its annual Worldwide Developers Conference Monday, Apple will announce plans to deeply integrate AI into its major apps and features — all while reiterating a commitment to privacy and security.\n\nThe company’s new AI system will be called Apple Intelligence, and it will come to new versions of the iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, according to people familiar with the plans. There also will be a partnership with OpenAI that powers a ChatGPT-like chatbot. And the tech giant is preparing to show new software for the Vision Pro headset, Apple Watch and TV platforms.\n\nThe AI features will account for about half of Apple’s WWDC keynote presentation, which starts at 10 a.m. Pacific time and typically runs for roughly two hours. Some of the buzziest features may be ones that don’t focus on AI, such as ones that make the iPhone more customizable and improve the Apple Watch. A company spokesperson declined to comment on the plans.\n\nHere is everything to expect during the keynote address:\n\nAI Features\n\nApple’s approach to AI will involve integrating the technology into as many of its apps as possible, in ways that ideally ease the daily lives of customers. The company is less focused on whiz-bang technology — like image and video generation — and instead concentrating on features with broad appeal. The new capabilities will be opt-in, meaning Apple won’t make users adopt them if they don’t want to. The company will also position them as a beta version. The processing requirements of AI will mean that users need an iPhone 15 Pro or one of the models coming out this year. If they’re using iPads or Macs, they’ll need models with an M1 chip at least. Apple’s AI features will be powered by its own technology and tools from OpenAI. The services will either rely on on-device processing or cloud-based computing, depending on the sophistication of the task at hand. The new operating systems will include an algorithm to determine which approach should be taken for any particular task. After years of discouraging the use of cloud servers for processing data — and even chastising rivals that did so — Apple risks sparking controversy by using the cloud for AI. So a large part of its announcement will focus on the precautions that the company is taking, including security features on the chips that it’s using in its data centers. Apple also won’t build user profiles based on customer data, and the company will generate reports to show that consumers’ information is secure and not being sold or read. At the same time, Apple will still tout the merits of on-device processing — when available. A major component of the AI push is summarization. Apple is planning features that can quickly recap articles and web pages in the Safari browser. They’ll also be able to sum up meetings notes, text messages and emails. And Apple is planning a catch-up feature for missed notifications, allowing users to quickly absorb what they missed when they weren’t looking at their phones. Another part of this is reply suggestions. The iPhone will be able to automatically create fully fleshed-out responses to emails and text messages on behalf of the user. Siri will be a part of the new AI push as well, with Apple planning a revamp to its voice-control service based on large language models — a core technology behind generative AI. For the first time, Siri users will be able to have precise control over individual features and actions within apps. For instance, people will be able to tell Siri to delete an email, edit a photo or summarize a news article. Over time, Apple will expand this to third-party apps and allow users to string multiple commands together into a single request. These features are unlikely to arrive until next year, however. Xcode, Apple’s software for developing apps, is getting a big AI infusion too. It will work similarly to Microsoft Corp.’s GitHub Copilot, which can complete code for programmers automatically. Though Apple has already been using this new developer tool internally, it’s unlikely to release it in its full form to third-party developers until next year. The Mail app is getting a big upgrade as well. It will include a Gmail-like feature that automatically categorizes incoming messages. One feature that will likely get a lot of attention among Gen Z — and perhaps the rest of the population — will be AI-created emoji. This will use AI to create custom emoji characters on the fly that represent phrases or words as they’re being typed. That means there will be many more options than the ones in the standardized emoji library that has long been built into the iPhone. Voice Memos will get a much-needed AI infusion, with the company adding the ability to automatically transcribe recordings. That’s a feature that Google Pixel devices and many third-party voice recording apps have had for years. AI is coming to the Photos app as well, which will embed new capabilities into photo editing. That will make it easier to enhance an image or remove a person or object from the frame.\n\nStory continues\n\nOther Software Upgrades\n\nFor decades, Apple’s industrial design team dictated the look and feel of all of the company’s products, ensuring that the software running on devices matched the clean lines and simplicity of the hardware. Now, customers are going to get a bit more say. In the latest iPhone operating system — iOS 18, codenamed Crystal — app icons will no longer have to remain in a neat grid. Instead, users will be able to place icons wherever they choose on their home screen. Moreover, icon colors will be customizable for the first time. That means users could make all their social media apps blue or finance-related icons green. All together, it’s considered to be the biggest upgrade to the home screen in the iPhone’s 17-year history. Control Center, another core part of the iPhone operating system, will get an updated interface that allows shortcut buttons to be rearranged within the Control Center view itself and placed across multiple pages. It will also have a new music widget and an updated interface for controlling smart home appliances. The Settings app, which has remained generally unchanged since the first version of the iPhone, is getting updated on iOS, iPadOS and macOS with a focus on improved navigation, better organization and more reliable search. The Messages app is getting some non-AI tweaks, including a change to the effects feature — the thing that lets you send fireworks and other visual elements to the people you’re texting. Users will now be able to trigger an effect with individual words, rather than the entire message. There will be new colorful icons for Tapbacks, which let you quickly respond to a message with a heart, exclamation point or other character (they’re currently gray). And users will have the ability to Tapback a message with any emoji. There’s another frequently requested feature coming as well: the ability to schedule a message to be sent later. And Apple announced last November that it will be bringing RCS — or rich communication services — to the iPhone later this year, reversing a long-held stance. That will make it easier to share messages with Android users. Apple is launching a Passwords app for iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15 that will offer an alternative to the 1Password and LastPass services. This will essentially be an app version of the company’s long-existing iCloud Keychain feature, which is currently hidden in the Settings app. The company has revamped the Calculator app and is bringing it to the iPad for the first time. On the iPad and Mac, the app will use the same overall interface — with round buttons — as the existing iPhone version. Calendar is getting some updates, including the ability to bring in data from the Reminders app. But the two apps aren’t getting combined on iOS or macOS. The Health app is getting some upgrades, including improved blood pressure data management — in preparation for future Apple Watches to have hypertension detection. There also will be support for a new hearing test feature on Apple’s AirPods. The earbuds are getting a new hearing-aid feature as well, but this may not be announced until later this year. The Health app, meanwhile, will better tailor data, such as cycle tracking, if a person is pregnant. The watchOS 11 update, codenamed Moonstone, will add an updated Siri interface that uniquely formats responses depending on the type of query. There are also major changes coming to some key apps such as Fitness. Safari in macOS 15, codenamed Glow, is getting some changes, but it seems unlikely that Apple is going to unveil its own ad blocker — something that’s been reported as a possibility. Advertisers already pushed back heavily against Apple’s App Tracking Transparency, or ATT, in iOS 14 a few years ago, and the company doesn’t need another privacy-related headache. Apple’s devices are getting new wallpaper packs, including Mac versions that reference old school icons and slogans. The iPhone wallpapers will have options that look similar to early ones on the phone. The company’s newest product, the Vision Pro, won’t get a major overhaul with visionOS 2 — codenamed Constellation — but the software will include features like new environments, the Passwords app and Vision Pro versions of iPad software. That should make the experience a bit more polished. Overall, the software is more focused on filling in gaps from the first version rather than breaking new ground.\n\nHardware and What’s Coming Later\n\nWWDC usually focuses on software, but the company has used the conference to unveil devices as well. Last year, Apple showed off the Vision Pro for the first time. But this time, we’re in a lull between releases. The next wave of devices aren’t expected until the fall, so there shouldn’t be any new hardware announcements next week. Still, the conference will set the stage for what’s to come. The new health features will be fundamental to upgraded Apple Watches in the fall. And the new AirPods enhancements will be core to multiple new models coming later this year. The AI features, meanwhile, should help Apple sell new iPhones and Macs with upgraded chips over the next year and beyond.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "The advent of generative artificial intelligence (AI) took the world by storm in 2023. Semiconductor companies have been ever busy since then. There is a plethora of complex components — hardware and software — that go into making the silicon chips that power large language models (LLMs). Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is arguably the largest beneficiary of the AI craze. Over the past 12 months, the acclaimed GPU maker’s share price has nearly quadrupled in value, making it one of the most lucrative semiconductor trades in a while.\n\nEquities investors looking to invest in semiconductor stocks should perhaps look beyond Nvidia. However, that doesn’t necessarily imply they would be avoiding exposure to AI. Without further ado, below are the three most undervalued semiconductor stocks to buy in June 2024.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) TSMC Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM) logo displayed on mobile phone screen\n\nSource: Piotr Swat / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (NYSE:TSM) is perhaps the most consequential chipmaker on the globe. In particular, TSM is a contract manufacturer that builds Nvidia’s advanced AI chips as well as the silicon for Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The contract chip manufacturer has enjoyed sizable earnings growth over the past couple of quarters due to a recovering consumer electronics market and robust demand for AI chips.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024 saw revenue rise 16.5% to NTD 592.6 billion ($18.6 billion), while net income increased 8.8% to NTD 225.5 billion ($7.2 billion). The firm accounted for about 61% of global chip foundry sales in Q4 of 2023, and this solid position in the market will make TSMC poised to capture the AI demand in the market.\n\nCurrently, the company can produce chips at a 3-nanometer process, and the business is aiming to be able to bring 2-nanometer production to the broader market by 2024.\n\nTrading at 26.5x forward earnings, the stock appears undervalued, and given its role in manufacturing AI chips, TSMC could make a good long-term bet on the space.\n\nBroadcom (AVGO) broadcom (AVGO) logo outside office building\n\nSource: Sasima / Shutterstock.com\n\nBroadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) is in the business of designing and selling microchips to power data processing across vast networks. Optical technology has proliferated with the rise of data centers and cloud networks. For example, optical interconnects have begun to replace traditional copper wires to facilitate data interchange between servers. The rise of artificial intelligence models has, in turn, increased demand for fast optical interconnects and network chips that help process data.\n\nStory continues\n\nOutside of network chips, Broadcom also designs custom AI chips for clients. At an event in March, the tech firm unveiled a sophisticated XPU designed for a consumer “consumer AI company.” That part of Broadcom’s business has Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) as a major client and also commands a high gross margin.\n\nBroadcom expects to sell about $10 billion worth of AI chips in 2024. While there will definitely be some competition from Nvidia, Broadcom’s comparatively lower valuation makes it a compelling choice for an AI chip bet.\n\nACM Research (ACMR) a magnifying glass enlarges the ACM logo on a website\n\nSource: Pavel Kapysh / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe final entry on this list is ACM Research (NASDAQ:ACMR). This semiconductor firm provides the sophisticated equipment semiconductor foundries use to manufacture chips. In essence, the point of ACM’s business is to enhance the yields for integrated chips during the manufacturing process.\n\nACM Research’s Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024 saw the firm increase revenue by 105% on a year-over-year basis to $152.2 million. That reflected higher sales of various core products, including single wafer and semi-critical cleaning equipment. Shipments, which include deliveries for revenue recognized during the quarter and “first tool systems” that may lead to sales in future quarters, skyrocketed 175% from last year to $245 million.\n\nACMR is seeing major growth and success as its mainland China customers have increased spending on mature, advanced node technology. The semiconductor firm trades at just 14.3x forward earnings, and its growth opportunity in China and other parts of East Asia makes it undervalued.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

        "content": "When the stock market goes up, dividend stocks are a good way to invest because they are all-weather investments. From 1991 to 2020, dividend-paying stocks had a 13.3% monthly standard deviation and non-dividend-paying stocks had 15.7%.\n\nBank of America predicts the S&P 500 will end 2024 between 4,700 and 4,900 points by 2024, driven by the Federal Reserve’s economic expansion, but since the index is already over 5,350, the BAC number is more of a benchmark now. What’s more, RBC and Goldman Sachs are also bullish on lower inflation, higher consumer spending and growth in U.S. corporate profits.\n\nIf you’re unsure if the positive stock momentum will continue, invest in three Dividend Aristocrat stocks with double-digit upsides. The first is giving its 227th bonus amid a challenging retail climate. Second, a home repair leader shows how digital capabilities may counter consumer spending declines. The last is an industry veteran maintaining a forty-year streak of dividend increases.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTarget (TGT) Image of the Target (TGT) logo on a storefront.\n\nSource: jejim / Shutterstock.com\n\nTarget (NYSE:TGT) will pay its 227th dividend on Jun. 10. Its annual yield of 2.99% is a cut above the consumer staples sector average of 1.89% and is sustainable, considering a 42% forward payment ratio, complimenting 22% upside in its stock.\n\nHowever, balancing the bull thesis is sluggish consumer spending, leading to earnings of $2.03 per share in the fiscal first quarter. That was short of Wall Street’s expectation for $2.06 as shoppers bought less food and other basics and less expensive clothing and home decor. Despite its first profit drop since November 2022, TGT reaffirmed its guidance.\n\nCustomers visiting the store or online dropped 1.9%, as did their average spending, but digital sales gained 1.4%, the first rise in over a year. When sales dropped, Target discounted thousands of diapers, bread, paper towels and other basics to give customers a better deal.\n\nTarget also used in-store activities and picture opportunities to promote Taylor Swift’s current album along with its collaboration with tennis and lifestyle brand Prince to sell pickleball gear.\n\nIn 2024, Target wants to renovate 2,000 current sites and establish 300 new ones. New Ulta Beauty stores-within-stores and changes to enable same-day services like drive-up and in-store pickup are among these improvements. Additionally, the business is relaunching Target Circle, its reward program, with new membership choices.​\n\nLowe’s (LOW) the front of a Lowe's store\n\nSource: Helen89 / Shutterstock.com\n\nLowe’s (NYSE:LOW) recent 5% dividend increase to $1.15 per share marks 52 consecutive years of hikes. The payout yields 2.1% and is much higher than the consumer cyclical sector average of around 1%. There is no surprise analysts project 16% upside for LOW.\n\nStory continues\n\nSales and profits for Lowe’s first quarter of 2024 exceeded Wall Street expectations. It made $3.06 per share, more than the $2.94 predicted. Sales for the quarter of $21.36 billion beat estimates of $21.12 billion but fell year over year. For the last five quarters, sales have shown a similar pattern as consumers spend less on kitchen renovations, garden sets and barbecues.\n\nSpending on do-it-yourself projects decreased, but Lowe’s focus on business customers and online sales made up for it.\n\nOn a brighter note, Lowe’s now has same-day delivery servicesfromShipt, DoorDash (NASDAQ:DASH) and Instacart. Adding on this service makes home improvement projects easier, especially in the spring and summer.\n\nWhat’s more, Apple‘s (NASDAQ:AAPL) Vision Pro, one of Lowe’s newest home remodeling tools, was shown off at SXSW 2024 to give customers a more immersive kitchen design experience in-store. Lowe’s stores also accept Apple Pay now, which makes shopping easier and more up-to-date for customers.\n\nPPG Industries (PPG) PPG Paints retail location.

        "title": "Nonfarm payrolls, Nvidia, GameStop - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- The monthly payrolls report is the highlight of the day's activity, as investors look for more clues as to when the Federal Reserve will start cutting interest rates. Nvidia remains in the spotlight, although short positions in the AI giant are rising, while volatility in meme stock GameStop is set to continue. .\n\n1. Nonfarm payrolls in spotlight\n\nThe day’s highlight will be the closely watched U.S. nonfarm payrolls report, which could provide clues on the timing of Federal Reserve interest rate cuts.\n\nExpectations are for the world's largest economy to have added 185,000 jobs last month - slightly more than April's 175,000, which was the smallest gain in half a year. The unemployment rate is expected to have remained below 4% for the 28th straight month.\n\nThat said, a slew of economic data this week have pointed to an easing of labor market conditions, creating the possibility of a downside surprise.\n\nInvestors had been worried that an overly strong economy might prevent the U.S. Federal Reserve from lowering rates this year at all. But those concerns have been, at least partly, alleviated by data showing slowing inflation as well as a cooling labor market.\n\nThe employment report could prove the economy is losing steam if it shows the slowdown in job creation has continued, but an upside surprise could deliver a nasty shock to markets.\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee meets next week, but is not expected to cut interest rates at that point. Markets currently price in 50 basis points of cuts by end-December, with the first cut most likely coming in September.\n\n2. Futures just higher ahead of jobs report\n\nU.S. stock futures traded marginally higher Friday, with investors wary of taking hefty positions ahead of the release of the key monthly jobs report.\n\nBy 04:00 ET (08:00 GMT), the Dow futures contract was 35 points, or 0.1%, higher, S&P 500 futures climbed 3 points, or 0.1%, and Nasdaq 100 futures rose by 23 points, or 0.1%.\n\nThe main Wall Street indices are all on course for a winning week. The Dow Jones Industrial Average stands 0.5% higher, the S&P 500 is gaining 1.4%, while the Nasdaq Composite is on pace for a 2.6% advance.\n\nThe main focus will be the nonfarm payrolls report [see above], as investors look for further evidence of a slowing economy that may support interest rate cuts from the Federal Reserve.\n\nThe Federal Reserve meets next week to discuss monetary policy, and this report comes a day after the European Central Bank cut rates for the first time since 2019.\n\n3. Short positions on Nvidia soar\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI, with its stock more than trebling over the last year, culminating in its market capitalization surging past $3 trillion on Wednesday.\n\nStory continues\n\nDemand for its AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nHowever, there has also been a sharp rise in short positions on Nvidia’s stock as it overtook Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-most valuable company on Wall Street.\n\nData from S3 Partners showed the notional value of short positions on Nvidia rose to $34.4 billion this week, representing about 1% of the firm’s overall market capitalization.\n\nNvidia is the “largest short in the U.S. market,” S3 Partners Managing Director Ihor Dusaniwsky said in an interview with Yahoo Finance.\n\n4. GameStop volatility to continue\n\nThe volatility in GameStop (NYSE:GME) trading is set to continue Friday, after the online stock influencer known as \"Roaring Kitty\" posted on YouTube that he would host a livestream later in the session.\n\nThe struggling videogame retailer surged 20% on Monday after the influencer’s - Keith Gill is his real name - Reddit profile returned with a post showing a $116 million bet on the stock after a three-year gap.\n\nGill was a key player in the 2021 rally of so-called meme stocks, including GameStop, that was fueled by individual investors on Reddit's wallstreetbets forum.\n\nGameStop stock surged nearly 50% on Thursday, and gained a further 30% in after hours trading.\n\n5. Crude set for hefty weekly losses\n\nCrude prices traded largely flat Friday, and are on course for a third straight week of declines on concerns over rising supply.\n\nBy 03:55 ET, the U.S. crude futures traded largely unchanged at $75.55 a barrel, while the Brent contract dropped 0.1% to $79.84 per barrel.\n\nSaudi Energy Minister Prince Abdulaziz bin Salman tried on Thursday to address concerns that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies, known as OPEC+, could lift output levels later this year.\n\nHe said the group can pause or reverse voluntary output increases if it decides the market is not strong enough.\n\nHowever, the crude benchmarks are still on track for weekly losses of around 2% in the wake of last weekend’s OPEC+ meeting.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNonfarm payrolls, Nvidia, GameStop - what's moving markets\n\nStock market rally pauses as US jobs data looms\n\nTake Five: Which way to look first?\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Is Apple Inc. (AAPL) A High Quality Stock to Buy Now?",
        "content": "We recently compiled the list of the 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy according to the hedge funds using the latest sentiment data. In this article, we are going to take a look at where Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) stands against the other quality stocks.\n\nInvesting in 2024 is significantly different from investing in the 1950s and onward. This is because these days investors have to. sift through thousands of stocks and countless data points and signals to separate the wheat from the chaff and make the right investment decisions. Amidst this hubris, the ability to pick out 'quality' stocks becomes important, and there's quite a lot of financial literature available that helps determine what such stocks are.\n\nTypically, stock analysis involves analyzing a firm's financial statements to determine profitability, operating strengths, cost control, asset utilization, and other metrics. Some of these are also present in financial literature that discusses quality stocks. One such research paper comes courtesy of researchers associated with Research Affiliates. They point out that metrics that typically define a quality stock include earnings stability, capital structure, profitability, accounting practices, and investing strategies. Within these, the quality factors that were also related to returns were investment strategies, dividend payouts, profitability, and accounting strategies.\n\nThe next thing to ask is, whether quality stocks are any different from standard run of the mill stocks when it comes to share price performance. For context, the last 12 months on the stock market have been dominated by a few key themes. These are artificial intelligence, inflation, interest rates, and GDP growth. Higher rates and inflation are bearish stock indicators, while growth and AI have proven to have kept the market buoyant at a time when rates are at two decade high levels. So, over the past year, exchange traded funds that track quality stocks have appreciated by 12% to 27%, the midpoint of which is slightly lower than the S&P 500's 23% price appreciation over the same time period. However, picking the right quality stocks appears to have its advantages as well, since the high end of the performance, i.e. 27%, is far higher than what the index has delivered.\n\nETFs and research aren't the only ones that talk about quality stocks. One hedge fund that's become quite well known for its focus on quality stocks is Cliff Asness’ AQR Capital Management. One of the largest hedge funds in the world, AQR had a 13F investment portfolio worth $58 billion as of Q1 2024 end according to Insider Monkey's research. Close to a quarter of its portfolio is invested in the technology industry, and the second biggest category is services stocks. AQR focuses on stocks that follow its strategy of Quality Minus Junk or QMJ. According to its founder Cliff Asness, a quality stock is defined by its shareholder payouts, growth, profitability, and sound financial and general management. We recently took a look at some top AQR Capital management stocks and you can check them out by looking at 13 Best Stocks To Buy Now According To Billionaire Cliff Asness.\n\nStory continues\n\nBefore we head to our list of the best quality stocks, a general overview of the stock market is relevant. Right now, investors are wondering when the first interest rate cuts might occur. The latest bit on this front came in the form of the Personal Consumption Expenditure (PCE) data from the Commerce Department. This data set revealed that the 12 month inflation in the US stood at 2.7% in April 2024, which was still higher than the Fed's preferred rate of 2%. Additionally, the data also provided investors with some bearish signals. These were apparent in the readings for consumer spending, which slowed down to 2% in the first quarter of 2024 over the robust 3.3% reading in Q4 2023.\n\nLower spending means less money sloshing in the economy, and while this might help reduce prices, it can also affect business performance, economic growth, and naturally, stock market performance. Data from the CME Fed Watch Tool shows that 47% of all investors polled expect a 25 basis point rate cut in September, while an additional 7.5% believe that the Fed might get generous and cut rates by as much as 50 basis points.\n\nWith these details in mind, let's take a look at some top quality stocks that hedge funds are buying.\n\nMethodology\n\nTo make our list of the best quality stocks to buy, we ranked the 30 largest constituents of a quality stock ETF and picked out those with the highest number of hedge fund investors in Q1 2024. By the way, Insider Monkey is an investing website that tracks the movements of corporate insiders and hedge funds. The reason is simple: our research has shown that we can outperform the market by imitating the top stock picks of the best hedge funds. Our quarterly newsletter’s strategy selects 14 small-cap and large-cap stocks every quarter and has returned 275% since May 2014, beating its benchmark by 150 percentage points (see more details here).\n\nThe computer and a laptop\n\n6. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)\n\nNumber of Hedge Fund Shareholders In Q1 2024: 150\n\nTech giant Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is a household name. These days, the rumor mill is adamant when it comes to Apple and AI as sources insist that Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) is interested in partnering up with OpenAI to bring AI functionality to its Siri virtual assistant and validate the consumer use cases for the highly hyped technology. Amidst broader concern on Wall Street about the iPhone and Apple's China woes, Wedbush's Dan Ives was filled with optimism in a May 2024 interview. During the talk, he shared that 70% of China's 225 million iPhones were yet to be upgraded, and the introduction of AI to the Pro model could very well see Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) grow the iconic Average Selling Price (ASP) in the region.\n\nAs Q1 2024 ended, 150 hedge funds part of Insider Monkey's database had held a stake in Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL). Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway held the largest stake which was worth $135 billion.\n\nDue to its heft, it's hard for a firm like Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) to continue to grow in triple digit percentages. However, its heft also allows the firm to generate massive amounts of cash that it then uses to buy back shares. Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s latest share buybacks are worth $110 billion, which is more valuable than the market value of most companies. Additionally, a forward P/E ratio of 29.33 makes the stock slightly overvalued compared to the S&P 500.\n\nPolen Capital shared some of the stresses that have plagued Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL)'s shares in 2024, which have stood out from big tech due to a rather modest 3.6% year to date gain. The fund shared in its Q1 2024 investor letter:\n\nThe largest relative contributors to the Portfolio’s performance during the first quarter were SAP, Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL) (not owned), and Amazon.\n\n...The zero weight to Apple was another notable relative contributor in the quarter. More recently, Apple has come under pressure from a confluence of issues ranging from a weak iPhone cycle, market share erosion in China, mounting regulatory pressure around App Store fees in Europe, and a lawsuit from the U.S. Justice Department accusing the company of anticompetitive practices in its iPhone business. All this has resulted in the stock down -11% year to date, underperforming the overall Index by -19%—Apple’s worst relative performance quarter since 2013. It remains a great business and one we follow, but we’re content not owning it right now, given its growth prospects relative to its valuation.”\n\nApple shares currently trade at a forward PE ratio of 29 which is much higher than Alphabet's and Meta's forward PE ratios. Overall, AAPL ranks 6th among the 13 Best Quality Stocks to Buy now. You can visit 13 Best Quality Stocks To Buy to see the other quality stocks that are on the hedge fund radar. While we acknowledge the potential of Apple as an investment, our conviction lies in the belief that AI stocks hold greater promise for delivering higher returns, and doing so within a shorter timeframe. If you are looking for an AI stock that is more promising than AAPL but that trades at less than 5 times its earnings, check out our report about the cheapest AI stock.\n\nREAD NEXT: Michael Burry Is Selling These Stocks and Jim Cramer is Recommending These Stocks.\n\nDisclosure: None.

        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- Apple Inc. will introduce a new homegrown app next week called Passwords, aiming to make it easier for customers to log in to websites and software, according to people with knowledge of the matter.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nBehind ‘Suicide Squad,’ the Year’s Biggest Video-Game Flop Billionaire-Friendly Modi Humbled by Indians Who Make $4 a Day A Struggling Business Park Deals a Blow to Singapore's Regional Hub Ambitions ‘Everything Is Not Going to Be OK’ in Private Equity, Apollo’s Co-President Says Vietnam Tycoon Sentenced to Death Faces New Charges: Media\n\nThe company is planning the new app as part of iOS 18, iPadOS 18 and macOS 15, the next major versions of its iPhone, iPad and Mac operating systems, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the initiative hasn’t been announced. The software, which can generate passwords and keep track of them, will be unveiled June 10 at Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference.\n\nThe new app is powered by the iCloud Keychain, a long-existing Apple service that can sync passwords and account information between different devices. This capability was previously hidden inside the company’s settings app or presented when a user logs in to a website.\n\nBy turning the feature into a dedicated app, Apple is trying to get more people to use secure passwords and bolster the privacy of its devices. But the move also ramps up competition with third-party software. The new app will take on password managers like 1Password and LastPass, and Apple will allow users to import passwords from rival services.\n\nA representative for Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment.\n\nThe app features a list of user logins and splits details into different categories, such as accounts, Wi-Fi networks and Passkeys, an Apple-promoted password replacement that relies on Face ID and Touch ID. Like most password managers, the data can be auto-filled into websites and apps when a user goes to log in.\n\nThe software will also work on the Vision Pro headset and Windows computers. And it can support verification codes and serve as an authentication app similar to Google Authenticator.\n\nThe Passwords push is just one component of the WWDC event. The main focus will be Apple’s artificial intelligence initiative, which will add features like notification summaries, instant photo editing, AI-created emoji and a more powerful version of the Siri digital assistant. Apple will also announce a partnership with OpenAI to use the ChatGPT chatbot.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nSam Altman Was Bending the World to His Will Long Before OpenAI David Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

(NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nWood explained that the decision to reduce Nvidia holdings was based on the belief that Nvidia's success would benefit other companies.\n\nAs a result, Ark began evaluating potential beneficiaries within the AI sector.\n\nDespite Nvidia's ongoing prominence, Wood highlighted that the semiconductor industry is experiencing a pause as companies reassess their AI strategies.\n\nDuring her remarks, Wood acknowledged that some companies anticipated to gain from AI advancements have yet to see the expected revenue boosts, with Salesforce Inc (NYSE:CRM) being a notable example.\n\nAlso Read: Cathie Wood: El Salvador's Bitcoin And AI Push Could Grow Its GDP 10X In 5 Years\n\nMeanwhile, she reaffirmed her strong stance on autonomous driving as the \"biggest AI project on earth,\" reiterating her faith in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nArk increased its Tesla position in the first quarter despite concerns about slowing electric vehicle demand and competition from Chinese rival BYD Company (OTC:BYDDY).\n\nAccording to Ark's 2023 analysis, Tesla's share price is projected to reach $2,000 by 2027, with potential highs and lows ranging from $2,500 to $1,400.\n\nAdditionally, the Ark Venture Fund recently disclosed stakes in xAI, OpenAI, and Anthropic, signifying its commitment to AI innovation.\n\nWood gained widespread recognition during the pandemic for her bold investment calls, particularly in companies like Tesla, Zoom Video Communications Inc (NASDAQ:ZM), and Roku Inc (NASDAQ:ROKU).\n\nDespite a 12% decline in the ARK Innovation ETF (NYSE:ARKK) this year, largely due to Tesla's 30% drop, the fund had an impressive 68% gain last year.\n\nWood predicts significant interest rate cuts in 2024, driven by economic recessions and rate reductions in several countries.\n\nStory continues\n\nDisclsaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nCathie Wood Ark Photo courtesy Benzinga YouTube and Unsplash\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTESLA (TSLA): Free Stock Analysis Report NVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article Cathie Wood Remains Bullish On AI Investments Despite Nvidia Stock Adjustments originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "content": "DexCom Inc. DXCM recently announced the direct connectivity of the Dexcom G7 Continuous Glucose Monitoring (CGM) system with the Apple Watch. This added feature is now available to users in the United States, the UK and Ireland, with additional markets launching the feature soon.\n\nThe Dexcom G7 provides customers with the liberty and convenience of real-time glucose readings on their wrist as the first and only CGM system that links directly to the Apple Watch. This feature is likely to provide users confidence even when their iPhone is not with them.\n\nMore on the Feature\n\nDexcom G7 users may go for a run, have a meal out and feel comfortable leaving their iPhone behind as the system sports a dedicated Bluetooth connection that allows it to deliver glucose information and tailored alerts directly to their Apple Watch. The Dexcom G7 is the only CGM system that can show blood glucose levels on several screens independently, such as a smartphone, smartwatch, receiver, or linked automated insulin administration system.\r\n\r\nApart from the advantages of using Direct to Apple Watch with Dexcom G7, diabetic patients can monitor additional vital health indicators that may influence blood glucose levels by utilizing Apple's Activity, Cycle Tracking, Sleep, and further health capabilities on Apple Watch, iPhone, and iPad. All these data are safely kept in the Health app, where users may examine it, along with any Dexcom G7 data they choose to save, allowing them to access all their diabetes-related health records in one location.\n\nTo use Direct to Apple Watch, users must have the Dexcom G7 app version 2.1, an Apple Watch Series 6 or later running watchOS 10 or later, and an iPhone running iOS 17 or later.\n\nMore on Dexcom G7 CGM System\n\nSince the international conference of Advanced Technologies and Treatments of Diabetes 2023, Dexcom has expanded access to its ground-breaking real-time CGM technology by introducing its best-in-class G7 sensor into 16 new markets. Patients with diabetes of any kind, including gestational, who are two years or older can use Dexcom G7. This wearable glucose meter can be worn day or night on the back of the upper arm for up to 10 days, and it requires replacement.\n\nThe Dexcom G7 CGM System is designed to be user-friendly, robust and efficient. CGM uses a wearable sensor to continuously monitor blood sugar levels. Without the inconvenience of fingersticks or scanning, Dexcom CGM Systems transmit your blood glucose readings in real time to a handheld receiver or smart device.\n\nPatients can control their glucose and accomplish outcomes like a lower A1C and more time in range by making better decisions about what to eat, how much to exercise and how to take their medications when they have simpler access to real-time CGM data.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe Dexcom G7 CGM sensor needs only 30 minutes to warm up, and there is a 12-hour grace period to replace finished sensors for a seamless transition between sessions. The alert settings on the system have also been improved.\n\nIndustry Prospects\n\nPer a report by MarketsandMarkets, the global digital diabetes management market was estimated to be $18.9 billion in 2023 and is expected to reach $35.8 billion by 2028 at a growth rate of 13.6%.\n\nThe market is being driven by escalating diabetes care solutions and technological developments that have made it possible to introduce highly adaptable solutions. Other significant drivers include the increasing popularity of the use of connected devices and apps as well as the growing adoption of cloud-based solutions.\n\nGiven the market potential, the improvement and innovation of new features for its CGM system are likely to provide a significant boost to Dexcom’s business.\n\nNotable Developments\n\nDexcom recently announced the FDA clearance of its Stelo glucose biosensor, which is available over-the-counter to consumers without a prescription. Stelo's approval of non-prescription use would further facilitate this population's access to cutting-edge CGM technology.\n\nIn December 2023, Dexcom announced the Dexcom G7 CGM System connectivity with the t: slim X2 insulin pump by Tandem Diabetes Care in the United States, marking the first AID integration with the Dexcom G7 CGM.\n\nDexcom also unveiled its new state-of-the-art manufacturing facility located in Athenry Co. Galway. With the ability to produce millions of Dexcom rtCGM sensors annually, the new plant is likely to contribute to the betterment of diabetes patients throughout Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.\n\nPrice Performance\n\nFor the past six months, DXCM’s shares have lost 0.7% against the industry’s rise of 13.9%. The S&P 500 increased 15.5% in the same time frame.

        "content": "What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday?\n\nNvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock surged to record highs on Wednesday, valuing the company at over $3 trillion and making it the world’s second most valuable company, surpassing Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nNvidia plans a ten-for-one stock split on June 7 to attract more individual investors.\n\nNvidia’s valuation has soared 147% in 2024 due to strong demand for AI processors from companies like Microsoft Corp (NASDAQ:MSFT), Meta Platforms Inc (NASDAQ:META), and Alphabet Inc (NASDAQ:GOOG) (NASDAQ:GOOGL).\n\nOn Wednesday, Nvidia added nearly $150 billion in market capitalization, more than the entire value of AT&T Inc (NYSE:T), Reuters reports.\n\nJake Dollarhide, CEO of Longbow Asset Management, remarked, “Nvidia is making money on AI right now, and companies like Apple and Meta are spending on AI.”\n\nNvidia’s CEO Jensen Huang received widespread media coverage at Computex in Taipei. Meanwhile, Apple faces weak iPhone demand and stiff competition in China.\n\nAccording to S&P Dow Jones Indices, five companies, including Nvidia, Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet, and Amazon.Com Inc (NASDAQ:AMZN), account for about 60% of the S&P 500’s total return of over 12% this year. Nvidia alone has contributed roughly a third of this gain, following a 147% surge in 2024.\n\nAngelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones, highlighted potential market vulnerability if these key stocks falter and the rest of the market does not provide support.\n\nTajinder Dhillon, senior research analyst at LSEG, expects the earnings gap between the “Magnificent Seven” companies and the rest of the S&P 500 to narrow as 2024 progresses.\n\nRecent reports indicated that Nvidia is preparing to ramp up investments in Taiwan, with plans to build its second supercomputer there. This underscores the importance of crucial supplier Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM).\n\nNvidia has already tapped Samsung Electronics Co for the supply of high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips and is now eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier to overcome the supply chain constraints.\n\nAnalysts reaffirmed Nvidia as the lead AI beneficiary after the recent Taiwan event, citing opportunities with its Hopper platform and Blackwell B100/200.\n\nNvidia stock gained over 217% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the stock via SPDR S&P 500 (NYSE:SPY) and iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (NYSE:IVV).\n\nPrice Action: NVDA shares traded lower by 0.83% at $1,214.17 at the last check on Thursday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nStory continues\n\nPhoto via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nNVIDIA (NVDA): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Nvidia Stock On Thursday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Nvidia stock pulls back after topping $3 trillion market cap mark",
        "content": "Nvidia (NVDA) stock retreated in early trading on Thursday, after a rip-roaring rally sent the company past a $3 trillion market cap for the first time.\n\nNvidia's stock price opened at $1,240.09 per share before dipping around 0.4% in early morning trading.\n\nShares of the Wednesday's move pushed the chip giant past Apple, making it the second-most-valuable company on the US stock market, before the early retreat. Microsoft currently holds the top spot.\n\nThe rally came amid a broader gain in tech stocks, with softer US economic data and a decline in Treasury yields boosting markets on hopes the Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as July.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for investor enthusiasm in AI, which accelerated with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nThe stock is up over 140% this year and 200% over the last year; Nvidia shares have gained more than 3,300% in the last five years. Over those same periods, the Nasdaq has gained a more modest 14%, 29%, and 126%, respectively.\n\nNvidia shares were steady in pre-market trading on Thursday, up less than 1%\n\nThis week's rally in Nvidia follows an announcement on Sunday from its CEO, Jensen Huang, who said at an industry conference the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip — called the Blackwell Ultra — in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang arrives at an event at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan, June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia also announced that its stock would undergo a 10-for-1 split on June 7, and the company will raise its dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only game in town.\n\nAMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nStory continues\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia continues to maintain its grip on the AI space, and it will do so for the foreseeable future.

        "title": "Streamers like Netflix, Max, and Peacock are raising prices — here’s why",
        "content": "It's getting more expensive to watch your favorite streaming shows — especially if you want to watch them without commercials.\n\nAd-free streaming plans have become a primary target of price increases as media companies like Netflix (NFLX), Max (WBD), and Amazon (AMZN) raise the costs of their respective offerings — all while keeping the prices of cheaper, ad-supported options unchanged.\n\nIt sounds counterintuitive at first. Why would streamers want to raise the costs of premium tiers at a time when consumers are becoming more choosy about the services they subscribe to? Wouldn't they rather users sign up for more expensive options than cheaper ones?\n\nNot necessarily, experts say.\n\n\"When you want to optimize revenue, you would actually increase the price of the ad-free tier because even if users turn to the ads, you're still making the same money,\" said Marc DeBevoise, who helped launch CBS All Access and now serves as CEO of streaming tech company Brightcove.\n\nDeBevoise explained it all boils down to the additional ad revenue per user. Added on top of the subscription price of the lower tier, the total revenue per user will typically end up matching the premium option.\n\nThat's why companies may decide to increase ad-free pricing since they want to be \"economically differentiated in the two plans,\" DeBevoise said.\n\n\"You want to have the ad-free tier effectively make you more money per user per month, if possible. So I could see [companies] tweaking the pricing for that reason,\" he continued. \"These are revenue maximizing opportunities, not necessarily trying to push more subscribers [to the ad tier.]\"\n\nEarlier this week, Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) announced it will raise the prices of its ad-free plans on its streaming service, Max, by $1 each to $16.99 for ad-free and $20.99 for its “ultimate” tier, which allows four concurrent streams and 4K streaming options. The price hikes come just ahead of the second season of Warner Bros.' blockbuster \"Game of Thrones\" prequel, \"House of the Dragon,\" which is scheduled for release on June 16.\n\nPrior to Max's increases, Comcast's (CMCSA) flagship streaming service, Peacock, announced price hikes that will come in July, just ahead of the 2024 Paris Olympics, after it upped prices for the first time last summer.\n\nThe streamer plans to raise prices by $2 for its Peacock Premium plan and mostly ad-free Peacock Premium Plus tier to $7.99 and $13.99, respectively.\n\nThe timing of both companies’ respective increases is important.\n\nStory continues\n\n\"You seek to raise the prices in two types of moments. One is when you know folks don't want to cancel and you have a large, full-ordered audience that wants to stick around for the amazing things you're about to deliver,\" DeBevoise said, referencing Peacock's upcoming Olympics coverage and Max's \"House of the Dragon\" premiere.\n\n\"The other is when people are not paying attention and just let their subscriptions roll on their credit cards,\" he added, noting many price adjustments are often tested on a smaller cohort of users before platforms roll them out to a larger subscriber base. It's getting more expensive to watch your favorite streaming shows (Courtesy: Getty Images) (simpson33 via Getty Images)\n\nVirtually all of the major streaming companies raised the cost of their respective services throughout the course of last year amid greater profitability challenges and a push to reaccelerate top-line growth.\n\nBut subscribers aren't necessarily sticking around. According to the latest data from consumer measurement platform Antenna released at the end of May, US subscriber churn — or the act of paying users abandoning their streaming plans — stood at 4.6% in April, higher than the 4.2% seen in the same month last year. Still, the data was well off of the records reported at the start of the year in January, when overall churn came in at 6.1%.\n\nIn terms of whether or not there will be a ceiling on price hikes, DeBevoise said media companies are still \"figuring out the audience,\" especially as the content bundle consistently shifts for each streamer over time — whether it be tentpole event coverage like the Olympics or the exclusive rights to a sports game.\n\n\"Ultimately, they're trying to find a very profitable model,\" he said. \"The real question will be exactly what price. You're going to see that continue to be tested.\"\n\nThat means more price hikes will likely be on the horizon.\n\nAlexandra Canal is a Senior Reporter at Yahoo Finance.

        "content": "For Immediate Release\n\nChicago, IL – June 6, 2024 – Today, Zacks Investment Ideas feature highlights Apple's AAPL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN.\n\nDoes Apple's (AAPL) AI Focus Make It a Buy Ahead of WWDC?\n\nApple's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), scheduled on Jun 10, is expected to provide a glimpse into the iPhone maker's AI endeavors. It is highly anticipated that the iOS 18 release will offer AI features, including a more intelligent Siri.\n\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Microsoft, Amazon and its other peers in the \"Magnificent Seven\" group.\n\nIts competitive position is expected to improve with AAPL's focus on adding a plethora of AI-enabled features that automatically generate playlists for Apple Music, edit photos through written or spoken commands and create custom emojis.\n\nA plausible collaboration with Microsoft-backed OpenAI will give iPhone users access to ChatGPT. Safari is expected to get an upgrade with a new intelligent search feature.\n\nApple is expected to launch its first major software update with visionOS 2 for its mixed-reality device Vision Pro at WWDC. It is also expected to add a few AI-enabled updates to iPadOS 18 and macOS 15.\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL's Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to \"Apple's unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple's silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.\"\n\nApple has been active on the acquisition front to boost its footprint in the AI space. It acquired nearly 32 AI start-ups in 2023 alone. Moreover, it has been looking for a partner to harness the abilities of cloud-based GenAI.\n\nPer sources, including Bloomberg, it has been actively involved in discussions with Alphabet to license Google's Large Language Model (LLM), Gemini, for the iPhone. Apple reportedly has developed its own LLM called AppleGPT based on a framework called Ajax.\n\nIntegration of AI and LLMs into Apple devices — iPhone, iPad, and Mac — will make them faster and more efficient, thereby providing an impetus to its already massive installed base for upgrades. This is expected to drive top-line growth in the long haul.\n\nApple's robust Services business, strong cash balance ($162.34 billion as of Mar 30, 2024) and record share buyback program worth $110 billion are other positives.\n\nStory continues\n\nStiff Competition, China Worries Hurt AAPL's Near-Term\n\nApple shares have returned 1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector's 16.1% growth. It has suffered from stiff competition and weak iPhone sales in China.\n\nChina's growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government's directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone's demand.\n\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, most among the top five vendors.\n\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\n\nCanalys forecasts that Gen AI-capable smartphones will reach 12% of shipments in 2024 in mainland China, ahead of the global average of 9%. Xiaomi led the GenAI-capable smartphone market with its flagship 14 series in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nConclusion\n\nApple's near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter's (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\n\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.07 billion, indicating 1.55% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has remained unchanged at $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\n\nInvestors should wait for a better entry point for Apple, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term. You can see the complete list of today's Zacks #1 Rank (Strong Buy) stocks here.\n\nMoreover, Apple is trading at a premium with a forward 12-month P/E of 27.75X compared with the Zacks Computer-Mini industry's 27.03X and higher than the median of 27.37X, reflecting a stretched valuation.\n\nWhy Haven't You Looked at Zacks' Top Stocks?\n\nSince 2000, our top stock-picking strategies have blown away the S&P's +7.0 average gain per year. Amazingly, they soared with average gains of +44.9%, +48.4% and +55.2% per year.\n\nToday you can access their live picks without cost or obligation.\n\nSee Stocks Free >>\n\nMedia Contact\n\nZacks Investment Research\n\n800-767-3771 ext. 9339\n\nsupport@zacks.com\n\nhttps://www.zacks.com\n\nPast performance is no guarantee of future results.

        "title": "3 Stocks Marjorie Taylor Greene Just Loaded Up On",
        "content": "For better, or for worse, most people who follow the news have heard of Representative Marjorie Taylor Greene in the last couple of years. Whether it be due to her theatrics on Capitol Hill or her relatively polarizing posts on social media, the representative from Georgia’s 14th congressional district has made a name for herself in the political world.\n\nFurthermore, as tends to be the trend with politicians on both sides of the aisle, her position in Congress has allowed her to make some savvy investments. Thanks to Quiver Quantitative we can see rough estimates of the date, time and size of her purchases of different stocks in the market.\n\nDue to her likely increased levels of awareness or information on potentially game-changing legislation, keeping an eye on Marjorie Taylor Greene stocks could be a solid way to predict performance. As such here are three companies Marjorie Taylor Greene recently gave her investment.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nApple (AAPL) Close-up of Apple (AAPL) retail store Logo in Honolulu at the Ala Moana Center. Advertising the latest generation of the ipad, iphones, and ipods with a Retina display.\n\nSource: Eric Broder Van Dyke / Shutterstock.com\n\nWhatever your thoughts on the new iPad might be, Apple’s  (NASDAQ:AAPL) focus on continuously improving its ARM architecture computer chips has put it in a race with itself. It’s hard to see exactly what potential legislative decisions Marjorie Taylor Greene has exposure to, but there’s a chance that she’s hedging on legislation related to the company’s technology.\n\nAt any rate due to the overall reputation of Apple and the size of a chunk of the personal computer and smartphone market, that it commands it’s hard to say that Apple is a bad long-term investment. In fact, out of the recent trades that MJT has made, it’s one of her only preferable ones in the last two weeks.\n\nMoreover, according to Quiver Quantitative, she took a relatively modest position in the stock between 1,001 and $15,000 purchase on May 21, 2024. This play would likely be a safe one for the average investor given AAPL’s consistent performance.\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices (AMD) In this photo illustration, the AMD logo is shown on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: Pamela Marciano / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother tech stock that MJT favors is Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD). The graphics processing and central processing fabless chip maker has played second fiddle to competitors like Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), for much of its last decade of operations. However, just like with Apple, MJT may be privy to specific technology-related legislation or funding that could help bolster AMD’s value in the long run.\n\nThus, it’s no surprise that she took another position valued anywhere between 1,001 and $15,000 and the tech stock on the same day she bought Apple on May 21, 2024. AMD has taken a gentle dip since her initial investment, but all economic and industry tailwinds project a journey further up in the years to come.\n\nStory continues\n\nAs a result, investors in AMD can rest assured the stock will likely continue to perform in line with its 12-month growth of 35%. Ultimately, it’s probably one of the safer Marjorie Taylor Greene stocks to buy.\n\nCaterpillar (CAT) stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nBreaking with the tech convention of her other two buys on May 21, 2024, MJT invested another medium amount of money into Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT). From an analytical standpoint, this purchase comes as an intriguing one. That’s because many debate whether or not the legacy heavy machinery producer’s stock price is reaching its limit as it moves toward retesting its all-time high.\n\nIt’s likely to keep growing thanks to predictions for increased construction, mining, and other infrastructure developments. These trends suggest Caterpillar will likely continue to have customers for the foreseeable future. This is especially likely considering the vast array of machines CAT supplies, making it the world’s top producer and seller of the construction machinery category.\n\nOverall, MJT may have taken this position in preparation for some form of new legislation that interacts directly with American manufacturing or construction and development.

        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semiconductor Stock On Thursday?\n\nOn Thursday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co (NYSE:TSM) shares hit a record high due to the global AI frenzy.\n\nAdditionally, TSMC is in talks with ASML Holding NV (NASDAQ:ASML) to acquire advanced lithography machines, expected by year-end.\n\nMeanwhile, Chinese AI chip firms are designing less powerful processors to comply with U.S. sanctions, underscoring the importance of TSMC.\n\nRecent reports indicated TSMC’s plans to raise the prices of its services.\n\nTSMC also announced a buyback of 3.25 million shares and plans for a $7.8 billion facility in Singapore with Vanguard International Semiconductor and NXP Semiconductors NV (NASDAQ:NXPI).\n\nTSMC’s surge followed Nvidia Corp’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock gains, which reached a record high, breaching Apple Inc’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) market cap. TSMC is a key technology supplier for Nvidia’s AI chips.\n\nNvidia looks to boost its investments in Taiwan, including constructing another supercomputer in Taiwan following the launch of Taipei-1 in 2023.\n\nInterestingly, Nvidia has also tapped Samsung Electronics Co for high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chip supply and is eying Intel Corp (NASDAQ:INTC) as a potential supplier as TSMC struggled with supply chain constraints.\n\nTSMC, which won the crown of the leading global foundry with a 62% market share, indicated 10% annual growth in the semiconductor industry, excluding memory chips.\n\nAnalysts don’t see the fizzling of the AI demand anytime soon, hailing Nvidia as the key beneficiary. Nvidia’s moat extends beyond gaming, including artificial intelligence, cloud computing, and data centers.\n\nTSMC stock gained over 63% in the last 12 months.

        "title": "Ark's Cathie Wood defends AI strategy despite offloading Nvidia shares below $150",
        "content": "Cathie Wood's decision to sell most of Ark Investment Management’s Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) holdings when the stock was trading below $150 per share has proven to be costly. The transaction caused the renowned money manager's firm to miss out on a rally that could have brought in a roughly $1.2 billion return.\n\nNevertheless, ARK Invest CEO claims that her firm is strategically positioned in artificial intelligence (AI) assets. Speaking at the Greenwich Economic Forum in Hong Kong this week, Wood highlighted Ark’s diversified exposure to emerging AI companies while maintaining Nvidia shares in specialized portfolios and the flagship fund.\n\nArk Investment initially bought Nvidia shares in 2014 when they were trading at $4 on a split-adjusted basis. The majority of Nvidia sales took place in November 2022, just before the release of ChatGPT spark a massive artificial intelligence-driven rally in the stock market.\n\nDespite selling most of its position before Nvidia's recent surge, Wood mentioned that Nvidia shares have gained 15% since May 24, following strong first-quarter sales and an optimistic second-quarter forecast. The stock has more than octupled since late 2022, reaching around $1,224, with a market value surpassing $3 trillion, overtaking Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL).\n\nReflecting on the decision to reduce Nvidia holdings, Wood said, \"We began to look at other companies that could benefit from AI if Nvidia continued its rapid ascent.\"\n\nWhile she remains positive about the semiconductor sector, she acknowledged a strategic pause as companies reassess their AI strategies. Wood cited Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) Inc. as an example of a company that has yet to see the expected revenue boost from AI this earnings season.\n\nWood also defended Ark's continued investment in Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) Inc., describing it as the \"biggest AI project on earth\" due to its advancements in autonomous driving. Ark increased its Tesla holdings in the first quarter amid concerns over a slowdown in electric vehicle consumption and competition from Chinese automaker BYD Co (SZ:002594).\n\nWood said earlier that she is still not convinced by Nvidia's sky-high valuation. \"I've watched Nvidia throughout my career, ever since it went public. It's a very cyclical stock,\" Wood said, adding that over-ordering of Nvidia's GPUs could lead to a painful inventory correction for the company.\n\nDuring the pandemic, Wood gained prominence for her investment calls on companies like Tesla, Zoom (NASDAQ:ZM), and Roku (NASDAQ:ROKU), leading to a surge in Ark’s assets, peaking at over $60 billion in early 2021.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, the ARK Innovation ETF, now valued at around $6.4 billion, has declined nearly 16% this year, with Tesla’s stock losing nearly 30% of its value. Despite this, the fund outperformed benchmarks last year with a 68% gain, driven by expectations of peaked interest rates and potential rate cuts.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nArk's Cathie Wood defends AI strategy despite offloading Nvidia shares below $150\n\nLululemon added to JPM's focus list after earnings\n\nNovo Nordisk braces for generic challenge to Ozempic, Wegovy in China\n\nView comments",

        "title": "The 3 Most Undervalued Renewable Energy Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "Renewable energy stocks broadly have been consistent underperformers over the past year. According to Koyfin, the iShares Global Clean Energy ETF (NASDAQ:ICLN), which holds more than $2.4 billion worth of renewable energy stocks, plummeted 20.4% in 2023, while the rest of the U.S. equities market enjoyed a sizable rally. The reason for such a disparity is related to elevated interest rates and their disproportionate effect on capital-intensive renewable energy prices. Moreover, oil and gas prices dipped from their 2022 highs, giving consumers and businesses less incentive to switch to a renewable energy resource.\n\nIn 2024, renewable energy stocks have largely continued to tick downward in value, particularly as the possibility of near-term rate cuts becomes increasingly far-fetched. This pullback has created an opportunity for value investors to buy up some undervalued renewable energy stocks. Not all renewable energy companies have seen their shares fall, of course, but even the lucky ones still trade at attractive valuations.\n\nFirst Solar (FSLR) Person holding smartphone with logo of US renewable energy company First Solar Inc. (FSLR) on screen in front of website. Focus on phone display. Unmodified photo.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nFirst Solar (NASDAQ:FSLR) is a well established manufacturer of photovoltaic solar modules. Founded in 1999, the solar panel firm has built a multi-billion-dollar business with manufacturing facilities worldwide. First Solar’s Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024 has been the company’s most recent highlight. Net sales increased 45% yearly to $794.1 million, despite decreasing 31% sequentially. The quarter-to-quarter decrease was due to a “seasonal reduction in volume” that the company and investors had already expected.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLooking towards profits, First Solar generated $236.6 million in net income, representing a net margin of 30%. During an earnings call, management highlighted the firm’s ability to grow revenue and earnings and produce 3.6 gigawatts of modules despite the problem of “oversupply” brought upon by Chinese solar companies. Management also noted how data centers will be a key growth lever as data center operators, including Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOG) desire to increase consumption while striving to be carbon-free.\n\nA good earnings report with new import tariffs on solar modules has led to First Solar’s share price skyrocketing more than 58% YTD. Still, FSLR only trades at 17.8x forward earnings, possibly meaning there is still opportunities for multiple expansion going forward.\n\nLinde (LIN) Logo of Linde AG (LIN) in Hanover, Germany - The Linde Group is a multinational chemical company\n\nSource: nitpicker / Shutterstock.com\n\nStory continues\n\nLinde (NASDAQ:LIN) is the world’s largest industrial gas producer based out of the United Kingdom. The industrial gas firm primarily manufactures and distributes atmospheric gases such as oxygen and nitrogen and processes gases, including helium, hydrogen and ammonia. Enterprises vary across industries including steelmaking, chemicals, healthcare, petroleum refining and technology and leverage these kinds of industrial gases in their industrial processes.\n\nDespite delivering a solid year of growth in 2023, Linde’s management team predicted a slower 2024 due to present risks in its metal and mining, and electronics end-markets. That has, so far, turned out to be the case. In their Q1 earnings report for fiscal year 2024, Linde reported lower volumes in its Americas and European businesses, which underwhelmed investors. The industrial gas firm also cut its capital expenditure forecast, a bell-weather measure of product demand, while investors had been hoping for an outlook raise.\n\nLinde’s current economic troubles shouldn’t worry long-term investors. The global economy is full of uncertainties at this moment. Still, Linde’s position in the market is undeniable. Moreover, the firm’s electronics end-market is likely to rebound, as semiconductor firms like AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) are seeing improved demand in their PC segments. Trading at around 27.4x forward earnings, Linde remains an attractive long-term investment.\n\nNextEra Energy (NEE) Nextra Energy (NEE) website on a mobile phone screen\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nNextEra Energy (NYSE:NEE) makes the final entry on our list. The company generates, transmits and distributes electricity throughout North America. In recent years, the firm has worked hard to transition from relying on natural gas and other non-renewable energy resources to building up its clean energy portfolio.\n\nThe firm delivered a robust Q1 earnings report. The “Florida Power & Light” business segment placed 1,640 megawatts (MW) of solar energy into service, growing net income from $1.1 billion to $1.2 billion on a year-over-year basis. The “NextEra Energy Resources” segment added 2,765 MW of renewable energy and storage to its backlog. The renewable energy firm has maintained its guidance and expects to grow adjusted earnings per share by 6-8% in 2024. NextEra also appears committed to returning capital to investors. The company announced a 0.515/share dividend in late May.\n\nOn a year-to-date basis, NEE shares have risen nearly 30%. Trading at 23.2x forward earnings, the firm continues to be a compelling turnaround story in the energy world. As NextEra continues to grow its renewable energy portfolio, the firm will likely be a key player in the space for some time.\n\nOn the date of publication, Tyrik Torres did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article. The opinions expressed in this article are those of the writer, subject to the InvestorPlace.com Publishing Guidelines.\n\nTyrik Torres has been studying and participating in financial markets since he was in college, and he has particular passion for helping people understand complex systems.

        "title": "Surprise! Why Wall Street Is Starting to Give Rivian Stock More Respect.",
        "content": "Two key, recent events finally gave Rivian (NASDAQ:RIVN) stock a significantly larger portion of the respect that it deserves. Analysts are starting to talk positively about the electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer and new partnerships are looking possible.\n\nMoreover, the automaker reiterated last month it believes it can generate positive gross margins in the fourth quarter. There are also multiple signs that demand for its EVs remains strong. Finally, I remain upbeat on its upcoming EV lineup and its ability to generate increased revenue from its commercial business.\n\nGiven these points, I continue to recommend that investors buy RIVN stock.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nTwo Recent, Key Developments\n\nIn a note to investors on Jun. 2, well-known Morgan Stanley analyst Adam Jonas wrote Rivian is “uniquely positioned within autos (other than Tesla) on scaling a fully integrated software stack critical to unlocking the AI opportunity.” Jonas wrote the note after meeting with Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe. He pointed out that Rivian relies entirely on its own software and advanced driver assistance systems. The analyst said the firm is well-positioned to partner with veteran automakers that want to reduce the amount of electronic control units that they use.\n\nAnd speaking of partnerships, last month DigiTimes, a tech news website, indicatedApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) was considering partnering with Rivian. Asked about the possibility during the automaker’s Q1 earnings call, Scaringe did not deny the two companies could form an alliance. Indeed, he responded by noting that his company has a history of launching partnerships.\n\nGiven the report and Scaringe’s response, I believe Apple and Rivian will eventually unveil a partnership.\n\nSince the Apple rumor surfaced, RIVN stock has jumped 22% in slightly less than a month. I believe that the rumor — which was given significant credibility by Scaringe’s non-denial — in conjunction with Jonas’ upbeat note makes the Street much more optimistic about the stock.\n\nPositive Gross Margins and Strong Demand Signals\n\nDuring the conversation with the analyst, Scaringe reiterated Rivian’s long-held assertion it can generate positive gross margins in Q4. The company believes it can accomplish the goal by cutting the amount it pays for supplies, upgrading its factory and selling more regulatory credits to other automakers that are producing fewer EVs.\n\nIf the automaker does generate positive gross margins in Q4, the Street should become even more confident on RIVN stock. That confidence would be justified because it would indicate that Rivian is well on its way to becoming profitable.\n\nStory continues\n\nOn the demand front, indications suggest a large and growing number of consumers are eager to buy Rivian’s EVs. First, the number of test drives of its EVs in Q1 surged by 90% last quarter versus Q4. Second, the automaker’s Q1 revenue jumped 82% to $1.2 billion versus the same period a year earlier. Also noteworthy is the fact it delivered 13,588 EVs last quarter. That was quite close to the 13,980 EVs it produced during the period.\n\nFinally, Rivian reported over 68,000 reservations were made for its relatively affordable mid-size R2 SUV less than 24 hours after unveiling it. The company intends to start delivering the R2 in early 2026\n\nUpcoming EVs and the Strong Outlook of Rivian’s Commercial Business\n\nThe high number of orders the automaker obtained for the R2 is one reason I’m upbeat on it and the even more affordable R3. Rivian intends to begin delivering the R3 in early 2026. I’m also positive on the EVs’ due to the positive reactions from multiple media outlets and several Wall Street banks.\n\nWhen it comes to media outlets, Elektrek wrote that “Rivian gets the details right (on the R2 and the R3)” while including many “neat things.” And TechCrunch labeled the R3 “cute as hell.”\n\nAs for banks, Bank of America contends the R2 could allow Rivian to “break more into the mass market segment, which represents about half of total U.S. auto sales.” Similarly, Piper Sandler believes the R3 “could be one of the most compelling designs on the market when it is released.”\n\nFinally, as I’ve pointed out in past columns, I’m upbeat about the automaker’s ability to generate more revenue from companies because “AT&T (NYSE:T) has agreed to test Rivian’s delivery vans, while auto reseller JB Poindexter & Co…is selling a new delivery van that utilizes RIVN’s chassis.” Among Poindexter’s customers are package delivery giants Fedex (NYSE:FDX) and UPS (NYSE:UPS).\n\nOn the date of publication, Larry Ramer held a long position in RIVN.

Nvidia — arguably the biggest beneficiary of a massive flood of AI spending of the past year — saw its market capitalization hit $3 trillion this week, becoming the first computer-chip firm to do so.\n\nThe Santa Clara, California-based company has dominated the market with its highly sought-after products that help power data centers running complex AI computing tasks. Meanwhile, Microsoft has invested in OpenAI and is infusing AI features in its products and services.\n\nApple has not had the strongest showing this year as the technology giant’s shares were pressured by concerns over cooling iPhone demand in China and a $2 billion fine from the European Union. However, shares in the company have just turned positive for 2024 as investor sentiment toward the iPhone maker slowly improves.\n\n“Momentum and growth seekers will be content to trust in Microsoft, Apple and Nvidia owing to their powerful competitive positions, fat profit margins and strong balance sheets,” said Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell.\n\n“The danger here is to mistake reliability for safety, again because a very lofty valuation can leave a share price exposed on the downside if expectations are very high and something unexpected happens,” said Mould.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "Over the long run, the stock market has proved to be a superior wealth creator. Over the last century, no other asset class has come anywhere close to matching the annualized average return generated by stocks.\n\nBut not all stocks are created equally.\n\nOne of Wall Street's greatest attributes is that it's dynamic. History tells us that today's largest stocks are unlikely to be the biggest publicly traded companies 20 years from now. Ongoing innovation, mergers, acquisitions, legal judgments, competition, and a host of other factors are constantly shaking up the \"leaderboard\" on Wall Street.\n\nDespite this unpredictability, I strongly believe one of the largest companies on today's leaderboard can overcome historic odds and become the first stock to reach a $5 trillion market cap. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nIt won't be these three widely touted \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks\n\nFor a company to reach a $5 trillion valuation, it would have to be an industry leader that's fueled by innovation and generates boatloads of cash flow. In other words, the perfect definition of companies found in the \"Magnificent Seven.\" However, some of the most-logical candidates among the Magnificent Seven are the stocks I believe are least likely to reach the psychological $5 trillion level.\n\nFor example, the infrastructure backbone of the artificial intelligence (AI) movement, Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA), probably looks like a no-brainer to become the world's largest company by market cap. Nvidia's graphics processing units (GPUs) have become the standard in high-compute data centers, which has afforded the company exceptional pricing power.\n\nOn the other hand, investors have, without fail, overestimated the adoption of every next-big-thing innovation or new technology for 30 years. Although AI is the hottest thing on Wall Street, most businesses aren't even sure how to utilize the technology to drive additional sales and profits. It's going to take time for AI utility to evolve, which likely means an AI bubble-bursting event is coming at some point in the future.\n\nI'll also add that Nvidia's top four customers, which comprise about 40% of its net sales, are all developing GPUs for their AI-accelerated data centers. Even if these chips are used in just a complementary fashion to Nvidia's GPUs, it likely signals a peak in order activity.\n\nI wouldn't count on Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) being the first $5 trillion stock, either. Though Apple's iPhone dominates in the domestic smartphone market, and the company has repurchased a truly jaw-dropping $674 billion worth of its common stock since initiating a buyback program in 2013, its growth engine has completely stalled.\n\nStory continues\n\nLast year, every physical product segment for Apple saw sales decline. Some of this decline can be attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic. For instance, personal computer sales are retracing now that workers have returned to the office. But continued weakness in iPhone sales suggests that recent innovations aren't hitting home with consumers.\n\nElectric-vehicle (EV) maker Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA) is unlikely to be the first $5 trillion stock, as well. Despite being North America's leading EV manufacturer and the only pure-play EV company to generate a recurring profit, Tesla's growth engine has sputtered and its efforts to become more than a car company have predominantly fallen flat.\n\nGrowing competition in the EV arena has encouraged Tesla to slash its prices on more than a half-dozen occasions since the start of 2023. These price cuts have reduced Tesla's operating margin from 17.2% to just 5.5%. With EV inventory levels still rising, additional margin-crushing price cuts may be necessary.\n\nFurthermore, CEO Elon Musk has given investors few reasons to cheer. Though he's overseen the introduction of five mass-produced models (3, S, X, Y, and Cybertruck), the overwhelming majority of Musk's promised innovations haven't been fulfilled. If these promises are backed out of Tesla's valuation, the company looks anything but \"magnificent.\" Image source: Amazon.\n\nWall Street's first $5 trillion stock will be...\n\nAmong the handful of companies that have helped push the Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite to record highs, it's e-commerce colossus Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) that has the best chance to be Wall Street's first $5 trillion stock.\n\nWhile Amazon's e-commerce marketplace is the face of the company, online retail sales produce razor-thin margins and are minimally relevant when it comes to generating operating cash flow and net income. It's Amazon's three faster-growing and higher-margin ancillary operating segments that give it the ability to become Wall Street's largest publicly traded company.\n\nIt all starts with Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is the world's leading cloud infrastructure service platform. Even though businesses are still in the relatively early stages of ramping up their cloud-service spending, AWS surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales, as of the March-ended quarter. This is a considerably higher-margin segment than e-commerce, and it'll consistently grow at a much faster pace. As a stand-alone business, I believe AWS could be worth up to $3 trillion by the end of the decade, based on its current growth trajectory.\n\nThe second all-important operating segment that can help carry Amazon to a $5 trillion valuation is subscription services. Before stepping down as CEO, Jeff Bezos announced in April 2021 that his company had leaped above 200 million global Prime subscribers. The steady growth of its online marketplace, along with securing the exclusive streaming rights to Thursday Night Football, gives Amazon strong pricing power with Prime.\n\nThe third puzzle piece is its advertising segment. Amazon is attracting in the ballpark of 2.5 billion unique visitors to its website on a monthly basis. Since of most of these visitors are motivated shoppers, Amazon has an insatiable dangling carrot that encourages advertisers to pay a premium to get their message(s) in front of shoppers.\n\nCollectively, these three segments are what generate almost all of Amazon's operating cash flow.\n\nWhile earnings per share (EPS) is a smart measure of value for mature businesses, Amazon tends to reinvest a majority of its cash flow into high-growth initiatives. Though this can, at times, have a negative impact on its EPS, these aggressive investments are rapidly increasing its cash flow -- and cash flow is a far better measure of value for Amazon. AMZN Price to CFO Per Share (TTM) Chart\n\nDuring the entirety of the 2010s, Amazon closed out each year at a multiple of 23 to 37 times forward-year cash flow. Put another way, investors willingly paid a median of 30 times operating cash flow to own shares of Amazon during the prior decade.\n\nBy 2027, Wall Street's consensus calls for $18.64 in cash flow per share. Based on where Amazon closed on Friday, May 31, this would place it at a multiple of just 9.5 times cash flow. If Amazon were to sustain a 10% annualized growth rate in cash flow through 2030 (based on the $18.64-per-share consensus for 2027), its multiple would drop to just 7.\n\nAmazon's stock can comfortably rise by the 172% needed to reach a $5 trillion valuation and still come in well below its median cash flow multiple from the previous decade. Among Wall Street's most-influential businesses, it has the clearest path to an eventual $5 trillion market cap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Amazon right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Amazon, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Amazon wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Nvidia overtakes Apple as its market capitalisation surpasses $3tn (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia (NVDA)\n\nUS chip designer Nvidia became the third US company to reach a market valuation of more than $3tn (£2.4tn) on Wednesday, overtaking Apple (AAPL) to become the world’s second most valuable company.\n\nNvidia’s shares jumped 5.2%, propelling its market capitalisation to more than $3tn to become the world’s second-largest company behind Microsoft (MSFT).\n\nNvidia’s chips are powering much of the rush into AI, which has seen it become a poster child of the AI boom, with demand for its processors from the likes of Google (GOOG), Microsoft and Facebook owner Meta (META) outstripping supply.\n\nNvidia’s shares – up nearly 150% so far this year – are also being boosted by an upcoming move to split its stock by 10-to-one on Friday.\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRead more: FTSE 100 LIVE: European stock markets creep higher as ECB expected to cut interest rates\n\nDan Coatsworth, investment analyst at AJ Bell, said the stock split will “bring its share price down and make it more affordable to investors who cannot afford to splash out more than a grand per share, as well as benefit employees who use some of their monthly pay packets to invest in the company.”\n\nLululemon (LULU)\n\nLululemon beat Wall Street’s earnings and revenue estimates but issued weak second-quarter guidance as it contends with a slowdown in the Americas, its largest market.\n\nThe yoga pants maker also raised its share buyback authorisation by $1bn, the second time in six months that the company has increased its returns to shareholders. Shares of Lululemon jumped 10% in pre-market trading.\n\nThe company’s revenue grew by 10% year over year to $2.2bn in the quarter ended April 28, in line with projections. Top-line growth was driven by a 35% revenue increase from international markets — including a nearly 50% increase in China — while in the Americas sales rose by a mere 3%.\n\nCEO Calvin McDonald touted the “strong momentum” the company is seeing in its international markets and hinted that it needs to do more work in the Americas.\n\nStory continues\n\n“We are pleased by the progress we are making to optimise our US product assortment,” said McDonald. “Looking ahead, we continue to have a significant runway for growth and are confident in our team’s ability to powerfully deliver.”\n\nFever-Tree (FEVR.L)\n\nPremium drink mixer brand Fever-Tree has reported growth across its markets in 2024 as it looks to capitalise on the key summer selling season when more customers spend on cocktails like mojitos and margaritas.\n\nWhile no numbers or guidance was given in a relatively short trading update to accompany the company's annual general meeting, management said it remained \"comfortable\" with full-year expectations.\n\nThe tonic maker said it has “strengthened its category-leading position” in the UK, while it “continues to be the biggest contributor to growth within the carbonated mixer category” in the US.\n\nIt said the brand has continued to “deliver topline growth in the year to date.”\n\nRead more: Darktrace and Vistry promoted to FTSE 100 as Ocado and St James Place crash out\n\nLast year, the company saw profits fall 23%, despite sales growing 6%, but said it was \"on track to double EBITDA\" in 2024.\n\nGold (GC=F)\n\nThe rally in the metal market continues with gold touching $2,381 amid speculation that the US Federal Reserve will cut rates.\n\nThe Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showed the US economy continues to expand in its service sector, boosting the golden metal.\n\nHowever, investors were caught by surprise over the announcement that a review has been launched by the trade body, which sets the global benchmark for gold prices, after doubts were raised about the purity of some precious metals from a supplier.\n\nThe London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) said it is reviewing allegations involving Indonesian state miner Aneka Tambang (Antam) over the purity of its gold products.\n\nAneka Tambang last week denied reports that there were 109 tons of counterfeit ANTAM gold circulating in the community in the period 2010-2021.\n\nIndonesia’s Attorney General Office has named six former general managers at Antam’s Precious Metal Processing and Refining Business Unit as suspects for alleged misuse of Antam’s stamping service.\n\nThe country is a major player in the global mining industry but has faced criticism as more than half of all tropical deforestation directly attributable to industrial mining takes place in Indonesia, according to new research conducted at Clark University.\n\nLBMA, an industry body whose rules for gold refineries require that they source gold responsibly, said that an Incident Review Process (IRP) has been invoked to review the current circumstances.\n\nWatch: Nvidia passes Apple as second-most valuable firm</p><p>Shares in the chipmaker jumped over 5% Wednesday, taking its market value to a little over $3 trillion. </p><p>That put it just ahead of the iPhone maker.</p><p>Nvidia stock has been soaring on bets it’s going to be the big winner from the AI boom. </p><p>The firm’s chips power products like ChatGPT, and are in hot demand around the world. </p><p>It has raised sales forecasts over and over again.</p><p>That has seen the stock gain 147% so far this year. </p><p>Now some analysts say it looks likely Nvidia could overtake Microsoft as well, to become the world’s most valuable company. </p><p>One said the big difference is that the chip firm is already making big money from AI, while rivals are having to spend huge amounts on the technology. </p><p>As for Apple, it’s been struggling with weak demand for its phones, and mounting competition in China. </p><p>Investors have also criticized it for lagging rivals in offering AI services. </p><p>Its stock has barely risen this year. \",\"thumbnailUrl\":\"https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/zVZHxvVxbxrzq5_azhD0WA--~B/aD01NDA7dz05NjA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/video.reutersnews.com/cef9687c21616206781155e31d2edb79\",\"duration\":\"PT1M13S\",\"contentUrl\":\"https://video.media.yql.yahoo.com/v1/video/sapi/hlsstreams/fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61.m3u8?site=finance&region=GB&lang=en-GB&devtype=desktop&src=sapi\",\"embedUrl\":\"https://uk.finance.yahoo.com/video/nvidia-passes-apple-second-most-050332350.html?format=embed\",\"identifier\":\"fc2d9a2f-b540-322d-8347-2d9341f77d61\"}\n\nDownload the Yahoo Finance app, available for Apple and Android.",

        "content": "Investing.com -- Shares in Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) ticked higher in premarket trading on Thursday, pointing to an extension to a rally in the prior session that saw the artificial intelligence chip designer top $3 trillion in market capitalization and overtake iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nThe California-based firm has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI. Demand for its AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nIn an unexpected move earlier this week, Nvidia unveiled plans for its new \"Rubin\" chip only months after it announced its most recent launch. The company, which faces intensifying competition from chipmaking rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as in-house processors made by large cloud computing firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said it is targeting a \"one-year\" cadence of releases.\n\nNvidia also reported another quarter of bumper earnings in May, including a 262% year-on-year spike in revenue, and revealed a 10-for-one stock split that is set take effect on June 7.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is expected to announce more details about its plans for AI at its much-anticipated developers conference next week. Compared to many of its Big Tech peers, the group has so far said relatively little about its AI ambitions, although Chief Executive Tim Cook has remarked that the technology represents a \"key opportunity.\"\n\nRelated Articles\n\nNvidia shares edge higher premarket after AI chipmaker's market cap tops $3 trn\n\nFundamentals points to further stock gains - UBS\n\nAmazon buys assets of Indian video streaming service MX Player - report\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Futures muted, Nvidia's market cap jumps above $3 trillion - what's moving markets",
        "content": "Investing.com -- U.S. futures were muted following a rally in both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite on Wednesday. Nvidia's (NASDAQ:NVDA) market capitalization soars above $3 trillion, as the artificial intelligence chip designer becomes the world's second most valuable company. Lululemon Athletica (NASDAQ:LULU) posts better-than-anticipated first-quarter results, sending shares in the athleisure group higher in after-hours trading.\n\n1. Futures muted\n\nU.S. stock futures hovered around the flatline on Thursday after the benchmark S&P 500 and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite both posted record high closing levels in the prior session.\n\nBy 03:28 ET (07:28 GMT), the S&P 500 futures contract and Dow futures were mostly unchanged, while Nasdaq 100 futures had risen by 26 points or 0.1%.\n\nOn Wednesday, the S&P 500 gained 1.18% to 5,354.03 and the Nasdaq Composite advanced by 1.95% to 17,186.38. The 30-stock Dow Jones Industrial Average also finished higher, adding 0.3% to 38,807.33.\n\nSupporting the rally was the benchmark U.S. 10-year Treasury yield, which slid to a two-month low following weaker-than-anticipated private payrolls data. The figures -- as well as a separate report earlier this week which showed job openings dipping to their lowest level in over three years in April -- pointed to a softening in the U.S. labor market.\n\nEasing demand for workers could relieve some upward pressure on inflation, bolstering hopes that the Federal Reserve will possibly slash interest rates down from more than two-decade highs later this year.\n\n2. Nvidia surpasses Apple as world's second most valuable company\n\nNvidia's market capitalization surged past $3 trillion on Wednesday, as the artificial intelligence chip designer overtook iPhone-maker Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the world's second most valuable company.\n\nThe California-based company has been a major beneficiary of a spike in enthusiasm around the applications of AI. Demand for the firm's AI-optimized chips has soared over much of the last year, as more businesses spend heavily to fold the nascent technology into their operations.\n\nIn an unexpected move earlier this week, Nvidia unveiled plans for its new \"Rubin\" chip only months after it announced its most recent launch. The company, which faces intensifying competition from chipmaking rivals like Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) and Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) as well as in-house processors made by large cloud computing firms like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL), said it is targeting a \"one-year\" cadence of releases.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia also reported another quarter of bumper earnings in May, including a 262% spike in revenue, and revealed a 10-for-one stock split that is set take effect on June 7.\n\nApple, meanwhile, is expected to announce more details about its plans for AI at its much-anticipated developers conference next week. Compared to many of its Big Tech peers, the group has so far said relatively little about its AI ambitions, although Chief Executive Tim Cook said in a recent earnings call that the technology represents a \"key opportunity.\"\n\n3. Lululemon shares jump after-hours\n\nShares in Lululemon Athletica rose by more than 9% in extended hours trading after the premium athletic apparel retailer posted first-quarter profit and sales that topped estimates.\n\nThe Canadian company known for its pricey leggings reported quarterly per-share income of $2.54, ahead of Wall Street expectations of $2.38, while net revenue of $2.21 billion was above projections of $2.19 billion. It also lifted its guidance for annual earnings per share and reiterated its full-year net revenue outlook.\n\nStrength in mainland China, where same-store sales increased by 26% versus the year-ago period, offset flat top-line returns in the Americas. Analysts cited by Reuters noted that Lululemon has been building up its presence in China to take advantage of relatively muted domestic competition and counteract sluggish demand among inflation-squeezed U.S. shoppers.\n\nMeanwhile, Lululemon, whose share price has slumped by 39% so far this year, signed off on a $1 billion uptick to its stock buyback program.\n\n4. ECB decision looms\n\nThe European Central Bank is widely tipped to slash interest rates down from record high levels at its meeting on Thursday.\n\nBuoyed by signs that inflation in the euro zone currency area is easing toward the ECB's 2% target, policymakers have all but telegraphed the decision in the build-up to the gathering.\n\nECB President Christine Lagarde said in May that she believes price pressures are \"under control,\" particularly as the impact of an energy crisis and supply chain constraints fades. Philip Lane, the central bank's Chief Economist, also told the Financial Times in an interview that \"barring major surprises\" officials see enough in recent data \"to remove the top level of restriction.\"\n\nInvestors are wagering that the ECB will cut its benchmark deposit rate, which currently stands at an all-time high of 4%, by a quarter percentage point. But uncertainty remains over how policymakers will approach future potential reductions later this year, with analysts at ING suggesting in a note that they \"doubt the ECB will have much to say\" on the topic.\n\n5. Crude inches higher\n\nCrude prices edged higher Thursday, boosted by the overall positive sentiment, but are still on course for hefty weekly losses.\n\nBy 03:24 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.7% higher at $74.60 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.6% to $78.88 a barrel.\n\nBoth contracts are headed for weekly declines of around 4%, weighed down by the decision from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and its allies to leave room for voluntary output cuts to be unwound gradually, beginning in October.\n\nThe crude market was also hit by the news that U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.2 million barrels in the week to May 31, compared with estimates for a draw of 2.3 million barrels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nFutures muted, Nvidia's market cap jumps above $3 trillion - what's moving markets\n\nRussian central bank urges global integration despite sanctions\n\nNo-tariff shipments popular with Shein, Temu hit US customs speedbump\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Investing.com - European stock markets rose Thursday, ahead of what market participants expect to be the first cut in interest rates by the European Central Bank since 2019.\n\nAt 03:05 ET (07:05 GMT), the DAX index in Germany traded 0.6% higher, the CAC 40 in France rose 0.4% and the FTSE 100 in the U.K. gained 0.1%.\n\nECB set to cut interest rates\n\nThe European Central Bank concludes its latest policy-setting meeting later in the session, and is expected to join the central banks of Canada, Sweden and Switzerland in cutting rates.\n\nThe central bank is widely expected to trim its deposit rate to 3.75% from a record 4.0%, in what would be its first cut since 2019.\n\nThe ECB policymakers have signaled that sufficient progress in tackling inflation has been made to justify an easing, with consumer prices having fallen from more than 10% in late 2022 to just above the central bank’s 2% target.\n\nThat said, recent data has seen prices turn higher, indicating that inflation could prove to be stickier than expected in the eurozone, creating uncertainty over what follows this likely rate cut.\n\nThis brings ECB President Christine Lagarde’s press conference after the rate decision firmly into focus, as the market looks for clues about future policy moves.\n\nMoney markets are pricing in between one and two more interest rate cuts, possibly in September and December.\n\nBefore the ECB announcement, eurozone retail sales data for April are due later in the session, and are expected to show a drop of 0.2% on the month, a small rise of 0.1% on an annual basis.\n\nNvidia’s market value soars above $3 trillion\n\nIn the corporate sector, the focus is likely to be on chipmakers after market darling Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) rallied more than 4% on Wednesday, pushing its value above $3 trillion for time ever, overtaking Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second most valuable company.\n\nThe surge in Nvidia followed recent strong quarterly results that fueled further bets the surge in AI-related spending on semiconductors is set to continue. In its quarterly results, the chipmaker also announced a 10-to-1 stock split, which will take effect on Friday, making its stock more affordable and accessible to a larger group of investors.\n\nCrude on course for weekly losses\n\nCrude prices edged higher Thursday, boosted by the overall positive sentiment, but are still on course for hefty weekly losses.\n\nBy 03:05 ET, the U.S. crude futures (WTI) traded 0.8% higher at $74.67 per barrel, while the Brent contract climbed 0.7% to $78.92 per barrel.\n\nBoth contracts are headed for weekly declines of around 4%, weighed down by the decision from the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries and allies to leave room for voluntary output cuts to be unwound gradually, beginning in October.\n\nStory continues\n\nThe crude market was also hit by the news that U.S. crude stocks jumped by 1.2 million barrels in the week to May 31, compared with estimates for a draw of 2.3 million barrels, data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration showed.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nEuropean stocks higher ahead of ECB policy meeting\n\nNvidia overtakes Apple as No. 2 most valuable company\n\nAsia shares rally as rate cut bets gather pace, ECB in focus\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Usher has some suggestions for Apple CEO Tim Cook.\n\nThe Grammy-award winning singer met with the Fortune 500 exec at Apple’s sprawling California campus to discuss 2024 Super Bowl plans, and after a lengthy tour, suggested Cook invest in a new mode of transportation.\n\n“I gave him a pair of skates,” Usher recalled to Fortune. “I told him, you’ve got enough space here, maybe you should use them in the hallway. Get you where you wanna go quicker.”\n\nThe R&B icon, who made history as the most-watched Super Bowl performance of all time, infamously sang, danced, and entertained 130 million viewers at this year’s game–all while wearing a pair of roller skates.\n\nTwo main results from Usher and Cook’s meeting emerged: an instant meme of Cook wearing a t-shirt with Usher’s face ironed onto it, plus suggestions for how to help the approximately 1.45 million Americans currently living with type 1 diabetes.\n\n“That t-shirt is probably going to be valued for millions someday so I'm hoping that I can get one,” the singer joked in an interview with Fortune.\n\nTim Cook appears in latest Apple Music Halftime Show ad pic.twitter.com/RImpFmv6nJ\n\n— Apple Hub (@theapplehub) February 8, 2024\n\nAfter his star-studded Super Bowl performance, Usher says he’s now readying his talents for a different stage: Capitol Hill.\n\nUsher is set to join a contingent led by French pharma giant Sanofi that will meet with legislators in Washington, D.C. later this month to discuss the importance of early screening for type 1 diabetes, a condition that’s thought to be caused by an autoimmune disease that leads the body to mistakenly attack insulin-producing cells.\n\nIt’s a cause that’s personal for the performer, who has been an outspoken advocate for more awareness about the condition after his child was diagnosed with type 1 diabetes in 2014 at age six.\n\n“My child was urinating a lot and was a bit lethargic and very tired,” he explained to Fortune. “There were no real explanations behind it.”\n\nUsher described the diabetes diagnosis experience as “shocking” since no other relatives were known to have had the condition.\n\n“My grandmother had type 2 diabetes, and I could remember drawing insulin and watching her take her blood sugar levels and also having to watch her administer insulin,” he explained. “So I did understand the treatment of diabetes but not type 1, especially not for an infant.”\n\nTen years later, Usher is now a paid spokesperson for Sanofi, ranked #299 on the Fortune Global 500, and hopes to assist other parents and caregivers through a process he describes as “overwhelming.”\n\nStory continues\n\nAccording to new research released Wednesday from Beyond Type 1, a nonprofit cofounded by singer Nick Jonas, 79% of adults with type 1 diabetes said they felt underprepared and overwhelmed when they first learned of their diagnosis. \"The Cost of Not Knowing” study, commissioned by Sanofi and conducted by Wakefield Research among 1,000 U.S. adults with type 1 diabetes and 1,000 caregivers to children, found that 88% of patients required emergency care for their type 1 symptoms before or during their diagnosis.\n\nThe number of Americans with type 1 diabetes is expected to jump to 2.1 million people by 2040–a nearly eight-fold increase since 1990, according to Beyond Type 1. The financial toll of that diagnosis can be steep; half of respondents with type 1 diabetes spent at least $5,000 on emergency care, and nearly a quarter reported spending at least $10,000.\n\n“Most Americans don't have $1,000 in their savings account, so it's something that could very easily put a family into extraordinary financial distress, causing people to take on debt,” Kristian Hurley, senior vice president of programs, advocacy, and health equity at Beyond Type 1, told Fortune.\n\nType 1 and type 2 diabetes cost Americans $413 billion per year in medical expenses and reduced productivity, according to the American Diabetes Association. While most common in children and young adults, type 1 can happen to anyone at any age, and about 90% of those diagnosed had no family history, according to research nonprofit JDRF. Hurley said those with type 1 diabetes have described it as “constantly having a math problem” to solve when checking insulin levels and medication.\n\n“Type 1 doesn't take a day off, so in everything that you do, you have to be able to make sure that you're supporting your needs as it relates to insulin,” Kristian Hurley said. “It's a full-time job.”\n\nHeading to Capitol Hill\n\nAs Usher prepares to meet with lawmakers on Capitol Hill later this month, he says he’s “excited” for the opportunity to share his family’s story.\n\n“If I am to use this very complicated experience that I have for something that is positive, and to bring about positive support, then I want to be there for it,” he said. “I'm there simply to share my story; I'm a storyteller.”\n\nThe mission is not new for the singer; last year, Usher and Sanofi launched the \"The 1 Pledge,\" a nationwide educational campaign to encourage screening for type 1 diabetes before noticeable symptoms arise.\n\nThough he describes the impact of T1D on his family as “complicated,” he hopes the visit to D.C. will be a collaborative way to educate Americans on early screening.\n\n“I make music and I actually tell stories, but this one is one that I feel is necessary and could potentially help a lot of people,” he said. “I feel like sharing my story could potentially bring support to people who really need it.”\n\nThis story was originally featured on Fortune.com\n\nView comments",

Innovative firms continually emerge, offering transformative growth opportunities.\n\nDespite misconceptions, the U.S. economy exhibits promise. GDP grows steadily, and unemployment recently hit historic lows near 4% as reduced inflation stabilizes prices, easing financial strain. Wage hikes and strong consumer spending indicate healthy demand. Investments in infrastructure and innovation bolster job creation. Despite doubts, growth stocks to buy present opportunities.\n\nFavorable market conditions, from a robust job market to AI advancements, set the stage for the next wave of growth for key hyper-growth stocks. Buying these companies could yield long-term upside for investors willing to take the risk right now.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nPalantir Technologies (PLTR) In this photo illustration, the Palantir Technologies (PLTR) logo is displayed on a smartphone screen.\n\nSource: rafapress / Shutterstock.com\n\nJust recently, AI software company Palantir Technologies (NYSE:PLTR) closed a $480 million deal with the U.S. Department of Defense until 2029. The deal is to provide a Maven Smart System prototype for the U.S. Army. Analysts estimate the contract to contribute approximately $90 million annually, showcasing Palantir’s growing share in government software spending.\n\nAdditionally, Palantir announced it will provide its Artificial Intelligence Platform to energy systems manufacturer Eaton, expanding its services beyond the government sector. Palantir and Eaton (NYSE:ETN) expanded their partnership to enhance Eaton’s supply chain efficiency, utilizing Palantir’s AI-generated data.\n\nPalantir’s major client accounts have expanded quickly, including a Fortune 500 company’s three-year deal boosting annual revenue. That highlights client satisfaction and attracts new business. Palantir achieved its sixth consecutive GAAP profitable quarter with $106 million net income and a Rule of 40 score of 57%, balancing sales growth and profitability.\n\nNvidia (NVDA) Nvidia technology company displayed on cell phone. NVDA stock\n\nSource: gguy / Shutterstock.com\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) remains a top choice for institutional investors based on various metrics. Following strong earnings, institutions increased their bets on Nvidia, now valued at over $1,000 per share, with TD Cowen raising its target price to $1,200. Retail and institutional investors alike have ample reason for continued optimism regarding Nvidia’s prospects.\n\nHigh volatility for Nvidia’s stock was expected, with options trading indicating an 8% move post-earnings. Although there has been a slight slowdown due to high demands, Nvidia proved to be resilient. Revenues are said to rise 90% by fiscal year January 2025.\n\nStory continues\n\nMoreover, the stock increased 7%, pushing its market cap to over $2.8 trillion. That has made Nvidia third place as the biggest company in the world. As the AI chip is in tight competition with Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia remains a top choice for AI chips. Its rapid ascent has been marked by a relentless rally since surpassing $500 in early 2024.\n\nMatterport (MTTR) Illustrative Editorial of Matterport's (MTTR stock) website homepage. MATTERPORT logo visible on display screen.\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nThe last one off the list is Matterport (NASDAQ:MTTR). In its recent Q1 2024 earnings report, the company outdid itself once again and showed improved revenue growth. The non-GAAP loss per share improved by over 86%, proving the company’s commitment to reaching profitability. CFO JD Fay emphasized these achievements as they continue to drive the adoption of Matterport digital twins.\n\nIn other news, CoStar Groups (NASDAQ:CSGP) announced its plans to acquire Matterport for $1.6 billion. The acquisition will take effect by Q4 2024. Shareholder and regulatory approval are still pending, presenting a merger arbitrage opportunity for investors. However, should the deal be completed, Matterport shareholders will receive $2.75 in cash and $2.75 in CoStar stock, subject to a symmetrical collar based on CoStar’s average share price prior to the acquisition.\n\nFor those considering Matterport’s merger arbitrage, Warren Buffett’s advice resonates: “We engage in arbitrage when odds favor.” With promising odds for regulatory approval, this short-term strategy offers potential. Monitor FTC and DOJ updates and CoStar’s stock fluctuations for cues.\n\nOn the date of publication, Chris MacDonald did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

Who’s Next for India?\n\nThe shares of the Santa Clara, California-based firm have rallied roughly 147% this year, adding about $1.8 trillion as the insatiable demand for its chips used to power artificial intelligence tasks skyrockets. On Wednesday, shares rose as much as 5.1% to briefly push the market value to $3 trillion, overtaking Apple Inc. in the process.\n\nThe last time Nvidia was worth more than Apple was in 2002, five years before the first iPhone was released.

The chipmaker still trails Microsoft Corp. by market value, but with shares on a tear Wall Street sees it as only a matter of time before Nvidia overtakes it.\n\nApple has struggled this year with the technology giant’s shares pressured by concerns over cooling iPhone demand in China and a fine from the European Union.

        "content": "Investing.com-- U.S. stock index futures rose slightly in evening deals on Wednesday, extending gains after persistent bets on interest rate cuts and a rally in heavyweight Nvidia put Wall Street at record highs.\n\nA series of weak labor market readings drummed up hopes that the Federal Reserve will begin cutting rates by September. But gains in futures were held back by anticipation of more upcoming economic data in the coming days.\n\nS&P 500 Futures rose 0.1% to 5,370.75 points, while Nasdaq 100 Futures rose 0.1% to 19,098.50 points by 19:13 ET (23:13 GMT). Dow Jones Futures steadied at 38,897.0 points.\n\nNvidia extends rally in aftermarket trade\n\nMarket darling NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) hit a record high in after-hours trade, rising 1.1% to $1,237.40.\n\nThe stock surged on Wednesday, crossing $3 trillion in valuation and overtaking Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL) as the second-largest company on Wall Street amid growing hype over its exposure to artificial intelligence. The firm had earlier this week revealed its newest line of AI chips.\n\nSentiment over AI was also upbeat ahead of Apple’s developer conference next week, where the tech giant is widely expected to unveil AI features for its flagship devices.\n\nWall St at record highs as weak labor data fuels rate cut hopes\n\nNvidia was the biggest boost to the S&P 500 and the NASDAQ Composite, which both closed at record highs on Wednesday.\n\nThe S&P 500 rose 1.2% to 5,354.03 points, while the Nasdaq rose nearly 2% to 17,186.38 points. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lagged, rising 0.3% to 38,807.33 points, and was well below peaks hit in May.\n\nWeak ADP private payrolls data, which came on the heels on a softer-than-expected reading on job openings, fueled bets that the labor market was cooling, which heralds softer inflation and gives the Federal Reserve more impetus to cut interest rates.\n\nTraders ramped up bets that the Fed will cut rates by 25 basis points in September. Additionally, a rate cut by the Bank of Canada on Wednesday, and a widely expected cut by the European Central Bank on Thursday also fueled optimism over looser monetary policy.\n\nFocus was now on more upcoming readings on the labor market, with nonfarm payrolls due on Friday set to offer definitive cues on the sector.\n\nThe Fed is also set to meet next week, and is likely to keep rates steady.\n\nAfter-hours movers: Lululemon surges, Five Below tumbles\n\nSportswear retailer Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) jumped 10% after clocking stronger-than-expected quarterly earnings, while also raising its annual guidance.\n\nDiscount retailer Five Below Inc (NASDAQ:FIVE) slid 17% after posting a disappointing forecast for full year earnings.\n\nStory continues\n\nRelated Articles\n\nUS futures inch higher as rate cut bets, Nvidia rally bring record highs\n\nChanel's creative director Virginie Viard to exit brand, Business of Fashion reports\n\nS&P 500, Nasdaq close at record highs as data supports Fed easing\n\nView comments",

        "content": "Shares of Nvidia (NVDA) climbed more 5% on Wednesday reaching a record high of $1,224.40 and giving the company a market cap above $3 trillion for the first time ever. The stock's advance pushed Nvidia past Apple, making it the second-most-valuable company in the US stock market. Microsoft currently holds the top spot.\n\nWednesday's rally comes amid a broader gain in tech stocks, with softer US economic data and a decline in Treasury yields boosting markets on hopes the Federal Reserve may cut rates as early as July.\n\nNvidia has been the poster child for investor enthusiasm in AI, which accelerated with OpenAI's release of ChatGPT in late 2022.\n\nThe stock is up over 140% this year and 200% over the last year; Nvidia shares have gained more than 3,300% in the last five years. Over those same periods, the Nasdaq has gained a more modest 14%, 29%, and 126%, respectively.\n\nThis week's rally in Nvidia follows an announcement on Sunday from its CEO, Jensen Huang, who said at an industry conference the company will release a high-powered version of its Blackwell chip — called the Blackwell Ultra — in 2025, followed by a new AI chip platform, Rubin, in 2026. The company will debut an Ultra version of Rubin in 2027.\n\nNvidia is the tech industry's go-to supplier for AI chips and integrated software.\n\nTech behemoths, including Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOG), Meta (META), Microsoft, Tesla (TSLA), and others, use its hardware to power everything from their cloud-based AI offerings for customers to their own AI models and services.\n\nIn the first quarter, Nvidia reported adjusted earnings per share of $6.12 on revenue of $26 billion, jumps of 461% and 262%, respectively, from the same period a year ago.\n\nNvidia's Data Center revenue in the most recent quarter increased 427% year over year to $22.6 billion, accounting for 86% of the company's total revenue for the quarter. Nvidia's gaming segment, which was previously its most important business, saw revenue of $2.6 billion. Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang arrives at an event at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan, June 4, 2024. (REUTERS/Ann Wang) (Reuters / Reuters)\n\nNvidia also announced that its stock would undergo a 10-for-1 split on June 7, and the company will raise its dividend from $0.04 per share to $0.10 per share.\n\nBut Nvidia isn't the only game in town.\n\nAMD (AMD) and Intel (INTC) are pushing forward with their own AI chips with the goal of outmaneuvering Nvidia. AMD recently announced its MI325X and MI350 will hit the market in 2024 and 2025, respectively, and said its next-generation MI400 AI accelerator platform will land in 2026.\n\nIntel, meanwhile, said its Gaudi 2 and Gaudi 3 AI accelerators will undercut competing chips on price. And with companies spending billions on AI chips, any price savings will certainly be welcome.\n\nStory continues\n\nNvidia is also contending with growing competition from its own customers, as Amazon, Google, and Microsoft seek to wean themselves off of their dependence on the company's chips and save on capital expenditures while they're at it.\n\nFor now, though, Nvidia continues to maintain its grip on the AI space, and it will do so for the foreseeable future.

        "content": "Apple’s AAPL annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), scheduled on Jun 10, is expected to provide a glimpse into the iPhone maker’s AI endeavors. It is highly anticipated that the iOS 18 release will offer AI features, including a more intelligent Siri.\r\n\r\nApple has been playing catch-up in the AI space compared with Alphabet GOOGL, Microsoft MSFT and Amazon AMZN, its peers in the “magnificent seven” group.\r\n\r\nIts competitive position is expected to improve with AAPL’s focus on adding a plethora of AI-enabled features that automatically generate playlists for Apple Music, edit photos through written or spoken commands and create custom emojis.\r\n\r\nA plausible collaboration with Microsoft-backed OpenAI will give iPhone users access to ChatGPT. Safari is expected to get an upgrade with a new intelligent search feature.\r\n\r\nApple is expected to launch its first major software update with visionOS 2 for its mixed-reality device Vision Pro at WWDC. It is also expected to add a few AI-enabled updates to iPadOS 18 and macOS 15.\n\nApple Inc. Price and Consensus\n\nApple Inc. price-consensus-chart | Apple Inc. Quote\n\nAI Focus Aids AAPL’s Long-Term Prospects\n\nApple CEO Tim Cook has expressed his enthusiasm over the opportunities with Generative AI (GenAI). In the fiscal second-quarter earnings call, Cook stated that Apple enjoys a significant advantage in the AI space due to “Apple’s unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration, groundbreaking Apple’s silicon, with our industry-leading neural engines and our unwavering focus on privacy.”\r\n\r\nApple has been active on the acquisition front to boost its footprint in the AI space. It acquired nearly 32 AI start-ups in 2023 alone. Moreover, it has been looking for a partner to harness the abilities of cloud-based GenAI.\r\n\r\nPer sources, including Bloomberg, it has been actively involved in discussions with Alphabet to license Google’s Large Language Model (LLM), Gemini, for the iPhone. Apple reportedly has developed its own LLM called AppleGPT based on a framework called Ajax.\r\n\r\nIntegration of AI and LLMs into Apple devices — iPhone, iPad, and Mac — will make them faster and more efficient, thereby providing an impetus to its already massive installed base for upgrades. This is expected to drive top-line growth in the long haul.\r\n\r\nApple’s robust Services business, strong cash balance ($162.34 billion as of Mar 30, 2024) and record share buyback program worth $110 billion are other positives.\n\nStiff Competition, China Worries Hurt AAPL’s Near-Term\n\nApple shares have returned 1% year to date, underperforming the Zacks Computer & Technology sector’s 16.1% growth. It has suffered from stiff competition and weak iPhone sales in China.\r\n\r\nChina’s growth remains a worry for Apple due to stiff competition from local smartphone makers, including Huawei. The Chinese government’s directive to state officials not to use non-Chinese phones for work has been detrimental to the iPhone’s demand.\r\n\r\nPer Canalys data, the Mainland China smartphone market witnessed 67.7 million units of shipment in first-quarter 2024. Huawei led with a 17% market share, shipping 11.7 million smartphones, while Apple sold 10 million units, down 25% year over year, most among the top five vendors.\r\n\r\nThe issues forced Apple to cut retail prices, which drove iPhone smartphone shipments in April (up 52% year over year) and is also expected to have benefited May sales. However, Apple is suffering from a lack of GenAI capabilities in the iPhone.\r\n\r\nCanalys forecasts that Gen AI-capable smartphones will reach 12% of shipments in 2024 in mainland China, ahead of the global average of 9%. Xiaomi led the GenAI-capable smartphone market with its flagship 14 series in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nStory continues\n\nConclusion\n\nApple’s near-term prospects remain foggy due to sluggish China sales amid stiff competition. It expects the June quarter’s (third-quarter fiscal 2024) revenues to grow low-single-digit year over year. Unfavorable forex is expected to hurt revenues by 2.5%.\r\n\r\nThe Zacks Consensus Estimate for revenues is currently pegged at $83.07 billion, indicating 1.55% year-over-year growth. The consensus mark for earnings has remained unchanged at $1.33 per share over the past 30 days.\r\n\r\nInvestors should wait for a better entry point for Apple, which currently has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), given the modest growth prospect in the near term.

        "title": "Why Apple’s generative AI push won’t launch an iPhone supercycle in 2024",
        "content": "We’re less than a week out from Apple’s (AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC), which kicks off on June 10 at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif. This year the company is expected to unveil its big generative AI push with new capabilities for the iPhone.\n\nThe moves are likely to energize investors who have been anxiously awaiting Apple’s foray into generative AI. But don’t expect generative AI itself to spur a new iPhone sales supercycle this year. That’s because when it comes to smartphones, users care more about hardware than software.\n\n“I don't think it's going to become the primary reason why people buy an iPhone,” explained Thomas Husson, vice president and principal analyst at Forrester. “It's more likely going to augment experiences.”\n\nBut that doesn’t mean generative AI won’t power iPhone sales in the coming years. That’s because as phones age and become unable to run generative AI experiences, users will inevitably have to upgrade.\n\nIt’s all about the hardware… at first\n\nPeople generally buy new smartphones for the hardware, not software.\n\n“The typical consumer is not going to care [about generative AI],” explained Deepwater Asset Management managing partner Gene Munster. “They want to know screen size, No. 1. Second is camera, third is battery.”\n\nThere’s another reason generative AI on the iPhone is unlikely to get people to line up outside of their local Apple Store: The software is still too new.\n\nMany of the consumer offerings out there are still relatively basic. Microsoft’s (MSFT) Copilot will soon provide helpful tips on how to fix common PC issues, and Google’s (GOOG, GOOGL) Gemini for Workspace makes drafting emails easier. But by and large, there’s no must-have generative AI app.\n\nEven Microsoft’s AI-centric Copilot+ PCs are more interesting for their new Qualcomm (QCOM) chips, which are supposed to rival Apple’s own M3 processors, than for the AI software they’re named after. Supercharge sales? An Apple store in Pittsburgh. AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (ASSOCIATED PRESS)\n\n“If you go to Joe and Jane Smith on Main Street, USA, and say to them, 'Hey, you can have Gen AI in your iPhone,' now they're going to say, 'Great. Now, what do I do with it?' And that's the … intersection that we find ourselves at right now,” explained IDC research director Ramon Llamas.\n\nAccording to Bloomberg reporter Mark Gurman, Apple will roll out a new, smarter version of Siri that will allow you to control apps with your voice and transcribe recordings, new photo editing tools, and enhanced notifications all powered by generative AI.\n\nSure, making Siri useful would be a huge step in the right direction, though it will be interesting to see how often people end up using the voice assistant. After all, when was the last time you asked Siri to do anything other than set a cooking timer or find out the weather for the next day?\n\nStory continues\n\nTranscription and photo editing tools would also be helpful, but Google and Samsung already offer those features in their own phones, and they don’t seem to be driving sales. And it's likely Apple will also offer its own take on transcription and photo apps too.\n\nMore importantly, we’ll have to wait to see how iPhone developers end up using generative AI technologies to improve their own third-party apps. Think about it. You likely spend most of your time on your iPhone using third-party apps like WhatsApp, TikTok, or Gmail. The same will be true with generative AI-powered apps, but it’ll take time for developers to get them up and running.\n\nSales will come\n\nWhile generative AI might not kick off a sales bonanza this year, it will get consumers to pony up for new iPhones in the coming years. That’s because generative AI features will require some of Apple’s latest chips, and users with older phones will either be unable to use those functions or they’ll run slowly. And nothing gets people to want to buy a new phone than when apps are slow.\n\n“It'll take six months, a year, two, three years, for people to start to understand that the hardware that they had pre-generative AI isn't performing as well as your phone,” Munster said. “The battery won't last, because it will be putting more weight on the CPU or the AI chip … things like that. I think that this iPhone AI upgrade cycle, it's like a two- or three-year cycle.”\n\nThat’s not to say Apple might not see a sales bump in September when it releases its next iPhone. The smartphone market, in general, is starting to turn around after a two-year slog. According to IDC, global smartphone sales should improve by 4% year over year in 2024. The majority of that, however, will come from Android sales, though iPhone shipments should improve some 0.7%. Not exactly a staggering number, but an increase, nonetheless.\n\nAs for the sales boost, that’s more likely to come further down the line as Apple fine-tunes its generative AI features and developers fire off more generative AI-powered apps that tax older iPhones. As for the supercycle, it’ll just have to wait. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter. (Yahoo Finance)\n\nEmail Daniel Howley at dhowley@yahoofinance.com.

        "title": "Why Arm chips pose a threat to Intel and AMD’s PC dominance",
        "content": "Intel (INTC) and AMD (AMD) are staring down a new competitor in the PC market: Arm (ARM).\n\nThe UK-based chip designer is making a fresh push into the space via Qualcomm (QCOM) and its Arm-based Snapdragon X Elite and X Plus chips, which are rolling out in laptops from companies ranging from ASUS and Acer to Dell, HP, and Lenovo in the coming weeks.\n\nArm is already the go-to platform for Apple (AAPL) and its M-series chips for its Mac line of laptops and desktops, but it’s had a rockier relationship with Microsoft’s (MSFT) Windows platform. There was 2012’s Surface RT, which couldn’t run certain apps, as well as 2022’s Surface Pro 9, which suffered similar compatibility problems.\n\nBut Microsoft, Arm, and Qualcomm say they’ve worked out the kinks — and that Arm-based PCs will be as reliable as Intel and AMD-based offerings. The proof? Microsoft turned to Arm-based Qualcomm chips to power its new Surface Pro tablet and Surface Laptop, rather than Intel or AMD processors.\n\nThose Surface devices are part of Microsoft’s new Copilot+ PC standard, which is essentially high-end laptops that can run native artificial intelligence apps, making the fact that Microsoft used Arm-based Qualcomm chips all the more interesting. ARM CEO Rene Haas makes a speech at COMPUTEX forum in Taipei, Taiwan June 3, 2024. REUTERS/Ann Wang (Reuters / Reuters)\n\n“The Microsoft Build moment, with Microsoft basically coming out and sort of anointing or declaring that the Snapdragon X Elite and the Qualcomm-based, Arm-based devices were the first to meet [Microsoft’s] Copilot+ standards, was a big inflection,” explained Daniel Newman, CEO of The Futurum Group.\n\n“It was just a bit of a sea change that we haven't seen in a long time in the industry,” he added.\n\nQualcomm’s chips are meant to be a part of Microsoft’s big Copilot+ PC AI push, which will see more generative AI apps on Windows laptops and desktops. But generative AI apps are still in their early stages, meaning general power and performance are still the best marketing tools for PCs running on Qualcomm’s chips.\n\nAnd the company looks set to deliver on some big performance and battery life gains compared to Intel and AMD processors, not to mention Apple’s M3 chips. Microsoft says Qualcomm’s X Elite chip offers up to 51% faster CPU performance when using the same power as competing chips and matches competitor peak CPU performance while using 65% less power. And that, at least initially, will be a key selling point for Arm-powered PCs.\n\n“One of the key things that Qualcomm has done is essentially made the promise and delivered on giving Mac-like, if not better, battery performance,” TECHnalysis Research president and chief analyst Bob O'Donnell told Yahoo Finance. “That's been a huge deal for all the Apple M-based Macs, and that's been a real challenge, frankly, for Intel and AMD.”\n\nStory continues\n\nBut Arm isn’t just hoping Qualcomm can take on Intel and AMD on its own, though. According to Reuters, Arm CEO Rene Haas says other other manufacturers will be rolling out Arm chips in the future. What’s more, he believes Arm will control 50% of the market for Windows PCs in the next five years.\n\nBut Intel and AMD aren’t taking this existential threat lying down. The companies both rolled out their own answers to the Arm-based Qualcomm chips during their respective keynotes at Computex 2024 in Taipei, Taiwan, this week.\n\nOn the Intel front, that comes in the form of a new Lunar Lake chip, which the company says will begin shipping in PCs in the third quarter of 2024. According to Intel, the Lunar Lake line uses 40% less power than the current Intel Core Ultra line, offers 50% better graphics performance, and features an up to 4x faster neural processing unit (NPU).\n\nMoreover, Intel CEO Pat Gelsinger said during his Computex keynote that Lunar Lake already outperforms the Snapdragon X Elite’s CPU, GPU, and NPU in internal testing.\n\nAMD is also firing back with its own Ryzen AI 300 line of processors for Windows Copilot+ PCs, complete with improved CPUs, GPUs, and NPUs. Importantly, AMD says its NPU is capable of performance of up to 50 TOPS, or trillions of operations per second, more than Intel's or Qualcomm’s chips. TOPS are a common measurement for running AI applications.\n\nIntel and AMD will need to ensure their chips are not only able to take on Arm and Qualcomm but also beat them in terms of overall performance and price. That’s especially important for Intel, which still makes the bulk of its revenue through chip sales to third-party vendors via its Client Computing Group.\n\nIn Q1 this year, the Client Computing Group brought in $7.5 billion of Intel’s $12.7 billion in total revenue. That’s roughly 59% of the company’s total quarterly revenue. AMD’s own client segment, meanwhile, made up $1.3 billion of its total $5.5 billion in revenue in its first quarter.\n\nMicrosoft says the first Copilot+ PCs will go on sale June 18, meaning we’re still a few days away from seeing how well Qualcomm’s Arm-based processors perform in the market. But if the company can deliver on its promises, it could pose an existential threat to Intel and AMD’s chip businesses.\n\nWe’ll find out soon enough. Subscribe to the Yahoo Finance Tech newsletter.

        "title": "The 7 Best Dividend Stocks to Buy in June 2024",
        "content": "You may have heard the pithy investing mantra to “sell in May and go away.” Because stocks tend to underperform during the summer months, the idea is to sit them out and wait for better opportunities in the fall. I don’t invest that way. I prefer to put my money to work at regular intervals all the time.\n\nBuying dividend growth stocks is one of the best ways to do that. Studies show dividend stocks outperform non-payers by a wide margin during almost all periods. They also show that stocks that initiate dividends and then raise them are the best stocks to buy overall.\n\nI like stocks that regularly raise their payout by a healthy margin but also have the financial wherewithal to support those payments. So while I look for dividend growth, I also seek out stocks that have excellent free cash flow (FCF) growth as well.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nFree cash flow is the money that’s left over after a business pays its bills. It can only use that money for certain things, such as paying a dividend, buying back stock, making acquisitions or investing in the business. Healthy FCF growth is a key consideration in my investment decisions.\n\nThe seven stocks below all offer both of those conditions in spades. Some I own and some are on my watchlist. All of them, though, are worth considering for your own portfolio.\n\nChubb (CB) Illustrative Editorial of Chubb website homepage. Chubb logo visible on display screen. CB stock\n\nSource: II.studio / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf it’s good enough for Warren Buffett it’s good enough for me. Property and casualty insurer Chubb (NYSE:CB) is the hidden stock Buffett bought that he didn’t want anyone to know about. Regulators give him and other big bucks investors special privileges to buy stock without telling anyone so they can get the best price before everyone piles in.\n\nChubb stock was trading around $252 per share before it was revealed Buffett bought $6.7 billion worth of the insurer. That was enough to land it as his ninth largest holding although it accounts for just 2% of the Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, BRK-B) portfolio.\n\nThe insurer’s dividend history is actually not quite what I look for though that may be changing. Over the past decade, Chubb has raised its dividend at a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 2.2% and over the last five years it is only slightly better at 4.1%. What I do like is Chubb has expanded FCF over the past 10 years by an eye-opening 13% CAGR. It also just announced a dividend increase that jumped 6% letting the payout yield a respectable 1.4% annually.\n\nMaybe because it has so much FCF available now it will start focusing on increasing its dividend more. It is why the insurance company may deserve a spot in your portfolio.\n\nStory continues\n\nRealty Income (O) realty income logo highlighted by a magnifying glass on a web browser\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nAny dividend growth investor worth their salt is familiar with real estate investment trust (REIT) Realty Income (NYSE:O). The REIT pioneered the monthly dividend payment and it has not disappointed. Since listing on the NYSE in 1994, Realty Income has made 647 consecutive monthly dividend payments. More impressive, it has raised the payout for 107 straight quarters, including its more recent increase where it raised the dividend 2.1% to 26.25 cents per share.\n\nAlthough the increase might seem on the low side, remember, this happens every three months in perpetuity. This is about as solid of a dividend growth stock as you can find. As a REIT though, you don’t want to look at its FCF but rather its adjusted funds from operation (AFFO), a metric similar to FCF for REITs. For Realty Income, its AFFO payout ratio stands at just under 75%. While that may look dangerously high, recall REITs are required to pay out 90% or more of their profits as dividends. It means Realty Income’s dividend is both safe and sustainable.\n\nREITs like Realty Income have been hurt by the high interest rate environment we’re in. The stock is down 12% over the past year. It is comforting to know, though, you can get paid a healthy yield (5.9% annually) while you wait for the Federal Reserve to cut rates again and for Realty Income to resume its growth trajectory.\n\nUnitedHealth Group (UNH) The UnitedHealth (UNH) headquarters in Minnetonka, Minnesota.\n\nSource: Ken Wolter / Shutterstock.com\n\nAnother dividend-paying insurance stock to buy is UnitedHealth Group (NYSE:UNH). This one, as its name implies, is a health insurer. Because healthcare is a critical expense for people and one they typically won’t or can’t go without no matter market conditions, it makes UnitedHealth an all-weather stock.\n\nThe insurer has used its premier positioning to reward shareholders. UnitedHealth has grown its dividend at an 18% CAGR for the last decade while increasing it by almost 13% over the last five years. FCF has widened at an equally impressive CAGR of 16% for the past 10 years. Although its FCF payout ratio has been climbing steadily for several years running, it still sits at an extremely low 26%, meaning the insurer’s dividend is sound.\n\nThe company has been expanding its outlook and reach through acquisitions, especially in home healthcare. It previously acquired LCH Group and is trying to acquiring Amedisys (NASDAQ:AMED). The purchase, however, is being scrutinized by regulators and may cause the stock to sumble if denied. But UnitedHealth doesn’t need the care facility to thrive so any weakness in the stock should be seen as a buying opportunity.\n\nParker-Hannifin (PH) An image of a futuristic aerospace engine rendering\n\nSource: solarseven / Shutterstock\n\nParker-Hannifin (NYSE:PH) has been around since 1917 and has been paying dividends for almost just as long. It has made 295 consecutive quarterly dividend payments, or nearly 74 years worth. Moreover, the motion control systems manufacturer has raised the dividend for 67 straight years making it a Dividend King.\n\nIt’s often the case that such stalwart dividend stocks don’t exhibit the sort of growth you want to see in their payout. These are large, mature businesses that can’t increase the dividend the same as younger companies. That doesn’t apply to Parker-Hannifin though. It has a 12.6% CAGR for the past 10 years and a better-than 13% CAGR over the last five. Equally impressive is Parker-Hannifin growing FCF at double-digit rates over those same time frames as well.\n\nInvestors also benefit from capital appreciation. In just the past year the motion control specialist stock is up 63% and offers a 10-year total return of 400%. That’s well ahead of the S&P 500’s 228% return. For a venerable industrial stock like Parker-Hannifin, that’s an impressive result.\n\nApple (AAPL) Apple (AAPL) logo on an Apple store in Santa Monica, California.\n\nSource: View Apart / Shutterstock.com\n\nApple (NASDAQ:AAPL) continues to surprise Wall Street and the stock market. When many were leaving it for dead due to slowing sales in China, the tech giant put together back-to-back months of growth. Bloomberg reports the iPhone maker saw 52% shipment growth in April following a 12% gain in March. Shipments had been down in the first two months of the year, lending credence to the analysts’ concerns.\n\nHowever, CEO Tim Cook recently flew to China to meet with its partners in the country and smooth over any rough spots in their relationship. It apparently worked as sales are accelerating now.\n\nShareholders were also heartened by Apple’s massive $110 billion stock buyback program it announced. At the end of the first quarter the consumer electronics company had $67 billion in cash and equivalents available to it on its balance sheet.\n\nMany dividend stock investors dismiss Apple out of hand as an investment because of its paltry 0.5% dividend yield. That would be a mistake. While it has grown its payment at an 8% CAGR over the last decade, its FCF payout ratio is just a super low 15%. It suggests dividends are not a priority for the tech star. What has it been doing with its FCF? Stock buybacks like the massive program just mentioned. Apple prefers to reduce its share count, which helps bolster and grow earnings and revenue per share. That even occurred last year when revenue fell!\n\nBecause Apple does throw off a lot of cash, the dividend will always receive attention even if it is not the top priority.\n\nZoetis (ZTS) a magnifying glass enlarges the Zoetis logo on a website\n\nSource: Casimiro PT / Shutterstock.com\n\nZoetis (NYSE:ZTS) is one of the world’s largest animal health providers offering a portfolio of therapies, vaccines, diagnostics and technologies in use in over 100 countries. It is a recession-resistant business because pet owners tend to ignore family pet health issues even less than their own no matter the economic conditions.\n\nAccording to the American Pet Products Association, pet owners spent $147 billion on their four-legged friends last year, 7.5% more than the year before. They are expected to spend another $150.6 billion this year. Of that amount, fully 26% was spent on vet care and products. It’s a very profitable business for Zoetis, which generates gross margins north of 80% in the U.S. and around 70% internationally.\n\nZoetis has produced near 500% total returns for investors over the past decade, double the broad market index. It has also grown its dividend at a 20% CAGR over that time frame. In the last five years, it has increased 21% annually with a 23% FCF CAGR.\n\nVisa (V) several Visa branded credit cards\n\nSource: Kikinunchi / Shutterstock.com\n\nLeading payments processor Visa (NYSE:V) is the last dividend stock to buy on this list — though definitely not the least. There are some 4.3 billion Visa cards in circulation and they generated $14.5 trillion in total payments and cash volume for its full fiscal year.\n\nVisa’s dividend yields less than 1% annually, which might dissuade some investors from buying. Yet the payments processor has a hefty record of increasing the payout every year. In 2013, Visa paid about 35 cents per share. After hiking the dividend last October, it now pays $2.08 per share, a 20% CAGR. As FCF grows at a 22% CAGR and the FCF payout ratio is a miniscule 19%, Visa has plenty of gas left in the tank for further generous dividend increases in the future.\n\nA recession could impede Visa’s growth as people cut back on their spending habits. The move to a more digital payments environment, however, means the payments processor has more opportunities to capture transactions. As recessions tend to be measured in months but bull markets go on for years, any slowdown will be temporary and a buying opportunity.\n\nOn the date of publication, Rich Duprey held a LONG position in O stock.

        "title": "Apple Made Once-Unlikely Deal With Sam Altman to Catch Up in AI",
        "content": "(Bloomberg) -- When a 23-year-old Sam Altman took the stage at Apple Inc.’s annual developer conference in 2008, he gushed about being able to use the company’s new App Store to promote his software, a friend-locating service called Loopt. “We think this is a new era of mobile, and we’re thrilled to be part of it,” Altman said.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nModi Vows to Retain Power Even as Party Loses India Majority BlackRock, Citadel Back Texas Stock Exchange in Challenge to NYSE Modi’s Magic Is Fading Fast. Who’s Next for India? Short Sellers in Danger of Extinction After Crushing Stock Gains Indian Stocks Lead Gains in Asia as Modi Ally Pledges Support\n\nNow, 16 years later, Apple is calling upon the entrepreneur again — but with a twist. This time, the company needs his help as much as he needs Apple.\n\nAltman currently runs OpenAI, the leading startup in generative artificial intelligence. And Apple, racing to catch up in that area, has forged a partnership to integrate OpenAI’s ChatGPT into the iPhone’s operating system. Though the controversial Altman is unlikely to take the stage at the event, the agreement will be a key focus of Apple’s Worldwide Developers Conference next week — and it shows just how much the power in Silicon Valley has shifted over the past few years.\n\nThe deal gives OpenAI access to hundreds of millions of Apple users, including ones that might have been hesitant to try ChatGPT otherwise. For Apple, the arrangement brings the company the hottest technology of the AI era — a chatbot with eerily powerful abilities — that it can pair with its own services.\n\nApple has been developing a host of AI features, including ones that run on its devices and others that require cloud computing. It’s also infusing its Siri digital assistant with AI. But the company’s own chatbot isn’t yet up to snuff.\n\nThe OpenAI partnership is likely a “short- to medium-term relationship” for Apple, said Dag Kittlaus, a tech veteran who co-founded and ran the Siri business before it was acquired by Apple. “But you can bet that they will be working hard building out their own competencies here.”\n\nThe WWDC keynote address, delivered by Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook on June 10, is seen as Apple’s biggest sales pitch in years. The company has to convince consumers, developers and investors that it can thrive in the AI era. And there’s added pressure because Apple’s existing business is stagnant, with revenue declining in five of the past six quarters.\n\nThe two companies haven’t disclosed the deal publicly yet, and terms of the arrangement aren’t clear. Cupertino, California-based Apple declined to comment, as did San Francisco-based OpenAI.\n\nStory continues\n\nApple once had a head start in AI services. It released the Siri digital assistant in 2011, beating Amazon.com Inc.’s Alexa and the Google Assistant to the market. But it soon fell behind rivals, and that was before a seismic shift in 2022 when ChatGPT debuted.\n\nThe introduction of OpenAI’s chatbot in November of that year captured the imagination of consumers and sent tech giants scrambling to develop their own AI services. Apple’s biggest peers have all made headway since then. Google’s Gemini chatbot is vying with ChatGPT for supremacy in the nascent market. Microsoft Corp., OpenAI’s biggest backer, has begun weaving its AI-assisted Copilot into software. And Amazon.com Inc. has demonstrated an AI-enhanced version of Alexa.\n\nIn contrast, Apple kept its AI ambitions quiet until now. Cook said last year that the company would tread carefully in the new space and only add AI technology on a “very thoughtful basis.” More recently, he’s argued that Apple will have an edge in AI because of its “unique combination of seamless hardware, software and services integration.”\n\nBehind the scenes, Apple employees have been working furiously to back up that promise. Around the time of the ChatGPT launch, small teams within the company’s AI and software engineering divisions began working on a competitor to ChatGPT, using a framework dubbed Ajax.\n\nSoftware chief Craig Federighi pushed managers to pack the latest version of the iPhone and iPad operating system — known internally as “Crystal” — with as much AI as possible. Eddy Cue’s services division got to work on new data center infrastructure for powering online AI services. Staffers also began investigating how AI could come to Apple Music and the company’s office-productivity apps.\n\nApple found that its AI is capable enough to power features like voice memo transcriptions and photo editing, as well as new search capabilities in the Safari web browser and auto replies in apps like Messages. But it determined early on that OpenAI and Google were far ahead in chatbots and on-the-fly assistance.\n\nThat put Apple in a difficult spot. The company’s own technology wasn’t ready, and executives were concerned about reputational damage from a rogue chatbot. Some people within Apple even have a philosophical aversion to having a chatbot at all, people familiar with the situation have said.\n\nBut it was clear by then that consumers would expect Apple to offer such a service, and that set the company on the path to its deal with OpenAI. Several months ago, the company began meeting with the startup — along with Google and other chatbot providers — about integrating the technology into its iOS software.\n\nBy outsourcing the chatbot function, Apple can distance itself from the technology itself, including its occasional inaccuracies and hallucinations, the people said. But it also links Apple to a startup beset by upheaval and controversy. Altman, now 39, was briefly ousted last year for reasons that remain murky, and he recently drew the ire of movie star Scarlett Johansson for a soundalike AI voice.\n\nThough Apple remains in talks with Google about using Gemini in its devices, the iPhone maker reached an agreement with OpenAI first. In the end, Apple may offer a number of third-party chatbots, but it’s negotiating the deals on a case-by-case basis, according to the people with knowledge of the situation.\n\nApple picked OpenAI as its inaugural AI partner for a few reasons, one of the people said. It got better business terms than Google was offering, and Apple believes that OpenAI’s technology is the best available on the market. Integrating Google AI into the iPhone also might have given the impression that Apple’s biggest technology rival had beat it in a vital new area.\n\nOpenAI, meanwhile, will get the gigantic exposure that comes with being deeply integrated into some of the world’s best-selling smartphones and tablets. Still, Apple’s involvement may bring new scrutiny to the safety and privacy concerns swirling around ChatGPT. Depending on how deeply Apple plans to integrate the chatbot with its software, it also could mean that OpenAI has access to personal information, which could unnerve some users.\n\nBut Apple is expected to offer its new AI features as an opt-in service, according to the people familiar with the matter. So wary customers could easily steer clear of them if they’d prefer.\n\nRegardless, the OpenAI agreement is likely a stopgap measure. Apple has a long history of eventually bringing outside technology in-house, such as when it replaced Intel Corp. chips with its own silicon.\n\nApple also is looking beyond chatbots. It aims to use large language models — a key technology behind generative AI — to help power a pair of robotic devices that it is secretly developing, the people said.\n\nThat includes a table-top robotic arm with a large, iPad-like display. The company also has been working on a mobile robot that can follow users around and handle chores on their behalf. And it’s looking to equip its AirPods with cameras and AI features.\n\nMore immediately, there’s the opportunity for Siri to finally live up to its potential, Kittlaus said. That could bring some vindication to a company that hatched the dream of a smart personal assistant under co-founder Steve Jobs.\n\n“There are no longer any technical constraints to realizing the original Siri vision,” Kittlaus said.\n\n--With assistance from Rachel Metz and Shirin Ghaffary.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek\n\nDavid Sacks Tried the 2024 Alternatives.

        "content": "As generative artificial intelligence (AI) works its way into our laptops, tablets, smartphones, watches and even lapel pins, we may very well have the “killer” new feature to convince consumers to upgrade their hardware.\n\nWhether new, capable “IntelliPhones” spark a red-hot supercycle (or a lukewarm refresh cycle) remains a big question on the minds of investors, specifically those hanging onto shares of Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). If there’s a segment that needs a jolt, it’s the iPhone, which seems severely limited by the current state of Siri. Indeed, Siri in 2024 pales compared to almost any other generative AI product out there, including those put out by little-known startups.\n\nWith Apple’s biggest development conference of the year just days away, it’s about time investors got ready for analysts to update their standing on AAPL stock. Of course, it’s not just Apple that stands to gain from an AI phone cycle. Many rivals and component suppliers also stand to gain.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nLet’s check in with three overlooked and undervalued stocks to play the rise of an AI phone that could be very similar to the one featured in the 2013 film Her.\n\nCorning (GLW) the corning (GLW) logo and homepage displayed on a mobile phone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nCorning (NYSE:GLW) is a lesser-known firm that stands to benefit if AI phones start flying off shelves again. The firm is best known for its legendary Gorilla Glass, which has helped modern smartphones shine in durability tests. Demand for Gorilla Glass will naturally increase as demand for the next generation of phones does.\n\nFor now, Gorilla Glass represents a relatively small slice of the overall Corning pie. Glass optical fiber and glass for other sorts of flat panel displays are the bigger needle movers for GLW stock. That said, in a truly “booming” IntelliPhone supercycle, I still view Gorilla Glass as a source of better-than-expected growth.\n\nThough Corning doesn’t have an unbreakable solution (the holy grail for glass displays), it’s hard not to love the firm as it innovates to bolster protection on tomorrow’s smartphones. Apple Ceramic Shield is just one intriguing innovation that’s helped newer iPhones better withstand drops, fumbles and accidentally putting one’s phone in a pocket and one’s keys.\n\nLook for future iPhones to adopt Gorilla Glass Armor, the next big leap in protection as Corning looks to fight scratches and reflections. For now, it’s unclear as to whether the iPhone 16 or 17 will boast the impressive new glass.\n\nAll considered, GLW stock isn’t a name I’d scratch off the radar at just 19.4 times forward price-to-earnings (P/E).\n\nStory continues\n\nQualcomm (QCOM) Qualcomm (QCOM) logo on side of headquarters\n\nSource: photobyphm / Shutterstock.com\n\nIf you believe smartphones will experience a once-in-a-decade refresh cycle, Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a top stock to consider. Unlike Corning, which has nothing to do with advancing a smartphone’s AI savvy, Qualcomm actually stands to power the incredible AI features of the next generation of high-end Android devices with its Snapdragon Series 8 Gen 3 chip.\n\nWhether Android or Apple wins the AI smartphone wars, Qualcomm will stand to win. The company is still a critical modem chip supplier for the iPhone and will continue to be through 2026 despite Apple’s relentless efforts to build its own comparable device.\n\nGiven Apple’s lack of success in swapping out Qualcomm modem chips for its own, I’d be willing to bet Qualcomm’s modem chip deal with Apple could extend far beyond the next two and a half years. Either way, QCOM stock stands to be a winner in the face of any smartphone refresh cycle. The stock also looks like an absolute bargain at 20.6 times forward P/E.\n\nSkyworks Solutions (SWKS) the Skyworks website is loading on a smartphone\n\nSource: madamF / Shutterstock.com\n\nSkyworks Solutions (NASDAQ:SWKS) remains overexposed to Apple despite the company’s ongoing efforts to diversify away from the iPhone maker. Indeed, if iPhone sales are down, the odds are that SWKS stock will be in an even bigger rut.\n\nToday, shares of Skyworks are down nearly 53% from all-time highs hit back in mid-2021. Undoubtedly, iPhone sales were in a better spot during the earlier days of the pandemic, when consumers upgraded their devices amid lockdowns. These days, customers just haven’t had enough reason to upgrade to the latest and greatest.\n\nIn the second half, Apple is expected to reveal new AI features in iOS 18 while touting advancements in its Neural Engine. Should such AI innovations push customers to upgrade their iPhones en masse, I’d be willing to bet that SWKS stock could easily outpace AAPL stock over the next year.\n\nApple is riding high today after a mixed quarterly result, primarily because of its massive share buyback announcement. Meanwhile, SWKS stock is stuck in the ditches and is getting close to multi-year depths. At 17.2 times forward P/E, Skyworks looks like a relative bargain for those seeking more profound value than the iPhone maker.\n\nOn the date of publication, Joey Frenette held shares of Apple.

        "title": "Where Will Apple Stock Be in 3 Years?",
        "content": "Apple's (NASDAQ: AAPL) stock chart is a thing of beauty. Shares of this tech heavyweight are up 54% in the past three years. That gain easily outpaces the 22% rise of the Nasdaq Composite index.\n\nAs this \"Magnificent Seven\" stock currently trades near its all-time high, investors might be considering adding the business to their portfolios. So it's important to ask, where will Apple be in three years?\n\nStill an iPhone company\n\nApple's monster success can largely be attributed to the popularity of the iPhone, which bucks the typical short lifespan and deflationary trend of consumer electronics. A whopping 17 years after its introduction, this single product still represents about half of the company's total revenue.\n\nThe management team is still focused on growing iPhone sales, with a new update slated to launch later this year. Apple has also finally opened retail stores in India, hoping to further tap the world's most populated country.\n\nIn 2027, I believe there's a very good probability that this business will still depend on the iPhone for its financial success. Yes, Apple sells other well-known products, like the Watch, AirPods, MacBook, and iPad. But its industry-leading smartphone still reigns supreme.\n\nInvestors should understand the downside of this, though. The iPhone is a mature product, as there are about 1.4 billion of these devices that are active across the world. So, it will become harder to drive outsize revenue gains.\n\nAt a $3 trillion market cap and with trailing-12-month revenue of $382 billion, Apple will probably need to introduce a new game-changing product to drive faster revenue growth. There is no reason for investors to be optimistic about this happening.\n\nCreating Apple's ecosystem\n\nIn addition to its successful hardware devices, Apple has done a fantastic job at boosting its services division. In the latest quarter (the fiscal second quarter of 2024 ended March 30), this segment grew sales 14% year over year to $24 billion, accounting for 26% of the company's total. Three years ago in Q2 2021, services only represented 19% of overall sales.\n\nI see no reason to believe that this trend won't continue over the next three years and beyond. For Apple shareholders, that's an encouraging sign. Services carry a stellar gross margin of 75%, well above the 37% gross margin of products. As more sales are derived from services, perhaps Apple's bottom line can expand even faster than the top line.\n\nApple's services include popular offerings like Music, Pay, and TV+. Going forward, the little-known advertising operations could become more important. Apple sells digital ads across its properties, like in the App Store and in the News app, for example. Despite being relatively new to the industry, the business is expected to bring in $10 billion in ad revenue this year, according to eMarketer.\n\nStory continues\n\nNot a good setup for investors\n\nThanks to Apple's incredible run in recent years, the stock is very expensive right now, in my opinion. Shares trade at a price-to-earnings ratio of 29.9, which is a 40% premium to their trailing-10-year average. The takeaway is that the market remains extremely optimistic about the company's prospects.\n\nBut given that Apple is likely to register slower revenue growth in the years ahead, particularly as a result of its massive scale and the maturity of the iPhone, I don't think the current valuation presents investors with a good buying opportunity. The higher valuation creates a scenario where the chance of earning market-beating investment returns over the next three years is low.\n\nThere's no denying that Apple is one of the world's most successful enterprises. But that doesn't automatically make it a great investment opportunity. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock underperforms the Nasdaq Composite over the next three years.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "Investing.com-- Apple Inc's (NASDAQ:AAPL) Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) is set to be a pivotal moment for the iPhone maker, Wedbush analysts wrote in a note, especially with the tech giant widely expected to reveal its plans for artificial intelligence.\n\nThe WWDC will kick off from June 10, which Wedbush analysts said they believed will begin an “AI-accelerated growth cycle on the iPhone and services.”\n\nThe brokerage maintained its Outperform rating on the stock and its $275 12-month price target, which indicates an upside of 41% from current levels.\n\nWedbush said the introduction of AI to Apple’s “golden installed base” of 2.2 billion iOS devices presented more opportunities for monetization on the services and on the device front.\n\nThe Cupertino-based tech giant is also expected to formally announce a tie-up with OpenAI and likely unveil AI models natively powered by its own devices. Wedbush said it also believed Apple will hint at an AI App Store.\n\nWedbush said that the AI angle will help Apple see a resurgence in growth, especially with the iPhone 16. The firm is also expected to integrate AI into iOS 18.\n\nAI is expected to help Apple offset an ongoing slump in hardware sales, particularly of its flagship iPhone. Laggard sales in China, which have now fallen for over a year, have been a key point of contention for the firm.\n\nWhile Apple clocked better than feared earnings in the first quarter, its sales in China continued to weaken amid some government scrutiny, as well as tough competition from local players such as Huawei and Xiaomi (OTC:XIACF) Corp (HK:1810). Still, the firm's revenue from software services remained relatively robust.\n\nApple has largely lagged its U.S. tech peers in incorporating AI features into its flagship devices- a trend that analysts say is also behind its latest sales decline.\n\nRelated Articles\n\nWWDC a ‘pivotal moment’ for Apple with AI plans in focus- Wedbush\n\nUS stock futures edge higher as cooling labor data boosts rate cut hopes\n\nJudge cuts Bayer $2.25 billion Roundup verdict to $400 million\n\nView comments",

        "title": "Should You Buy Apple ETFs on rebounding China's iPhone Sales?",
        "content": "In the past year, while some members of the 'Magnificent 7' have recorded strong quarterly results and solid price rally, Apple's performance has been less stellar. Despite the broader market's 23% gain, Apple's shares have increased by only 6.3%. This subdued performance is attributed to uncertainties surrounding China sales and Apple’s less exposure to AI compared to other “Mag 7” candidates.\n\nRecent Positive Developments\n\nHowever, there's been a recent uptick in Apple's performance. Over the last month, the company's shares have gained nearly 11% (compared with more than 4% gains noticed in the S&P 500), buoyed by positive reactions to its earnings report. Bloomberg reported a 52% increase in iPhone shipments in China last month, which further boosted Apple's share performance.\n\nApple's Latest Quarterly Results\n\nIn its latest quarterly release, Apple topped expectations, posting a 1.3% beat relative to the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate and sales 1% ahead of expectations. This marked the fifth successive double-beat for the tech giant.\n\nDespite previous woes in China, Apple's sales in the region came in much closer to expectations compared to previous periods. While there was still a shortfall of $220 million against the consensus estimate, this is a significant improvement from the $2.5 billion miss in the previous period.\n\nPositive Strategic Moves\n\nApple's recent announcements reflect efforts toward the maximization of shareholders’ wealth. The company revealed the largest buyback in corporate history, totaling $110 billion. Additionally, Apple announced a 4% boost to its quarterly payout, marking the 12th successive year of higher payouts.\n\nApple’s Increasing Focus on AI\n\nApple intends to push itself into generative AI (Gen AI) in 2024 by inorganic expansion. The company reportedly acquired Canadian AI startup DarwinAI earlier this year. Apple is preparing to transform Siri with advanced AI. The move will incorporate several features, including voice memo transcriptions and summaries, quick recaps of websites and notifications, automated message replies, advanced photo editing and AI-generated emojis, per Bloomberg, as quoted on straitstimes.\n\nPrice Target\n\nBased on short-term price targets offered by 30 analysts, the average price target for Apple comes to $205.96. The forecasts range from a low of $164.00 to a high of $275.00. The average price target represents an increase of 7.13% from the last closing price of $192.25 as of May 31, 2024. Price/Earnings (TTM) of Apple is 29.90X versus a P/E ratio of 46.02X possessed by the underlying industry.\n\nStory continues\n\nETFs in Focus\n\nInvestors intending to follow latest improvements of Apple but still wary of its apparently slow-paced AI initiatives may take the ETF route. This is because ETFs help investors mitigate one company’s average performance with the other big tech companies’ stellar presence.\n\nBelow, we highlight a few ETFs with heavy exposure to Apple for investors seeking to bet on the stock with much lower risk.\n\nSelect Sector SPDR Technology ETF XLK – AAPL holds the second spot with 19.10% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy).\n\nVanguard Information Technology ETF VGT – AAPL occupies the second location with 16.39% weight. The fund has a Zacks Rank #1.\n\niShares Dow Jones US Technology ETF IYW – AAPL takes the second spot with 15.21% weight.

        "content": "What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Tuesday?\n\nOn Tuesday, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co's (NYSE:TSM) C.C. Wei assumed the Chairman and CEO roles, marking the first time in years someone has held both positions. The stock is trading lower on Tuesday after closing higher by almost 3% on Monday.\n\nWei reiterated expectations for AI advancement to fuel a recovery in the industry by 2024. Quite interestingly, Wei is looking to boost the price of his company's AI chip production services.\n\nHe has already discussed the matter with Nvidia Corp (NASDAQ:NVDA) chief Jensen Huang, the Nikkei Asia reports.\n\nHe maintained earlier forecasts of 10% chip market growth this year, excluding the memory sector, though it was a more conservative outlook compared to April, citing challenges in smartphone and personal computing markets, Bloomberg reports.\n\nAlso Read: Taiwan Semi Leverages Asian Expertise and Culture for Chip Manufacturing Edge\n\nWei also ruled out the possibility of migrating TSMC's chip factories out of Taiwan, given that 80-90% of its production capacity is in the island.\n\nThe move reflects growing geopolitical tensions between Washington and China and The island's tensions with China, Reuters reports.\n\nWei's appointment represents a shift in leadership at TSMC, founded by Morris Chang and a pivotal player in global AI expansion.\n\nTSMC remains crucial to tech giants like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), Nvidia, and SK Hynix, supporting their AI services.\n\nConsolidating power under one executive comes as TSMC expands production overseas, notably with its Arizona plant, which is its most significant foreign investment. Wei emphasized TSMC's commitment to prioritizing advanced technology adoption in Taiwan before expanding abroad.\n\nTSMC executives indicated a focus on future investments over share buybacks or splits to capitalize on industry expansion.\n\nTSMC emerged as the leading foundry by revenue in the first quarter with a 62% market share. It expects up to 30% second-quarter sales growth. CNBC's Jim Cramer, expects Nvidia to soon crossMicrosoft Corp's (NASDAQ:MSFT) market cap backed by the former's AI, cloud computing, and data center moat.\n\nCurrently, the semiconductor industry, led by Nvidia, is struggling to adequately supply its customers with advanced AI graphical processing units (GPUs) triggered by the AI frenzy.\n\nAdditionally, growing geopolitical tensions between the U.S. and China are further affecting chip companies, which the U.S. has forbidden from supplying their advanced chip technology to China and the Middle East.\n\nStory continues\n\nTSMC stock gained over 58% in the last 12 months. Investors can gain exposure to the semiconductor sector via VanEck Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SMH) and iShares Semiconductor ETF (NASDAQ:SOXX).\n\nPrice Actions: TSM shares traded lower by 1.83% to $152.12 at the last check Tuesday.\n\nDisclaimer: This content was partially produced with the help of AI tools and was reviewed and published by Benzinga editors.\n\nPhoto by Jack Hong via Shutterstock\n\n\"ACTIVE INVESTORS' SECRET WEAPON\" Supercharge Your Stock Market Game with the #1 \"news & everything else\" trading tool: Benzinga Pro - Click here to start Your 14-Day Trial Now!\n\nGet the latest stock analysis from Benzinga?\n\nTAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR (TSM): Free Stock Analysis Report\n\nThis article What's Going On With Taiwan Semi Stock On Tuesday? originally appeared on Benzinga.com\n\n© 2024 Benzinga.com.

        "title": "Is This the Reason Warren Buffett Sold Apple Stock?",
        "content": "Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL) may be one of the best-performing stocks this century, but lately, the tech giant's performance hasn't been so stellar. Apple underperformed the S&P 500 by a wide margin so far this year as the stock's price is up less than 1%, compared to a nearly 11% gain from the S&P 500.\n\nWhile some of its big tech peers have surged over the past 18 months on excitement over artificial intelligence (AI), Apple seems to be getting left behind by the latest technology trend. Its quarterly results continue to show the company struggling to grow revenue, as the iPhone market that fuels the majority of its revenue continues to mature.\n\nTo add to its issues, Apple seems to be losing the support of its biggest backer. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway(NYSE: BRK.A)(NYSE: BRK.B) cut its stake in Apple for the second quarter in a row in 2024's first quarter. This time, Berkshire Hathaway sold more than 116 million shares of Apple, reducing its holdings by 13%. With the stock's underperformance, its value in the Berkshire portfolio fell from more than 50% at the end of the fourth quarter to less than 41% at the end of the first. Image source: The Motley Fool.\n\nIs Buffett turning on Apple?\n\nWarren Buffett is more open than most billionaire investors in talking about the stocks he buys and sells, but investors are still generally left guessing about Berkshire's stock purchases and sales. At Berkshire's annual shareholder meeting in early May, Buffett was asked about selling shares of Apple. In providing an answer, Buffett implied that the sale was related to possible changes in capital gains tax rates and wanting to lock in some of Berkshire's gains.\n\nWhile discussing the capital gains rate Buffett told shareholders at the meeting, \"I'm doing it at 21% this year and we're doing it at a little higher percentage later on, I don't think you'll actually mind the fact that we sold a little Apple this year.\"\n\nHowever, that might not explain the whole reason for Berkshire's decision to cut its Apple stake.  Buffett has raved about Apple as a business several times over the years, saying he thinks of it as Berkshire's third business after its insurance business and its BNSF railroad. However, Berkshire also adjusts its holdings, and Apple's recent earnings report may offer some explanation for why an investor would sell the stock.\n\nRevenue in the fiscal 2024 second quarter fell 4% year over year to $90.8 billion as iPhone sales declined, and the company continues to face challenges in China. While the services business continues to grow, it's not growing fast enough to sustain Apple's prior growth strategy. The company needs product sales to return to growth. As growth slows, earnings per share (EPS) were essentially flat in the period and improved mostly because of large levels of share buybacks and the higher margins that the growth in services offers.\n\nStory continues\n\nIs Apple's economic moat narrowing?\n\nOne alternate explanation for Berkshire's sell-off could be that the iPhone maker's economic moat isn't as strong as it once was. Apple isn't facing a threat from a new competitor, but in many ways, the company competes with itself.\n\nIf the company is going to sell new smartphones and devices, they need to be measurably better than previous models to convince investors to keep buying them. The upgrade cycle, or the amount of time consumers wait to buy a new iPhone, has been getting longer, which is putting pressure on iPhone sales.\n\nWith the company expected to release its 16th-generation iPhone device later this year, there may be some consumer fatigue for the company's trademark phone and a feeling among investors that it needs a new growth driver. Additionally, the company's perceived lack of significant investment in AI could leave it standing in the shallows in the coming years, as peers like Microsoft and Alphabet seem to be jumping into the deep end when it comes to AI.\n\nFinally, Apple stock is still expensive based on traditional metrics. It trades at a price-to-earnings ratio of 30, an especially high valuation for a company with declining revenue. Apple may eventually return to stronger revenue growth, but for now, the stock looks to be at risk of a pullback as the business is shrinking.\n\nThat may not be the actual reason Buffett sold Apple, but it's not a bad reason for other current shareholders to sell the stock. Apple is struggling in its core business. It seems to have fallen behind in the AI race, and the valuation is pricey. Whether you're Buffett or not, those are all good reasons to consider selling Apple stock today.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Forget Nvidia: Billionaires Are Selling the Artificial Intelligence (AI) Giant and Piling Into This \"Magnificent Seven\" Stock Instead",
        "content": "You might not realize it, but one of the most important data releases of the entire quarter occurred three weeks ago. During the heart of earnings season, and following the eagerly awaited April inflation report, institutions with $100 million in assets under management filed Form 13F with the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n\nIn simple terms, a 13F provides an over-the-shoulder snapshot of what Wall Street's smartest and most-successful investors bought and sold in the most recent quarter. In this instance, it covered trading activity during the March-ended quarter. Even though these snapshots are backward looking, they can offer valuable insight into what stocks, industries, and trends are piquing the interest of Wall Street's top investors.\n\nOne theme that's definitely stood out for more than a year has been Wall Street's love for almost anything involved in the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution. Using software and systems in place of humans, and giving these systems the ability to evolve over time without human intervention, provides AI with multitrillion-dollar utility in virtually all sectors and industries. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nBut what's interesting about this affinity for AI stocks is that the face of the AI revolution has been sent to the chopping block for two consecutive quarters by billionaire investors. At the same time, we've seen billionaires repeatedly pile into another \"Magnificent Seven\" stock with abundant long-term potential.\n\nOver a half-dozen billionaires are dumping Nvidia stock\n\nAlthough artificial intelligence might be the hottest innovation since the advent of the internet in the mid-1990s, it didn't stop more than a half-dozen billionaire money managers from casting aside shares of the infrastructure backbone of the AI movement during the March-ended quarter. Eight billionaire investors -- nine if you include the recently passed Jim Simons of Renaissance Technologies -- sent shares of Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) packing, including (total shares sold in parenthesis):\n\nPhilippe Laffont of Coatue Management (2,937,060 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (2,462,716 shares) Israel Englander of Millennium Management (720,004 shares) Stanley Druckenmiller of Duquesne Family Office (441,551 shares) John Overdeck and David Siegel of Two Sigma Investments (420,801 shares) David Tepper of Appaloosa Management (348,000 shares) Steven Cohen of Point72 Asset Management (304,505 shares)\n\nThere's no denying that Nvidia has taken advantage of its AI-driven opportunity. The company's graphics processing units (GPUs) are the preferred choice in high-compute data centers, and it's enjoying otherworldly pricing power on these chips as a result. Nvidia's gross margin came in at a scorching-hot 78.4% during its fiscal first quarter (ended April 28).\n\nStory continues\n\nNevertheless, there are four very clear reasons for billionaire investors to be skeptical of Nvidia moving forward.\n\nPerhaps the most obvious is that history has been unkind to next-big-thing innovations over the last three decades. Without fail, investors have overestimated the uptake/adoption of every new innovation, and AI is unlikely to break this trend. If the AI bubble bursts, the company that most-directly benefited from its rise (Nvidia) would be the likeliest to deflate.\n\nThe second issue is that Nvidia's pricing power on its GPUs is likely to wane in the quarters to come. Competitors are rolling out GPUs designed to train large language models and oversee generative AI solutions in AI-accelerated data centers. Even if Nvidia's H100 GPUs retain a compute edge over its competitors, the increased availability of new GPUs will lessen the scarcity that sent Nvidia's pricing power into the stratosphere. When this pricing power fades, so will Nvidia's gross margin.\n\nTight domestic regulation on AI solutions is another concern. In each of the last two years, U.S. regulators have restricted what AI chips Nvidia can export to China, the world's No. 2 economy by gross domestic product. Nvidia even developed toned-down AI-GPUs (the A800 and H800) specifically for China following the first round of export restrictions in 2022, only to have these chips also banned for export to China last year. Sans China, Nvidia is missing out on billions of dollars in potential quarterly revenue.\n\nThe fourth and final puzzle piece that may have encouraged billionaires to ring the register is an increasing amount of internal competition. Nvidia's top four customers account for roughly 40% of its net sales. The problem is that they're all developing in-house AI-GPUs of their own. Regardless of whether these internally developed chips are to complement Nvidia's H100 GPUs or to replace them entirely, we're likely witnessing a peak in orders from these industry-leading businesses. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nThis Magnificent Seven stock has been the apple of billionaires' eyes\n\nSince the curtain opened on 2023, the Magnificent Seven stocks have been widely credited with sending Wall Street's major stocks indexes to record-closing highs. The Magnificent Seven are some of the largest (by market cap) and most-influential businesses in the country and are comprised of:\n\nMicrosoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) Nvidia Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL)(NASDAQ: GOOG) Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) Meta Platforms(NASDAQ: META) Tesla(NASDAQ: TSLA)\n\nThese seven companies are industry leaders with well-defined long-term catalysts and clear competitive edges. In fact, the four top customers of Nvidia I alluded to earlier are Microsoft, Meta Platforms, Amazon, and Alphabet.\n\nBut these are also stocks that billionaires have been avid sellers of in recent quarters... with one exception: e-commerce behemoth Amazon. During the first quarter, nine billionaires piled into Amazon stock, including (total shares purchased in parenthesis):\n\nIsrael Englander of Millennium Management (2,390,755 shares) Ole Andreas Halvorsen of Viking Global Investors (1,972,702 shares) Chase Coleman of Tiger Global Management (1,438,600 shares) Jeff Yass of Susquehanna International (1,336,042 shares) Ray Dalio of Bridgewater Associates (1,047,891 shares) Dan Loeb of Third Point (900,000 shares) Ken Fisher of Fisher Asset Management (785,018 shares) Ken Griffin of Citadel Advisors (352,453 shares) Philippe Laffont of Coatue Management (241,514 shares)\n\nYou'll note that three of the biggest sellers of Nvidia stock (Laffont, Griffin, and Englander) were buyers of Amazon shares.\n\nThough Amazon's online marketplace is considered the \"face\" of the company, it's not why billionaires have taken the plunge. Amazon's exceptional growth in cash flow has everything to do with its trio of fast-growing ancillary operating segments.\n\nNothing is more important to Amazon's cash flow or bottom line than the ongoing growth and success of cloud infrastructure service platform Amazon Web Services (AWS). Based on an analysis from Canalys, AWS accounted for a hearty 31% of global cloud infrastructure service spending to end 2023. As of the March-ended quarter, AWS had surpassed $100 billion in annual run-rate sales. With enterprise cloud spending still rapidly accelerating, the juicy margins associated with cloud services should allow Amazon to rapidly grow its operating cash flow.\n\nSubscription services (e.g., Prime) is another segment that can deliver sustained double-digit growth potential. In exchange for Prime member perks like free two-day shipping on most online marketplace orders and access to Amazon's growing content library, Amazon enjoys strong subscription pricing power with Prime. Amazon surpassed 200 million global Prime subscribers in April 2021, according to then-CEO Jeff Bezos, and has almost certainly added to this total.\n\nThe third higher-margin ancillary segment that does some heavy lifting for Amazon is advertising. When you're driving in the neighborhood of 2.5 billion monthly visitors to your site each month, as well as growing the number of Prime subscribers, it's easy to command higher prices from advertisers who want motivated shoppers to see their message(s).\n\nPut these three ancillary segments together and you get a company slated to more than double its cash-flow-per-share between 2023 and 2027. Relative to its future cash flow, Amazon remains historically cheap.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

Something big has to happen that provides a catalyst that causes shares to take off.\n\nTwo of the most widely followed stocks on the market could soon have such catalysts. Big developments for Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) and Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) are only days away. Should you buy both stocks now?\n\nMajor events for these two tech giants\n\nApple's big news should be announced on June 10. That's when the company's annual Worldwide Developers Conference (WWDC) begins. While the event runs through June 14, Apple will deliver its keynote presentation on the first day.\n\nSpeculation has reached a fever pitch about what Apple might announce at this year's WWDC. Many industry observers expect the company to introduce major new artificial intelligence (AI) capabilities. Apple CEO Tim Cook hinted in the May quarterly conference call, \"We can't wait to reveal what we have in store.\" He then commented about Apple's investments and opportunities in generative AI, adding fuel to the fire of anticipation the company will talk about new generative AI tools at the WWDC.\n\nApple's upcoming major news is shrouded in mystery. No one knows for sure everything the company will announce at its event next week (although there has been no shortage of predictions). It's a different story for Nvidia, though. Investors know exactly what's on the way.\n\nNvidia will conduct a 10-for-1 stock split after market close on Friday, June 7. All record holders of its common stock at the market close on Thursday, June 6, will get another nine shares. Nvidia will begin trading at a lower split-adjusted share price at the market open on Monday, June 10. This is arguably the most highly anticipated stock split of the year.\n\nBuy Apple and Nvidia stocks ASAP?\n\nShould you buy Apple and Nvidia as soon as possible to get in on the stocks before their major developments in the next few days? There are some straightforward arguments why the answer could be yes.\n\nApple could wow investors with its new AI capabilities and extend the stock's current rebound. Some think the company could even spark a multiyear super cycle of iPhone upgrades.\n\nNvidia's stock split could attract enough retail investors who didn't buy the stock in the past because of its high share price and ignite yet another surge for the high-flying stock. The stock split could also set the stage for Nvidia to be added to the Dow Jones Industrial Average, a move that would spur mutual funds and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that track the index to buy the stock.\n\nStory continues\n\nHowever, there's no guarantee that Apple's and Nvidia's big news will provide strong catalysts. Apple's AI announcements could be underwhelming. Rumors are already circulating that the company won't introduce any new hardware.\n\nAs for Nvidia, many online brokerages already support buying and selling fractional shares, which lessens the impact of a stock split. I don't think investors should buy Apple and Nvidia solely because of their big developments on the way.\n\nThe long-term case for these stocks\n\nGranted, it's possible that Apple's WWDC announcements and Nvidia's stock split could cause temporary spikes for both stocks. The best approach for investors, though, is to focus on the long-term prospects for these companies. And those prospects appear to be good in both cases.\n\nRegardless of what Apple reveals next week, the company could be in a great position to lead the charge in the edge AI market. So far, the focus on AI has primarily centered on cloud applications. Edge AI involves running AI apps on devices where data is created and viewed.\n\nMore than 2.2 billion Apple devices, including iPhones and iPads, are used worldwide. With the right AI strategy, the company could be a huge winner in the edge AI market.\n\nNvidia remains the 800-pound gorilla in the AI chip market. I think the company's pace of innovation could enable it to stay on top for years to come. If AI delivers on its potential (and I suspect it will), Nvidia should continue to be a great stock to own over the long term.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "content": "The Q1 earnings season is now largely behind us, with more than 480 S&P 500 companies already delivering quarterly results. Technology companies contributed significantly to the growth pace, and the same is expected for Q2; earnings and revenue for the sector are currently expected to be up +14.4% and +9.3%, respectively. Three companies leading the trend are Nvidia, Apple and Vertiv.\n\nThroughout the Q1 cycle Nvidia NVDA, Apple AAPL and Vertiv VRT posted quarterly records. All three stocks have enjoyed bullish price action over the last three months, as illustrated below. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nLet’s take a closer look at each.\n\nVertiv Stock Gains on AI Interest\n\nVertiv shares have been big beneficiaries of the AI frenzy, exiting its latest quarter with its highest backlog in company history totaling $6.3 billion. The company provides services for data centersthrough a portfolio of power, cooling, and other services.\n\nThe stock sports a favorable Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), with the revisions trend notably bullish for its current fiscal year, up nearly 80% over the last year. VRT’s growth is expected to remain robust, with the Zacks Consensus EPS estimate suggesting a 36% year-over-year pop in earnings. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nFollowing the release, Vertiv upped its full-year guidance, causing shares to soar post-earnings. Other notable highlights from the release include 60% organic order growth and $600 million in share buybacks throughout the period.\n\nThe company has also enjoyed margin expansion as of late, aiding its profitability in a big way. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nApple Stock Surges on Services Growth\n\nUp 7% over the last month, Apple shares have seemingly regained their mojo after a slow start to 2024. The tech titan’s latest set of quarterly results and recent news from the WSJ regarding the development of chips for AI software in data centers have aided performance nicely.\n\nThe company’s Services portfolio has been a solid growth driver over recent periods, helping decrease the reliance on the iPhone. Services revenue totaled $23.9 throughout its latest period, climbing 14% year-over-year and reflecting a quarterly record.\n\nAs shown below, Apple has consistently surprised positively regarding Services sales, with the most recent beat totaling $570 million. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nShare performance has been boosted by recent favorable reports of iPhone shipments in China, easing concerns over demand issues in the area.\n\nNvidia Stock Remains Strong Buy for AI Exposure\n\nInvestors are beginning to run out of phrases to describe Nvidia’s unbelievable performance over the last year, driven by unrelenting demand for chips needed in AI applications. The company has exceeded our consensus EPS expectations by an average of nearly 20% across its last four releases, also seeing a bright earnings outlook across the board.\n\nStory continues\n\nThanks to the positive earnings outlook, the stock remains a highly coveted Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) and represents a prime consideration for those seeking AI exposure. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nData Center revenue of $22.6 billion once again blew away our consensus estimate and reflected another quarterly record, continuing the recent streak of robust results. As shown below, NVDA has exceeded our consensus Data Center expectations by a minimum of $1.4 billion across the last four periods. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nAnd perhaps to the surprise of some, NVDA shares haven’t become expensive amid the incredible run, currently trading at a 38.1X forward 12-month earnings multiple compared to a 50.7X five-year median and five-year highs of 106.3X in 2023. Zacks Investment Research\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nBottom Line\n\nThe Q1 earnings season has slowly winded down, with just a few S&P 500 companies yet to deliver their Q1 results at this stage. The period was primarily better than expected, underpinned by a strong performance from technology companies.\n\nAnd concerning positivity, all three companies above – Nvidia NVDA, Apple AAPL, and Vertiv VRT – posted quarterly records.\n\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

        "content": "Last year and this year saw record numbers of institutional and retail investors pile into Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA). The company’s stock value has increased, along with the rise of artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nNvidia makes graphic chips used to train and operate AI applications. As a result, companies experimenting with AI applications are buying Nvidia products, causing its stock to climb.\n\nBut not everyone is enthused with Nvidia, including billionaires. That’s certainly true for legendary investor Warren Buffet, who famously said not to buy what you don’t understand.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nSo, let’s see which stocks billionaires are betting on instead of Nvidia. You just might walk away with insights into what stocks to buy for your portfolio.\n\nAmazon (AMZN) Closeup of the Amazon logo at Amazon campus in Palo Alto, California. The Palo Alto location hosts A9 Search, Amazon Web Services, and Amazon Game Studios teams. AMZN stock\n\nSource: Tada Images / Shutterstock.com\n\nAmazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock is a strong investor favorite and one of the solid stocks to buy.\n\nIt sure is for billionaire Steven Cohen, who slashed his investment company Point72’s Nvidia position by 55% this quarter but maintained Amazon as the company’s largest stock allocation at $680 million.\n\nThe tech and e-commerce business has forayed into several industries, including e-commerce, cloud computing, entertainment, publishing and AI. That has made it one of the most successful companies and earned it a place in the Magnificent Seven.\n\nThe company’s 2024 Q1 results had a strong showing across all key metrics. It included a net income of $10.4 billion against $3.2 billion last year. Its earnings per share also grew to $0.98 from $0.31 a year ago.\n\nMoreover, Amazon shares are in focus after Reuters reported the company is in talks to pump billions of euros into data centers in Italy in its latest push to expand its cloud presence in Europe.\n\nChevron (CVX) Chevron (CVX) sing with \"diesel,\" \"food mart\" and \"car wash\" written underneath\n\nSource: Sundry Photography / Shutterstock.com\n\nBillionaire Warren Buffet’s Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE:BRK-A, NYSE:BRK-B) has a $332 billion stock portfolio spread out across 41 stocks, and Nvidia isn’t one of them.\n\nThe holding company’s top five holdings include Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL): 41%, Bank of America (NYSE:BAC): 12%, American Express (NYSE:AXP): 10%, Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO): 7.4% and Chevron (NYSE:CVX): 5.8% — per Q1’s 13F filing. Chevron’s position is worth over $19 billion.\n\nThe oil and gas company is noteworthy because Berkshire Hathaway significantly upped its stake in Q4 last year.\n\nChevron shares are expected to rise if it buys out Hess Corp (NYSE:HES) in a $53 billion merger proposal. The deal is currently on ice due to a dispute with ExxonMobil (NYSE:XOM), a Hess partner.\n\nStory continues\n\nDespite that particular wrinkle, analysts are bullish on Chevron — and it’s a promising stock to buy. At the time of writing, CVX has 12 buy ratings on the Wall Street Journal, with a price target of $183.99. Shares are currently trading in the ballpark of $162 apiece.\n\nCVR Energy (CVI) The logo for CVR Energy (CVI) is shown on a cellphone next to a screen displaying the company's website.\n\nSource: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com\n\nAll signs have been pointing to trouble for CVR Energy (NYSE:CVI), but that hasn’t stopped billionaire Carl Icahn from allocating close to 20% of his portfolio to its shares.\n\nThe Sugar Land, Texas-based oil refining company’s financials for Q1 2024 paint the picture of hard times for the company for the past year.\n\nFor instance, it netted only $90 million this quarter compared to $259 million for the same period last year. Its adjusted earnings were 4 cents per diluted share against earnings of $1.44 for the first quarter of last year.\n\nIcahn first bought CVR stock in 2012. He’s known for his investment activism, where he buys big stakes in companies and then pushes for changes in their structure to boost the stock price. The so-called “Icahn lift” is a phenomenon in which companies’ stock tends to increase in value after Icahn buys into them.\n\nCVR’s fundamentals are shaky at the moment, but if Icahn’s massive position in the company means anything to you, CVR might be an okay stock to buy.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not hold (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "title": "AI Ambassadors: 3 Stocks Bridging the Gap Between Humanity and Machine",
        "content": "Many people are predicting that computers will be smarter than their human creators as early as 2030. Known as artificial general intelligence, this would be the point at which humans are no longer the most intelligent things on the planet. Analysts and scientists say within a decade, machines could be making decisions independent of human control. This is a brave new world that has the potential for both positive and negative outcomes.\n\nRegardless of how things shakeout, there’s no question that artificial intelligence (AI) will shape our collective future and is fast emerging as the dominant technology of our time. Certain companies are leading the charge and pushing the frontiers of AI, as well as working to infuse AI into all kinds of machines and technologies. Here are AI ambassadors: three stocks bridging the gap between humanity and machine.\n\nAdobe (ADBE) A white and blue building with the Adobe logo is pictured in front of a blue sky\n\nSource: JHVEPhoto / Shutterstock\n\nAdobe (NASDAQ:ADBE), the software company behind popular creative products such as Photoshop and Illustrator, is adding AI where it can. In recent months, Adobe has launched AI assistant for both its Reader and Acrobat products. Management has called AI “the new digital camera.” The company is leading in terms of finding practical ways for AI to help humans enhance their creativity.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nAI has proven to be a bit of a double edged sword for Adobe. ADBE stock has been hurt by news that privately held OpenAI has developed Sora, an AI platform that can generate videos based on written descriptions, similar to some Adobe products. The stock has also been dinged by news that Adobe canceled its planned $20 billion acquisition of design software start-up Figma and had to pay a $1 billion termination fee.\n\nDespite near-term headwinds, Adobe stock should be fine in the long run. Investors might want to take advantage of the fact that ADBE stock is down 23% year to date.\n\nTaiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSM) TSM stock: the Taiwan Semiconductor logo on the side of its facility in Taiwan\n\nSource: ToyW / Shutterstock\n\nFew companies are doing as much to enable the AI revolution as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co. (NYSE:TSM). The microchip foundry currently makes about three-quarters (75%) of all the chips and semiconductors used in the world today. Most AI applications and models run on chips that are produced by TSMC, as the company is known. It is a highly specialized business that is red hot right now.\n\nTSMC’s services are so in-demand that the U.S. government has given the company $6.60 billion to fund the construction of microchip fabrication plants in Arizona. TSMC is spending $65 billion to build three cutting-edge fabrication plants in Phoenix. The plants are expected to be operational in 2027 and will provide microchips to customers such as Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL).\n\nStory continues\n\nTSM stock has risen 50% so far in 2024.\n\nTesla (TSLA) Tesla (TSLA) sign on the building on car sales\n\nSource: Vitaliy Karimov / Shutterstock.com\n\nAs its main electric vehicle manufacturing business struggles, Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) is pivoting to focus on AI. CEO Elon Musk has pledged to spend $10 billion this year alone on AI and has moved the company to focus both on AI and robotics with apparent plans to combine the two in the future.

Given the continued decline in Tesla’s sales and market share, switching to focus on AI, super computers, and humanoid robots might be the company’s future.\n\nMusk’s enthusiasm for electric vehicles appears to be waning along with the public’s interest.

        "title": "4 CEOs Who Bought Their Own Stock in May",
        "content": "Defying bad news, several chief executive officers bought their own companies' stock last month. Here are four cases that caught my eye.\n\nAt Skyworks Solutions Inc. (NASDAQ:SWKS), CEO Liam Griffin spent just over $1 million to buy 11,142 shares. That brings his total holding to 153,431 shares, worth more than $14 million as of May 31.\n\nA semiconductor maker, Skyworks specializes in chips for mobile devices, especially smartphones. Its customers have included Apple Inc. (NASDAQ:AAPL), Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN), Samsung Electronics Co. (XKRX:005930) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nWarning! GuruFocus has detected 5 Warning Signs with SWKS.\n\nApple is the biggest customer, and Skyworks has been criticized for over-dependence on Apple. That's a valid criticism, but far from a fatal one in my view.\n\nSkyworks has grown its revenue at an 11.60% annual clip in the past decade. But in the past year, revenue fell (coincidentally) 11.60%. Investors have to gauge which result is more indicative of the future.\n\nGriffin is apparently on the optimistic side of that choice. He has been with Skyworks for many years and has frequently sold shares acquired as executive compensation. Last month's buy was his first open-market purchase since 2006.\n\nSkyworks stock seems reasonably priced at 15 times the earnings analysts expect for the fiscal year in progress.\n\nGlobe Life\n\nGlobe Life Inc. (NYSE:GL) shares took a 53% dive on April 11, on a negative report by Fuzzy Panda Research. Fuzzy Panda, which held a short position in the stock (betting on a decline) alleged that Globe was guilty of insurance fraud.\n\nFuzzy Panda alleged that Globe Life has sold life insurance policies to dead people and fictitious people. It also alleged that Globe Life executives secretly had an ownership stake in Xcel Testing, and directed recruits to Xcel to prepare for licensing examinations.\n\nGlobe Life responded that Fuzzy Panda's report was wildly misleading and painted a picture of the company that is deliberately false. It said the report mischaracterizes facts and uses unsubstantiated claims and conjecture.\n\nThe company has co-CEOs James Darden and Frank Svoboda. Both of them bought shares in May, as did two other company executives. In addition, four directors bought shares in April, about two weeks after the short seller's attack.\n\nBloomberg News on April 12 described Fuzzy Panda as an anonymous organization.\" I'm skeptical that the short seller's attack is accurate. Accordingly, I think the stock is a speculative buy, but I wouldn't put more than 1% of your portfolio in it.\n\nStory continues\n\nGlobe Life shares fell from more than $120 early this year to just below $50 when the short seller's report hit. It has climbed back to about $83.\n\nOxford Lane\n\nOxford Lane Capital Corp. (NASDAQ:OXLC) is a closed-end investment company that invests in collateralized loan obligations. CEO Jonathan Cohen spent $25 million in May to greatly increase his stake. President Saul Rosenthal made an identical investment.\n\nThese two executives are attempting to shore up a company that has posted four losses in the past 10 years. The dividend yield is gigantic, at about 17% a year, and dividends are paid monthly. A dividend that large is a danger sign, but may also be an opportunity.\n\nAcacia Research\n\nAcacia Research Corp. (NASDAQ:ACTG) is bafflingly diverse for a small company. One segment makes printers and supplies for industrial printing. Another explores for and produces oil and gas. A third acquires and manages patents.\n\nThe company has lost money in six of the past 10 years. Over that time, the stock has lost 65% of its value. Nonetheless, CEO Martin Mcnulty and general counsel Jason Soncini bought shares in May. These were the first insider buys since 2021.\n\nThe record\n\nThe column you're reading is the 70th one I've written about insider purchases and sales. I'm missing some data for the first six, but can tabulate 12-month results for 60 columns all those from 1999 through a year ago.\n\nThe stocks I've recommended based on insider buys have beaten the Standard & Poor's 500 Total Return Index by an average of 0.40 percentage points.\n\nWhen insiders bought, but I suggested avoiding the stock, the average result trailed the S&P 500 by 24 percentage points.\n\nOn stocks where I discussed insider sales, the average result was two percentage points below the index.\n\nOn a few stocks, I noted buying by company executives but made no comment or an ambiguous one. Perversely, this group beat the benchmark by 16 percentage points.\n\nBear in mind that my column results are hypothetical and shouldn't be confused with results I obtain for clients. Also, past performance doesn't predict the future.\n\nJohn Dorfman is chairman of Dorfman Value Investments LLC in Boston, and a syndicated columnist.

        "title": "Foldable phones are increasingly popular—and Samsung’s share of the market is dropping",
        "content": "Nearly six years ago, I wrote an article lambasting the smartphone industry for still trying to make folding phones happen, after years of trying and failing. It’s a gimmicky form factor, I proclaimed—bulky, fragile, and destined to go the way of the 3D TV, which was another example of manufacturers trying to push something for which there was no appreciable consumer pull.\n\nThen, of course, Samsung and other manufacturers went on to make something of a success of the folding phone. But how wrong was I, exactly?\n\nLast week, Counterpoint Research said the global market for folding smartphones grew 49% in the first quarter of this year, with Huawei at the forefront (Huawei's shipments of such devices were up 257% year on year.) And according to new data from the market intelligence firm TrendForce, 17.8 million foldable phones will be shipped this year.\n\nThat’s pretty impressive, but it’s also still only 1.5% of the smartphone market. However, TrendForce expects the form factor to command 4.8% by 2028, partly due to falling prices—2019’s Samsung Galaxy Fold cost a cough-worthy $1,980, but ZTE’s Nubia brand is now selling a folding phone in Japan for just $499.\n\nSamsung is still projected to have the lion’s share of the folding phone market this year, but the Korean giant is a less dominant beast in this sub-sector than it once was, with its name on just 50.4% of shipments, down from over 80% just a couple years ago.\n\nTrendForce has Huawei boosting its market share from 12% last year to over 30% in 2024, followed by Motorola with 6%, then a bunch of other Chinese brands. The scale of Huawei’s jump would supposedly be aided by the launch of a rumored “tri-fold” phone, which somewhat reminds me of The Onion’s profane yet prescient “Five Blades” article from a couple decades back—still the best takedown of the corporate \"more is more\" attitude.\n\nAnd then there’s Apple’s so-called iPhone Flip, which rumormongers have been predicting for a good seven years now. The Information reported earlier this year that Cupertino has not one but two foldable iPhone prototypes knocking around. If it comes to (pardon the pun) fruition, Apple’s entry “could significantly shift market dynamics,” TrendForce’s analysts noted.\n\nPersonally, I think Apple has plenty on its plate without trying to belatedly enter yet another market that’s taken off despite its lack of presence—see: generative AI—but what do I know? I thought foldable phones were a bust and that’s clearly not the case, even if, as TrendForce points out, their repair rates are relatively high.\n\nStory continues\n\nBut I’m keen to know what you all think. Have you bought a foldable phone or would you consider doing so? What were your experiences with the form factor? And do you think Apple is likely to dive into the field?

        "title": "The Rally Will End. 3 Meme Stocks to Sell While You Still Can",
        "content": "Mid-May saw a round of meme stock rallies when Keith Gill, a.k.a Roaring Kitty, made a surprise return — in true meme fashion — on social media. Roaring Kitty is the trader from Massachusetts who instigated the infamous meme stock breakout in 2021 that pitted retail investors against Wall Street.\n\nHis reappearance signaled to retail investors that another meme rally was here and caused several stocks to rise by three-digit percentage points.\n\nBut these types of rallies tend not to be sustainable, which is why you might want to consider these meme stocks to sell while you still can.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nGameStop (GME) An empty GameStop (GME) store in Dresden, Germany.\n\nSource: 1take1shot / Shutterstock.com\n\nGameStop (NYSE:GME) is the quintessential meme stock, and that’s why it’s the first on this list. But the primary reason I’m including it as a meme stock to sell is that GameStop’s fundamentals and longevity prospects have been shaky for years now.\n\nGME share price increase nearly sixfold from late April through the start of trading on May 14 before sinking over 20% by market close.\n\nIt shot up again over 20% after the video-game store chain announced it had cashed in $933 million from the meme stock surge this month.\n\nHowever, this meme rally alone will not fix GameStop’s.\n\nGameStop’s business model involves  customers walking into its brick-and-mortar stores to buy video games, gaming merchandise and consumer electronics.\n\nThe problem is customers are increasingly going online for those types of solutions — something that has proven detrimental to the firm’s survivability prospects. Unless it goes back to the drawing board, GameStop has serious headwinds ahead. It makes GME stock some of the meme stocks to sell at the moment.\n\nAMC Entertainment (AMC) AMC Entertainment sell off continues as stock sees tenth straight losing day, as the markets continued to see volatility following Federal Reserve Chairman's speech.\n\nSource: TY Lim / Shutterstock.com\n\nAMC Theatres (NYSE:AMC) has been hanging on by a thread for years now.\n\nBetween the lingering effects of Covid-19 — when moviegoers stayed home to Hollywood’s recent labor strikes and increasing competition from streaming services like Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX) to being billions in debt, the movie theater chain is barely keeping above water.\n\nIts occasional savior has been retail investors, who heavily bought its stock in 2021 and this month after Roaring Kitty’s re-emergence on X.\n\nAnother shot in its arm was singers Taylor Swift and Beyonce’s concert films — whose direct distribution deals with the company last year padded its bottom line for the time being.\n\nBut the company has a long way to go before it can become profitable again, and these random lifelines will not suffice to keep it afloat in the long term.\n\nStory continues\n\nAMC stock’s over 100% climb on Roaring Kitty’s return this month cemented its status as a meme stock and is one you want to sell ASAP.\n\nBlackberry (BB) BlackBerry Limited logo. Company was originally known as Research In Motion (RIM), a Canadian software company specializing in cybersecurity.. BB stock. meme stocks to sell\n\nSource: Poetra.RH / Shutterstock.com\n\nBlackberry (NYSE:BB) stock rose this month in tandem with other meme stocks, but it is a meme stock to sell while you still can.\n\nThe BlackBerry company is another casualty of being caught being on the wrong side of a fast-changing business environment — just like GamesStop and AMC in their respective niches.\n\nBlackBerry was once a roaring success as a phone maker but was edged out of the market by Alphabet’s (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) and Apple’s (NASDAQ:AAPL) iOS.\n\nIt has since rebranded itself as a cybersecurity and IoT software developer and had some success. For instance, for the 2024 fiscal year, it declared $853 million in revenue, with its IoT business reporting a 25% year-over-year (YOY) revenue jump.\n\nBut the same can’t be said for its stock. Its share price has declined 48% YOY and 50% from the same time two years ago.\n\nIt’s clear BlackBerry has some work to do to win back investor confidence. Until then, it’s right there with other meme stocks to sell right now.\n\nOn the date of publication, Hope Mutie did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the stocks mentioned in this article.

        "content": "This is The Takeaway from today's Morning Brief, which you can sign up to receive in your inbox every morning along with:\n\nThe chart of the day What we're watching What we're reading Economic data releases and earnings\n\nThe Nasdaq Composite crossed the 17,000 mark for the first time earlier this week.\n\nI'm not exactly one to get excited about record highs on major exchanges or on certain stocks, but I found this \"milestone\" to be really cool.\n\nWhen I began my career in the summer of 2004, the Nasdaq Composite was at 1,800 or so and not too far removed from the dot-com bust. That's a ninefold-plus increase in 20 years — at the same time my hairline DECREASED by ninefold!\n\nToday, we are witnessing another tech boom, with the daily advancement of generative AI fueling the rise of companies such as Nvidia (NVDA), Anthropic, and OpenAI. While some of this tech is scary as hell, there is no denying the impact it's having on value perception in markets.\n\nAnd throughout the week, I got the latest dose of insight into how the spread of AI is powering financial statements and outlooks.\n\nHP Inc. (HPQ) CEO Enrique Lores told me (video above) a factor in the company's above-consensus second quarter EPS guidance is the release of higher-priced AI PCs in mid-June. These will be HP's first crop of AI PCs with beefier processors to support various AI-related tasks.\n\nChewy (CHWY) CEO Sumit Singh didn't explicitly mention AI in our chat, but you could see how it's beginning to drive better sales and margins. It's my understanding the company is able to react quicker to consumer needs because of its investments in automated technology.\n\nA similar vibe was felt when I talked to Abercrombie & Fitch (ANF) CEO Fran Horowitz, who is using new technology to keep inventory low, then \"chase\" demand signals it's getting in real time. The end result: impressive margin expansion.\n\nExciting stuff!\n\nAnd all of it helps to understand the enthusiasm around a lot of big-cap tech stocks.\n\nBut then there were those rough Salesforce (CRM) numbers and guidance.\n\nOof.\n\nI wrote about them at the crack of dawn in our live markets blog, as I couldn't get over how disappointing the quarter was — truly came out of left field given the company's new suite of AI offerings.\n\nNevertheless, guidance was lackluster and Salesforce could be sitting out of the hot AI trade until the macroeconomic backdrop improves.\n\nBut the shocking Salesforce quarter sent me off to dig into the tech-heavy Nasdaq, specifically the Nasdaq 100 — the 100 largest nonfinancial companies traded on the Nasdaq — to see if there are warning signs creeping into the picture.\n\nStory continues\n\nIn short, I'm not liking what I've found, for you believers in stock prices being the truth — or a predictor of future fundamentals.\n\nWhile the Nasdaq 100 is hovering around fresh highs amid strength in names like Nvidia and Apple (AAPL), drastically fewer stocks are holding above their 50-day moving averages, per new research from Sundial Capital Research. As of last week, fewer than 60% of stocks in the Nasdaq 100 were holding above their 50-day moving averages. That's not great.\n\nFewer and fewer stocks are holding above their 200-day moving average as well, Sundial notes.\n\n\"It looks ominous on a chart, but historically, most of the weakness in forward returns was confined to the next 1-3 months,\" said Sundial's research team.\n\nSome of the laggards in the Nasdaq 100 include consumer names Dollar Tree (DLTR) and Lululemon (LULU).

        "title": "Is Nvidia Stock a Buy Now?",
        "content": "Chip designer Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) looks virtually unstoppable right about now.\n\nThe company crushed Wall Street's expectations and management's guidance targets in last week's first-quarter report. A global thirst for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, and particularly for semi-creative generative AI platforms, drove Nvidia's results through the ceiling again.\n\nAs a result, the stock soared to fresh all-time highs. With a market capitalization of $2.85 trillion, only Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) and Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) can claim a larger market value nowadays.\n\nGiven Nvidia's impressive performance and rich valuation, it's only fair to ask whether the stock can soar any higher from this lofty point. Is Nvidia still a great buy, or is it high time to lock in your Nvidia gains with a quick sell?\n\nA bull case for Nvidia\n\nThe company has many things going for it. Covering all of Nvidia's proven or potential growth catalysts would take a book, but let's scratch the surface:\n\nNvidia is making money hand over fist. Top-line revenue jumped 262% year over year in the first quarter, driving adjusted earnings 461% higher. Free cash flow exploded 479% higher. The company's manufacturing partners, led by Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing(NYSE: TSM) and Samsung(OTC: SSNL.F), don't have unlimited production capacities. Heavy demand for Nvidia's current lineup of AI accelerator chips has created a backlog of unfilled orders and product delivery wait times of roughly four months. That's down from 11 months in the fall of 2023, partly thanks to export restrictions into China. Still, the supply and-demand equation remains heavily unbalanced in favor of strong demand and limited supply. The generative AI rush is still in its early days. Systems will grow more powerful for many years, requiring a steady flow of increasingly capable number-crunching chips. In other words, Nvidia's game-changing AI revenue streams won't run dry anytime soon. Not content to rest on its digital laurels, Nvidia is actively seeking new applications for its proprietary chip architectures. Examples include the Nvidia Drive self-driving vehicle control system and the Project GROOT model for humanoid robotics. These initiatives are fairly small so far but may become serious revenue streams over time. Of course, I have to mention the 10-to-1 stock split Nvidia announced alongside its earnings report. The split will take effect on the morning of Monday, June 10, moving share prices down from approximately $1,000 to roughly $100 per share. It's largely an accounting exercise that doesn't add any real value to Nvidia's stock, but it does give shareholders more fine-grained control over the stock. And it's a robust vote of confidence in Nvidia's future -- the board of directors is essentially saying that share prices will continue to rise, so let's make them a bit more affordable right now.\n\nStory continues\n\nWhy the stock may be due for a correction soon\n\nNvidia has an undeniable collection of shareholder-friendly balls in the air. However, enthusiastic investors may have lifted the stock price too high.\n\nI'm not saying that Nvidia's stock has peaked and is due for a dramatic plunge. Far from it. The upsides listed earlier should keep the stock afloat for quite a while. Follow the money flowing through the AI market, and you'll find Nvidia firmly parked at the receiving end. Other chip suppliers will surely steal a few contracts over time, but Nvidia is an early leader, and it won't be easy to shake the company off the AI accelerator throne. There's room for several big winners in this corner of Silicon Valley, and Nvidia should be one of them for the foreseeable future.\n\nSo I wouldn't recommend selling your Nvidia shares today. That's especially true if you have a small stake with one or two Nvidia shares, managed in a stock brokerage that hasn't embraced fractional share trades yet. If you're in that situation and want to reduce your Nvidia exposure -- converting a bit of your paper profits into actual cash returns -- you should wait a while and let the stock split take effect. Then, you'll be able to sell 10% or 30% of your Nvidia holdings instead of dumping the entire investment.\n\nFinal verdict: Be careful -- Nvidia is priced for perfection\n\nThat being said, Nvidia's lofty valuation ratios and skyrocketing stock chart are making me nervous. The company is executing with crisp perfection so far, but I don't know how long that streak will last. The history of semiconductors is littered with industry titans running into unexpected issues, and what if Nvidia is next?\n\nIt's a long way down from a $2.85 trillion market cap. Nvidia shares trade at 35 times sales and 71 times free cash flow, like a hungry little upstart with triple-digit percentage rates of revenue growth. It's just hard to keep up that pace from an already lofty starting point, not to mention the limited supply of chip manufacturing services.\n\nSo on a scale of buy, sell, or hold, I'd recommend simply holding on to most of your Nvidia shares for now -- with an eye toward buying more after a price correction. I'm certainly not adding to my own Nvidia holdings right now.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Nvidia right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Nvidia, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Nvidia wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "Prediction: These 5 Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Be Worth a Combined $25 Trillion by 2030",
        "content": "Is the hype warranted? That's a question investors must always ask about anything that receives a huge amount of attention.\n\nIn some cases, the hype fizzles away -- 3D printing comes to mind. However, in other cases, early hype is more than justified. For example, the massive market built around the internet has shown that many early proponents were right.\n\nI think artificial intelligence (AI) belongs in the latter category. In my view, the enormous success of multiple AI leaders is just the beginning. It's impossible to know what the future holds. However, I predict that by 2030, five AI stocks will be worth a combined $25 trillion -- perhaps even more.\n\nAI's fantastic five\n\nBased on market cap, the five biggest companies on the planet have one major thing in common: They're all investing heavily in AI. Not only that, their respective AI strategies have played a key role in their big gains over the last couple of years. Below are AI's \"fantastic five\":\n\nAI Stock Current Market Cap* Microsoft(NASDAQ: MSFT) $3.08 trillion Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL) $2.93 trillion Nvidia(NASDAQ: NVDA) $2.73 trillion Alphabet(NASDAQ: GOOGL) $2.13 trillion Amazon(NASDAQ: AMZN) $1.86 trillion\n\nData source: Google Finance. *Market caps as of May 30, 2024.\n\nMicrosoft surged past Apple earlier this year to take the No. 1 spot based on market cap. The company's partnership with ChatGPT creator OpenAI has unquestionably been the primary factor behind Microsoft's remarkable rise. The tech giant has integrated GPT-4 throughout its product lineup. Microsoft is especially benefiting from its relationship with OpenAI in its cloud business.\n\nApple delivered a strong performance in the first half of 2023. Since then, though, it's lagged well behind the other biggest AI stocks. Some investors have worried that Apple was getting left behind in the generative AI race. The company's growth has also slowed significantly due in large part to saturation in the smartphone market. Still, Apple remains in a close contest with Microsoft for the biggest market cap.\n\nNvidia is, without question, the brightest star in the AI universe right now. The demand for its graphics processing units (GPUs) continues to skyrocket. Every other company in the top five (plus many more) are Nvidia customers. Most of them would love to buy as many GPUs as they could get. Thanks to this tremendous demand, Nvidia's shares have skyrocketed.\n\nAlphabet seemed to have been caught by surprise by the successful launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT. It didn't take long, though, for the company to roll out its own generative AI products. Despite some public relations stumbles, Alphabet remains in the thick of the AI race with its Gemini AI models and Google Cloud AI offerings.\n\nStory continues\n\nLike Alphabet, Amazon quickly introduced multiple generative AI products after ChatGPT took the world by storm. Amazon's AI initiatives have helped drive its stock much higher. The company's focus on profitability has also been a critical factor, with earnings more than tripling year over year in the first quarter of 2024.\n\nThe path to $25 trillion\n\nThe combined market cap of these five AI stocks stands at a little over $12.7 trillion right now. How can they together nearly double that amount to reach $25 trillion by the end of 2030? I think there are three major prerequisites.\n\n1. Organizations migrate rapidly to the cloud to benefit from AI's tremendous return on investment\n\nImportantly, AI must deliver tremendous returns on investment (ROIs) for companies. I expect this will be the case. If so, organizations across the world will almost certainly rapidly migrate their apps and data to the cloud to harness the power of AI.\n\nAmazon CEO Andy Jassy estimates that at least 85% of global IT spending remains on-premises, with the remainder in the cloud. AI could go a long way toward flipping those numbers by the end of the decade.\n\nThis migration would directly benefit Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet's Google Cloud since they're the biggest cloud service providers. It should also help Nvidia as the leading source of chips for AI servers.\n\n2. AI computing technology continues to improve at a frantic pace\n\nIt's critical for Nvidia that AI computing technology, especially chips, continues to improve at a frantic pace -- and that the company leads the way. Nvidia's new Blackwell GPU platform, which will launch later this year, should help make this a reality. CEO Jensen Huang said in the company's Q1 call that \"other Blackwells are coming.\"\n\n3. Edge AI becomes a huge new market\n\nThe first two prerequisites should ensure continued success for Microsoft, Alphabet, Nvidia, and Amazon. But what about Apple? The tech giant needs edge AI to become a huge new market. Edge AI enables AI to be run on mobile devices. Since Apple has over 2 billion active devices worldwide, it should be in the driver's seat to lead the edge AI market.\n\nPotential problems and pleasant surprises\n\nWhat could go wrong to derail these five AI stocks from reaching a combined market cap of $25 trillion by 2030? A lot. On the one hand, an economic recession could cause tech spending to tank. AI might not deliver the ROI companies hope to achieve. The \"hallucinations\" and other issues with generative AI could remain problematic.\n\nOn the other hand, there could be some pleasant surprises over the next few years. One possibility is a major breakthrough in artificial general intelligence (AI). Perhaps AI computing power could increase even faster than anyone expects.\n\nWhatever happens, I think the hype about AI is warranted. And I won't be shocked if my prediction turns out to be too pessimistic.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Microsoft right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Microsoft, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Microsoft wasn’t one of them.

Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) and Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) are three of the Magnificent Seven stocks, ranked by current market cap.\n\nMost ETFs have large positions in these stocks, especially the ones that track broader indices. However, some growth gems aren’t as obvious. These picks are relatively overlooked but look ready to outperform most, if not all, of the Magnificent Seven stocks in the years ahead.\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (ELF) an elf branded beauty product on a stone counter\n\nSource: Lisa Chinn / Shutterstock.com\n\nE.l.f. Beauty (NYSE:ELF) recently reported its 21st consecutive quarter of sales growth. The company also gained market share in the beauty industry for the 5th consecutive year while delivering more than $1 billion in net sales in fiscal 2024.\n\nInvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips\n\nThe company ended on a strong note with 71% year-over-year (YOY) revenue growth in Q4 FY24. Investors initially got spooked by this report, since e.l.f. Beauty offered modest guidance that called for a 20% to 22% YOY net sales increase in fiscal 2025.\n\nWhile this represents a meaningful drop, e.l.f. Beauty has always been conservative in its guidance. The company raised its guidance multiple times in fiscal 2024 and initially projected similar results for that year. Instead of seeing revenue growth in the mid-twenties, investors got to enjoy 77% YOY net sales growth in fiscal 2024.\n\nThe company’s shares are up 29% year-to-date and have surged nearly 1,700% over the past five years. The stock currently has a $10.2 billion market cap and may be added to the S&P 500 within 1 to 3 years.\n\nSezzle (SEZL) a person holding a smartphone over a check out scanner representing payments stocks to buy\n\nSource: Shutterstock\n\nSezzle (NASDAQ:SEZL) is a “buy now pay later” platform that trades at a 34 P/E ratio and has a market cap of $460 million. Most people haven’t heard of this stock, yet it has more than tripled year-to-date. The P/E ratio combined with strong financials have made the rally sustainable.\n\nRevenue increased by 35.5% YOY in Q1 2024. GAAP net income was up by an astonishing 364% YOY. The company’s total subscribers surged from 142,000 members in Q1 2023 to 371,000 members in Q1 2024. Sezzle also reported a 45.9% YOY increase in the number of transactions, demonstrating more frequent purchases from its members.\n\nSezzle isn’t receiving as much attention as other investors. Analysts aren’t rushing to assign price targets for this up-and-coming fintech firm. More than half of the company’s shares are currently owned by insiders. Leadership has a lot of skin in the game, which is good to see.\n\nStory continues\n\nSoFi (SOFI) An image of SoFi headquarters. SOFI stock.\n\nSource: Michael Vi / Shutterstock\n\nSoFi (NASDAQ:SOFI) is another fintech firm worth monitoring. The stock has been on a roller coaster, which includes a 28% year-to-date decline, but the stock’s recent results don’t match up with the company’s earnings report.\n\nWhile the stock’s recent price movement may have investors think otherwise, SoFi reported solid results. Revenue increased by 37% YOY in the first quarter of 2024. Net income was also solid. The company went from a GAAP loss of $44.4 million in Q1 2023 to $77.9 million GAAP profitability this quarter.\n\nSoFi offers many financial products that should keep retention high. It has loans, brokerage accounts, bank accounts, credit cards and other resources. SoFi can also offer more competitive rates since it is a digital bank with less overhead than traditional banks.\n\nLeadership’s multi-year plan suggests earnings and revenue should continue to march higher.

        "content": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has been all the rage since early last year, with many of the biggest companies in technology staking their claim. For example, a number of the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks have been extremely forthcoming about their plans to profit from the windfall resulting from the rapid adoption of AI, and several of these same stocks have generated market-beating returns this year.\n\nOne member of the collective that's been curiously left out of the conversation is Apple(NASDAQ: AAPL). The iPhone maker has historically kept its plans and product upgrades close to the vest, including its intentions regarding the deployment of generative AI. This, combined with lackluster iPhone sales, has plagued Apple's share price, which is essentially flat in 2024.\n\nApple's Worldwide Developer Conference (WWDC) is scheduled to kick off on June 10, and speculation is rampant that the company will finally lay out its generative AI strategy. That, in turn, could light a fire under Apple's stagnant share price and set the stage for future gains.\n\nWith the stage set, should investors buy Apple stock before its highly anticipated event? Let's examine the available evidence. Image source: Getty Images.\n\nHas the time come?\n\nApple hasn't had much to say about the topic of generative AI, at least until recently. After remaining largely silent on the topic for nearly a year, CEO Tim Cook has finally begun to shed some light on Apple's aspirations. Earlier this year, Cook said of the company's AI plans, \"We continue to spend a tremendous amount of time and effort, and we're excited to share the details of our ongoing work in that space later this year.\" When pressed for additional details, Cook responded, \"Our M.O. [modus operandi], if you will, has always been to do work and then talk about work.\"\n\nCook opened up a little more during Apple's second-quarter earnings call. \"We continue to feel very bullish about our opportunity in generative AI. We are making significant investments, and we're looking forward to sharing some very exciting things with our customers soon.\" Cook went on to highlight the company's \"seamless\" integration of hardware, software, services, and processors while never taking its eye off user privacy.\n\nHistorically speaking, Apple has announced some of its most groundbreaking product releases and updates during WWDC, so it stands to reason the company would reveal its generative AI objectives at the event.\n\nA \"once in a decade\" event?\n\nWall Street is buzzing about Apple's annual conference, which would mark the perfect venue to introduce developers to the company's AI functionality. This would give them time to create signature generative AI-powered apps before the release of the next iPhone.\n\nStory continues\n\nBank of America analyst Wamsi Mohan suggests that the release of AI-enabled phones could spark a multiyear upgrade cycle that's a \"once in a decade type of event.\" He goes on to suggest that with more than 2.2 billion active devices, Apple could drive generative AI into the mainstream. These AI-fueled devices could vastly improve photography, health monitoring, security, and even battery life.\n\nWedbush analyst Dan Ives is even more bullish, raising his price target on Apple stock to $275 while maintaining an outperform (buy) rating on the shares. That represents 45% upside compared to Tuesday's closing price. Ives posits that an \"AI-driven iPhone 16 supercycle [is] now on the horizon.\" The analyst goes on to say that generative AI will represent \"ample monetization opportunities\" for Cook and company. Ives also revealed that recent channel checks suggest the beginning of a long-awaited rebound in iPhone sales in China, one of Apple's biggest markets. Tepid sales in the region have weighed on the stock in recent quarters.\n\nIt's also worth noting that of the 38 analysts who offered an opinion on Apple stock in May, 84% rated it a buy or strong buy, and not a single one recommended selling. Since Wall Street rarely agrees on anything, it's noteworthy when there's such a solid consensus.\n\nShould you buy Apple stock now or wait until after WWDC?\n\nFor day traders looking to make a quick buck, hopping into and out of stocks around major events in order to catch the rally before selling, Apple might not be the stock for you. Truth be told, we don't know exactly what Apple will announce at WWDC. Furthermore, even if the company does jump feet-first into generative AI, that doesn't mean its efforts will yield immediate results.\n\nHowever, for investors with an outlook of years rather than weeks or months, there's plenty to like about Apple. The company has a long track record of defying detractors while continuing to build an empire. Market historians will note that Apple has rarely been first to market with anything but frequently releases industry-leading products that stand the test of time. At the same time, services is Apple's fastest-growing segment, driven by its 2.2 billion active devices.\n\nIf I were to hazard a guess, I'm inclined to believe that Apple stock will perform much better in the second half of 2024 than the first half and will be a market-beating investment over the next five years. That said, if the company's WWDC announcement disappoints, it could be a rough ride over the short term.\n\nFinally, there's the matter of Apple's valuation. At 29 times trailing-12-month earnings, the stock is only slightly more expensive than the multiple of 27 for the S&P 500. Furthermore, over the past five years, Apple stock has soared 327% (as of this writing), more than three times the 88% gains produced by the broad index. This helps illustrate why Apple is deserving of a premium.\n\nFor investors looking beyond June, I believe Apple's long track record of success speaks volumes about the company and its future prospects. That's why investors should simply buy Apple for the long runway ahead.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Apple right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Apple, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now… and Apple wasn’t one of them.

        "title": "3 Reasons to be Bullish on Apple Stock (NASDAQ:AAPL)",
        "content": "It may seem that Cupertino-based giant Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) has fallen behind its Big Tech peers in the race for AI, as the company has only achieved a modest performance of just 3% this year compared to the “Magnificent Seven” group of leading technology companies. However, several reasons justify my bullish stance on Apple. In this article, I’ll outline three of them: Apple’s advancements in AI, the potential growth in China, and the company’s robust fundamentals and strategic share buybacks.\n\nAI Is Finally Playing Its Game on AAPL\n\nSince last year, Apple has made some moves to catch up with its peers, but it is still far from leading the pack. This has sent a bearish wave through the stock, causing the Cupertino company’s share price to be stuck in second gear.\n\nBut that doesn’t mean that Apple isn’t making any progress on AI. The Cupertino-based company has been on a shopping spree, acquiring 32 AI start-ups in 2023—more than any other tech giant, which indicates the company’s efforts to expand its AI capabilities. However, as the old saying goes, “Rome wasn’t built in a day,” and it seems the market is ignoring this fact, as other tech companies appear to be more advanced with their AI developments.\n\nI believe part of the market’s skepticism towards Apple and its early AI efforts has been influenced by the launch of the VisionPro, the “magic” virtual reality glasses powered by AI and machine learning. The VisionPro has received mixed reviews, with some users calling it a dud and others praising its immersive experiences. The steep $3,500 price tag hasn’t helped its case, either, making it a tough sell for the average consumer.\n\nAdditionally, Apple has faced challenges in production and demand forecasts, with reports of slashed production numbers and fading hype.\n\nIn reality, VisionPro was just Apple’s first step into AI. But Apple has also been working on its own large language models (LLMs) and has even developed a chatbot, although it has yet to define how it will unveil it to the general public. A significant step will be taken when this model is integrated into the hardware. This integration is expected to begin with the launch of the AI App Store in June during its prestigious WWDC developers’ conference.\n\nEventually, Apple will integrate AI and LLMs into its hardware. There is also great anticipation regarding Siri’s on-device AI capabilities, such as real-time analysis using the iOS 18 camera.\n\nIn short, when AI is integrated into Apple’s massive user base of two billion active iPhones, not counting other iOS devices, it’s very likely that Apple will be taken more seriously regarding its AI capabilities.\n\nStory continues\n\nChina May be Shifting from a Headwind to a Tailwind\n\niPhone demand in China has been a black eye for Apple throughout this year. The iPhone, Apple’s core segment and accounting for 54% of its revenues, has exposed the company’s over-dependence on a single line of business.\n\nChina is a crucial market for Apple, but local competition, especially from Huawei, has been gaining ground. A report earlier this year highlighted that Huawei has been eating into Apple’s market share, leading to a 19.1% drop in iPhone sales in China during Q1. Meanwhile, Huawei’s sales surged by 69.7%, driven by a significant upgrade in its new smartphone model after months of struggling to secure parts due to Western sanctions.\n\nHowever, what currently looks like a black eye could soon turn into a silver lining. Wedbush’s perma-bull analyst Dan Ives suggests that while current economic data in China doesn’t indicate a turnaround, a rise in upgrades could shift the narrative. There are 225 million iPhones in China, and 70% of these haven’t been upgraded in the last three years. Ives’ theory is that many of these consumers are moving to Pro models, which boosts the average selling price (ASP) of iPhones in China.\n\nRobust Fundamentals and Share Buybacks\n\nIn addition to the two reasons mentioned above, I believe Apple’s extraordinarily robust fundamentals round out the case for why Apple stock may still have significant upside potential and recover from its lackluster performance so far this year.\n\nFirst off, Apple’s fundamentals remain rock solid. Even though market fears have dampened hardware demand amid unimpressive economic growth, Apple is far from a struggling company. Services have been a major bright spot.\n\nTake its most recent quarter, for example. Despite iPhone sales dropping 12% year-over-year and product revenues falling 10% year-over-year, services revenue jumped 14.2% year-over-year, hitting an all-time high. This growth in services helped minimize the overall 4.3% drop in net sales, allowing Apple to beat market estimates in both EPS and revenues.\n\nIn my view, since Apple operates across two main segments—products and services—the latter is where the company’s valuation could see the most growth, especially with the potential AI adoption cycle. The high scalability of the App Store and Apple TV+ further supports this potential.\n\nMoreover, Apple has generated a massive amount of cash—$336.6 billion over the last three years. Plus, the board recently authorized an additional $110 billion for share buybacks, an amount large enough to purchase almost all the shares of Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), just to give you an idea.\n\nWith this move, Apple has shown a clear interest in pleasing investors who are anxious about its share price’s underperformance this year compared to other big tech companies. As a result, AAPL stock has soared more than 11% since announcing its results, demonstrating its historic ability to bounce back from valuation declines.\n\nIs AAPL Stock a Buy, According to Analysts?\n\nThe Wall Street consensus on AAPL stock is largely bullish. Out of the 34 Wall Street analysts who have provided recommendations and target prices on the company in the last three months, 22 have issued a Buy rating, 11 have issued a Hold rating, and only one has issued a Sell rating. The average AAPL stock price target is $207.72, indicating upside potential of 8.1%.\n\nThe Bottom Line\n\nDespite fears that Apple has missed the AI bandwagon and a few other headwinds, Apple shares have underperformed compared to their big tech peers. But from my perspective, it’s only a matter of time.\n\nJune will be a key month for Apple, particularly with advances in AI, which should bring a new cycle of updates for iPhones and potentially mark a turning point for the company.\n\nGiven Apple’s extremely solid fundamentals—evidenced by a monumental buyback announcement and significant growth in services that could be the major catalyst for Apple around AI—I remain bullish on the stock.\n\nDisclosure\n\nView comments",
